Thus in 1752 it is recorded that the Board were dissatisfied with the sanitary condition of the town and arrived at the conclusion that the evil \"was in great measure due to the little regard the inhabitants in general pay to the scavenger, on account of his being always a junior servant\", and therefore agreed \"that a member of the Board be appointed to that office, and that all houses within the town be proportionately taxed for maintaining a sufficient number of labourers, carts and buffaloes for keeping the town clean\". This system continued till 1792, when Parliament passed Statute 33, whereby the Governor-General in Council was empowered to appoint in the Presidency Towns Justices of the Peace who were authorized to appoint scavengers for cleaning the streets, to order the watching and repairing of streets and to levy for these purposes a rate not exceeding one-twentieth of the gross annual value of the houses, buildings and grounds in these towns. No special rules were laid down for the conservancy of the town and island of Bombay until 1812 when a \"Rule, Ordinance and Regulation\" was passed for the good order and civil government of the island. This gave certain powers to the Justices of the Peace. Whether the powers entrusted to the Court of Petty Sessions as laid down in Rule, Ordinance and Regulation\n\n---\n\n1 Forrest's Selections (Home Series), Vol I., 1887.\nof 1812 were abused or not\", writes Michael; \"there is nothing to show; but the Government after a time perceived that a road was open to great abuse of power, and three years after the passing of that Regulation, they therefore promulgated another for enlarging, explaining and amending it.\" In this new Rule the powers of the executive authorities were limited, and it was no longer left to the Court of Petty Sessions to inflict such legal punishment \"as the danger, audacity or repetition of the offences justified.\"\n\nThe next step forward was taken in 1827 when a Regulation (XIX of 1827) was passed prescribing rules for the assessment and collection of land revenue and for the collection of taxes on houses, shops, stalls and carriages, etc. These regulations, though conceived in a progressive spirit, were the source of a good deal of friction between the Bench of Justices and the other local authorities. The administration of the town by the Bench was also the subject of not unfrequent comment; and at length it was felt that some better system must be devised for dealing with the protection, sanitation and development of the growing town. Accordingly in 1845 an Act (XI of 1845) was passed for the better collection, management and disbursement of certain public funds and money for police and municipal purposes throughout the island of Bombay and Colaba. By this Act all municipal taxes paid into the Government treasury were formed into a Municipal fund, which was administered by an executive body styled the Board of Conservancy and composed of 7 members, of whom the Senior Magistrate of Police was Chairman and the Collector of Bombay an ex-officio member, the other five members being two European and three native resident justices, elected by the Bench or by such persons as Government might appoint to supervise and control the fund. These members were elected for three years, being eligible for re-election on the expiry of that period. Under the r\u00e9gime thus established, the Justices of the Peace were vested with the supervision and control of the fund, while in practice the Board of Conservancy administered it as they pleased. With the exception of Rs. 45,000 set apart\n\n---\n\n1 Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation.\nannually for police expenses, the Board in reality had entire control over the fund, and were empowered to make such improvements and carry out such public works, as in their discretion they deemed necessary. The duties of the Board were apparently quite distinct from those of the Petty Sessions. They had merely the control of the fund, and the supervision of the sanitary and other measures required for the improvement of the public health; but they possessed as a body no penal powers to enforce their orders. At the outset the income of the Board amounted to roughly 2.88 lakhs and their expenditure to 2.79 lakhs, which comprised considerable sums spent on police, markets, repairs and scavenging. The functions of an executive engineer's establishment, namely, the design and construction of new roads and sanitary works, and the repair and maintenance of old ones, were performed by an official known as the Superintendent of Repairs, who was appointed by the Bench of Justices, subject to the approval of Government, who continued his appointment only on condition of his discharging gratuitously the duties of Surveyor to the Court of Petty Sessions. Being appointed to the latter post by Government, his establishment under that head was paid from the Government treasury and not from the municipal fund. The inconvenience that might have arisen from the dual control thus exercised over the Surveyor to the Court and the Superintendent of Repairs was largely obviated by making one individual Chairman both of the Court of Petty Sessions and the Board of Conservancy. The Surveyor to the Court dealt with the regulation of buildings under the Building Act XXVIII of 1839 and with the prevention of nuisances under the Nuisance Act XIV of 1842.\n\nThe average expenditure of the Board of Conservancy during a period of eight years (1845-46 to 1852-53) was 2.37 lakhs per annum, out of which 1.06 lakhs were devoted to new works, one lakh to works requiring special sanction, and nearly Rs. 6,000 for road-widening (i.e., set-backs), while the balance was expended upon the repairs and maintenance of public works. The municipal\n\n---\n\n1 Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation.\n2 Bombay Times 20th October, 1849.\n3 Report on the sanitary requirements of Bombay, 1855, pp. 7-8.\nfund however never proved equal to the calls upon it, and on one occasion had to be replenished by the loan of a lakh of rupees advanced through the Bench of Justices by several native gentlemen of the city. This fact, coupled with complaints of the inefficiency of the Board, eventually induced Government to alter materially its constitution by Act XXV of 1858. Under this Act three Commissioners, styled Municipal Commissioners for the Town and Island of Bombay, were appointed for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act and for the conservancy and improvement of the city. One of these Commissioners was appointed by Government and the other two by the Justices. This system of a triumvirate, with equal powers but divided responsibility, never worked successfully, and the evils which Government had sought to counteract by the abolition of the Conservancy Board were prolonged, and in some degree intensified by the division of power, the absence of individual responsibility, the tedious routine, and the absence of power of enforcing obedience to the law. The only real difference between the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Conservancy was that the former drained the municipal fund of Rs. 24,000 a year more than the latter did.\n\nAccordingly in 1865 another Act was passed, whereby the Justices of the Peace were created a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal and with the power to hold lands, impose taxes and rates, and borrow money on the security of the same. The entire executive power and responsibility for the purposes of the Act was vested in a Commissioner appointed by Government for a term of three years. He had to lay before the Justices each year a budget of income and expenditure, which the latter had power to revise at a special general meeting. A Controller of Municipal Accounts was also appointed by Government for a like term and a Health Officer and Executive Engineer were likewise appointed by Government to be subordinate to the Commissioner.\n\n---\n\n1 General Administration Report, 1856-57.\n2 Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation.\n3 Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation; Martineau's Life of Sir Bartle Frere.\nThis Act, as subsequent events proved, was marred by the fact that there was practically no control either by Government or the Bench of Justices over the Commissioner's powers of expenditure: and at an epoch when costly projects were the order of the day he was open to the temptation of spending the ratepayers' money too lavishly. In 1871 a serious crisis took place in municipal affairs and an inquiry, which was set on foot in response to the demands of the Justices and the public, showed that some amendment of the municipal constitution was necessary in order to secure a more efficient administration of the municipal estate, and to enable the Corporation to exercise more direct control over its expenditure. At the same time there was an agitation on the part of a considerable section of the public for the introduction into the management of municipal affairs of some measure of self-government. In March 1872 a Bill was accordingly introduced into Council to provide for the management of municipal affairs of the city, and to make better provision for the conservancy and improvement of the city and for the levy of rates and taxes.\n\nThe interest of the measure of 1872 lay in the form of municipal constitution which it proposed to introduce. The following were the chief constitutional provisions of the Bill as finally passed:\n\n(a) The grant of the franchise to certain classes of ratepayers.\n\n(b) The creation of representative assemblies.\n\nThe powers in connection with the administration of municipal affairs formerly possessed by the Bench of Justices devolved upon two representative bodies, the Corporation and the Town Council. The outer assembly or Corporation consisted of 64 members, of whom one-half were elected by the ratepayers, and the rest were nominated in equal proportion by the Justices of the Peace and by Government. The functions of the Corporation were the fixing of municipal rates and the voting of the budget, coupled with the right of selecting representatives to sit in the Town Council. The Town Council consisted of 12 persons, 8 of whom were elected by the members of the\nMunicipal Corporation and 4 were the nominees of Government. From the 12 members thus appointed, Government selected one to be the Chairman of the Council. With a view to ensure the regular attendance of members a system of payment was introduced, under which each councillor received a fee of Rs. 30 for each weekly attendance. The Council, with the assistance of the Municipal Commissioner, prepared the budget, and a double audit of municipal accounts by the Council and the Corporation was provided for. All payments from the municipal fund were made by cheques signed by the Municipal Commissioner and two councillors; all contracts entered into by the Municipal Commissioner were to be in writing and to be reported to the Town Council, special sanction being required for contracts involving an expenditure of more than Rs. 5,000. The Municipal Commissioner was thus in matters of finance entirely under the control of the Town Council. The annual expenses of the police were determined by Government, and any portion thereof, on the requirement of Government, had to be paid out of the municipal fund. The portion of the Bill which gave rise to the most prolonged discussion was the provision for the levy of a small tax upon cotton. This suggestion, though opposed by the mercantile members, was approved by the majority of the Council. Finally, however, it was withdrawn, as the levy of the tax was understood to be contrary to the wishes of the Government of India. A novel and important feature of the Bill was that it empowered Government to enforce the performance by the municipality of its duties to the public. This provision was not adopted without considerable opposition; and it was finally agreed that the power in question should be exercised only in matters connected with police, sanitation, and the water supply.\n\nThe Municipal Act of 1872 was passed tentatively for a term of three years, but the term was extended from time to time. As the Act was found to work satisfactorily on the whole, another Act was passed in 1878 continuing the principal Act of 1872 permanently with certain modifications, one of which was the conferment on the Municipal Commissioner of the right of being present at\nall meetings of the Town Council or Corporation and of taking part in the discussions thereat, but not of voting upon or moving any resolution submitted to any such meeting. The Acts of 1872 and 1878 were recast in 1887, and the Bill was passed into law as Act III of 1888, which with amendments in certain particulars is still in force.\n\nAt the head of the municipal administration of the city is the Municipal Corporation, consisting of 72 members, with its duties, obligatory and discretionary, clearly defined by the law, with a Standing Committee of 12 members, also vested with certain independent powers and functions, to aid it with financial advice, and with a Municipal Commissioner in whom is vested the entire executive power for carrying out the provisions of the law governing the municipal administration of the city. With the Municipal Corporation lies the power of the purse: all contemplated expenditure whether from revenues obtained from the city or from loans raised from the public must receive its prior sanction, except in certain well-defined cases, such as the occurrence or threatened occurrence of any accident or unforeseen event involving or likely to involve extensive damage to any property of the Corporation or damage to human life, when the Municipal Commissioner, as the principal executive authority, has to act independently and report the matter to the Standing Committee and the Corporation forthwith. It is incumbent on the Corporation to provide for the execution and maintenance of drainage and water-works: for scavenging and the removal and disposal of excrement and other filthy matter, and of all ashes, refuse and rubbish: for the reclamation of unhealthy localities; for the regulation of places for the disposal of the dead; for the registration of births and deaths; for measures for preventing and checking the spread of dangerous diseases; for the construction, maintenance and regulation of markets and slaughter-houses; for the regulation of offensive and dangerous trades; for the entertainment of a fire-brigade for the protection of life and property in the case of fire; for the construction, maintenance, improvement and alteration of public streets, bridges, &c.; for\nmaintaining, aiding and suitably accommodating schools for primary education; for public vaccination; for establishing and maintaining public hospitals and dispensaries and carrying out other measures necessary for public medical relief; and generally to discharge such functions as promote or are likely to promote public safety, health, convenience or instruction.\n\nResting as all such measures must on the financial capacity of the city, the Corporation is helped in the discharge of its duties by the Standing Committee and the Municipal Commissioner; and though the Corporation may and does on its own initiative authorize the prosecution of works and projects which in its own opinion may conduce to the benefit of the city, it is with the Standing Committee aided by the advice of the Municipal Commissioner, that the recommendation must lie as to the source from which the funds are to come. It is the Municipal Commissioner who by law is required to submit yearly to the Standing Committee an estimate of the expenditure which must or should be incurred by the Corporation, and to indicate the sources from which the expenditure is to be met and the taxation which it will in his opinion be necessary or expedient to impose or the loans required to be raised. These proposals with such modifications as the Standing Committee may think advisable have to be considered by the Corporation, who determine what taxation shall be levied subject to the minima and maxima fixed by law, and generally what expenditure shall be incurred, and who have the power to either refer the estimates back to the Standing Committee or adopt them as they stand or subject them to such alteration as they deem expedient. Funds required outside the budget estimates are asked for by the Municipal Commissioner from time to time as necessity arises, but no funds can be allotted without the prior approval of the Standing Committee and the Corporation. For the proper disbursement of funds allotted by the Corporation for the city's benefit the Municipal Commissioner is primarily responsible, but the Standing Committee aided by its secretary and two auditors, appointed by the Corporation, watch the interests of the city by seeing that no\npayments are made except under due authority and that the accounts are correctly prepared.\n\nThough the entire executive power is vested in the Municipal Commissioner, the Corporation have the power to require the Commissioner at any time to produce any official document that they think it advisable to have placed at their disposal in the interests of the efficient administration of the city, and the Standing Committee and the auditors may require the production of any document bearing on the accounts, the receipts or the disbursements of the public money. The Corporation may also require the Commissioner to furnish a report by himself or to obtain from any head of a department subordinate to him and furnish with his own remarks thereon a report upon any subject connected with the municipal government of the city. In their financial inter-relations the position of the Corporation, the Standing Committee and the Municipal Commissioner may be briefly stated to be that the Municipal Commissioner as chief executive officer makes proposals, but has no power to spend money except in the direction determined by the two superior authorities, that the Standing Committee review the Municipal Commissioner's proposals for the benefit and orders of the Corporation, and that the Municipal Corporation finally determine the volume and direction of the stream of income and expenditure. Except in the case of the Executive Engineer, the Executive Health Officer, the Secretary Schools Committee and the Auditors, whose appointment rests with the Municipal Corporation, and of the Municipal Secretary who is appointed by the Standing Committee, the number and the salaries of the various officers and servants of the Corporation are determined by the Standing Committee on the recommendation of the Municipal Commissioner, but no office of which the aggregate emoluments exceed Rs. 200 per mensem can be created without the sanction of the Municipal Corporation. A very large proportion of the expenditure incurred yearly from funds allotted by the Corporation is disbursed on contracts entered into after public competition. In the making of such contracts the responsibility for the efficient administration of the funds allotted is divided between the\nStanding Committee and the Municipal Commissioner. It is within the power of the Municipal Commissioner to make contracts for sums not exceeding Rs. 5,000 on his own responsibility, provided that all contracts exceeding Rs. 3,000 are entered into either after inviting public tenders or after the Standing Committee have accorded their sanction to the invitation of public tenders being dispensed with. In regard to contracts exceeding Rs. 5,000, the Municipal Commissioner has the power to accept such a contract as may appear to him most advantageous to the Municipality taking all the circumstances into consideration, but the approval of the Standing Committee to the contract being entered into is necessary before the contract can be considered valid by law. Every contract has in accordance with the law to be made by the Municipal Commissioner on behalf of the Municipal Corporation. It should be noted that these independent financial powers vesting in the Standing Committee and the Commissioner are to be so exercised that liability for any expenditure shall not be incurred without the sanction of the Corporation if the discharge of any of the functions is likely to involve expenditure for any period or at any time after the close of the official year. Certain powers are further vested in the Standing Committee and the Municipal Commissioner in regard to the disposal of moveable properties. These the Commissioner may dispose of by sale or otherwise if the value in each instance does not exceed Rs. 500. With the sanction of the Standing Committee he may dispose of such properties up to a limit not exceeding Rs. 5,000. The Commissioner in consultation with the Standing Committee has also to arrange for the investment of all surplus balances either in the Bank of Bombay, in public securities or in such banks in Bombay as the Standing Committee, subject to the control of the Corporation, may from time to time select. All the financial transactions of the Municipality are recorded by the Municipal Commissioner in such manner and in such forms as the Standing Committee from time to time prescribe. A weekly scrutiny of these accounts has to be conducted or caused to be conducted by the Standing Committee and a weekly abstract of all\nreceipts and expenditure is required to be published, signed by not less than two members of the Standing Committee and the Municipal Secretary. The receipts and disbursements are subject to further scrutiny at the hands of two Municipal Auditors appointed by the Corporation, whose duty it is to forthwith report to the Standing Committee any material impropriety or irregularity in the expenditure or in the recovery of moneys due to the Corporation. It is also within the province of the Governor-in-Council at any time to appoint an Auditor for the purpose of making a special audit of the municipal accounts.\n\nThe Standing Committee is required to frame in consonance with any resolution passed by the Corporation regulations fixing the securities to be furnished by employ\u00e9s, regulating the grant of leave to and the allowances to be received by employ\u00e9s while on leave, the remuneration to be paid to acting officers or servants, determining the contributions to be paid for pension or for provident fund and the amount of such pensions, gratuities or compassionate allowances to be received by them or their heirs. All such regulations governing the service of employ\u00e9s must receive the confirmation of the Corporation and any regulations relating to the pensions, gratuities and compassionate allowances of employ\u00e9s require the confirmation of the Governor-in-Council. The interpretation of all such rules and regulations lies with the Municipal Commissioner, any breach or misinterpretation thereof being brought to notice by the municipal auditors.\n\nThe control over the whole municipal staff with the exception of the Municipal Secretary, who is a subordinate of the Standing Committee and the Corporation, vests in the Municipal Commissioner who can fine, reduce, suspend or dismiss any servant for breach of rules, neglect of duty or misconduct, provided that\u2014(1) No officer or servant whose monthly emoluments exceed Rs. 300 can be dismissed without the approval of the Standing Committee. (2) The officers appointed by the Corporation, viz., the Executive Engineer and the Executive Health Officer can be dealt with by the Corporation alone.\nWhen once the works to be undertaken and the services to be rendered are finally determined by the Corporation the Municipal Commissioner is the sole executive authority under the law for the prosecution and control of such works and services. To assist him in the discharge of these duties the Standing Committee and the Corporation are required by law to place at his disposal four Heads of departments, vis., (1) an Executive Engineer, (2) an Executive Health Officer, (3) an Assessor and Collector, and (4) a Chief Accountant. Each of these is given such deputies or assistants as the Municipal Commissioner and the Standing Committee may consider desirable. On the Executive Engineer, subject to the orders and control of the Municipal Commissioner, devolves the construction, maintenance and upkeep of all drains and water-courses vesting in the Corporation, of all sewage pumping stations with their ventilation, connected pipes, and drains, of all lakes and water works within and without Bombay, supplying water to the island. The Executive Engineer is also responsible for the efficient maintenance and watering of the roads, for the creditable lighting of the city, for the acquisition of lands for set-backs in narrow or congested streets, for the inspection of buildings in course of construction after their plans have received his approval. All municipal properties are in his charge and it is his duty to keep them in repair. His jurisdiction also extends to the Municipal Workshops, and the works and repairs executed therein. In short he is the expert adviser to the Municipal Commissioner on all engineering questions. In the same way on all questions of public health and sanitation the Executive Health Officer is the expert adviser appointed to assist the Municipal Commissioner. Under him are all dispensaries and hospitals maintained at Municipal expense; he directs, under the control of the Municipal Commissioner, the conservancy of the city; he devises measures for the speedy removal of all refuse, rubbish and excrementitious matter; he by his subordinate staff examines the fittings of houses and the gullies attached thereto for the removal of sullage and water; he it is who advises on the control of epidemic diseases, who is responsible for public vaccination, and the sanitary sur-\nroundings of dwellings; he also advises on the regulation of dangerous and offensive trades; arranges for the registration of births and deaths; and analyses food, drugs, drinks and the water-supply.\n\nThe duty of the Assessor and Collector is to assist the Municipal Commissioner in all matters relating to the valuation of buildings and lands in accordance with well established rating laws or judicial decisions, to keep a record of all lands and buildings with a description thereof and their rateable values, and to have such rateable values authenticated by the Municipal Commissioner on the 1st day of April of each year: on such approved valuations to issue taxation bills at rates approved by the Corporation and Standing Committee, and attend to their efficient and speedy collection, to advise what rebates are to be given to house-owners and landlords on account of non-occupancy of buildings or lands, to inspect properties with a view to determining if the rateable values recorded require any alteration, and to hear complaints by the public against the rateable values proposed to be fixed for purposes of taxation. The Chief Accountant is the officer who is required to give the Municipal Commissioner the benefit of his advice on all matters relating to the efficient record of and check over expenditure, to interpret, subject to control by the Municipal Commissioner, the various rules and regulations framed from time to time dealing with the leave, acting and other allowances, pensions and other personal matters affecting the employ\u00e9s' service, to advise the Commissioner as to the progress of expenditure, to assist him in preparing the yearly budget estimates of income and expenditure with the rates of taxation to be levied, to advise the various departments of the Municipality on all financial, audit, and account questions subject to the final orders of the Commissioner, to report any apparent extravagance in outlay, to advise on the borrowing capacity of the Corporation, to keep a watch over rates paid for labour and stores, to advise on contracts to be entered into and generally to aid the Commissioner in controlling expenditure and ensuring a correct record of the account transactions of the Municipality. The Chief Accountant has further to\nreceive all moneys payable to the Municipality and arrange for their subsequent payment into the Government Treasury; to audit and subsequently check all payments to the staff, contractors and others to whom the Municipality is indebted; to advise on the investments to be made of surplus funds, and to arrange for the payment of all sinking fund instalments as they fall due.\n\nThe other officers who act as assistants to the Commissioner in his executive functions are the Revenue and Refund Audit Officer, who is chiefly responsible for a check over the revenues collected and paid into the Chief Accountant's office and over refunds of town duties paid on goods imported and re-exported within six months; the Superintendent of Markets and Slaughter Houses; the Superintendent of Gardens, the Superintendent of Licenses and the Storekeeper. The other principal officers of the Municipality are the Deputy Executive Engineer, Water Works; the Deputy Executive Engineer, Drainage; the Deputy Executive Engineer, Mechanical Branch, who assists the Executive Engineer in his duties; the Assistants to the Executive Health Officer who have charge of the health administration, medical relief and conservancy of the city under the Executive Health Officer; the Deputy Accountant, who assists the Chief Accountant.\n\nAt the close of the eighteenth century the financial power in regard to the management of municipal affairs in the City of Bombay was vested by Act of Parliament (Statute 33, Chapter 52) in Justices of the Peace, whose duty it was \"from time to time to make an equal assessment or assessments on the owners or occupiers of houses, buildings and grounds... according to the real annual values thereof.\" The maximum assessment that could be levied was limited to 5 per cent. of the gross annual values of the properties,\n\n1 The Officer also hears the annual complaints against assessment of properties and scrutinizes claims to and sanctions the grant of refunds of property taxes and of wheel tax as also of town duties on the report of goods which on their entry into the city have paid such duties.\n\n2 It is now (1909) proposed to make this an independent office under the direct control of the Municipal Commissioner.\n\n3 This section and the preceding one have been written from notes supplied by Mr. W. E. Waite, the Chief Accountant, Bombay Municipality.\nunless otherwise ordered by the Governor-in-Council, when a further 2\u00bd per cent. could be levied. The proceeds of the tax were to be employed towards the \"repairing, watching and cleansing\" of the city and were to be \"disposed of according to the orders and directions of the Justices in sessions.\" By Regulation XIX of 1827 rules were prescribed for the assessment and collection of land revenue, for collecting taxes on shops and stalls, on beating the bataki, on country music, on carriages and horses, &c. The financial powers of the Bench of Justices were regulated from time to time by rules, ordinances and regulations framed by Government, and seem to have remained unchallenged till the year 1833, when the Supreme Court of Judicature desired to be furnished with an account of the income and expenditure of the assessment funds, and a report as to what roads were in need of repairs which could not be carried out for want of funds. The Bench of Justices, in reply, asserted their right to the control over the collection and disposal of funds which had been vested in them by the legislature, and denied the right of the High Court of Judicature to exercise any powers over such funds. In the same year (1833) the Governor of Bombay proposed and subsequently ensured the appointment of a military officer to the control of the police, combined with the collection of assessments levied by the Bench. The consequent retirement of the Collector of Assessment appointed by the Justices brought forward the question of the right of the Bench to compensate their retiring servant. Government withheld the compensation awarded by the Bench. Other instances of friction occurring, Government contemplated a change in the law; and in 1836 addressed the Bench of Justices with this end in view. Notwithstanding the protests of the Justices, Act XI of 1845 was passed whereby a Board of Conservancy was created, consisting of seven members, of whom the Senior Magistrate of Police was Chairman, the Collector of Bombay ex-officio a member, and the remaining five were Justices of the Peace, two being European and three native resident Justices.\n\nUnder this Act all sums received from the tax on houses and lands, shops or stalls, beating the bataki, &c., as speci-\nfied in Regulation XIX of 1827, all fines and penalties levied by the Court of Petty Sessions, by the Magistrate of Police and by any Justice of the Peace, all sums (less actual cost of management) collected by the granting of licenses for the sale of spirituous liquors, were for the first time credited to a \"Municipal Fund\", the control over which was vested in the Bench of Justices. The functions of the Board of Conservancy were purely executive, they being authorized with the approval of the Justices of the Peace to construct new roads or streets or other public works tending to the improvement of the island and connected with the comfort and health of the inhabitants. The appointment of the staff required to carry on the executive functions vested in the Board subject to approval by the Justices and sanction by Government. Such persons, it was decided, \"shall be under the immediate orders and control of the said Board.\" Appeal lay by the Conservancy Board to Government against any decision of the Bench of Justices. The audit of all receipts and disbursements was by this Act to be carried out by \"such persons as the Governor-in-Council shall appoint\".\n\nCertain inherent defects in Act XI of 1845 subsequently attracted the attention of Government, and after a fair trial it was proposed in 1856 to revise the constitution by placing the management of municipal affairs in the hands of three Commissioners whose remuneration was fixed. Again the Bench of Justices protested and again without avail; for the proposals of Government were given effect to in Act XXV of 1858 which came into force on the 7th July 1858. In so far as financial control went, it was specifically provided that \"the Commissioners shall not be subject to any check or control on the part of Justices,\" though a proviso existed that any work contemplated or salaries to be paid should receive the approval of the Justices, an appeal lying to Government by the Commissioners in the event of dispute. The principal revenues, which were paid into a Municipal Fund, controlled by the three Commissioners, were to be derived from:\n\n(1) Assessment of houses, buildings and lands at 5 per cent. of the annual value, to be raised if necessary to 7\u00bd per cent.\n(2) A tax on carriages, carts, hackeries, horses, ponies and mules kept in the town and plying for hire.\n\n(3) A levy of town duties collected by and under the management of the Commissioner of Customs on certain animals, foodstuffs and materials.\n\n(4) Receipts from licenses for sale of spirituous liquors.\n\n(5) Miscellaneous receipts from fines and beating the bataki, &c.\n\nGovernment continued to hold authority in the disbursement of the fund in certain directions, as Section XXVIII of the Act provided that the funds could be diverted \"to the execution of any public works tending to the improvement of the said town, which may be sanctioned by the Governor-in-Council, although not expressly mentioned in any of the said Acts.\" Government also had a call on the funds for payment of charges for the Vehar water works and certain drainage works. The Act which gave birth to the three paid Commissioners in 1858 was found in practice to be as defective as the Act of 1845 which constituted a Board of Conservancy and already in 1861 proposals for its repeal and amendment were advanced. After very detailed discussion Act II of 1865 was brought into effect from the 1st July 1865, and for the first time greater financial control was handed over to the principal representatives of the people. The Act clearly laid down that the \"Municipal Fund of the City of Bombay,\" together with all property of what nature or kind soever which may become vested in the Justices was to be under \"the direction, management and control of the Justices.\" Though the control of the municipal fund was vested in the Justices of the Peace, the \"entire executive power and responsibility for the purposes of this Act\" was vested in one Commissioner, while Government retained in its own hands the appointment of the Commissioner and the principal officers subordinate to the Commissioner, viz:\u2014\n\n(1) The Controller of Municipal Accounts, who signed cheques on the fund conjointly with the Commissioner and had the right to correspond\ndirectly with the Governor-in-Council and the Justices of the Peace.\n\n(2) The Executive Engineer who was under the immediate orders of the Commissioner.\n\n(3) A Consulting Officer of Health, who was not precluded from holding any other office, which might not interfere with the performance of his duties.\n\nWhile it was incumbent on the Justices to hold only four meetings in the year, the powers of the Commissioner were practically unlimited. He was the senior municipal officer, and had to be held in check by a junior officer (the Controller of Accounts) appointed also by Government: he had limitless power in regard to entering into contracts, and his accounts were subject to audit \"once in every year at the least\" by auditors appointed by the Justices. For the first time in any legal enactment, the Commissioner was required to place before the Justices a budget estimate of income and expenditure, which the Justices had the power to pass or to reject or to modify.\"\n\nThe revenues of the city, after the passing of Act II of 1865, were derived principally from the following sources:\n\n(1) An annual rate of 5 p.c. to be raised by Government with the concurrence of the Justices to a maximum of 10 p.c. on the annual value of houses, buildings and lands in the city.\n\n(2) Taxes on carriages, horses, ponies and mules.\n\n(3) A lighting rate not exceeding 2 p.c. of the annual value of houses, buildings and lands.\n\n(4) Such annual or other principal water-rates as may be considered sufficient by the Commissioner, concurred in by the Justices and approved by Government for the maintenance, repair, extension, improvement and other expenses of the Vehar water works.\n\n(5) License tax on professions, trades and callings.\n\n(6) Receipts from markets for stallage, rents and tolls paid by persons authorized to sell any articles in the market.\n\n---\n\n1 Abolished by Act IV of 1867.\n(7) An annual rate of 2 per cent.\\(^1\\) upon the occupiers of houses, buildings and land in the city to provide for the annual expenses of the Police.\n\n(8) All fines and penalties levied under the Act.\n\n(9) Duty on tobacco and snuff.\n\n(10) Liquor license fees.\n\n(11) Halalkhore cess.\n\nIt is important to notice that indirect taxation by \"town duties\" was abolished under this Act. One very important power vested in the new corporation of Justices was the power to borrow on mortgage of the rates and taxes with the sanction of the Governor-in-Council such sums as might be required to carry out any permanent work for the city, provided the total sum borrowed did not at any time exceed ten times the average annual sum received from the rates and taxes during the preceding three years and provided due provision was made for the repayment of loans so raised.\n\nThe new authorities succeeded to a far from desirable financial heritage, it being publicly stated later that the Municipal Commissioner \"had succeeded to a bankrupt exchequer\". The difficulties were further increased by the unsatisfactory manner in which the accounts had been maintained. It was pointed out in a memorandum prepared by a competent auditor that \"if Government or the Commissioner should wish to ascertain the true state of the whole affairs of the Municipality, or any branch thereof, regarding the assets, including outstanding liabilities, live and dead stock, and profit and loss, or of what the money in the Bank is composed, the system would fail to give the information\". The neglect, moreover, of sanitary and other requirements of the city in the years prior to 1865 necessitated a very heavy outlay in 1865; and under three heads of expenditure alone, viz, scavenging and scavenging plant, repairs to roads, and watering roads, the expenditure for 1865 was in excess of that for 1864 by 14 lakhs. At the close of 1865 the financial prospects of the Municipality were extremely disquieting. The income and expenditure account up to the close of that year showed an excess over\n\n\\(^1\\) Raised to not more than 3 p. c. by Act IV of 1867.\nincome of Rs. 2,84,301, but if undischarged liabilities, with unrecovered receipts, be taken into account, the balance against the fund worked out to Rs. 9,90,918. It is true that the municipal fund had advanced to the water fund a sum of Rs. 9,21,408, but the municipal fund on the other hand had entrenched for its own purposes on the drainage fund to the extent of Rs. 14,90,213.\n\nIn these circumstances it is not surprising that, with the full concurrence of the Municipal Commissioner, a committee was formed by the Bench of Justices in July 1867 to enquire into the financial position of the Municipality of Bombay. The labours of this committee showed that during the years 1866, the deficit in the municipal fund amounted to Rs. 4,01,044, the total excess of expenditure over income of the amalgamated funds amounting to Rs. 2,25,854. The deficit estimated by the committee for 1867 was Rs. 3,14,680; and as observed by the committee \"adding this to the deficit of the municipal fund on 31st December 1866, viz., Rs. 16,76,899-11-9 it appears the probable deficit on 31st December 1867 will be Rs. 19,80,579-0-9\". The committee found that the control of the Justices over the expenditure was in effect nominal, that the check over the Municipal Commissioner by the Comptroller of Accounts had not been effective, that budget estimates had been exceeded without due authority, that the expenditure had up to that time been in excess of the income; that the outstanding debts were becoming larger year by year, and that \"until this state of affairs is reversed, there is not the remotest prospect of a balance being created of the municipal fund\". The committee absolved the Municipal Commissioner from any great blame, as he \"was left to himself and acted boldly and to the best of his judgment\". Yet the fact remains that without provision being made to write off the drainage debt, amounting to nearly Rs. 15,00,000, the Municipal exchequer was in a state of insolvency. The committee's report was submitted on the 2nd December 1867; and on the 26th April 1868 the following expression of approval of the Municipal Commissioner's administration was recorded:\u2014\"That the meeting tenders its cordial\nthanks to Mr. Crawford and his colleagues for the able manner in which they have respectively contributed to the satisfactory working of the Bombay Municipal Act of 1865.\"\n\nDuring 1869 Government came to the assistance of the hard-pressed Municipality. The amount actually required by the Municipality as determined by the Comptroller of Municipal Accounts was nearly 23 lakhs, but Government advanced only 15 lakhs, repayable with interest at 5 p. c. per annum within ten years from the 1st August 1869. A town-duties Act was also passed during the year and tended to help the crippled exchequer. But already were heard the rumblings of the distant storm that was to break upon the Municipal Commissioner, and committees were sitting to discuss the constitution of the Corporation and the position of the executive, the question of Municipal taxation and its incidence, the financial position of the Municipality at the introduction of the Municipal Act of 1865 and the value of the real property of the Municipality. The press fulminated against the methods adopted by the executive; individual members of the Bench of Justices insisted on retrenchment and reform in the existing machinery for financial control; and Government appointed a commission of enquiry into the methods followed and the financial position of the Municipality. In the end, Government had once more to come to the rescue of the Municipality and to pass Act II of 1872 providing for the repayment of a further sum of 15 lakhs advanced to the Justices of the Peace for the purposes of payment of (1) the amount due for principal and interest on a sum of 2 lakhs advanced by Government in 1871; (2) the principal and interest on a loan given by the Bank of Bombay; (3) repayment of principal and interest to the sinking funds which had been utilized for ordinary revenue and loan expenditure.\n\nA quinquennial review placed by the Municipal Commissioner before the Bench of Justices in September 1871 showed that, while the ordinary income of the Municipality for the six years 1865 to 1870 had been Rs. 1,89,27,143, the ordinary expenditure was Rs. 2,26,98,519, giving a net deficit of Rs. 37,71,376. With such results the system which gave practically\nunlimited power to one Commissioner passed away, and Government yielding to the growing desire and capacity of the people for a greater share in the administration of their local affairs passed Bombay Act III of 1872 (The Bombay Municipal Act of 1872), as amended by Act IV of 1878 and other legislation up to the 1st September 1878. These enactments are commonly known as \"The Bombay Municipal Acts, 1872 and 1878\".\n\nUnder these Acts all moneys to be received by the Commissioner were to be forthwith paid into the Government treasury and no payment could be made out of the municipal fund without the sanction of the Town Council, all cheques being signed by the Municipal Commissioner, one member of the Town Council and the Municipal Secretary. The Town Council had to conduct a weekly audit of the municipal receipts and disbursements and to call on the Municipal Commissioner to forthwith furnish any explanation in regard to receipts and disbursements. Auditors were also to be appointed by the Corporation to examine the accounts from week to week. The proposed expenditure of the Municipality was to be laid annually by the Municipal Commissioner before the Town Council and that body was to \"approve or reject or to alter all or any of the items entered therein\", due regard being had to the requirements of the law. The Town Council with the assistance of the Commissioner had also to prepare an estimate of the Municipal income and proposals for taxation. All such proposals had to be submitted to the Corporation, which passed final orders on the expenditure proposed and the taxes to be levied. The entire executive power and responsibility for the purposes of the Act still vested in the Commissioner, but the Controller of Accounts, who was the financial check hitherto on the Commissioner, disappeared and his place was taken by the Town Council. An Executive Engineer and an Executive Health Officer had to be appointed by the Corporation, subject to confirmation by Government. The unlimited power vested in the Municipal Commissioner by Act II of 1865 in regard to the making of contracts was considerably curtailed, and all contracts exceeding Rs. 5,000 were subject to control by the Town Council.\nand all contracts over Rs. 2,000 were open to public competition.\n\nThe following were the principal sources of income of the Municipality under the Acts brought into force:\n\n(1) A consolidated rate of not less than 8 p. c. and not more than 12 p. c. of the annual value of houses, buildings and lands in the city.\n\n(2) A water-rate of so many per centum of the annual value of houses, buildings and lands as the Corporation may think sufficient for the maintenance, repairs, &c., of the water works.\n\n(3) A halalkhore rate of not more than 3 p. c. of the annual value of houses, buildings and lands.\n\n(4) In place of (3) a rate to be determined by the Commissioner for the supply of water by measurement or at a reasonable fixed rate.\n\n(5) Tolls on labour carts entering the city.\n\n(6) Town duties on grain, wines and spirits, beer, sugar, ghi, timber excluding railway sleepers, firewood.\n\n(7) Tax on insurance companies of not less than Rs. 500 and not more than Rs. 1,000 per annum.\n\n(8) License fees paid for the regulation of certain trades, such as tallow, boiling or storing offal, blood, bones, rags, &c., &c.\n\n(9) Taxes on carriages, horses, ponies and mules.\n\n(10) Tobacco duty and licenses.\n\n(11) Market fees.\n\n(12) Liquor licenses.\n\nBy Act V. of 1878 the sums collected by and credited to the Corporation for fees on liquor licenses were compounded for a lump sum payment to the Municipality of Rs. 1,43,750, all control over the liquor traffic being thenceforth taken over by Government. Owing to the extra expenditure involved in the introduction of Tansa water into the city, it became necessary to increase the revenues of the Municipality, and for that purpose Act\nNo. III of 1886 was passed altering the \"town duties\" tariff as follows:\n\n| Old tariff | New tariff |\n|------------|------------|\n|            | Annas.     | Annas.     |\n| (1) Grain, Per khandi ... | 4          | 6          |\n| (2) Sugar, Per cwt. ...    | 14         | 8          |\n| (3) Petroleum, Per imp.-gallon ... | Nil | 1 |\n\nAct III of 1888 closely followed the legislation of 1872 and 1878, and created the following Municipal authorities charged with carrying out the provisions of the Act, viz.:\u2014\n(i) A Corporation. (ii) A Standing Committee. (iii) A Municipal Commissioner. The constitution of the Corporation was slightly altered and consisted of 72 Councillors as follows:\u201436 elected at ward elections by the ratepayers, 16 elected by Justices, 2 elected by Fellows of the University, 2 elected by the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, 16 appointed by Government. The Chairman of the Corporation became the \"President.\" The constitution of the Standing Committee remained the same as that of the Town Council, except that it elected its own chairman instead of Government appointing him. Except when it was otherwise expressly provided in the Act, the Municipal government of the city vested in the Corporation. The functions of the Municipal Commissioner remained the same, i.e., the entire executive power for the purposes of the Act vested in the Commissioner. Provision was made for the appointment by the Corporation of a Deputy Commissioner, subject to the approval of Government. The Standing Committee continued to appoint its own Secretary. The relative powers of the three bodies, viz., the Corporation as the custodians of the city's purse, the Standing Committee as the financial advisory body and the Municipal Commissioner as the only executive officer responsible to the Corporation, remained practically the same as in the Acts of 1872 and 1878. The directions in which the revenues could be utilized were very clearly defined and the obligatory and discre-\ntionary duties of the Corporation were definitely laid down. The Corporation were also required to provide and pay \"to Government such proportion of the annual expenses of the police of the city as Government shall from time to time determine.\"\n\nThe Municipal taxes were defined as follows:\u2014(1) Property taxes to be levied on buildings and lands in the city as follows\u2014(a) A water tax of so many per centum of their rateable value as the Corporation may deem expedient. (b) A halalkhore tax not exceeding 3 per centum of their rateable value. (c) A general tax of not less than 8 and not more than 12 per centum of their rateable value. (d) A fire-tax of not more than 3 per centum of their rateable value. (2) A tax on vehicles and animals. (3) A toll on vehicles entering the city from Salsette. (4) Town duties. In addition the following items of revenue contributed to the income of the Municipality:\u2014(1) Liquor licenses. (2) Tobacco duty and licenses. (3) License fees paid for the regulation of certain trades within the city. (4) A rate for water taken by meter measurement.\n\nThe advent of the plague in 1896 showed the inadequacy of the law in regard to the control of epidemic diseases and resulted in Act III of 1897 being passed, whereby the financial control over the expenditure on plague was taken out of the hands of the Corporation and vested first in a Plague Commissioner, and subsequently in the Municipal Commissioner. Once more the Municipal exchequer was subjected to severe strain. Balances which had been carefully, perhaps too carefully, conserved, and which at the end of 1896, stood at over 24 lakhs, were soon dissipated; and at the end of 1897-98 the plague expenditure had risen to over 24\u00bd lakhs and the surplus balances were 3\u00bd lakhs. By a contribution of 14\u00bd lakhs from Government, by the strictest economy compatible with efficiency, and a revision of the methods of assessment of properties in the city, the surplus balances were again built up. But the expansion of the city, an advance in the standard of living which entails increased emoluments to the staff, and the prevalence of scarcity in 1908 and 1909 have again caused a reduction in the surplus balances which at the close of the year 1908-09 stood at 8'21 lakhs.\nThe attempt to rehabilitate the city's finances, combined with the enormous expenditure called for in respect of the sanitary amelioration of the city has demanded very great sacrifices. Within five years from the year 1897-98, which might be taken as the beginning of the plague period, the Corporation spent over 33 lakhs on the better drainage of the city, and within the next five years had increased this sum to 57\u00bd lakhs, besides pledging its future income for further drainage works to the extent of nearly 20 lakhs. The department of Public Health, which in 1896-97 cost under Rs. 14,00,000, rose in five years to over 22 lakhs, and in 1908-09, besides a charge of nearly 2\u00bd lakhs for special plague measures, cost more than 24 lakhs to maintain and administer. The maintenance charges of the Engineering department, which in 1896-97 aggregated little over 14 lakhs, in 1908-09 totalled more than 22\u00bd lakhs. To the close of 1908-09 the total expenditure on plague measures aggregated 70 lakhs which was financed as under:\n\n| Rs.          |\n|--------------|\n| (1) From a plague loan raised by the Municipality | 20,00,000 |\n| (2) From the Government contribution | 14,50,000 |\n| (3) Advances from loan funds | 25,10,052 |\n| (4) From current revenues | 10,70,346 |\n\n70,30,398\n\nAdded to these heavy charges came the further price which the city had to pay in the interests of improved sanitation, when by Act IV of 1898 (The City of Bombay Improvement Act) \"a lump-sum not exceeding 2 per centum on the total rateable value of buildings and lands in the city\", was added to the taxation of the city. The sum paid in liquidation of this obligation amounted to 7\u00b780 lakhs on the 1st April, 1909. Were it necessary for the purposes of the City Improvement Trust to levy the maximum demand, the additional direct taxation to the city would aggregate nearly 8\u00bd lakhs of rupees per annum on the existing rateable value.\nA dispute, which for nearly three decades proceeded intermittently between Government and the Corporation in regard to the city's liability for police charges, medical relief and primary education, was concluded by the passing of Act III of 1907, whereby the city was relieved of all liability for police charges in return for taking over the control of vaccination, medical relief and primary education, and making a certain contribution to higher education, which had hitherto fallen on Government. Vaccination has thus become one of the obligatory functions of the Municipality; while in regard to medical relief the Municipality has to pay monthly to Government the sum of Rs. 34,542 for the management of the medical institutions referred to in schedule U of the above-mentioned Act. With this contribution Government undertakes to maintain the institutions at their existing standard of efficiency; and if any new institutions are required, the Municipality is bound to provide them at its sole cost. The Government grant of Rs. 18,000 a year to the Acworth Leper Asylum at Matunga has also ceased, and the Municipality is now wholly responsible for the maintenance of the institution. Under the Act the Municipality is further bound to contribute monthly Rs. 2,083 towards the up-keep of the Prince of Wales' Museum of Western India (under construction) and to bear the entire cost of the maintenance of the Queen's Statue on the Esplanade and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Under the head of education, the Municipality is responsible for the control of all primary schools and for the amount hitherto spent by Government on primary education in the city, exclusive of building grants.\n\nThe revenue and expenditure of the Municipal Corporation for different periods since 1865 is shown on the next page. The municipal receipts in 1908-09 were nearly Rs. 1,02,86,000. The general tax\\(^1\\) contributed about Rs. 33,00,000. It consists of a tax on houses and lands, levied at 8 per cent. on the net annual letting value of\n\n\\(^{1}\\) The tax before 1877 was separately levied as house rate, police rate and lighting rate. In 1877 it was consolidated and levied at 2 p. c. till 1881, when it was fixed at 8 p. c. In 1886-87 it was raised to 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) p. c. and again it was brought down to 8 p. c. in the next year. In 1898-99 it was raised to 9 p. c. and next year to 12 p. c. In 1901-02 it was again lowered and brought to 10 p. c., and in 1905-06 to 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and in 1906-07 to 8 p. c.\nhouses and lands. The receipts from other taxes levied under the provisions of the Municipal Act are town duties 13 lakhs, wheel tax and tolls 5 lakhs, licenses for trades, land conveyances and music 1 lakh, halakhore tax 11 lakhs, water tax 20 lakhs, market receipts 5 lakhs, and receipts from Government for liquor licenses and tobacco duty 4 lakhs. The average incidence per head of population was Rs. 8-14-11. The expenses in the same year amounted to nearly 73 lakhs, excluding the amounts paid towards the municipal debts and investments. Of this sum about 3 lakhs were expended on education, 7 lakhs on medical relief and plague expenses, 17 lakhs for the maintenance of the fire brigade, 45 were contributed to the Improvement Trust, and 50 lakhs were spent in the Engineering and Health departments and a large portion was spent for carrying out repairs, road making and conservancy.\n\n**Revenue and Expenditure of the Bombay Municipality.**\n\n_In thousands of rupees (000s omitted.)_\n\n| Year | Receipts | Expenditure | Year | Receipts | Expenditure |\n|------|----------|-------------|------|----------|-------------|\n|      | Rs.      | Rs.         |      | Rs.      | Rs.         |\n| 1865 | 23.64    | 49.59       | 1887-8 | 51.07   | 58.13       |\n| 1866 | 29.15    | 36.02       | 1888-9 | 49.66   | 52.01       |\n| 1867 | 30.41    | 42.16       | 1889-90 | 53.42  | 50.42       |\n| 1868 | 38.53    | 34.77       | 1890-1 | 61.66   | 56.85       |\n| 1869 | 33.93    | 31.31       | 1891-2 | 62.33   | 57.82       |\n| 1870 | 33.08    | 33.92       | 1892-3 | 66.73   | 65.46       |\n| 1871 | 28.71    | 38.04       | 1893-4 | 67.03   | 69.64       |\n| 1872 | 30.48    | 31.16       | 1894-5 | 65.39   | 63.73       |\n| 1873 | 33.24    | 30.45       | 1895-6 | 67.62   | 67.03       |\n| 1874 | 29.81    | 29.91       | 1896-7 | 62.09   | 70.05       |\n| 1875 | 31.44    | 32.65       | 1897-8 | 71.46   | 74.97       |\n| 1876 | 31.77    | 31.60       | 1898-9 | 71.62   | 73.39       |\n| 1877 | 32.41    | 30.37       | 1899-1900 | 88.30 | 73.92       |\n| 1878 | 31.45    | 32.70       | 1900-01 | 84.03 | 85.84       |\n| 1879 | 33.41    | 31.11       | 1901-2 | 77.67   | 82.26       |\n| 1880 | 32.52    | 30.58       | 1902-3 | 81.76   | 84.53       |\n| 1881 | 38.74    | 37.99       | 1903-4 | 84.83   | 84.31       |\n| 1882-3* | 46.12 | 47.54       | 1904-5 | 93.36   | 85.92       |\n| 1883-4 | 37.37 | 37.16       | 1905-6 | 90.93   | 93.74       |\n| 1884-5 | 42.14 | 38.81       | 1906-7 | 96.49   | 95.21       |\n| 1885-6 | 44.74 | 40.67       | 1907-8 | 98.89   | 101.89      |\n| 1886-7 | 49.02 | 41.76       | 1908-9 | 1,02.86 | 1,06.30     |\n\n* For fifteen months.\nThe subjoined table shows the debt of the Bombay Municipality and the sums set aside as sinking fund on the 31st March 1909:\n\n| Particulars of Loans | Rate of interest | Amount of Loans raised | Balance due on 31st Mar., 1909 | Sinking Funds on 31st March 1909 |\n|----------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Government**       |                 |                        |                               |                                |\n| Vebar Water Works Debt | ...            | ...                    | 25,00                         | 23,52                          |\n| **Public**           |                 |                        |                               |                                |\n| Drainage Loan of 1878 | ...            | ...                    | 26,94                         | 12,25                          |\n| The Sanitary Works Loan of 1885-86 | ... | ... | 44,00 | 17,39 | 14,24 |\n| Do. do. of 1888      | ...            | ...                    | 7,00                          | 7,00                           | 2,19 |\n| Tansa Water Works Loan | ...          | ...                    | 147,00                        | 147,00                         | 11,56 |\n| Miscellaneous Works Loan of 1888-89 | ... | ... | 14,00 | 12,00 | 3,93 |\n| Agripada House Sullage Water Connections Loans of 1889-90 | ... | ... | 10,08 | 10,08 | 2,97 |\n| Sanitary Works Loan of 1890-91 | ... | ... | 35,00 | 35,00 | 8,73 |\n| Municipal Office Building Loan of 1891 | ... | ... | 8,00 | 8,00 | 1,91 |\n| Loan for Fire Brigade-Quarters and Stations | ... | ... | 4,50 | 4,50 | 1,80 |\n| Loan for repayment of the balance of the 4\u00bd p. c Govt.

The latter have been lodged with the Bank of Bombay.*\nThe original liability on account of the Vehar debt amounted to 25 lakhs; but the expenditure on those water works being much in excess of the original estimate, the liability of the Corporation was fixed by Government under section 140 of Bombay Act III of 1872 at Rs. 37,30,053, after taking into account the repayments made by the Corporation from time to time. Repayments made since the settlement of the liability have amounted to Rs. 13,77,614; and the balance due to Government on the 31st March 1909 thus stood at Rs. 23,52,439.\n\nOriginally when loans were raised it was the practice to pay off a certain proportion of the loan each year. But this practice has yielded place to the policy of providing a sinking-fund for each loan. Under the old practice the drainage loan of 1878, amounting to Rs. 26,94,000, was raised. The sanitary works loan of 1885-86 was of a hybrid character, 6'61 lakhs being paid off at certain stated periods and the balance being covered by a sinking-fund. All subsequent loans are being discharged by means of a sinking-fund. Up to 1905-06 Government required the sinking-funds to be built up on the basis of the accrual of interest at rates analogous to the rates at which the loans were raised. But the gradual lowering of the rates at which interest is paid on gilt-edged securities resulted in Government orders to arrange the sinking-funds of all existing loans on a 3\u00bd p. c. basis and of all future loans on a 3 p. c. basis.\n\nProperty taxes comprising a general tax, water tax, halalkhore tax, and a tax on vehicles and animals produce more than three-quarters of the total municipal revenue, and are collected and assessed by the Assessment and Collection department. In 1865, 17,959 properties were assessed, and their rateable valuation was more than 120 lakhs. In 1867 these figures rose respectively to 22,829 and 163 lakhs; but from that year up to 1880 there was a continual decrease in valuation which at length attracted the notice of the Corporation and led to the reorganization of the department in 1882, in accordance with proposals submitted by the Commissioner, Mr. (now Sir E. C. K.) Ollivant.\nUnder the Municipal Act the valuations of properties are revised every year according to the rents prevailing in the city. For supervisinal purposes the city is divided into 7 wards, each in charge of a Superintendent, and sub-divided again into sections, for each of which a ward-clerk is responsible. The ward clerk has to inspect each property once a year, assess all the properties in his section and collect the dues from the persons resident therein. The department is controlled by an Assessor and Collector, aided by assistants, in whose office assessments are maintained, demands settled, bills prepared and issued, collections brought to account and balances struck. All complaints against valuations are investigated by the Assessor and Collector.

The wells were of an average depth of 30 feet; and like the tanks were mostly situated in crowded localities and thus peculiarly liable to pollution. The location of a private well within the house was regarded as a special luxury to be enjoyed only by the rich; and many houses in the Fort were supplied in this way with water which percolated from the foul ditch surrounding the ramparts. In fact, up to 1860, the conditions of an impure water-supply were abundantly fulfilled by insanitary surroundings, and natural facilities afforded to the drainage of organic impurities into the wells left little room for doubt that liquid sewage formed no insignificant constituent of much of the drinking water.\n\nNevertheless it was rather the scarcity than the impurity of the water-supply that underlay the efforts to improve it. In 1850, for example, the only water to be found on Malabar and Cumballa hills was situated at Walkeshwar village on the one side and at Tankerville (Gowalia Tank road) on the other, and the total quantity obtainable throughout the island cannot have been much more than one-tenth of the amount now used by the public. Water-famines were by no means uncommon, one of the largest occurring in 1824 and resulting in a public enquiry into the condition of the wells and tanks. But no definite steps towards improvement were taken until 1845, when the deficiency of\n\n---\n\n1 For more detailed information see Major Tulloch's Water Supply of Bombay (1872), Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation (1907), Clerk, Sadsewjee & Jacob on Impounding Reservoirs in India (1891); Santo Crimp's Report on Bombay Water Supply, 1899.\n\n2 A good example of such tanks was Framji Cowasji tank, bordering the Esplanade, which was built in 1831 by an enterprising Parsi for the benefit of residents in the locality. Another was the big tank constructed in 1849 near the Grant Medical College, into which several springs of salt water gushed from the Hydul side. These springs were used and decreased with the spring and neap tides. (Bombay Times, June 6th, 1849). Others were the Two Tanks in Duncan road, built before 1823, and supplied with water by an aqueduct from the Cowasji Patel tank.\n\n3 Tulloch's Water Supply of Bombay (1872), pp. 209-10.\nwater in the town forced Government to appoint a committee, composed of Dr. Graham and Dr. Leith, to devise measures for enhancing the supply. Various proposals were put forward, among them being that of Mr. L. C. C. Rivett for impounding the surface drainage of the Neat's Tongue (Trombay), which according to his calculations would have provided the town with 200,000,000 gallons a year at a cost of some 7 lakhs. Colonel George Jervis, on the other hand, believed in the construction of three reservoirs at Dhobi Talao, Girgaum and Mahim, the first of which was to supply the Fort, the second the town proper, and the third Parel, Byculla and Mazagon, the water being pumped from them by steam-power and distributed through pipes to those areas. This proposal, however, lost weight from the fact that the existing tanks were often extremely low and had occasionally to be replenished by the sinking of new wells. The old Cowasji Patel tank, for example, was very short of water in 1846; and the situation was only saved by Mr. Framji Cowasji, who purchased the Mugbhat oart and sank three large wells in it, from which the tank was supplied by means of steam-machinery at an outlay of Rs. 30,000. A third proposal by Captain Turner to impound water on Malabar hill and Cumballa hill was likewise rejected.\n\nThe project finally adopted was the outcome of a report, submitted by Captain Crawford of the Engineers in 1850, in favour of drawing the city's water-supply from the Vehar nala. In 1852 Mr. Conybeare was asked to scrutinise the proposals of his predecessor and by 1855 he had elaborated the great scheme for the construction of the Vehar lake, in conjunction with a minor scheme for the distribution of water by iron pipes to nearly all parts of the city. Outlying villages were to be supplied by means of draw-wells kept constantly full by masonry conduits connected directly with the main pipe. The scheme was formulated by no means too soon; for in 1854 so terrible a water-famine occurred that the Great Indian Peninsula\n\n---\n\n1 Tulloch's Water-Supply of Bombay (1872).\n2 Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation, pp. 65, 69. Mr. Framji Cowasji obtained the Powai Estate as freehold from Government in 1837 on condition of always keeping the Two Tanks supplied with a reasonable quantity of water.\nrailway and country-boats had to be used for the daily transmission of water from the mainland into the town. Nevertheless a certain amount of trouble was experienced in raising the necessary funds, so that the lake and its ancillary works were not completed till 1858. Water was introduced in the year following, the daily supply amounting to roughly 94 million gallons. This supply proved within a few years wholly insufficient for the needs of a population, which from the commencement of the cotton-boom and share-mania was annually increasing by abnormal strides; and in 1866 therefore meters were introduced and applied to about 3 p. c. of the total supply, including all Government, factory and public company connections. By 1868 an enhanced supply had become an imperative need; and on the motion of Dr. Blaney, the Municipal Commissioner was desired to submit proposals for the extension of the supply. Four separate schemes, the Shewla, Kennery, Tulsi and Powai, formed the subject of this report; and of these the Tulsi scheme, which consisted in damming the river Tasso and diverting its waters into the Vehar lake, ultimately found favour with Mr. A. R. Scoble's commission, which was appointed by Government in 1869 to discuss the four alternative projects. Plans and estimates were prepared in 1870; the works were commenced in 1872 and completed in 1879, together with a settling tank and covered service reservoir on Malabar Hill, which are connected with the Tulsi lake by a 24-inch main. The additional supply thus obtained amounted to about 4\u00bd million gallons a day.\n\n---\n\n1 The author of the Marathi Mumboiche Varman gives a graphic description of the shifts resorted to by the people in this crisis. Prayers and offerings to the gods were made daily; an image of one of the sages was made, consecrated and worshipped for eight consecutive days; all cattle were removed from the city to Mahim; and a single jar of muddy water was in most cases all that the poorer families had to depend on for several days.\n\n2 The ceremony of turning the first sod of the new works was performed by the Governor-General on January 1st, 1856, in the presence of Lord Elphinstone and a large gathering of Bombay residents. Bombay Times, 2nd February 1856.\n\n3 The water from the Tulsi catchment area was actually diverted into Vehar from 1874 onwards, before the completion of the Tulsi works. This saved the city from a serious failure of supply in 1876 and 1877. Administration Report of the Municipal Commissioner for 1877.\nHay Grant or Bhandarwada reservoir with six filter beds for Vehar water was also commenced in Mazagon on the 10th May 1880 and the water from Vehar lake was diverted into the reservoir on the 7th April 1884.\n\nStill the city continued to increase rapidly in size, and by 1884 the yield of Tulsi and Vehar together, amounting to roughly 14 million gallons a day, proved insufficient for even the domestic needs of the population, apart from the increased demand from the city's trades and industries. Consequently, after initiation of investigations by Dr. Blaney, the Municipal Corporation sanctioned the execution of the Tansa water works project, originally devised by Major Tulloch, and applied to Government for the loan of the services of Mr. Clerke, an official of the Public Works Department, to carry out the work. Plans and estimates were prepared in 1885; the contract for the construction of the masonry-dam was signed and the work was commenced in January 1886; and on the 31st March 1892, the completed works were opened by the Viceroy, Lord Lansdowne. In 1889, during the period of construction, the probability of a water-famine appeared so imminent that the Corporation sanctioned the Powai valley scheme as an auxiliary to Vehar. This consisted of the construction of a masonry-dam to secure the water flowing from 1,700 acres, forming part of the old Powai estate and situated immediately to the south-east of Vehar lake. The lake or emergency reservoir thus formed in 1891 was far too shallow to admit of good water for domestic purposes being obtained and also at too low a level to permit of proper gravitation into the city; and, on the completion of the Tansa works in 1892, it was therefore abandoned and has never since been utilized. The daily supply that can be stored in the Tansa lake, as at present constructed, is estimated at 40 million gallons.\n\nAt the present time (1909), the three lakes, Tansa, Vehar and Tulsi have a total storage capacity of about 30,000 million gallons above the lowest outlets, and with a regularly recurring monsoon, there is little prospect of a total failure of the supply. To provide for the growing needs of the city, the Tansa dam has been so designed as to admit of its being raised 15 feet in height, which will then\nprovide an additional storage of about 12,600 million gallons. The quality of water is generally good, that received from Tansa being considered fit for potation without further purification. The supplies from the various sources are periodically analysed and every care is taken to maintain an abundant supply of uncontaminated water. The following is a brief result of an analysis made during the month of May 1907, when the water level in the lakes was low:\n\n| Lake from which sample was taken | Grams per gallon | Part per million |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                  | Total Solids    | Chlorine        |\n|                                  |                 |                 |\n| Tansa                            | 7.0             | 0.6             |\n| Vehar                            | 9.0             | 0.9             |\n| Tulsi                            | 9.0             | 0.9             |\n\nThe average daily supply drawn off from the lakes, exclusive of that lost by evaporation, amounts to about 32 million gallons, i.e., 174 millions from Tansa, 114 millions from Vehar and 31 millions from Tulsi. Out of these 32 million gallons about 4 million gallons are used for railways, Port Trust, cattle stables, and trade purposes; half a million gallons are supplied to the suburbs and the remainder is used for domestic purposes, including the flushing of drains, water-closets, and wastage. It is estimated that about 4 million gallons are used for road watering. The Fort, with a population of about 100,000, consumes 4 million gallons daily, or about 40 gallons per head, leaving 28 million gallons for distribution amongst the remaining 900,000 odd inhabitants.\n\nThe present supply mains from the lakes to the city vary from 24\" to 48\" diameter, while the distributing and service mains laid within the city range from 3\" to 48\" diameter.\n\nHouse service connections for domestic purposes are granted to all private consumers, and vary from 1\" to 3\" in diameter. Connections to mills, factories, and other industrial concerns vary from 2\" to 6\" diameter. There are about 22,000 connections now in existence. Hydrants for fire-extinguishing and road-watering pur-\nposes are provided in all parts of the city; there are about 3,400 hydrants now in use.\n\nThe following table shows the sizes and lengths of the principal mains now in use:\n\n| Inches | 48\" | 36\" | 24\" | Total |\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Supply mains outside the city ... Miles | 24 | 7 | 18\u00bd | 49\u00bd |\n| Supply mains within the city ... Miles | 3\u00bd | 13 | 3 | 3 | 34\u00be |\n| Distributing and service mains, within the city ... Miles | 1 | 2\u00bd | 2\u00bd | 4 | 117 | 139 |\n\nAll the water used for Government, railways, Port Trust, and trade purposes and part of the domestic supply is now metered. There are about 3,000 meters of various sizes ranging from \u00be\" to 6\" in diameter in use at present time.\n\nThe principal water-works inside the island are the reservoirs and filters on Malabar hill and Bhandarwada hill. The former comprise a clear-water reservoir, settling reservoir, and 7 filter beds with a combined area of nearly 9,000 square yards, which practically filter the whole daily supply from Tulsi. The latter works likewise comprise settling and clear-water reservoirs and 9 filter-beds with a combined area of 15,560 square yards and a filtering capacity of 7\u00bd million gallons a day. The reservoirs on Malabar and Bhandarwada hills have storage capacities respectively of 20 million and 12 million gallons. The filters in both cases are constructed of a 24-inch layer of sand, resting upon a 6-inch layer of gravel; and below the gravel are built brick channels which carry the filtered water away into clear water channels and thence through regulating and measuring sluices into the distributing reservoir. The rate of filtration of Bombay water is calculated at nearly 600 gallons per square yard per diem, which is equivalent to a lineal velocity of flow of about 5 inches per hour.\nPublic drinking-fountains, stand-pipes and cattle-troughs have been provided in all parts of the city; these are taking the place of the old wells and tanks which are now almost entirely abandoned and are being gradually reclaimed. The public drinking-fountains and stand-pipes, now in existence, number about 150 and cattle-troughs about 60.\n\nThe total amount expended on all water-works up to the present time is about 282 lakhs, nearly the whole of which has been met from various loans raised from time to time. The present financial position of the water works scheme is\u2014liabilities 255 lakhs and assets 329 lakhs. Thus the assets, including value of works, is 74 lakhs in excess of liabilities.\n\nAmong the most serious accidents occurring since 1892, resulting in the temporary stoppage of the supply from different sources, may be mentioned the bursting of the 42\" Vehar outlet main within the Vehar outlet tunnel. This accident occurred on the 30th August 1893, and necessitated the closing of the Vehar supply for about 7 days. In 1892 a land slip occurred at Gibbs' road which carried away a portion of the 24\" Tulsi main, and the supply from this source was stopped for about a week. A similar accident occurred in 1907, but caused no serious interference, as Tansa water was supplied to the city and reservoirs through the existing distributing mains. On the 30th July, 1896, about three miles of the 48\" Tansa main settled owing to heavy floods and about 500 feet of piping were entirely washed away. This accident caused a stoppage of the Tansa supply for about 10 days. A portion of the Tansa aqueduct, opposite the Vehar lake, collapsed on the 20th February 1901 and stopped the Tansa supply to the city for 10 days. Owing to the prevailing hot weather, much inconvenience was felt by the stoppage of this supply. A similar accident to the Tansa duct occurred at Pogaon near Bhiwandi in November 1901, but being the cold season, less inconvenience was felt. The supply on this occasion was stopped for about five days. In September 1904, a portion of the Tulsi tunnel, under the dam, fell in and caused damage to the cast-iron pipes laid therein. This accident caused\nthe supply from the Tulsi lake to be curtailed for a considerable length of time.\n\nSince the completion of the Tansa works in 1892, water has been regularly supplied from the lakes which are amply replenished after each monsoon. There has been no occasion for the inhabitants of the city to return to the use of water from the old wells; but, owing to the increasing demands for water for trade and other purposes, it is considered necessary to further augment the supply by duplicating the line of 48\" pipes. These proposals are now under discussion.\n\nThe Tansa lake is situated at the foot of the Western Ghats, about 55 miles from Bombay, and has a drainage-area of 52\u00bd square miles. Its area, when full, is 5\u00bd square miles, with a capacity of about 18,600 million gallons, which after due allowance for evaporation and other losses, suffices for a daily supply of upwards of 40 million gallons. The masonry-dam, which is 8,800 feet in length and 118 feet in height at the highest point, is so designed that it can, if necessary, be raised 15 feet higher, thereby increasing the storage capacity to more than 30,000 million gallons, and the daily supply to 70 million gallons: but this would involve the construction of a second aqueduct along a far less practicable route than that of the existing aqueduct.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall recorded at Tansa was 120 inches in 1896 and the lightest 40 inches in 1899, the mean average fall being 108 inches: but so immense is the catchment-area that a fall of less than 40 inches suffices to fill the lake. The surplus waters pass away over a portion of the dam to the south, which is 1,650 feet long and 3 feet lower than the remainder, and thence by depressions in the ground into the old course of the river. These nata or depressions at the back of the dam have acquired a depth of 20 to 30 feet. Levels are taken after the close of each succeeding monsoon, a comparison of which for several years shows that denudation is not advancing to any appreciable extent. The heaviest flood on record occurred on the 20th July 1894 and amounted at its maximum volume to 2,500 million cubic feet per second.\n\n---\n\n1 See Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, 21st November, 1893.\nWater is drawn from the lake by means of four sluices at different levels, the lowest being 380 feet above the Town Hall datum or about 280 feet above street-level in the Fort, and is always tapped as near the surface of the lake as possible, to ensure the maximum of purity. The conduit which commences at the level of the lowest sluice consists of a masonry channel, 7 feet wide and 6 feet deep, with an arched roof, and is furnished with manholes at about every furlong and cleansing sluices at every two furlongs. It has a downward gradient of 6 inches in the mile, and when full is capable of discharging 40 million gallons a day. The seven valleys on its course, which vary in length from three-quarters of a mile to 1\u00bd miles, are crossed by 48-inch cast-iron pipe syphons, with a fall from end to end of 1 in 1,650 and a consequent discharge of about 18 million gallons. Up to the present date a single line of piping only has been laid, so that the full capacity of the aqueduct still remains to be utilized. The longest syphon-line, which crosses the Bassein creek and the low-lying land on either side, is more than 11 miles long, and for roughly half-a-mile is carried on iron bridges over the three branches of the creek. In all there are about 27 miles of masonry conduit and tunnel, including several long masonry aqueducts and 17 miles of syphon between Tansa and Ghatkopar, the latter point being furnished with a screening and measuring basin, in which can be estimated the quantity of water passing into the 48-inch main running from Ghatkopar to Chinchpugli. At Chinchpugli the 48\" main is reduced to 27\" and runs as far as Nana's chowk at Gowalia tank, thence it supplies Malabar hill and Bhandarwada reservoirs and the city direct, through the existing distributing mains. The total cost of the Tansa water works was 149\u00bd lakhs.\n\nThe Vebar lake in Salsette has a drainage area of about 3,900 acres, of which 1,400 are covered by the lake itself, and when full contains about 8,800 million gallons of water. The ratio of the catchment area to the storage area is far smaller than at Tansa. The effects of a poor monsoon are far more lasting than in the case of the larger work, and only a succession of good monsoons can operate\nto maintain the water at overflow-level. The lake possesses three earthen embankments, the large one measuring 84 feet in height and two of smaller dimensions, which were somewhat carelessly constructed in the first instance, and had to be repaired and strengthened at considerable cost about 1871. As originally constructed, the water was drawn off at an upstand tower connecting with a pipe through the main embankment, but justifiable fears being entertained of the safety of this device, it was finally abandoned in favour of an upstand tower at the upper extremity of the dam with regulating sluices to carry the flow into a 42-inch pipe, laid in a tunnel driven through the hill on the east side of the embankment. At the lower end of this tunnel the pipe bifurcates into one of 32 inches and one of 24 inches in diameter, of which the former, supplying 74 million gallons a day, joins the Great Indian Peninsula railway at Kurla and runs thence to the Bandarwada reservoir and filters; and the latter, supplying 3 to 4 million gallons a day, runs directly to the Vehar filters and thence via Kurla to old Government House, Parel, with a branch to Mahim, Bandora and the northern portion of the island. At the end of the embankment and to the north of the outlet is a waste weir, 603\u00bd feet long, which is capable of disposing of the largest flood likely to occur and thereby preventing the danger consequent upon the escape of water over the top of the earthen-dam. The total cost of the Vehar water-works was more than 45.4 lakhs.\n\nThe Tulsi lake in Salsette, which is the smallest of the three main sources of supply, is situated amid the most charming scenery and lies 52 feet higher than Tansa and nearly 200 feet higher than Vehar. On this account it is able to furnish with water places like Malabar hill and Cumballa hill which cannot be reached by the Vehar supply. But the quality of its water on the other hand is distinctly inferior to that of the other two lakes, owing partly to its size, which is too small to allow of free sedimentation,\n\n---\n\n1 Lecture on the Water-Supply of Bombay by Mr. Fairlie Bruce, Times of India, 1901. It is there recorded that, owing to the deficient rainfall (38 inches) of 1899, the lake was short by 2,000 million gallons in 1900.\n\n2 This main is now being diverted between Kurla and Byculla and that portion of the main between Vehar and Kurla will shortly be replaced by a 48\" diameter main.\npartly to the absence of algae-absorbing weeds, and partly also to the fact that the prevailing winds blow towards the outlet instead of in the contrary direction, as at Tansa and Vehar. The lake, which covers 330 acres out of a total catchment area of 1,714 acres, is formed by a masonry dam, 85 feet in height, across the original course of the Tulsi nala and an earthen dam of less elevation on the Vehar side. A waste weir, measuring 142 feet in length, carries the overflow of water into the Vehar lake.\n\nThe average rainfall at Tulsi is 104 inches, measured as at Tansa and Vehar near the embankment. As much of the catchment-area of all three lakes is at a far higher level than that occupied by the gauges, it seems probable that the latter do not indicate the total rainfall. The highest recorded fall at Tulsi was 144 inches in 1892, and the lowest 44 inches in 1899. Water is drawn from the lake at different levels into an upstand tower and passes into an iron pipe laid through a tunnel under the embankment; this tunnel collapsed several years ago, without however causing any damage to the earthen embankment. The water is conveyed to Malabar hill by means of a 24-inch pipe, which, passing Marole about 1\u00bd miles from Andheri and Bandora, skirts the west side of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India railway line as far as the race-course, and thence runs up by the Pedder and Gibbs roads to the reservoir. The pipe supplies about 3\u00bd million gallons a day. The total cost of the Tulsi works was 37'6 lakhs.\n\nNo problem in the municipal administration of the island has presented greater difficulties or been more fully discussed from time to time than that of drainage, in consequence of the fact that the bulk of the island was originally below the mean level of the sea, thereby rendering gravitation into the latter impossible, and considerably enhancing the cost of drainage-operations; and also because at the present date, after a large portion of the interior has been filled up and reclaimed, the elevation of the land is too slight to admit of gravitation into the sea at a distant point of outfall. The history of the drainage of Bombay commences with the old main drain, constructed about the end of the eighteenth century, which, at first merely an open nala discharging at the Great Breach, was\ngradually covered in between 1824 and 1856 from the Esplanade to Paidhoni and Bellasis road and was furnished, after the construction of the Hornby Vellard, with a fresh outfall at Varli. As the urban area increased, an outfall nearer the town and a more constant delivery of sewage into the sea became essential; and in 1842 therefore sluices were constructed at Love Grove and connected with the upper part of the channel by a new cut, the junction of the two forming the present bend in the main drain. In the meanwhile subsidiary connections with the main drain had sprung into existence, so that by 1856 there were altogether 8,201 yards of subsidiary drains, 1,268 yards of drains communicating directly with an outfall into the harbour, and 3,634 yards of drains falling into Back Bay. The system was thoroughly unsatisfactory, inasmuch as the bottom of the main drain was below the level of the low-water spring-tides, and both sewage and storm-water were therefore constantly ponded up until they overflowed the Flats and rendered residence over a large area a complete impossibility.\n\nPrior to 1860 various attempts were made to rectify the nuisance, as for example in 1853 by Mr. Conybeare, who initiated a scheme for running all sewage during the fair season into a sunk pit near Bellasis road, deodorizing it and then applying it to the irrigation of land near the Flats. This, as well as other schemes, only served to accentuate the nuisance; and no comprehensive proposals were formulated until 1860, when Messrs. Wilcox and Tracey submitted plans for the discharge of all sewage at Wari bandar and Carnac bandar on the east of the island, and for the separate drainage of the Fort area, the Malabar hill area being omitted as not ripe for drainage-operations. The total cost of the scheme was estimated at 33.2 lakhs. The scheme, having been approved by a local committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Leith and by an expert in England, was sanctioned by Government in 1863; a drainage department was organized, and work was commenced in 1864. The work however came to an abrupt conclusion in the following year, partly owing to the failure of the contractors, and partly because in the meanwhile the proposed location of the outfall had been\nseriously combated in the public press. Eventually in 1866 Government, in deference to public opinion, appointed a commission to report upon the whole subject and sanctioned the proposal, which it submitted to discharge all sewage into a reservoir opposite the old light-house at Colaba and thence pump it into the sea at ebb-tide. By the close of 1867 the outlet into the harbour had been provided, and a main-sewer costing 1.4 lakhs with an outfall at Sonapur in Back Bay had been completed.\n\nA definite plan of operations, acceptable to all, was however still a desideratum; and the history of the decade 1867-77, is one of delay and of destructive rather than constructive energy. In 1868 for example Captain Tulloch, who had been despatched for the purpose from England, submitted a report opposing the sewage outfall at Colaba, and proposing to pump the sewage at Love Grove. He further favoured the construction of three sluices at Love Grove, Varli, and Dharavi for dealing with storm water. This scheme was rejected in 1869 by another commission, presided over by Mr. A. R. Scoble, so that in 1872 the several outfalls at Love Grove, Colaba, and Back Bay had all been condemned, and the Municipal authorities had no definite plan upon which to proceed. Meanwhile the drainage of Kamathipura and other areas had been completed, pending a final decision on the location of the outfall; and in view of this fact and of the pressing requests of Government to apply themselves seriously to the problem, the Municipality in 1877 decided to adopt an alternative scheme, contemplating an outfall at Love Grove, which had been prepared by Captain Tulloch in 1872 and modified by Mr. Rienzi Walton, their Engineer, in 1876. A loan of 27 lakhs was raised and work on the scheme was commenced in 1878, the chief features of the scheme being the construction of a new main sewer from Carnac bandar to Love Grove at an estimated cost of 4.9 lakhs, which was completed with its ancillary works in 1881, of a new outfall sewer estimated to cost 2.41 lakhs and completed in 1880, of pipe-sewers completed in 1883-84 at a cost of 3.71 lakhs, and of a pumping-station and plant at Love Grove, which were erected in 1884 at a cost of Rs. 95,000, exclusive\nof machinery costing 186 lakhs. This pumping-plant was eventually condemned by Mr. Baldwin Latham in 1890, and a new plant and engine were purchased in 1893-94 at a cost of 488 lakhs, including the cost of building.\n\nFrom 1882 onwards the work on this scheme has steadily progressed. Branch sewers were laid down, notably the Queen's road sewer, completed in 1884 at a cost of 141 lakhs; the Fort area was re-sewered by the close of 1889 at a cost of 398 lakhs; house-connections and pipe-sewers were completed in Girgaum in 1891 at a cost of 795 lakhs; and in 1884 dep\u00f4ts were erected for the reception of night-soil which was discharged into new sewers and carried out to Varli. This system still prevails over the greater portion of the island. In 1890 Mr. Baldwin Latham was asked to advise the municipal authorities upon the general scheme of drainage for the island; and, in view of the expense attendant upon the location of the main outfall at the Prongs Reef, which he strongly favoured, he decided that the existing outfall at Love Grove was the most suitable. As a result of his report Colaba was sewered on the Shone system in 1893.\n\nSince 1890 the drainage department of the Municipality has been engaged in gradually completing the details of the original scheme, such as the sewerage of Mazagon, Malabar hill, Parel, and other parts of the island. At the present date (1909) the city contains about 200 miles of underground storm-water drains and about 116 miles of sewers. Since 1897 the districts of Mazagon, Parel, Chinchpugli and Agripada have been sewered on the Shone system at a cost of 1324 lakhs, an air-compressor station having been constructed at Love Grove for all these districts at a cost of 878 lakhs, inclusive of the cost of the principal air main from the station to these districts. Malabar hill has recently been sewered at a cost of about 6\u00bd lakhs, a portion of the sewage being dealt with by biological treatment. The effluent is discharged into the sea on the west of Malabar hill. For the disposal of storm water a new channel from Jacob's Circle to Varli has been completed, as also a branch channel up to Dadar road. These works have cost about 15 lakhs. Branch\ndrains from Jacob's Circle have been completed at a cost of 2\u00bd lakhs. The Varli channel was designed on lines recommended by Mr. Santo Crimp, who visited Bombay in 1899, to advise the Corporation on the general drainage of the island. Important drainage-works carried out since 1867 are shewn in Appendix IV at the end of this chapter. More than 200 public latrines and urinals are at present (1909) maintained by the Municipality, and are being added to yearly as necessity arises. The majority of these are on the water-carriage system.\n\nIt is proposed to carry out the following works during the next few years at an estimated cost of 50 lakhs. The sewerage of the Elphinstone reclamation on the Shone system; the drainage of high lands discharging into the harbour at Tank bandar; and the erection of new pumps at Love Grove and other works necessary for relieving the present surcharging of sewers. As regards the last item the Corporation have decided on the advice of Messrs. G. Midgley Taylor and G. R. Strachan to instal an entirely new pumping-station at Love Grove to deal with the whole of the city's sewage, the existing pumps being kept in reserve in order to deal with the increased flow during the heavy rains of the monsoon. The present plant has proved inadequate to deal with the maximum quantity of sewage reaching Love Grove, which has resulted in the sewers periodically becoming seriously surcharged.\n\nThere is no separate tax or cess to defray the cost of the drainage works constructed in Bombay. The general tax on properties amounting to not less than 8 per cent. and not more than 12 per cent. covers the cost of these works in addition to other works carried out by the Municipality. A halatkore tax not exceeding 3 per cent. on properties is also levied, which covers the cost of maintaining and repairing municipal drains and of scavenging. Since 1878 the Municipality has spent about 125 lakhs on drainage works.\n\nUp to 1906 the Drainage department of the Municipality was divided into two branches, a special branch for the construction of new works and an ordinary branch for the maintenance of existing works and the supervision of\nhouse-connections. These branches have since 1907 been amalgamated under a qualified Deputy Executive Engineer for drainage, who is assisted by a full staff comprising two Assistant Engineers, a Chief Inspector, several inspectors, a head plumber, a head surveyor and a full clerical establishment.\n\nThe License department was formerly managed by the Health department, but in 1890 a separate department was formed with a staff of inspectors and clerks under the control of a Superintendent of Licenses, to whom power was delegated by the Municipal Commissioner under the provisions of Section 394 of the Municipal Act, 1888, to issue licenses, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, which are enumerated in the license forms in respect of dangerous and offensive trades. The city is divided into seven wards A to G, and each ward is in charge of an inspector. The work of tabulating the wards for the purpose of controlling premises subject to licenses is commenced on 1st April of each year, and ends on 31st March following.\n\nThe provisions of Act II of 1865 materially differ from those of 1872, 1878 and 1888. Section 97 of Act II of 1865 authorized a license tax on professions, trades or callings, which were divided into four classes. The Municipal Commissioner was authorized to determine under which of these classes every person should be licensed and to assess them accordingly. Any person aggrieved had the right to appeal to the Court of Petty Sessions, which heard and determined each appeal and had power to award compensation to the appellant or to the Municipal Commissioner as was thought fit. Any person required to take out a license or to renew the same who failed to do so, was liable, on conviction, to a penalty not exceeding three times the amount which in the judgment of such Magistrate would have been payable by such person; and if any person, without reasonable excuse, neglected or refused to produce and show his license when demanded, was liable, on conviction, to a penalty not exceeding one hundred rupees. In 1867 the revenue from this source was Rs. 2,00,019, and the number of licenses issued was 6,943. In his annual report of 1868 the Municipal Commissioner\ncommenting on the levy of this tax says:\u2014\u201cThis most objectionable tax has happily been abolished, and a better form of taxation introduced for the current year\u201d.\n\nThe Municipal Act of 1872 and 1878 provided for the licensing of dangerous and offensive trades almost in the same manner as the Act of 1888 which enacts that no person is authorized to use any premises for any of the purposes hereinbelow mentioned without or otherwise than in conformity with the terms of a license so granted, vis:\u2014(a) Any purpose which is in the opinion of the Commissioner dangerous to life, health or property, or likely to create a nuisance. (b) Keeping horses, cattle or other four-footed animals for sale, on hire or for sale of the produce thereof; (c) Storing for other than domestic use or selling timber, firewood, charcoal, coal, coke, ashes, hay, grass or any other combustible things; (d) Casting metals; (e) Manufacturing bricks or tiles; (f) Packing, pressing, cleansing, preparing or manufacturing, by any process whatever, any of the following articles, vis:\u2014(1) Cloths in indigo or other colours; (2) Paper; (3) Silk; (4) Pottery; (g) Storing, packing, pressing, cleansing, preparing or manufacturing, by any process whatever, certain specified articles.\n\nThe following statement gives the total number of licenses issued, and the gross revenue since 1890-91:\n\n| Year       | Number | Revenue | Year       | Number | Revenue |\n|------------|--------|---------|------------|--------|---------|\n| 1890-91    | 3,235  | 36,417  | 1900-01    | 5,912  | 63,689  |\n| 1891-92    | 4,110  | 46,383  | 1901-02    | 6,154  | 67,516  |\n| 1892-93    | 4,833  | 51,996  | 1902-03    | 6,538  | 72,628  |\n| 1893-94    | 5,407  | 60,507  | 1903-04    | 6,474  | 73,830  |\n| 1894-95    | 5,701  | 63,914  | 1904-05    | 6,576  | 75,149  |\n| 1895-96    | 5,880  | 65,048  | 1905-06    | 6,545  | 76,370  |\n| 1896-97    | 5,730  | 58,462  | 1906-07    | 6,039  | 81,672  |\n| 1897-98    | 5,750  | 63,741  | 1907-08    | 6,991  | 83,347  |\n| 1898-99    | 5,588  | 60,646  | 1908-09    | 7,163  | 84,646  |\n| 1899-1900  | 5,831  | 63,732  |            |        |         |\n\n---\n\n1 The articles are blood, bones, candles, catgut, chemical preparations, china grass, cocoanut fibre, cotton or cotton refuse and seed, dammer, dynamite, fat, fins, fish, fireworks, flax, fulminate of mercury, gas, gun cotton, gunpowder or blasting powder, hemp, hides, horns, hoofs, hair, jute, kerosine oil, lime, matches for lighting, manure, meat, nitro-glycerine, oil, oilcloth, offal, petroleum oil, paraffin oil, rags, resin, Rangoon or Burma oil, soap, sulphur, saltpetre, spirits, skins, tallow, tar or pitch, tow, turpentine and wool.\nThe demand for the retail sale of kerosine oil is so great that no less than 1309 licenses were issued during the year 1908-09. 1050 places were licensed for sale or storage of timber; 487 places for sale or storage of firewood; 305 places for sale or storage of charcoal; 568 places for sale or storage of matches. Besides these, there are 18 soap factories, 18 silk dyers, 33 sugar refineries, one paper manufactory, 22 lime-kilns, 4 candle manufactories, 185 indigo and other dye-works, and 20 potteries. In all 7163 licenses were issued in 1908-9. Under the Poisons Act of 1866, the Municipal Commissioner was authorised to issue licenses in this respect. But in 1909 the responsibility of the licensing for possession and sale of poisons was by a Government Notification vested in the Commissioner of Police. The conditions and restrictions of these licenses are contained in rules issued by Government under section 2 of the Poisons Act I of 1904. The poisons enumerated in this Act are aconite (bachnag), dhatura, henbane (kharasani ajwan), aux-vomica, (kuchla and kajra), Saint Ignatius' bean (Papita), Calabar bean, white arsenic (Somal), red arsenic (Mansil), yellow arsenic (Hartal), Scheele's green (arsenite of copper), Schweinfurth green (aceto-arsenite of copper, Hirwa), corrosive sublimate (raskapur).\n\nThe precise date of the constitution of a fire-brigade for Fire Brigade. Bombay cannot be definitely stated; but the fact that in 1777 Colonel Lee was allowed Rs. 4 a day \"for his trouble in superintending the fire-engines\" shows that arrangements of some kind were in existence at that date. Judging however by the great havoc and loss caused by the fire of 1803, these arrangements cannot have been very complete. During the greater portion of the nineteenth century the fire-brigade was administered by the Commissioner of Police, the officers and men being members of the ordinary police force; but whereas the European members of the brigade performed police-duty as well as fire-duties, the native portion of the staff was restricted to the work of the brigade only. The chief equipment of the brigade consisted of seven hand-engines, of which the first was purchased in 1840 and the last three were pur-\n\n---\n\n1 Forrest's Selections. Home Series II, 192.\nchased in 1884. In 1859 Government made an attempt to shelve the burden and cost of maintenance of the brigade on to the shoulders of the Municipal Commissioners, but were met by a refusal based upon the terms of Act XXV of 1858: and in 1864 they appointed a commission to enquire into the condition and working of the brigade, which eventually reported that the brigade was under-equipped and under-manned. It was probably in consequence of this report that in 1865 the Bench of Justices, who had by this date become responsible for the cost of the brigade, despatched Mr. Edginton to England to qualify himself for the post of captain of a new steam fire-brigade, and that they appointed Major Henderson, ex-Commissioner of Police, to reorganize the existing arrangements. The equipment at this date comprised six hand-engines and four steam fire-engines, stationed respectively in the Dockyard, Dongri Koli street, Paidhoni, and Kamathipura. The latter were horsed by the now extinct Omnibus Company, which for a monthly contract rate of Rs. 75 per horse undertook to supply one pair of horses and a driver to each engine at any hour of the day or night.\n\nBy 1887 the rapid growth of the city forced the authorities to relieve the European police officers attached to the brigade of all police duties: and from that date the staff became purely a fire-brigade staff, consisting of a Chief Engineer, 3 assistant engineers, 4 firemen, 12 tindals, 60 lascars and 8 coachmen and grooms. The annual cost of maintenance was about Rs. 75,000, and the engines in use numbered 12, of which 8 were hand-engines and 4, stationed at Hornby road, Paidhoni, Upper Duncan road and Byculla, were steam-engines. Two years later (1889) the Municipal Corporation appointed a committee to consider the subject of reorganizing the staff, as a result of which several fresh posts were created, notably that of Chief Officer, to which Mr. W. Nicholls was appointed in 1890. Under his auspices considerable improvements\n\n---\n\n1 Annual Report of the Municipal Commissioner, 1890-91, 323; Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation, 379.\n2 Times of India, 15th June, 1865.\n3 Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation.\n4 Michael's History of the Municipal Corporation.\nhave been effected, among them being the promulgation of a working code, the continual training of the staff, the provision of uniforms, the appointment of a surgeon to the brigade, and the provision of pensions for the staff.\n\nNine fire-brigade stations have been built at Byculla, Babula tank, the Fort, Colaba, DeLisle road, Mahim, Dadar, Mazagon and Bhuleshwar. The present equipment includes, besides various life-saving appliances, one petrol motor-engine, one chemical engine, 8 steam-engines, and 8 hand-engines; while the total number of all ranks in the department is 221, including the Chief Officer, a head foreman, 6 foremen and 9 engineers. The annual cost of the staff amounts to more than Rs. 58,000 and the annual cost of maintaining all the stations in a state of efficiency is estimated at 129 lakhs. The recent addition of a motor-engine has increased the efficiency of the brigade. The engines are located in twelve different places.\n\nDuring the last five years the average annual number of fires was about 100. Of 102 fires in 1908-09, 28 were caused by the careless throwing down of lights, 24 by careless use of lamps and fire, and 28 were due to unknown causes.\n\nThe question of lighting the streets of Bombay was first seriously considered in the year 1833, when a committee, appointed by the Justices of the Peace, decided that the Bench possessed due legal authority to light the streets; and recommended it to invite tenders for the provision of lamps and posts. No steps to this end were however taken till ten years later (1843), when the Bench formally resolved that all available funds should be applied in the first instance to the lighting of the principal streets, as a measure tending to the comfort and security of the inhabitants. By 1853 there were 50 lamps in existence, which were lighted from dusk to midnight throughout the year, excepting on nights of moonlight. The cost of these arrangements worked out to about Rs. 17 per lamp per annum. Six years later (1859) the Bench of Justices recorded\n\n---\n\n1 Apparently there was a doubt whether the Bench of Justices could legally light the streets, and a reference on the point was made to the Supreme Court. Hence the delay.\nits opinion that it was most desirable to light the town with gas, but realizing that the municipal fund was insufficient to defray the cost of such lighting, and at the same time deeming a special tax for the purpose undesirable, the Bench deprecated any definite contract being entered into with the Gas Company. But in 1861, the Municipal Commissioners, with the full approval of the Bench, proposed to ask Government to pass a special enactment enabling the Municipality to appropriate to gas-lighting a portion of the sum annually set apart for the drainage of Bombay. Government agreed to the proposal, and requested the Bench to consider the advisability of raising a loan in preference to the course approved by the Municipal Commissioners. The raising of a loan was approved, and on the 7th October 1865 the first gas-lamps in Bombay were lighted. These lamps were erected along Bhendi Bazaar, the Esplanade and Church Gate street and were lighted during the afternoon, the lamp-lighters being followed by a large crowd of wondering natives. By the end of the year the number of gas-lamps had increased to 220; and the action of the Municipal authorities in this respect was so greatly appreciated that during 1866 several native gentlemen presented the city with large ornamental lamps to be placed in central positions on the public roads.\n\nThe lighting of the town with gas gradually expanded simultaneously with a reduction of cost, which in 1871 worked out to Rs. 8\u00bd per lamp per month. In 1880-81 the total number of street lamps lighted during the year was 3,177 gas and 224 kerosine oil lamps, the illuminating power of the former being equivalent to 12 sperm candles' power. In 1882 the Arthur Crawford market was lighted by electricity; and in the following year the Municipal Corporation entered into an agreement with the Eastern Electric Light and Power Company, under which the Company had the right to lay, conduct and maintain electric cables under, along or over certain of the public streets and roads of the city. The Company however had to go into liquidation in the following year, and for the time being the Crawford Market had again to be lighted with gas.\n\n1 Times of India, October 9th, 1865.\n2 Michael's History of the Corporation.\nquestion of lighting portions of the city by electricity was however again brought forward in 1891, and in 1894 the Corporation sanctioned a certain sum for the provision of additional electric-lighting plant for the municipal offices and Crawford Market. In 1895 the contract with the Gas Company was renewed and contemplated the gradual conversion of the ordinary gas lamps into incandescent lamps\u2014a work which was completed within twelve months of the signing of the contract. The light of the old gas lamp was equivalent to only 14 candle-power, while that of the incandescent lamps, which number 4100, is 30 candle-power. Double, triple, quadruple and quintuple lamps and high power self-intensifying lamps are placed in different spots and at various junctions.\n\nAt the end of the year 1908-09, the total number of gas lamps in the city was 4400, and of kerosine oil lamps 1831, while the cost of the former amounted to 2.8 lakhs and of the latter to Rs. 49,000. In 1906 the Corporation decided to do away with the electric-lighting plant at the Crawford Market, which had been in existence since 1894 and was almost worn out, and to light the markets by high candle-power gas lamps, which have since proved very satisfactory. The electric-lighting of the municipal offices was at the same time provided for by connecting the installation with the supply mains of the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramway Company.\n\nThe first market appears to have been established for the sale of fruit, vegetables and flowers in 1696 within the Fort, and dealers in those commodities were permitted to occupy the market, free of rent or any other impost. In 1769 two large sheds were built within the town walls \"for the public markets to be held in, one for meat and fowls, and the other for fruit and greens,\" and a constable was appointed to attend the sheds with an allowance of 4 annas a day. During the administration of Mr. Hornby (1776-84), a market known as Mahomed's market was established, which was destroyed by fire (probably the great fire of 1803), and subsequently rebuilt in 1809 during the governorship of Mr. Jonathan Duncan. This market was\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Courier of 3rd November 1846.\n2 Bombay Gazetteer Materials, Part II, 72.\nopen to all descriptions of persons dealing in vegetables, fruit and flowers, free from any tax, fee, *dasturi* or other emolument whatsoever\". A mutton market was erected in 1794 at a cost of Rs. 2,940; and in 1803, after the great fire, a site in the Fort known as the Governor's old horse-stable was converted into a mutton and vegetable market. About 1837 a market for fruit and vegetables was erected at Erskine road, and about the same date the Court of Petty Sessions appointed a clerk of the markets to supervise generally the sale of all commodities, and prevent their being disposed of to purchasers in the public streets. Other centres gradually sprang into existence until in 1865 Bombay contained the following markets, yielding no revenue:\u2014The Green or Duncan market in Sheik Memon street, consisting of ranges of low tiled open sheds, badly paved and undrained. The Boribandar Mutton and Fish market, unpaved, and including a yard belonging to a neighbouring mutton slaughterhouse. The Beef market in the yard of the slaughterhouse in Butcher street, midway between the two markets above-mentioned. A private market in Abdul Rahiman street of a most insanitary character. The Mutton and Fish market in Nall bazaar. The Vegetable market in Nall bazaar. An enclosure in Mody street for the provision of the North Fort, constructed in 1847 at a cost of Rs. 1,655.\n\nThe slaughter-houses of the city at the same date were, if possible, less sanitary than the markets. Situated\n\n---\n\n1 This was the inscription on the wall of the market. (Bombay Courier, 3rd November 1846). It was known as the Green Market or Duncan Market.\n2 Michael, 485.\n3 Bombay Gazetteer Materials, Part II, 74.\n4 Bombay Courier of 17th December 1836. Captain Seely writing in 1825 (Wonders of India) remarked:\u2014\"The markets at Bombay are well supplied, and for the most part the articles are of moderate price. The fish are excellent, vegetables are abundant and good, poultry is reared by the Portuguese in great quantities and sold cheap. The bread is said by strangers to be preferable to that made in any other part of India.\"\n5 Michael, 478-479. Report on the sanitary state of the island of Bombay, 1864, p. 24.\n6 \"The Bread Market, as it was styled, was quite a feature of Bazaar Gate street. It might have been more appropriately named 'Breakfast Bazar,' as here were sold not only bread, but all the other ordinary requisites of the breakfast table, such as butter, tea, sugar and eggs. It may be noted that here the dealers in\n(one in Mandvi and the other at Boribandar,) they were of the most antiquated pattern, one of them being a mere shed built on stakes below high water-mark, from which the blood and offal streamed on to the mud of the foreshore, where it was left to putrefy for several hours.\n\nIn 1865 the Municipal Commissioner, Mr. Arthur Crawford, set himself to remedy this condition of affairs. A plot of ground was obtained from Government, and a general market, now known as the Arthur Crawford market, was erected. The Erskine road and Fort markets were also opened in the same year. In 1893 three more markets were built to meet the wants of the people living in different localities and four others were subsequently erected, while proper slaughter-houses were erected at Bandora outside the limits of the island. At present (1909) the city contains 12 municipal markets, the chief of which are the Arthur Crawford market, the Erskine road (or Nall Bazaar) market and the Bhuleshwar market.\n\nThe Arthur Crawford market is built upon a triangular plot of land, bounded by the Carnac, Paltan and Esplanade roads, and presented by Government to the city in 1865. The market, which was completely opened in 1869, consists of three divisions, the green and general market with the Superintendent's office, residence and the clock-tower being situated on the north-west, the godowns, purveying-shops and fowl-rooms on the south, and the\n\neggs were all Parsis. The general price was one pie for two eggs, whereas now an egg cannot be had for less than two pies. Some of the egg vendors thrived so well that they became men of substance. The Bread market was so close, ill-paved and dirty, that the Municipality of the present day would not tolerate it for a moment. At some distance from it, at Modikhana, was the principal market of the Fort. It is now held under one roof; but fifty years ago it consisted of a range of low shops in rows, the intervening open space being utilized by squatters retailing fish and vegetables. Unlike the Bread market, it was clean and well kept. The question of its removal was a vexed one many years ago. But the central situation was so very convenient to the inhabitants of the Fort that they sent a deputation, myself being one of the number, to the Governor appealing against its removal, with the result that, through various vicissitudes, the old market has stood its ground to this day.\" (Mr. K. N. Kabraji's Reminiscences in the Times of India, 1901).\n\n* The fruit and vegetable section was opened on the 16th January 1868 and the beef market in 1869. The reclamation of the site, which was very low-lying, was commenced in March 1867, and the foundations were begun in July of that year.\nmutton and beef markets on the east. The markets were completed at a cost of Rs. 19,49,700 and are lighted by incandescent gas. The market contains altogether 888 rent-producing compartments, including 29 fowl-rooms and 28 purveyors' shops and godowns, out of which 765 were occupied in 1909. The income of the market from rents and fees amounted in 1909 to Rs. 1,04,000. Excluding the Superintendent and an assistant, who have duties connected with all the markets on the island, the staff of the Arthur Crawford market comprises an inspector of meat, an inspector, 2 naiks, 8 peons, 31 labourers, one gardener, and six police ramosis (watchmen). There is also a general inspector on the market establishment who performs multifarious duties under instructions from the Superintendent. The market is open from 3-45 a.m. to 10 p.m., the busy hours in the morning being from 5-30 to 10, and from 4 to 7-30 in the evening.\n\nThe green and general market is divided into a fruit section and vegetable section, the central portion being surmounted by a tower, 120 feet high, containing a clock which is illuminated at night. The fruit section is in the masonry wing and contains 171 stalls, the larger number of which are reserved for fruit and the rest for flowers, pan-sapari, herbs, plantains, lemons and plantain leaves. The vegetable section is in the iron wing and contains 401 stalls, some of which are regular woodwork shops running the whole length of the building. Here are sold vegetables of all kinds, flour, grain, bread, butter, oilman-stores, Indian and English biscuits, confectionery, spices, groceries, tobacco, sugar, molasses, dates, stationery, cutlery, hosiery, boots, shoes and fancy goods. An ornamental drinking fountain, designed by Mr. J. Lockwood Kipling and presented by the late Mr. Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney, stands in the angle of the two wings.\n\nThe mutton and beef markets are situated on the other side of the central garden, and are divided into three sections:\u2014the Mundi or head bazaar, the fish and mutton market and the beef market. The mutton is brought\n\n---\n\n1 Some of the stalls are of stone, some of wood. In the latter shelves and iron rails are provided for the display of fruit.\n2 Of these one is reserved as a Hindu tea-shop, two or three are let to shroffs, and a few to sweetmeat sellers.\nfrom Bandora; the fish section contains 119 stalls, more than half of which are reserved for the sale of Indian salted fish. The stalls are in four rows, and are made of masonry covered with Yorkshire flagging. The market has accommodation for 250 fishmongers, and has an eating-house and shroff's shop attached to it.* The right of occupying the fish area is farmed out every year. The beef market, which is an iron-building in the form of a cross, contains 84 iron stalls.\n\nThe fowl-sheds to the south of the vegetable and fruit sections number 26, of which 6 are reserved for the sale of imported animals and birds, and the remainder for poultry. Three of the fowl-sheds are generally used by the purveyors of the markets. The godowns likewise number 26, out of which 2 are reserved for the use of the market department. At the western end is a covered weighing-shed, where consignments are first tested before\n\n---\n\n* Cattle destined for the meat-supply of the city are procured from all parts of the Presidency and collected in the fair-ground of the slaughter-houses at Bandora for examination. Forty-eight hours are allowed to elapse before inspection, when the healthy animals are transferred to the stock-yard and thence, after a further careful inspection, to the slaughter-houses. The slaughtering is usually performed late in the afternoon, and by 9 or 10 p.m. the carcasses are cleaned and dressed. Occasionally as many as 150 head of cattle and 150 sheep and goats are killed in a day. By 10-30 p.m. the meat has been packed in special meat vans, with a carrying capacity of 14 tons each drawn by heavy draught-bullocks, which cost about Rs. 300 a piece, and before midnight the vans (16 beef vans and 19 mutton vans) set off to Bombay through the Mahim woods. The meat arrives at the markets about 3-30 a.m. and is again inspected before sale. When the markets were first opened the meat was brought into Bombay by a special train, in which the beef vans were separated from the mutton-vans by three carriages for coolies, but this system was found inconvenient and the bullock-vans were substituted. The Municipality in 1903 purchased a motor-van which proved tolerably successful, and added a second in 1907. The former can contain about 250 carcasses, and the trailers attached to the latter about 160 apiece.\n\n\u2020 The fish supply is almost entirely a local monopoly. A certain quantity comes from Dauda, Varsova, Bassein, Virar, Bhayndar, Bandora and Kurla in the Thana District, and during the monsoon a good deal is hauled down in ice from Bulsar and Billimora in Gujarat. Otherwise, and during the fair season, the fishing-castes of Bombay supply all the fish for the market, after landing their haul at Colaba, Chaupati, Mazagon, Matunga, Vartli, Sion and Mahim.\nbeing distributed to the stalls for retail sale. The enclosure is laid out as a garden with a handsome fountain in the centre.\n\nThe Bhuleshwar market is built upon the site of an old private market for fruit and vegetables, which was burnt down in 1868. It comprises 164 stalls reserved exclusively for the sale of fruit and vegetables, and is supervised by an inspector, who is also in charge of the Fort and Colaba markets. The staff consists of a sub-inspector, 2 peons and 3 labourers. The stall-holders are chiefly Hindus, with a sprinkling of Muhammadans, while from 40 to 60 vegetable sellers are allowed to squat daily in the market at a fee of 2 annas per seat per diem. The Nall Bazaar or Erskine road market was opened in 1867 and enlarged in 1887. It is divided into (a) the old fruit and vegetable market, (b) the new fruit and vegetable section, (c) the mutton market and (d) the fish market. The fish market, which is in charge of a fish contractor, contains an ice and aerated water shop, a shop for the sale of country-salt, and places for shroffs to do business. This market caters for the poorer classes, and is supervised by an inspector, who is also in charge of the Foras road and Pedder markets, a sub-inspector, 7 peons and 17 labourers. The Fort market, constructed in 1867, contains two sections, one for fruit and vegetables and the other for fish and mutton, and is provided with 2 peons, 1 ramosi and 3 labourers. The Colaba market comprises two similar sections, and is in charge of 2 peons and 3 labourers, working under the Bhuleshwar market inspector. The other markets are the Pedder market, which contains a pork section; the Foras road market, which sells fruit, vegetables and mutton; the pork market at Sonapur, which also contains a slaughter-house, and is patronised chiefly by Native Christians and Chinese; the DeLisle road\n\n---\n\n1 The first consignments arrive at the market in the afternoon. The produce is weighed for a small fee, and the business of \"the man with the scales\" is so brisk that between Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 7,000 are paid every year for the privilege of doing this work. The scale-man is known to be honest and many a cultivator up-country, who has no agent in Bombay, consigns his produce to him for sale; and on the day of sale a khundi with the brokerage deducted, is despatched in return. By 7 a.m. the stalls are replete with the choicest Indian fruits.\nmarket for the sale of live sheep and goats, brought in from the fair ground at Bandora for slaughter in private premises; and the Fergusson road market for the sale of vegetables, fish and mutton. Since 1908 the Parbhadevi road and Elphinstone road markets have been opened.\n\nThere are, besides the municipal markets, 16 private markets in Bombay which have been licensed under the provisions of the Municipal Act. Of these the Adamji Pirbhai market, which has existed for twenty-three years, occupies a site once covered by the buildings of the Indo-British Institute. It is situated in Lohar Chal street and comprises a fish market, capable of accommodating about 60 fisher-people who are charged 3 pice per basket twice a day, and a vegetable market containing 52 stalls, the daily rents of which vary from 1\u00bd to 4 annas. Part of the ground-floor of a building facing the market is let out for mutton stalls, for which a daily charge of 2 annas per stall is made. The ground-floors of most of the buildings surrounding the market are let out as shops, godowns and dwellings. The owner of this market is Sir Adamji Pirbhai, Kt., who devotes the income of the market to defraying the expenses of the Adamji Pirbhai sanitarium at the corner of Charni road. The Chira Bazaar market in Girgaum road, which is the joint property of four Muhammadan brothers, contains 16 mutton stalls, 24 vegetable stalls, and room for 32 fish-sellers. There are also 6 shops facing the public road outside. The rents charged for the sale of mutton, vegetables and fish are respectively 2\u00bd annas per stall per diem, 2 annas per stall, and 1 to 1\u00bd annas per basket twice a day. The Don Tar market, situated at the corner of Jackaria Masjid street and 1st Chinchbunder road, has been in existence for 45 years, and comprises 8 mutton stalls, 2 mincing stalls, 10 vegetable stalls, and 8 outside shops. The Umarkhadi market in the street of the same name contains 12 mutton stalls, 30 vegetable stalls, and 12 outside shops for the sale of cocoa-nuts, supari, groceries, etc.;\nbut owing to the fact that the property is in the hands of the Receiver, High Court, most of these stalls are vacant. The Khetwadi main road market, situated at the corner of Khetwadi main road and 1st Parsiwada street and built in 1874, contains a small number of vegetable and mutton stalls, which are let out to the butcher attached to the market for Rs. 3 per diem; while the Byculla market (also called the Guzri Bazaar), which was built in 1859, is devoted to the sale of mutton, vegetables and fruit and contains about a dozen stalls, which fetch from 2 annas to Rs. 1/4 a day. A certain amount of fish is also sold here in the morning. Other private markets are the Haines road or Agripada market, built in 1873 for the sale of mutton, fish, and vegetable; the Tank Bandar market; the Parel road fruit and vegetable market, known locally as Dhondi Meher's market, which charges one pice per basket, bundle or bag of each commodity introduced for sale; the Parel Chal market at Lalwadi, formerly owned by Mr. Fazulbhoy Visram, C.I.E., for the sale of mutton, fish and vegetables; the Bhoiwada market, which has been in existence for nearly half a century; the Parel village market, in which the rates for stalls vary from Rs. 4 to Rs. 6 per mensem according to the character of the commodity sold; the Upper Mahim market in Mahim Bazaar road, the Dadar market, which is let by the owner on contract for Rs. 10/4 per diem; and the Vadala market which is a mere shed, in which squatters pay a daily fee of \u00bd an anna per seat for the night to sell vegetables and fish. It also contains a mutton shop.\n\nThe letting of stalls in the Municipal markets rests with the Superintendent of Markets subject in certain cases to the sanction of the Municipal Commissioner. The principal market day in Bombay is Sunday, when the mills and offices are closed, and people are therefore free to make their purchases for the week. Articles of a perishable nature are exposed for sale as long as they remain in good condition, after which the stall holders usually dispose of them to hawkers, who sell them cheap in the streets of the city. Any quantity not disposed of in this manner is thrown away. Fruit and vegetable growers\nup-country either consign their produce to Bombay for sale on commission or sell the right of removal to Bombay merchants who make their own arrangements for transport. Meat and fish, unfit for consumption, are seized and destroyed under the provisions of the Municipal Act. The stall-holders and the butchers in all the\n\n---\n\n1 The fruit and vegetable supply of Bombay is drawn from a wide area. Nagpur, Poona and Ahmadnagar supply oranges and sweet limes; Poona, Nasik, Karachi, Quetta and Kabul supply grapes between August and February; while apples are sent from Varsova between June and August, from Kashmir between September and March, from Bangalore between July and August and from Colombo and Kabul between March and July. Excellent apples are obtainable from Kulu, but the trade is hampered by heavy railway rates; while small consignments of American and Australian apples are sometimes seen, which sell for as much as Rs. 4 and Rs. 5 per dozen. Pine-apples come from Chaut, Billimoria Harnai, Goa and Singapore, throughout the year, while custard apples are grown partly in the city and are partly obtained from Poona, Aurangabad and Surat between September and November. Plantains, yellow, green and red, are imported in thousands from Bassein, Surat and the local carts and gardens; peaches are furnished between July and October by Panchgani, Mahabaleshwar, Poona, Karachi, Quetta and Peshawar; while between February and June there is an enormous import of figs from the Deccan. The strawberries of Mahabaleshwar, which are obtainable between February and May, have earned a well-deserved reputation, and occasionally one may purchase excellent consignments of mangosteens from the Straits. Perhaps the most popular fruit is the mango, particularly those grown in Bombay itself. The Aphoos (Alfonso) variety comes from the gardens of the city and from Ratnagiri between March and June, while the Pairi (Pereira) variety is imported from Thana, Bankot, Surat, Bangalore and Madras, the Thana, Bankot and Surat consignments appearing in March-June, and the rest between June and August. The melons of Kabul command a large sale, as also do the water-melons of the Presidency.\n\nThe Bombay Presidency supplies most of the vegetables sold daily in the markets, but a considerable quantity comes from more distant places. Potatoes, for example, are sent from the Nilgiris in September-November, from Australia in August-December, from Mahabaleshwar in November-February, from Poona in September December, from Cawnpore in December-March, from Gujarat in April and May, and from Karachi in December-February. Cabbages, beans and peas for the city's consumption are grown chiefly in the Deccan and Gujarat, but a certain quantity of cabbages are raised from Bengal and of peas from the United Provinces. Onions are sent from Poona, Nasik, Thana, and Khanda, as also are cucumbers, cauliflowers, and pumpkins; while purely Indian vegetables like bhindi and brinjal are either locally grown or imported from neighboring districts.\n\nFlowers are a feature of the Arthur Crawford market. Poona and the Deccan supply most of the roses and other flowers that appeal most to the western eye, while such flowers as the Hindu prefers, the jasmine, the champak, and the sweet-smelling creepers, are supplied by Bombay and the places in the immediate vicinity.\nMunicipal markets, the Phadkari's and the Kamatsis of the DeLisle road sheep market and the butchers in all private markets are licensed under this Act. Other dealers including fowl-dealers and squatters, are under the jurisdiction of the fish-contractors. The rentals of stalls in all markets, except the DeLisle road and Fort markets and the pork-stalls and fowl-rooms, are payable quarterly. The tenants of the fowl-rooms pay a monthly rent; the pork-stall holders pay annually; and all stall-holders in the two markets above-mentioned pay half-yearly. Standard weights and measures are preserved in the office of the Superintendent of Markets, and provision has been made for the comparison, verification and stamping of all weights and measures used in the municipal markets.\n\nThe oldest public gardens in Bombay are the Victoria Gardens, which in 1861 were laid out on the Mount Estate, Mazagon (now included in Byculla), and stocked with plants from the garden of the Agri-Horticultural Society of Western India at Sewri. The latter society was formed in 1830 under the auspices of Sir Sidney Beckwith, then Commander-in-Chief and Acting Governor of the Bombay Presidency, with the object of encouraging agriculture and horticulture in Western India. In 1835 the Society acquired land at Sewri, which was laid out as a garden by Colonel Dickinson and Dr. Heddle, assisted by an expert European gardener, and was, after the grant of further areas in 1837 and 1840, finally established in 1842 by Dr. Buist and Dr. Giraud, the former carrying out the general arrangement of the land, and the latter organizing the botanical section. The Sewri garden\n\n---\n\n1 Of the poultry sold in Bombay, the fowls and chickens are mostly imported from Kolaba, Thana, Katnagiri, Gujarat, Nasik and Hyderabad; ducks come from Bassein, Goa and the Kaveri district of the Madras Presidency or are locally purchased; Nasik, Ahmadnagar, Poona and Ahmadabad supply pigeons; while turkeys and guinea-fowls are procured from Ahmadabad, Jubbulpore and Allahabad. Game birds, such as teal, quail, snipe and wild duck are procured from Thana and neighbouring districts; wild partridges are brought down from the Deccan during the open season.\n\n2 The first President of the Society was Mr. Newham and the first Secretaries Mr. Vanhill and Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy. The expenditure of the Society was met by subscriptions, public donations and grants from Government.\nwas maintained until 1862, when its plants were transferred to the Victoria Gardens, the charge and direction of which were vested in the Agri-Horticultural Society until 1873, when the Society ceased to exist. Since that date the Victoria Gardens have belonged to the Municipal Corporation, while the old Sewri garden has since 1863 been used as a European cemetery. The Victoria Gardens comprise about 50 acres, cost Rs. 74,000 annually in maintenance, and produce an annual income of about Rs. 9,000. The annual number of visitors is estimated at nearly 1,700,000.\n\nOther gardens in charge of the Municipality are the Elphinstone Circle garden, laid out in 1869, covering 12,081 square yards and costing annually more than Rs. 1,600; the Falkland road garden, laid out in 1870, covering 3,003 square yards and costing annually Rs. 420; and the Northbrook Garden in Grant road, which was laid out in 1874 in honour of the visit of the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook. This garden covers 12,085 square yards, was laid out at a cost of nearly Rs. 21,000 and annually costs about Rs. 1,500 for upkeep. The Sir Cowasji Jehangir garden at Mori road, Mahim, was made in 1876, comprises 5,272 square yards and is maintained at an annual cost of Rs 628; and much the same cost is incurred on account of the Bazaar Gate garden in Hornby road, measuring 3,672 square yards, which was handed over by Government to the Municipality in 1881. Dick's Tank garden, which covers 2,740 square yards on the Parel road, was formed in 1884, and the gardens on Ridge road, Malabar Hill, comprising 52,675 square yards, in 1885, the approximate annual expenditure on them being respectively Rs. 400 and Rs. 700.\n\n\"The English have only a burying place called Mendenham's Point, from the first man's name there interred, where are some few tombs that make a pretty show at entering the haven\". This remark, made by Dr. Fryer in 1675, is the earliest reference to burial grounds in Bombay island: and the ground so mentioned, together with a\n\n---\n\n1 For further information, See Victoria Gardens, under Places and Objects of Interest.\nnarrow strip outside St. Thomas' Cathedral, were the only English cemeteries in Bombay until 1760, when Government decided on strategic considerations to demolish all the buildings and tombs at Mendham's Point, and open a new cemetery at Sonapur (on the present Queen's road). The actual site of Mendham's Point was the area now occupied by a portion of the Sailor's Home and the Crescent, and extended as far as the junction of the present Wodehouse and Colaba causeway roads. Apparently only Protestants had the right of burying their dead here, the Roman Catholic burial ground being within the limits of the town until 1740, when the Roman Catholic Bishop obtained by exchange a site outside the town walls. Other communities in these early days had their own sites for the disposal of the dead, notably the Banias from Diu whom Gerald Aungier permitted in 1677 to burn their dead, presumably on the shore of Back Bay, the Parsis whose first tower of silence was built on Malabar hill in about 1672, and the Muhammadans, whose ancient burial-ground may still be seen on Queen's road adjoining the Sonapur cemetery.\n\nBy 1760 the buildings outside the Apollo Gate had become dangerous as affording possible cover to an enemy, and the principal engineer, in his search for a more suitable spot for the disposal of the European dead, discovered in Sonapur \"a cocoanut garden near the water-side at the nether end of the Moormen's (i.e. Muhammadans) old burying ground,\" which was shortly afterwards walled in by order of Government, and was from 1763 until 1867, utilized as the European cemetery. Burials in St. Thomas church and yard ceased entirely in September 1762. Adjoining the Sonapur cemetery were the Portuguese cemeteries \"which had been in use for centuries;\" the Hindu burning-ground and a burial-ground for low-caste Hindus, while\n\n---\n\n1 A piece of land in Marine Lines, now covered with buildings, was also used as a cemetery until 1783.\n2 Many bones were discovered at the time of digging the foundations of the Sailors' Home.

By the time it was closed more than 19,000 persons had been buried in Sonapur.\nit was a common practice to use the foreshore of Back Bay for the interment of the carcases of cattle and other carrion.\\footnote{Bombay City Census Report, 1881.} It can well be imagined therefore that by 1855, the juxtaposition and constant use of these cemeteries had given rise to serious complaints both from the public and the municipal authorities, who declared that the high mortality of the Girgaum section at seasons when cholera was epidemic was primarily due to the miasmata wafted from the cemeteries and mortuaries on the Back Bay foreshore.\\footnote{Dr. Leith's Mortuary Report for 1854.} Other parts of the city were hardly more sanitary; for in addition to the general and highly dangerous practice in vogue among Brahmins, and other high-class Hindus of burying the corpses of still-born or newly-born children in the courtyards or under the bathing-places of their own dwellings, there were by 1855 at least seventy different places of interment situated in the very heart of the more populous quarters.\n\nIn the hope of remedying these evils, the Board of Conservancy requested the Senior Magistrate of Police in 1854 to draft a Bill prohibiting burial in the congested parts of the town; and in 1855, under the directions of Government, he issued orders for the total and immediate discontinuance of all interments in the sands of Back Bay. These steps were followed in 1863 by the appointment of a Burial Commission, which two years later submitted a comprehensive scheme for the concentration of all cemeteries at or near Matunga. The project, including the constructional cost of Towers of Silence and the provision of railway communication was estimated to require an expenditure of 47\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lakhs. The cost involved being prohibitive, it was reserved for the Municipal Commissioner, Mr. Crawford, in 1865 to make the best arrangements he could for the closing of old cemeteries and the opening of new grounds. His first step was to obtain from Mr. Bomanji Framji Cama the old Agri-Horticultural Society's Garden at Sewri, which Mr. Cama had purchased in 1866, and to lay it out as a cemetery for Europeans of the Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Scotch Presbyterian churches. The land, which measured 52,000 square yards, was formally consecrated and opened in March, 1867, from which date...\nthe old Christian cemeteries in Sonapur, Marine Lines and Girgaum were finally closed. For the Native Christians and Portuguese communities a new site was purchased at Matunga for Rs. 8,000 in 1866; the old Colaba cemetery, which had been in use since 1816, was closed in 1872; the American cemetery in Grant road, which had been opened in 1813, was relinquished about the same date in favour of a new site at Antop hill; and new cemeteries were opened at Matunga, on land granted for the purpose by Government, for the Brahma Samaj, the Armenians, low-caste Hindus, and a section of the Jewish Community.\n\nThe general condition of Hindu cemeteries and burning-ghats was also improved, as the result of a meeting of the Hindu Justices of the Peace convened in 1871; the Muhammadans were induced to wall in their cemetery at Back Bay in the same year; and in 1875 the system of burying the Hindu dead by contract in the cemetery on the Flats was finally abolished. Thus by 1881 the efforts of the Municipality had resulted in most of the old and insanitary graveyards being closed and in 19 registered burning-grounds and 40 registered burial-grounds being opened at suitable distances from the city proper.\n\nSince that date a large plot of land at Tank bandar has been allocated (in 1897) to the Sunni Muhammadans; the Bene-Israel were granted a burial-ground at Mount road, Mazagon, in the same year; and in 1903-04 two new cemeteries were opened in Narelwadi at the junction of the Mount and Victoria roads for the use of the Ismaili Momin and Daudi Bohra communities. In 1905-06 two more cemeteries were provided, one at Antop hill for the Babi community, and the other at Haines road for the Dhed caste. At the present date there are 73 burning and burial-grounds in use in the island, of which 31 are used by Hindus, 25 by Muhammadans, 9 by Christians, 3 by Jews, 2 by Chinese, 1 by Japanese, and 2 (Towers of Silence) by Parsis.\n\nTHE BOMBAY PORT TRUST.\n\nUp to 1863 all public duties connected with the management of the harbour and its pilotage were divided among\n\n---\n\n1 The Marine Lines cemetery had been in use since May 1826. The Colaba cemetery was closed in 1872; but four burials in family vaults were allowed after that date. Matunga cemetery was in use from 1820 to 1873.\nseveral departments and offices of Government. The Government Secretariat in both the Public Works and Marine departments, the office of the Superintendent of Marine, the Master Attendant, the Commissioner of Customs and the Chief Magistrate, all played a part in the control of the port and its shipping, the official most directly concerned being the Master Attendant, who collected the port-dues, leviable under Act XXXI of 1857, and who, originally an officer of the Government Dockyard under the immediate control of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, was subsequently by a Government order of June 28th, 1859, made responsible to the Commissioner of Customs, was relieved of his duties in the Dockyard, and was placed in direct control of the pilot establishment and of the collection of shipping-dues. This system continued until 1863, when in consequence of the demand by the public and by the Chamber of Commerce for the better lighting of the harbour and for increased efficiency in the pilot-service, a Harbour and Pilotage Board, composed of five members, was created, which, placed in sole control of the Port and Pilotage funds, was empowered to place buoys and beacons in the harbour, to erect buildings, light-houses, etc., in the interests of the port, to employ and discharge pilots, and to make regulations for the efficient discharge of all duties connected with the port. The Master Attendant was appointed chief executive officer for carrying out the regulations of the Board. The Board remained in existence until the date of the formation of the Port Trust, which superseded it; and although it evinced considerable zeal in the improvement of the navigation of the harbour, it was throughout the whole\n\n---\n\n1 Sir Bartle Frere's speech at the laying of the corner-stone of Kenney Lighthouse on the 19th January 1867. (Report of the Harbour and Pilotage Board, 1873). The Times of India of the 22nd May, 1841, mentions a Dock Committee, which held weekly meetings to discuss the affairs of the port and the issue of the same paper for the 3rd January, 1846, mentions a Committee appointed to frame Port regulations.\n\n2 The first members of the Board were Mr. George Inverarity, Commissioner of Customs, as President, Captain Young, Indian Navy, as Vice-President, Mr. H. Forman, merchant; Mr. A. Gompert, elected by the Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. A. Grant, selected by Lloyd's Agents in Bombay. In 1866 the Executive Engineer to the Municipality was added as an extra member to the Board.\nperiod seriously handicapped by lack of funds. It commenced work in 1864 with no balance to its credit, inasmuch as a sum of 13 lakhs standing to the credit of the Port Fund at that date was appropriated by Government for the Mody Bay reclamation, while the only property vested in it by the Government regulation consisted of the light-houses at Colaba and Dolphin Rock, two light-vessels, nine pilot-boats, a conservator's boat, three signal-stations at Colaba, Centre hill and the Castle, and a boat-shed. In spite of these drawbacks, however, the Board contrived to extend the Mazagon pier, to improve the Apollo pier by segregating the cotton-traffic and constructing a foot-path for pedestrians, to mark the shoals in the harbour, to supply pilot-schooners, and to purchase in England a first-class life-boat and rocket life-saving apparatus. They also erected the Kennery light-house, which absorbed nearly two lakhs out of the 8\u00bd lakhs, expended upon harbour improvements. The total receipts of the Board for the nine years ending 1871-72 amounted to 36\u00bd lakhs and the expenditure for the same period to 38 lakhs, the receipts being chiefly port dues, measuring fees, salvage proceeds and pilotage funds; and in connection with this deficit the Board wrote to Government in 1872, urging the latter very strongly to grant the Board certain further sources of income, which were at that date appropriated to the revenue authorities. Government however were unable to comply with the Board's request; and it is conceivable, therefore, that further improvements in the administration of the port would have been indefinitely postponed, or would have at least proceeded very slowly, had not external circumstances impressed upon Government the need of a properly constituted and suitably financed Port Trust.\n\nThe decision to constitute a Board of Trustees for the administration of the affairs of the Port of Bombay originated in the apprehension on the part of the Bombay Government that trade-interests were seriously endangered by the possession by private companies of a monopoly of the landing and shipping facilities of the port. This apprehension was particularly felt in the case of the\nElphinstone Land and Press Company, so named after Lord Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, which was originally formed in 1858 for the reclamation of the foreshore, the construction of godowns for merchandise and the erection of a cotton-press. The company commenced operations by taking over a lease for 990 years of a piece of waste ground at Naoroji hill, subsequently known as the Elphinstone bandar, the frontage of which was on the line of road now called Clive street; and it subsequently acquired two adjoining properties to the south of Elphinstone bandar, known as the Clare and Carnac bandars, the frontage of which, situated about halfway between Frere and Argyle roads, extended southwards as far as the present Carnac Bridge road. In 1862 the company entered into an agreement with Government to provide upwards of one hundred acres for the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway and other purposes, receiving in return the right to reclaim from the sea for their own advantage an area of 250 acres, fronting the properties they had previously acquired. By 1871 more than seven million cubic yards of material had been deposited, a land and dock estate had been laid out, comprising for the land estate more than one hundred acres of building-plots, nine miles of roads, and ten miles of drains; and for the dock-estate about 71 acres of wharf, about six acres of sheds, two miles of permanent wharf-wallings, forming two basins and one bandar at which there was six feet of water at extreme low-water spring-tides, and about one and a half miles of temporary walling.\n\nFrom the commercial point of view the bargain of 1862 appeared prima facie very favourable to Government. They conceded what to them, in its natural state, was quite valueless, and in return obtained property estimated to have cost more than Rs. 50,00,000 to reclaim, which they were bound to provide for the railway. Yet politically the bargain was a mistake; for the company secured a monopoly of the harbour-frontage opposite that point in the native town where the country-trade had for years centred, and, owing to the proximity of the railway terminus, were also in a position to subject a large portion of the trade of the port to wharfage and other dues. Shortly\nafter the contract had been signed the outbreak of the American war and the consequent stimulus afforded to the cotton industry ushered in an unexampled era of prosperity for Bombay. The company, which was under the management of Messrs. Nicol and Co., an enterprising local firm, set to work with their able engineer, Mr. Ormiston, to carry out their contract, and up to 1865 displayed an almost feverish vigour in the prosecution of the work. Gangs of Chinese labourers were imported, a fleet of barges was constructed on the most approved principles to bring earth from the other side of the harbour, and a regular service of trains was established to bring in material from Kurla in Salsette. Everything was done that a combination of capital, skill and energy could effect. In the meanwhile the speculation mania rose to its height, shares in companies of all kinds commanded ridiculously high prices, and, in common with those of the wildest schemes, the shares of this bona fide company reached quite a fabulous premium\u2014at one time as high as Rs. 1,80,000. The time of prosperity was not of long duration, and the hour of humiliation was at hand. Consequent mainly upon the cessation of the American war, and partly upon the extent to which insane speculation had been carried, the whole trade of Bombay temporarily collapsed and commercial ruin became general. The property of the Elphinstone Company did not escape the general depreciation, and its shares fell to 50 per cent. discount. Meanwhile the Company had almost completed their agreement with Government; and out of a subscribed capital of Rs. 2,16,00,000, a sum of Rs. 1,28,00,000 had at this date been paid up and nearly all expended. In the state of affairs, which characterized the year 1866-67, the company considered it impossible to call in the remainder of the subscribed capital; and, being in considerable difficulties, they applied to Government for assistance, which ultimately resulted in the loan to them of Rs. 10,00,000.\n\nAt this juncture, the Government of Sir Seymour Fitz-Gerald (1867) strongly urged upon the Government of India the advisability of buying out the company, and of placing the administration of the harbour foreshore, thus regained, in the hands of a public trust. After a correspondence extending over two years, the Secretary of State in June\n1869 sanctioned the proposals of the Local Government, which *inter alia* provided (1) that the Elphinstone property should be acquired and, together with the whole of the foreshore of Bombay harbour, within limits defined by the Bombay Government and so far as it was the property of Government, and all wharves, the property of Government within the same limits, excluding any portion required for public administrative purposes, should be made over for administration to a Board of Management constituted under a legislative enactment; (2) that the Board thus constituted should be debited with the whole sum paid to the Elphinstone Company and the costs of the transfer, with a capital sum representing twenty years' purchase of all existing income, then derived by Government from the whole property, and thirdly with the whole outlay incurred by Government from the year 1815 in the reclamation of land made over to the Board or for wharves or other conveniences, so made over, from which income was not obtained; (3) that the Board should be vested with the right of levying wharfage and other fees and dues and of receiving rents on all the property made over to them; (4) that the Board should pay interest to Government at 4\u00bd per cent. per annum on the capital debt; and (5) that the Board should be authorized and required to levy such rates on shipping entering the port and on goods landed or shipped, as should, in addition to the wharfage rates, fees, rents and the other income of the Board, after paying all necessary charges, suffice to supply the sum due to Government for interest on the debt and for its liquidation in a term of years.\n\nOn receipt of these orders, Government entered into negotiation for the purchase of the Elphinstone Company's rights. The market-price of the shares which, following the collapse of 1865, had fallen to Rs. 505, had revived considerably, and in February 1869, was quoted at Rs. 810, which subsequently rose to Rs. 920 and again to Rs. 1,030 per share. In July 1869, it was finally agreed to purchase the Company's rights at the par value of the paid-up capital; the Company went into voluntary liquidation; and an Act (No. V of 1870) was passed by the Government of India empowering the liquidators\nto transfer the property to the Secretary of State in consideration of the payment of the purchase-money in 4 per cent. Government of India stock, such stock to be issued and calculated at Rs. 100 for every Rs. 93 of the purchase-money. On these terms, the Company's property was taken over by Government on the 30th April, 1870, and the price amounted altogether to nearly 186 lakhs, including 13 lakhs previously advanced by Government. The stock issued was treated as an addition to the Government of India 4 per cent. loan of the 1st May 1865, and was subsequently converted into promissory notes of that loan. In October 1870, in furtherance of the proposal for the formation of a Board of Trustees, and in order to provide funds for the payment of interest on the debt created by purchase of the Elphinstone property, an Act was passed by the Bombay Legislative Council authorizing the levy of wharfage and other fees for landing and shipping goods at the Government bandars, wharves and landing-places. Up to that date the Government wharves were used practically free of charge, rates being levied only for goods not removed within the prescribed time. Rates became leviable under the new Act with effect from the 1st March, 1871.\n\nThe Act, constituting the Board of Trustees, was not passed until 1873; but in the meantime the whole of the property purchased from the company was managed by a department of Government on behalf of the Trust from the 1st May 1870. During this interregnum, some progress was made in adapting the Elphinstone and Mody Bay reclamations to traffic; but the three years' working resulted in an aggregate deficit of 6 lakhs, which was charged to the capital debt of the new Board on its formation. The Bombay Port Trust Act I of 1873 was published on the 26th June of that year, and gave legislative effect, with certain modifications, to the scheme as sanctioned by the Secretary of State in 1869. It provided for the creation of a corporation under the name and style of the Trustees of the Port of Bombay, consisting of not less than nine or more than twelve persons, of whom not less than one-third or more than one-half should be Government servants, and a Chairman, all of whom were to be appointed by\nGovernment. The Bandar Fees Act V of 1870 was repealed, and the Board was given power to levy dues at rates previously sanctioned by Government on all goods passed over their wharves, while the control of pilots and the conservancy and lighting of the harbour was taken out of the hands of the old Harbour and Pilotage Board and vested in the new Trust. The properties vested in the Board included the Elphinstone estate, the Mody Bay reclamation, east of Frere road, the Apollo Bay reclamation, the Wellington reclamation, the Apollo pier, the Tank bandar estate (timber ponds), the Customs bonded ware-houses (Customs bandar), the Kasara bandar, the saw-mills property, and the whole of the property of the Harbour and Pilotage Board, comprising chiefly the lighthouses on Kennery island, on the Dolphin Rock, and at Colaba, the Mazagon pier, the signal-stations, the lightships, pilot-schooners and other craft.\n\nThe total debt of the Port Trust on account of the properties mentioned above was 220 lakhs, including 6 lakhs representing loss on the working of the properties from 1870 to 1873. Of the total sum, 212 lakhs bore interest payable to Government at 4 per cent. for the first ten years and at 4\u00bd per cent. thereafter, while 8 lakhs bore no interest but was repayable to Government. No capital charge was made on account of the properties transferred from the Harbour and Pilotage Board. During the earlier years of its existence, the Trust was unable to raise from its properties sufficient revenue to meet the interest upon the debt. The famine years 1877-78 and 1878-79 brought immense stores of grain into Bombay for distribution to the affected districts, and for the first time afforded a surplus; but for the period from June 1873 to the 31st March 1879 the accounts showed a total net deficit of 2\u00b736 lakhs. This loss of revenue was chiefly due to the competition of private wharf-owners, holding the remainder of the foreshore, chief among whom were Messrs. D. Sassoon & Co., who had built a small dock at the Colaba end of the foreshore, the Colaba Land Company, the Mazagon Land\n\n---\n\n1 The first Board, appointed on the 26th June 1873, consisted of Colonel J.A. Ballard C.B., R.E., as Chairman, and nine Trustees, of whom three were Government officials.\nCompany, and the Frere Land Company. This competition, while serving to keep down wharfage rates, gave no satisfaction to the trade, and was the source of much confusion and inconvenience, particularly in regard to the cotton trade, one portion of which centred in Mazagon and the other portion at Colaba.\n\nTo obviate these disabilities, Government in 1879-80 purchased, on behalf of the Trust, the private foreshore-owners' rights (with one or two unimportant exceptions) at a total cost of 75.4 lakhs, which was met by the issue of 4 per cent, debenture bonds, guaranteed by Government from Bombay provincial revenues. At the same time the Trust was reconstituted by Act VI of 1879, which, while authorizing the above purchases, also laid down that the Chamber of Commerce should have power to elect five of the Trustees, that the remaining seven and the Chairman should be nominated as before by Government, and that not less than three of the Trustees should be natives of India resident in the city of Bombay. Since the year 1880 the Chairman has been a full-time officer, devoting himself wholly to the business of the Trust: and with the exception of a few of the chief appointments, for which the sanction of Government is necessary, all vacancies in the establishment are filled up by the Chairman or the Board. A provident fund administered by the Trustees has been established, which provides retiring allowances for the officers and servants of the Trust. The Trustees have power to lease land for any term not exceeding 50 years, longer leases being submitted to Government for sanction; and they have to submit to Government before the commencement of each year estimates of receipts and expenditure, their accounts being audited half-yearly by Government auditors. They have power to enter upon and budget for any project estimated to cost less than 2 lakhs; but more costly schemes have to be submitted to Government, together with plans and estimates for approval.\n\nConsequent upon the acquisition of a monopoly of foreshore rights in 1879-80, and the opening of the Prince's Dock on the 1st January 1880, the financial difficulties of the Trustees disappeared; and a succession of surpluses for the nine years ending 1888-89 enabled the Trustees to\nlargely reduce the charges on trade and to appropriate large sums from revenue to meet capital expenditure. In 1889-90 the completion of the Victoria Dock resulted in a slight deficit; while famine and the outbreak of plague gave rise to heavy deficits in 1896-97 and 1897-98. During the five years ending 1903-04 the annual average surplus was 3\u00bd lakhs. Since 1904 there has been an unbroken succession of surplus receipts, which amounted annually to between 7 and 12 lakhs. This has enabled the Trustees to institute sinking funds for the repayment of the whole existing debt and to build up a large revenue-reserve. Receipts from the landed estates, obtained partly by purchase and partly by reclamation, have also steadily increased, and, including the rents of warehouses and godowns, amounted in 1908-09 to 19'94 lakhs. During the whole period from June, 1873 to the 31st March, 1909, the aggregate surplus on revenue account has amounted to more than 116 lakhs. The Trustees have also accumulated funds aggregating more than 2 lakhs for replacement of pilot-vessels and 46\u00be lakhs for repayment of debt, and have during the 27 years ending 1908-09 made reductions in the charges on trade and shipping amounting to about 2\u00bd crores or 1\u00bd million sterling.\n\nThe following statement shows the annual receipts and expenditure in lakhs from 1870-71 to 1908-09:\n\n| Year | Receipts | Expenditure | Year | Receipts | Expenditure | Year | Receipts | Expenditure |\n|------|----------|-------------|------|----------|-------------|------|----------|-------------|\n|      | Rs.      | Rs.         |      | Rs.      | Rs.         |      | Rs.      | Rs.         |\n| 1870-71 | 10       | ...         | 1883-84 | 39\u00bd     | 33          | 1896-97 | 46       | 48\u00bd        |\n| 1871-72 | 14\u00bd      | ...         | 1884-85 | 39\u00bd     | 34\u00bd         | 1897-98 | 46       | 48         |\n| 1872-73 | 14       | ...         | 1885-86 | 43      | 37\u00bd         | 1898-99 | 52       | 50\u00bd        |\n| 1873-74 | 12\u00bd      | ...         | 1886-87 | 39\u00bd     | 35\u00bd         | 1899-00 | 53\u00bd      | 50\u00bd        |\n| 1874-75 | 14\u00bd      | 6\u00bd          | 1887-88 | 40      | 36\u00bd         | 1900-01 | 52\u00bd      | 53\u00bd        |\n| 1875-76 | 15\u00bd      | 7\u00bd          | 1888-89 | 45      | 40\u00bd         | 1901-02 | 55\u00bd      | 54\u00bd        |\n| 1876-77 | 15      | 7\u00bd          | 1889-90 | 42      | 42\u00bd         | 1902-03 | 59       | 55         |\n| 1877-78 | 17\u00bd      | 7\u00bd          | 1890-91 | 43      | 43\u00bd         | 1903-04 | 64\u00bd      | 57         |\n| 1878-79 | 16\u00bd      | 7\u00bd          | 1891-92 | 48      | 46\u00bd         | 1904-05 | 66       | 58\u00bd        |\n| 1879-80 | 15\u00bd      | 7\u00bd          | 1892-93 | 44\u00bd     | 46\u00bd         | 1905-06 | 70       | 61         |\n| 1880-81 | 25\u00bd      | 25\u00bd         | 1893-94 | 47      | 47\u00bd         | 1906-07 | 73       | 62\u00bd        |\n| 1881-82 | 37\u00bd      | 28\u00bd         | 1894-95 | 48\u00bd     | 48\u00bd         | 1907-08 | 78\u00bd      | 64\u00bd        |\n| 1882-83 | 36\u00bd      | 31          | 1895-96 | 48      | 47\u00bd         | 1908-09 | 76       | 68\u00bd        |\nThe following table shows the approximate annual amount in thousands of rupees received from each main source of revenue during the last five years:\n\n| Heads                        | Rupees |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| I.

During the first ten years, 1873 to 1883, the energies of the Board were mainly devoted to prosecuting the works on the Elphinstone estate, including the construction of the Prince's Dock, which was opened for traffic on New Year's day, 1880. They also completed the Frere road across Mody Bay and other roads required for the convenience of trade and for the opening-up of building sites; they erected at a cost of 5.7 lakhs a fine range of permanent sheds for the storage of grain awaiting shipment on the Elphinstone estate, and seven large warehouses adjacent to Prince's Dock for the storage of piece-goods and other imports, which cost 4.2 lakhs; the lighthouse on the Sunk Rock was erected to replace the inner light-ship; a powerful steam-tug was provided at a cost of 1.5 lakhs; and the Trustees' workshops were transferred at a cost of 1.6 lakhs to the north of the Clerk Basin, in order to allow room for the Prince's Dock wharves. The second period from 1883 to 1893, was chiefly remarkable for the construction of the Victoria Dock and Merewether Dry Dock, which were urgently required for the convenience of a much increased trade and shipping; and besides these great works, the Board constructed a fine block of offices\nfor the dock and traffic staff and also for the administrative staff, and large ranges of warehouses for imports at the Victoria Dock. The filling of the old basin and other improvements at the Apollo Bandar were completed at a cost of 1\u00bd lakhs; private property on the foreshore at Sewri was purchased for nearly 3\u00bd lakhs, and 3 lakhs were also spent on additional cranes and on improvements to the channel at Prince's Dock. No work of great magnitude characterized the third period, 1893-1903; but 66 lakhs were expended on works designed to facilitate trade and to develop the property of the Trust. Thus improvements to the two wet docks,\u2014notably an increase of shed accommodation, extension of railway-sidings, and the deepening of the entrance-channel\u2014swallowed 32 lakhs; a new wharf was constructed at Tank bandar for the benefit of the coast trade; the Mody Bay reclamation was adapted for the storage of bulk-oil; and the construction of the Ballard Pier for the convenience of mail-passengers was commenced. In regard to the development of the landed estate, the construction of Reay road from Mazagon to Kala Chauki and numerous cross-roads, the reclamation of several swampy areas the construction of roads on the Apollo reclamation and Sassoon Dock estates, and the provision of quarters for labourers and other employ\u00e9s of the Trust at a cost of 2\u00bd lakhs were perhaps the most noteworthy achievements. The fourth period, from 1903 up to 1907 was mainly occupied in works preliminary to the important scheme for the provision of further dock accommodation. It became necessary in the first instance to provide for the large traffic at Mody Bay, which will be displaced by the new docks. For this purpose two broad jetties have been formed at Mazagon by reclamation, affording a storage space of 26 acres, with an aggregate wharf frontage of 5,800 feet. The Ballard Pier is being extended 825 feet seaward to form the southern boundary of the area (38 acres) to be reclaimed by the material excavated in the formation of the new docks, and large purchases in the shape of a powerful new dredging-plant and a fleet of capacious steel barges with a special steam-tug for the conveyance of reclamation-material have been made. The area of Prince's Dock has also been extended\non the north; further facilities for the manganese ore trade have been provided; new sheds and cranes have been built in the existing docks; a new unattended lightship burning Pintsch's gas has replaced the old outer lightship; quarters for the accommodation of some of the staff have been built; and a new steam-tug and launch have been added to the equipment of the port.\n\nBesides the new docks, other important works under contemplation or in progress are the Port Trust railway, the proposed reclamation between Mazagon and Sewri, and the new bulk oil depot at Sewri. The Mazagon-Sewri scheme contemplates the reclamation of 583 acres, with a wharf-frontage of 2\u00bd miles, or roughly an addition of about 4\u00bd per cent. to the area of the island. This work is being carried out by means of powerful suction-dredgers. The area thus reclaimed will provide for the new goods depot at Mazagon for the grain and cotton trade and for a new stores-yard for the Great Indian Peninsula railway, which the Trustees have agreed to provide in exchange for the existing railway store-yard at Wadi bandar; it will also provide for the hay trade, for a new telegraph store-yard, and possibly for a new store-yard for the Bombay, Baroda and Central India railway, in the event of their present yard at Jamsetji bandar (Colaba) being given up. The project, when completed, will form a link in the long-standing scheme for connecting Bombay with Trombay island and closing the Kurla creek which is little better than a marsh at low-tide. The new bulk oil depot at Sewri, designed to supersede the former installations, which from their proximity to the docks constituted a danger to shipping and property, have been located, on a site at the extreme northern limit of the Trustees' estates, completely shut off from the harbour on three sides and in close proximity to the harbour branch railway line, with which it is connected by sidings to enable traders to despatch oil direct to their dep\u00f4ts up-country. The site, which has been acquired, at a cost of 3\u00bd lakhs and laid out at a further cost of 3 lakhs, measures 61 acres, affording room for six separate installations, and is connected with a deep\n\n---\n\n1 See Places and Objects of Interest.\n2 See Vol. I, pages 356-358.\nwater berth for oil-steamers by a line of cast-iron pipes. The entire cost of the scheme is estimated at 22.2 lakhs, including the cost of a special oil-pier which it may not be necessary to construct, and will be wholly covered by charges on the trade.\n\nThe total expenditure on works already completed since June 1873 to the 31st March 1909 amounts to roughly 837 lakhs or 54 millions sterling, as detailed hereunder:\n\n| Dock                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Prince's Dock         | 90\u00bd    |\n| Victoria Dock         | 120    |\n| Merewether Dry Dock   | 12     |\n| New Docks (preliminaries) | 126\u00bd |\n| Other works           | 488    |\n\nThe total capital debt, including the amount charged for expenditure prior to the formation of the Trust, allowing for credit from sales of property, etc., amounts to 786 lakhs, out of which 302 lakhs represent debt due to Government and 484 lakhs are due to the general public under foreshore securities and debenture loans. This debt is due on properties, which are steadily increasing in value, and its repayment is provided for, as already explained, by regular sinking-funds. Since the completion of the Victoria Dock, the entire expenditure has been met by 4 per cent. debenture loans, and the sum originally advanced by Government for the construction of the Prince's Dock has been repaid in the same manner. The debentures are in high favour with the investing public.\n\nThe Chairman is assisted in the work of administration by a Deputy Chairman and the staff is divided into six departments, namely (1) the engineering department, consisting of a Chief Engineer, two Deputy Engineers, six assistant engineers and a mechanical superintendent with an assistant, (2) the port department comprising a Port Officer, an Assistant Port Officer and a Harbour Master; (3) the dock department, comprising a Dock Superintendent with three deputies, and a senior and junior Dock Master; (4) the traffic department, composed of a Traffic Manager with one deputy, (5) the secretary's department, comprising a Secretary and Chief Accountant, a Deputy Secretary, and a Deputy Accountant and (6) the medical department in charge of a medical officer. The pilot-staff\nnumbers 20, consisting of 2 master pilots, 6 first grade, 6 second grade and 6 third grade pilots.\n\nThe total area of land held by the Port Trust in Bombay on the 31st December, 1909, was 917.83 acres, excluding the Mazagon-Sewri reclamation which measures 554 acres and the land handed over to the G. I. P. Railway Company for the Harbour branch railway. The area held by tenants on leases amounted on the same date to more than 549,000 square yards and realized an aggregate annual rent of 6\u00bd lakhs. The area let on a monthly tenancy was more than 70 acres and produced a rent of more than 5\u00bd lakhs for the year 1909.\n\nThe following table shows the distribution over the Port Trust Estate of the area leased, excluding monthly tenancies:\n\n| PORT TRUST ESTATES | Area held on 31st December 1909 in Sq.

In the early months of 1897, the Bombay Government, which had long been aware of the insanitary condition of the city, commenced to formulate a comprehensive scheme of urban improvement, designed particularly to insure the better ventilation of densely-crowded areas, the removal of insanitary dwellings, and the prevention of overcrowding. In September of that year they laid before the Municipal Corporation and other bodies definite proposals for the establishment of a special improvement trust, constituted on much the same lines as the Bombay Port Trust. The Trust, which was to be composed partly of representative and partly of nominated members, was to be endowed for a long period on certain terms with the use of valuable Government and Municipal properties within the island, was to be subsidized from municipal revenues, and was to be entrusted with the work of (a) making new streets, (b) opening out crowded localities; (c) reclaiming lands from the sea to provide room for the expansion of the city, (d) constructing sanitary dwellings for the poor and (e) provision of Police accommodation. The scheme, having been generally approved by the Municipal Corporation, the Port Trust and the Chamber of Commerce, was\nfinally legalised by the passing of Act IV of 1898, to which\nthe formal assent of the Governor-General in Council was\ngiven on August 30th in that year; and the term of office\nof the first Trustees commenced by public notification from\nNovember 9th, 1898.\n\nThe Improvement Trust Board is composed of fourteen\nTrustees, including the Chairman, who is executive head\nof the establishment. Of these, three are nominated by\nthe Local Government, one is elected by the Mill-owners'\nAssociation, one by the Port Trustees, one by the Chamber\nof Commerce, four by the Municipal Corporation, while\nthe General Officer Commanding the Bombay District,\nthe Collector of Land Revenue and the Municipal Com-\nmissioner sit on the Board as ex-officio Trustees. Since\nthe constitution of the Board in 1898, the office of Chairman\nhas been held in succession by Mr. (now Sir Walter)\nHughes, by Mr. S. Rebsch, by Mr. G. O. W. Dunn and\nby Mr. J. P. Orr.\n\nWorking under the orders of the Board and its Chair-\nman are the following officers, each in charge of a\nseparate department:\u2014An Engineer, aided by a deputy\nengineer and three assistant engineers, a Land Manager\nwith three assistants, a medical officer and a Secretary\nand Chief Accountant.\n\nAll properties, of which possession is necessary to the\nBoard in pursuance of their various schemes of improve-\nment, and which are the property of private individuals,\nare in the first place publicly notified for acquisition by\nGovernment and are then acquired by a special officer\nunder the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act I\nof 1894. At the outset the work of acquisition was\nperformed by the Collector of Bombay; but in consequence\nof the vast number of properties to be dealt with, a full\ntime officer, with the title of Special Collector, was appointed\nby Government to cope with the work on August the 13th,\n\n---\n\n1 The various departments of the Trust are located in the Im-\nprovement Trust Building facing the Queen's Statue, which was\ncommenced in September 1902 and completed in March 1904. The\nbuilding, which also contains the board-room of the Trustees,\nwas designed by Mr. C. F. Stevens of Bombay. For some time the\noffices of the Special Collector were located in the building, but\nowing to pressure of space, they were removed to hired rooms in\n1907.\n1900. Subsequently, in view of the active progress of the Board's schemes, an additional Special Collector was appointed by Government on September the 2nd, 1902. Although his enquiries into the value of properties under acquisition are modelled to a large extent upon judicial lines, the Special Collector is primarily an executive officer, and in arriving at his decisions is not bound to adhere rigidly to the limits of enquiry binding upon a purely judicial court. To obviate hardship to owners of the properties acquired by him, and to ensure the correct apportionment of compensation among the various parties in intricate and contested cases, the Improvement Trust Act provides for the appointment of a tribunal of appeal, composed of a president and two assessors. The president is a barrister-at-law and the two assessors are members of the engineering profession, one of whom is nominated by Government and the other by the Municipal Corporation. To this tribunal any property-owner, who may be dissatisfied with the Special Collector's award is entitled under certain limitations to appeal, and to it the Special Collector also refers for decision questions of an intricate legal nature which cannot be satisfactorily settled in his court.\n\nBy the 31st March, 1909, the Trustees were engaged upon the prosecution of 33 schemes of improvement, including street schemes, reclamation, housing, and police accommodation schemes in various portions of the island, of which twenty-seven have already been sanctioned by Government and are in progress of completion, and the remainder will shortly be taken in hand. These thirty-three schemes contemplate an expenditure of about 658 lakhs. The details are as follows:\n\nScheme 1.\u2014First Nagpada. An extremely insanitary area of about 75,000 sq. yards, has been completely cleared and laid out with wide roads and convenient building sites, and model chals for the industrial classes have been erected there and on vested lands at Agripada in the neighbourhood.\n\n---\n\n1 The foundation stone of the first block of dwellings was laid at Agripada on November 9, 1899, by Lord Sandhurst, in the presence of H. E., the Viceroy, Lord Curzon.\nScheme II.\u2014Consists of a new street running from Queen's road to Carnac bridge, which opens up a wide passage through a thickly-crowded quarter, clears several very insanitary areas and provides a new thoroughfare for traffic.\n\nScheme III.\u2014Consists of a broad 80 ft. road, running through the heart of the city from Back Bay to Elphinstone bridge near the harbour-properties of the Port Trust. Incidentally sites are provided for the construction of chals for the poorer classes, and several grossly insanitary areas have been cleared.\n\nScheme IV.\u2014Provides for a much-needed thoroughfare from Back Bay to Cumballa hill and Breach Candy and opens up a large area for the construction of better-class residences.\n\nSchemes V and VI.\u2014Embrace very large areas of land now mostly vacant and low-lying and provide for the expansion of the urban population towards Dadar, Matunga and Sion, the northern portions of the island.\n\nScheme VII.\u2014Provides for the reclamation from the sea of a large area of ground at Colaba.\n\nScheme VIII.\u2014Provides for the removal of a very insanitary congeries of buildings in the old Koliwada at Mandvi and for the re-laying out of the area.\n\nScheme IX.\u2014Provides a short length of new street extending from Ripon road to Morland road in Byculla.\n\nScheme X.\u2014Provides for a new street connecting Hornby and Paltan roads, which will afford a new frontage to the Crawford Market.\n\nSchemes XI, XII and XIII.\u2014Provide for new roads opening up the Agripada and Connaught road estates.\n\nSchemes XIV, XVI to XIX and XXIII to XXVI.\u2014Provide proper accommodation for the City Police force in various parts of the island.\n\n1 This street, known as Princess Street, was formally opened by Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales on Nov. 10th, 1905, at the commencement of their tour through India.\n\n2 In the case of Scheme XV (Police hospital at Nagpada) Government decided to lease the land from the Trust and build the hospital themselves. Schemes XXVI and XXVIII (Mahim\u2014Dharavi) and XXII have not yet been prepared.) Schemes XXV and XXXII have not been sanctioned.\nSchemes XX, XXI and XXII.\u2014Provide for roads through three of the estates vested in the Board, at Wellington Lines, Wodehouse road and Hornby road.\n\nScheme XXVII.\u2014Provides for an 80 ft. road linking Queen's road and Sandhurst bridge, permitting of the closing of the Chaupati railway-crossing.\n\nScheme XXXI.\u2014Provides for clearing a congested area on Naoroji hill.\n\nScheme XXX.\u2014Provides for the extension of Souter street westward from Agripada estate, so as to give access to a proposed new park, and also provides for the reclamation of low-lying land on either side of the B. B. and C. I. Railway.\n\nScheme XXXI.\u2014Provides for widening Parel road to 120 feet and building accommodation for mill-hands on either side.\n\nScheme XXXII.\u2014Provides for reclamation of insanitary areas and the construction of a 120 ft. road.\n\nScheme XXXIII.\u2014Provides for the improvement of a crowded area in Girgaum.\n\nIn addition to the execution of these large schemes, the Trustees are engaged upon the question of housing mill-operatives, upon the suitable leasing of the vacant areas and upon the development of the various estates vested in them; and up to the present time (1909) immense strides have been made both in the housing of the poor and the creation of wide thoroughfares as well as in the purification of crowded areas and the reclamation of hitherto useless land. It must ever redound to Lord Sandhurst's credit that he lent all the weight of his position as Governor of Bombay to furthering the creation of an agency which within the next twenty years will have literally purified and rejuvenated a city destined by its natural position to be one of the healthiest places in India.\n\nThe capital debt due by the Board to Government and Finance, the Municipal Corporation in respect of vested land, on which they have to pay interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum from the 1st April 1908, stood at the time of the passing of the Act at Rs. 91,01,351, out of which Rs. 72,60,992 represented the liability for Government lands and Rs. 18,40,559 the liability for Municipal lands.\nOwing to the resumption of various lands this capital debt has been from time to time reduced, and at the close of 1908-09 stood at Rs. 77,66,433. The Board have raised the following loans, all at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum with a currency of 60 years:\n\nIn thousands of rupees.

The Trust's income under this head, known as general account, to the end of 1908-9 was 108 lakhs and the expenditure 90 lakhs. The balances from this source have been carried year by year to capital account to meet current capital expenditure.

A list of these is given in schedules C. and D. of the City Improvement Trust Act. These grants comprised 3,792,053 square yards valued at Rs. 9,101,551. Some of the lands originally granted have been resumed, and the area now (1909) held by the Trust including 94,000 square yards reclaimed at Colaba measures 3,488,342 square yards as shown below:\n\n| Square yards |\n|--------------|\n| Government Lands ... ... ... ... 2,642,614 |\n| Reclaimed land at Colaba ... ... ... 94,000 |\n| Municipal lands ... ... ... ... 7,36,205 |\n| Additional lands given by Government ... ... 15,523 |\n\nTotal 3,488,342\nBesides these the Improvement Trust has acquired up to the end of 1908-09 lands measuring 1,460,000 square yards. Thus the total area of land held by the Trust is 4,948,000 square yards; the total developed area is 1,300,000 square yards. About 350,000 square yards have been occupied for roads and service passages and about 300,000 square yards are open space.\n\nLand is disposed of either by private negotiation or by public auction. The bid in the case of auctioned plots is for the capital amount per square yard on which rent is to be calculated at 4\u00bd per cent. (and in some cases 4 per cent.) per annum. When an offer is accepted, the lessee is required to enter into an agreement with the Board binding himself to construct a building on the land taken up by him within a certain time (6 to 24 months) in accordance with the Board's rules in that behalf and to then accept a lease. The accepted tenant has to pay a certain sum as security for the fulfilment of his contract. In some cases this consists of a sum equivalent to one year's or two years' rent, and in others such sum plus an additional sum of Rs. 2,000. He has also to pay Rs. 500 to meet legal expenses in connection with the agreement and lease. A certain period is allowed to the lessee rent-free. This period varies from six to eighteen months from the date of agreement according to the nature of the building to be erected on the plot; in most cases it is 12 months.\n\nRules and regulations have been laid down for the buildings on Trust land, and all buildings erected by the lessees must conform to those rules. Plans and specifications must be submitted to the Board for approval and all construction work must be in accordance with the sanctioned plans. On completion of a building the Trust Engineer certifies to its having been completed in accordance with the Board's rules; and then a lease for a term of 999 years (in the case of lands temporarily transferred to the Trust from Government or the Municipality 99 years) is granted to the lessee. In some cases, however, the lease is granted before the completion of the building. A lessee may assign his interest in his building with the consent of the Board. Ground rent is payable into the\noffice of the Secretary in regular monthly or quarterly instalments.\n\nLeases granted or agreed to be granted as on 31st March 1909.\n\n| Area in thousands (sq.

enterprise. At the close of the sixteenth century, for example, the Franciscan fathers maintained three parochial schools for catechism and rudimentary instruction in Latin and Portuguese, of which one was attached to the church of Nossa Senhora da Esperan\u00e7a (built in 1596), a second to the church of Nossa Senhora de Gloria in Mazagon, and the third to the church of Mahim. After the cession of the island to the English, the first educational institution founded was a charity school, opened by the Reverend Richard Cobbe, chaplain of St. Thomas' church (now the Cathedral), in the Fort in September, 1718, with the object of \"educating poor (European) children in the Christian religion, according to\n\n---\n\n1 Most of this article was supplied by Mr. R. S. Taki, Deputy Educational Inspector, Bombay.\n\n2 This was connected and perhaps identical with the so-called Mahim College, which was abandoned about 1810 and was finally demolished in 1831. It stood on the verge of a large tank in the middle of the Mahim cocoanut woods, and consisted of halls for study, a refectory, private apartments and dormitories, built in the form of a square, with a fine open courtyard in the middle, from which massive flights of stone steps led up to the four sides of the building. At the zenith of Portuguese dominion it ranked as the chief Portuguese college in Western India; but was subsequently transformed into a seminary for Portuguese youths.\u2014Bombay Times, October 22nd, 1851, and Lady Falkland's Chow-Chow, 1848.\n\nNearly three centuries before the English missionary societies commenced to labour in Bombay, and more than a hundred years before the island of Bombay was ceded to the English Crown, the Portuguese had founded an orphanage at Montpezier in Salsette for the maintenance and education of destitute native children. The institution flourished for upwards of two centuries; and its church and ruined walls are still standing. Other similar establishments were founded about the same time in the neighbouring islands of Agasaim and Karanja (Uran); and in 1556 a large orphanage for 170 boys was established near Thana, at a village which was situated in the valley now covered by the Vehar lake. All of these orphanages gave an elementary education in Portuguese and Latin, and to this was added instruction in agriculture and other industrial work.\n\nTowards the end of the sixteenth century, the Franciscan and Jesuit orders maintained at Bombay and on the adjacent islands a considerable number of parochial elementary schools which were\nthe use of the Church of England.\" Under his auspices the inhabitants of Bombay \"raised among themselves Rs. 6,000 and upwards, without stirring out-of-doors; of which the Governor (Charles Boone) according to his usual generosity launched out Rs. 2,000, leaving a blank for the Honourable Company in hopes of their assistance.\"\n\nFor nearly a century from that date the school was entirely supported by voluntary subscriptions, but in 1767 received from Mrs. Eleanor Boyd a legacy of Rs. 6,000, which, lying at interest in the East India Company's Treasury for 57 years, accumulated to Rs. 46,000. In 1807 therefore the Court of Directors took the school under their own\n\nslightly inferior in grade to the orphanages. Colleges for higher instruction also were established at Bassein, Thana, and Chaul. In the institution at Bassein, which was founded in 1548 and had a theological seminary attached to it, a high order of education was given gratuitously to upwards of 200 students. Dr. John Fryer, who visited Bombay in the year 1674 and saw these flourishing establishments, describes their collegiate buildings as being not unlike those at the English universities, and he adds that the Bassein college had an extensive library of historical, moral and expository works.\n\nOn the expulsion of the Portuguese by the Marathas in 1739, and the suppression of the Catholic orders, the orphanages and colleges were all broken up. But the parish schools, which evidently supplied a public want, survived, and were carried on by the native clergy with the aid of private liberality. An attempt was made by Sir Miguel De Lima towards the end of last century to establish a college at Bombay, but it failed; it was not until the return of the Jesuits to Bombay, shortly before the foundation of the Bombay University, that the re-establishment of a complete system of schools was successfully taken in hand. In 1795 a school was founded by Antonio de Souza for the free education of the Roman Catholic children of Mazagon, the cost being defrayed from the interest on a sum of Rs. 40,000 which he gave to the Trustees of the church of Our Lady of Glory. At the outset this school taught only Portuguese and Latin.\n\nThe Church of Bombay by the Reverend R. Cobbe. The success of this school was probably responsible for the Court of Directors recommending to the Bombay Government in 1752 \"the setting up and establishing of charity schools wherein the children of soldiers, mariners, topasses, and others, might be educated, as well as the subordinates as at Bombay.\" A subsequent order laid down that \"bastards, and the children of slaves on one side, should be admitted, provided the other children would mix with them.\" Bombay Quarterly Review II.\n\nIbid. Richard Cobbe was appointed Chaplain of Bombay through the influence of Humphrey Prideaux, the well-known Dean of Norwich, but returned to England in 1720 in consequence of a quarrel with the Bombay Council on the subject of a supposed insult which he had put upon Mr. Braddell (Bombay Quarterly Review III). His son was chaplain to Admiral Watson in India (Ives' Voyages, 1754-56).\nmanagement, allowing it an annual grant of Rs. 3,600; and finally in 1815 handed it over, together with a fixed annual grant of Rs. 5,280, which has now been exchanged for an annual grant equal to one-third of the expenditure on the two Byculla schools, to the \"Society for promoting the education of the poor within the Government of Bombay,\" which was founded in that year (1815) and is now known as the Bombay Education Society. This Society, the first of its kind in India\u2014received nearly a lakh of rupees in benefactions during the first five years of its existence, and was warmly supported by the national society in England. It did not confine its efforts to the education of European children, and its operations extended beyond the island. Native boys were encouraged to attend schools and by 1820 the Society had opened four schools for natives in the island, attended by about 250 pupils. In August of that year it formed a separate branch known as the Elphinstone Native Education Institution, the object of which was to prepare school-books in the vernacular languages and to aid or establish vernacular schools. Two years later however (1822) the Society, finding itself unequal to the discharge of rapidly increasing responsibilities, determined to confine itself solely to the education of European and Eurasian children, and therefore severed itself from the Elphinstone Native Education Institution, which thenceforth provided for the education of the Native population under the title of \"The Bombay Native School Book and School Society.\" The latter society soon rose into prominence, becoming in 1827 the Bombay Native Education Society and being merged in 1840 in a Board\n\n---\n\n1 The Bombay Education (or parent) Society still maintains two large schools at Byculla. One of the scholarships now open to pupils of the schools is known as the Barnes' Scholarship in memory of the famous Archdeacon of Bombay (1815-1845), through whose exertions the Society was founded in 1815. The Archdeacon was also a Vice-President of the Native Education Society; and in 1833 Mr. Framji Cowasji presented the Society with a portrait of the Archdeacon as a memorial of his zeal.\n\n2 The Honorable Mountstuart Elphinstone was the first President of the Society. The Vice-Presidents were the Chief Justice and three Members of the Executive Council of the Bombay Government. The Managing Committee was composed of 12 European and 12 Native gentlemen, with Captain George Jervis, R. E., and Mr. Sadashiv Kashinath Chhatre as Secretaries.\nof Education; and down to the year 1855 it shared with missionary bodies from Europe and America the entire burden of educational administration in Bombay.\n\nThe earliest missionary workers in the field of education were members of the American Marathi mission, who arrived in Bombay in 1813 and opened in May 1815 a Hindu boys' school\u2014the first school conducted on western lines in this part of India. This was followed by the opening in 1824 of a girls' school; and by 1826 they were enabled to report an increase of 9 girls' schools, attended by 340 pupils, and in 1829 by 400 pupils, of whom 122 were able to read and write and do plain needlework. In 1831 the mission maintained eight boys' schools and thirteen girls' schools, attended by 760 pupils; but commenced from that year to relinquish gradually its work in Bombay in favour of the new educational centre at Ahmadnagar. Meanwhile, the Church Missionary Society had also appeared in the field, opening their first school and commencing the compilation of a series of moral class books in 1820. In 1826 they opened a school for native girls, and in 1835 founded an anglo-veracular school in memory of Robert Cotton Money, Secretary to Government (in the Educational Department) raising for that purpose funds which sufficed also for the erection in 1857 of the building which stood until 1909 on the verge of the Esplanade. The schools of the Society steadily advanced up to the year 1840, when in consequence of the baptism of two pupils, the number on the rolls suffered a sudden and considerable reduction; but the effect of this action was only temporary, for by 1852 the Robert Money school contained more than 400 pupils, and the Society's vernacular schools were attended by 670 boys and nearly 400 girls. A later comer was Dr. John Wilson of the Scottish Missionary society, who, assisted by Mrs. Wilson, established in 1829-30 six schools for native girls, the\n\n---\n\n1 One of these institutions was a boarding-school which was successfully maintained at Byculla for several years. The Governor of Bombay and many high officials subscribed liberally to the American Marathi Mission School funds.\n\n2 Robert Money had been a benefactor of the society and Secretary to the Native Education Society.\nattendance in which soon rose to 200. In 1832 Dr. Wilson opened a school for boys, financed by local contributions, in which both English and vernacular languages were taught, and which, after re-organization by the Church of Scotland in 1838, formed the nucleus of the Free General Assembly's Institution.\n\nMeanwhile the Bombay Native Education Society maintained a steady progress. In 1824 they purchased a plot of ground for erection of a central building to accommodate their English and vernacular schools; they appointed a European head master to the English school in the following year, and in 1825 despatched twenty-four trained masters from the vernacular schools to take charge of primary schools in the Konkan, the Deccan and Gujarat. They even formed in 1825 an engineering class, under the superintendence of Captain Jervis, with the object of \"preparing a body of men to act under the officers of Government in superintending surveys and buildings, and of providing for a more general diffusion of mathematical and physical knowledge, as well practical as mechanical, among the native subjects of this Presidency, in their own vernacular dialects.\" Their success, both tutorial and financial, was largely due to the encouragement given by the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone, who was an advocate of higher as well as vernacular education, and who had won the entire confidence of the native community; and it is therefore hardly a matter for surprise that, when he relinquished the reins of office in 1827, the Native Chiefs of the Deccan and Konkan and the public subscribed more than 2\u00bd lakhs, which subsequently accumulated to nearly 4\u00bd lakhs of rupees, to found a Presidency College in his memory. He himself was requested to select the first Professors\u2014Messrs. Harkness and Orlebar\u2014who arrived from England in 1835, while the\n\n---\n\n1 Heber's Narrative\u2014\"On May 5th (1825) the foundation of a free school on the same plan with that of Calcutta was laid. The ceremony was numerously attended, and the institution, which has been for some time in activity, though in a hired and inconvenient building, appears very flourishing. The plan and elevation of the intended schools by Lieutenant Jervis of the Engineers, I think a very elegant and judicious one.\" See also Von Orlich's Travels, Vol I (1845).\n\n* Bombay Quarterly Review II.\nBombay Government undertook to superintend the general maintenance of the college and to defray all expenditure in excess of the income derived from fees and endowment funds. This system of dual control by Government and the Society, however, did not make for success, any more than did the plan, adopted in 1832, of placing the district schools of the Society under the control of Government revenue officers; and it was soon apparent that, unless a special agency was created for the supervision of schools, the management of such institutions by Government was bound to be faulty. In view of the past accomplishments of the Native Education Society in the cause of education, and of the fact that their central English school in Bombay had attained a high standard of excellence under Messrs. Henderson and Bell, Government decided in 1840 to amalgamate the school and college classes into one institution, named the Elphinstone Institution, and to place them under the control of a Board of Education, composed of a President and three European members appointed by Government and three native members.\n\n---\n\n1 The amount of this subsidy was Rs. 22,000 a year, and was continued to 1864. For further particulars of the College, see the article on Elphinstone College.\n\n2 Mrs. Postains' Western India in 1838, Vol. I, page 48 et seq.:\u2014 \"The Schools are situated near the great bazaars at the extreme end of the Esplanade. Committees and examinations are held in the library, a splendid apartment fitted with a good collection of useful works, globes, maps and adorned at either end with full-length portraits of the great benefactors of the institution, Sir John Malcolm and the Honorable Mountstuart Elphinstone. The lads vary in age from seven to twenty, the classes being composed mainly of Hindu and Parsi students, including a few Portuguese boys, but not one Mahomedan. The sons of tradesmen or any below the caste of a Parvoe (Prabhu) or writer are not admitted. The branch schools form one of the most important parts of the Institution. The students sit cross-legged on carpets with huge tomes resting upon their knees. The fame of the Native Education Society's Schools has spread far and wide and in truth very deservedly.\" The education of European and Eurasian children seems to have been carried on in more than one private school at this date. The Bombay Times of November 3rd and November 28th, 1838, contains advertisements of a day-school for both sexes in Meadows street, and of a new English school \"adjoining the Sailors' Home near Dhobees' Tank (Dhobi Talao), for the children of Indo-Britons and other Christian inhabitants of Bombay,\" owned by the Reverend G. Candy. The latter school formed the nucleus of the modern Indo-British Institution.\nappointed by the Native Education Society, which thenceforth disappeared from the educational arena.\n\nUntil the State recognized the need of a properly organized department of Public Instruction, this Board of Education was responsible for the whole educational administration of the Bombay Presidency, and was in direct charge of the schools in Bombay island, which comprised in 1840 the Elphinstone Institution and seven vernacular schools. Their first step was to divide the Presidency into three educational divisions, each under a European Inspector with one Native assistant; and this was followed by the establishment of school-committees and stipendiary studentships, by the institution of an entrance-test for English schools, and by the revision of fees and the provision of free studentships for poor pupils from vernacular schools. They also founded a normal class, which languished on the death of its first Director, Bal Gangadhar Shastri, and was abolished about 1848. In 1844 they added to the upper division of the Elphinstone Institution a surveying and civil engineering class under a professor chosen in England by the Court of Directors; and in 1846 appointed a Professor of Botany and Chemistry; while at the same time they re-organized the school-book depositories in Bombay, and appointed a special committee for the preparation of English and vernacular text-books. The Board also received control of the Grant Medical College, founded in 1845. The funds of the Board consisted chiefly of a Government subsidy of Rs. 1,45,000, including a contribution of Rs. 22,000 to the Elphinstone Institution, and of Rs. 2,756 to the West and Clare scholarship endowments. The most notable President of the Board was Sir Erskine Perry, Chief Justice (1843-52), whose encouragement of higher education involved a deviation from the previous tendency of the educational movement in Bombay, and whose policy so stimulated private enter-\n\n---\n\n1 The first members of the Board of Education were Sir J. W. Awdry, Messrs. Bruce, Morris (Secretary to Government), Dr. J. Mcleanan (afterwards Physician-General in Bombay) and Messrs. Jagannath Shankarsett, Mahomed Ibrahim Makba and Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy.\nprise that by the end of his tenure of office nine private English schools were being maintained by their promoters in the capital of the Presidency. Besides these there were 17 indigenous schools in the Fort, of which twelve belonged to Hindus and five to Parsis, and 75 vernacular schools outside the limits of the Fort, including both Government, missionary and indigenous institutions. The total number of boys receiving English or vernacular education was reported to be 5,809.\n\n\"The indigenous schools were chiefly owned by so-called Mehetajis, penurious men of limited intellect, who held their classes on the verandah of a house, free of rent. Chairs and tables were unknown, and very few pupils possessed slates or pencils, their place being supplied by a portable wooden board, on which the pupil wrote with a reed pen dipped in chalky fluid, and which was re-painted every Divali by the Mehetaji for a small consideration. The Mehetaji exercised unlimited power within his own domain. Not only did he oblige his elder pupils to sweep the school premises every morning, but in cases of misbehaviour he subjected the boys to several most ingenious modes of punishment, such as standing in a bent position for an hour with their fingers touching their toes. The arrival of a new pupil was the occasion of a regular initiation ceremony, in which the Mehetaji, after being garlanded at the house of the boys' parents, headed a procession back to the school, amid the chanting of hymns to Ganesh, the god of knowledge. This was followed by the distribution of inkstands and sweetmeats to the pupils, who observed the remainder of the day as a holiday. Bombay also contained a few private academies of an exclusive character, attended by the sons of the rich, in which the fees were high, discipline was lax, and the pupils studied or not according to their own fancy.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Lady Falkland writing (Chow-Chow) in 1848 remarks:\u2014 \"There are several other admirable schools and institutions for purposes of education; some supported by Government, or by the various missionary bodies, others supported by Natives amongst which latter are some very large Parsi schools.\"\n\n2 The late Mr. K. N. Kabraji's Reminiscences, reprinted in the Times of India, 1901.\nOn Sir Erskine Perry's retirement from the Board in 1852, a reaction took place in favour of primary education, and the Government subsidy was increased to 2\u00bd lakhs, whereupon the Board undertook to open a school in any village of the Presidency, provided that the inhabitants were prepared to defray half the salary of the master and to provide a school-room and class-books. In fact, with the exception of girls' schools, which were relegated entirely to private enterprise, the Board may be said to have founded a system of education which in many respects anticipated the principles of the famous Despatch of the Court of Directors in 1854. They had prepared the way for an University by the establishment of institutions for the teaching of literature, law, medicine and civil engineering, and had introduced a system of primary schools, administered by the State but mainly supported by the people themselves, which formed the germ of the modern local-fund school system.\n\nAt the time of the transfer of the functions of the Board to the Director of Public Instruction (1855), the number of Government institutions in Bombay island was ten, namely, the Elphinstone Institution and two branch schools,\n\n---\n\n1 When Sir Erskine Perry was about to leave India altogether, the Perry Professorship of Jurisprudence at the Elphinstone College was founded by public subscription, in memory of his long connection with law and education in India.\n\n2 The Despatch laid down that \"Among other subjects of importance, none can have a stronger claim on our attention than that of Education. It is one of our most sacred duties to be the means, as far as in us lies, of conferring upon the Natives of India those vast moral and material blessings which flow from the general diffusion of useful knowledge, and which India may, under Providence, derive from her connection with England\". The measures prescribed for the attainment of this object were, (a) the constitution of a department of Public Instruction; (b) the foundation of universities at the Presidency towns; (c) the establishment of training-schools for teachers; (d) the maintenance of the existing Government colleges and schools of a high order and the increase of their number when necessary; (e) increased attention to all forms of vernacular schools, and (f) the introduction of a system of grants-in-aid, which should foster a spirit of reliance upon local exertion, and should, in course of time, render it possible to close or transfer to the management of local bodies many of the existing institutions.\n\n3 These two branch schools, one in the Fort and the other at Mumbadevi, were opened in August, 1850, and were considered as preparatory schools to the Elphinstone Institution. As the building, in which the central Marathi and Gujarathi schools were\nattended by 961 pupils and costing nearly Rs. 55,000 a year; six vernacular schools attended by 560 pupils and costing Rs. 3,900 a year; and the Grant Medical College, with 71 pupils, which was founded in 1845 and cost nearly Rs. 28,000 a year. The chief private institutions at this date were the Bombay Education Society's boys' and girls' schools, the Indo-British Institution, the Bombay Scottish Orphanage, the St. Mary's Institution, the Convent School at Parel, the Sir J. J. Parsi Benevolent Institution, several schools of the American Mission, the Robert Money School and 12 vernacular schools belonging to the Church Missionary Society, and the Scottish Missionary Society's schools. Sectarian education was represented by the Prabhu seminary and a Bhattia school, attended also by Khojas, Memons and Lohanas, while female education, apart from missionary effort, was stimulated by the Students' Literary and Scientific Society, which supported nine vernacular free schools for girls, attended by 654 pupils, of whom 136 were Marathi-speaking Hindus, 120 Gujarati Hindus and 398 Parsis. Muhammadan education was represented by only one Hindustani school, opened by Government in Kazi street in 1834; for the bulk of the Muhammadan population evinced no ardent desire for education on western lines and were quite content with the ability to read or recite the Koran.\n\nlocated, was let by the owner for the Small Cause Court; these schools were removed in 1854 to a building in Cavel; and as the latter building was large enough to accommodate the Paidboni Gujarathi school also, the latter was closed, thereby reducing the number of vernacular schools from seven to six. The policy of the Board was against Government support of primary instruction at the Presidency, on the grounds that such instruction might safely be left to private enterprise. But, in deference to the wishes of the bulk of the native community, the Board refrained from closing the two schools above mentioned. (Last Report of the Board of Education.)\n\nThe formation of this Society was promoted by Professor Patton of the Elphinstone College in 1848. It was intended by the students and assistant teachers of the Elphinstone institution to be a mutual improvement society and to aid the dissemination of knowledge by means of vernacular lectures and the publication of cheap periodicals in the vernacular languages. In 1848 the Society maintained 16 schools with 1,132 pupils, including several female schools with 120 pupils.\n\nAn honourable exception was Mahomed Ibrahim Makba, a Konkani Muhammadan, who was elected a member of the managing committee of the Native Education Society in 1832,\nThe orders of the Government of India on the despatch of 1854 were received by the Bombay Government in February 1855; and three months later the Department of Public Instruction was formed, with Mr. C. J. Erskine, C.S., as its first Director and Dr. Harkness, Principal of the Elphinstone College, as first Educational Inspector of the Presidency. The inspection of the vernacular schools in the island was entrusted to the Deputy Educational Inspector of the Thana and Kolaba Districts, Rao Bahadur V. N. Mandlik. Mr. Erskine's first act was the preparation of an inspection-code and the formulation of rules, prescribing the conditions under which grants were to be payable to private schools and providing for a system of stipendiary scholarships. He further instituted an entrance test for higher primary and for secondary and collegiate institutions, and was about to deal with the question of augmenting the number of trained masters for vernacular schools, when ill-health forced him to resign office. His successor, Mr. Howard (1855-65), the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, confined his attention mainly to the consolidation of the departmental system, to preparing the colleges and higher schools for the University and to securing the voluntary aid of the people in the improvement rather than the extension of primary schools. He also formed a vernacular class-book committee for the improvement of the school-books produced by the departments of the Marathi and Gujarathi translators. In 1856 a Deputy Educational Inspectorship of Gujarathi schools was created; but, owing to the Mutiny of 1857, which closed the public coffers to all except war-claims, and to the seven lean years which followed it, no provision could be made until 1865 for other wants which Mr. Erskine had declared to be urgent. Among educational institutions other than schools, founded during Mr. Howard's regime, were the Government Central Museum (now the Victoria and\n\nbecame a member of the Elphinstone College Council in 1834, and a member of the Board of Education in 1840. He published several works for the benefit of his co-religionists, receiving on one occasion the marked approval of the Court of Directors, and was instrumental in popularising the first Muhammadan school opened in 1834.\nAlbert Museum), the David Sassoon Industrial and Reformatory Institution, the Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy School of Art, which commenced with drawing-classes in Elphinstone High School, and the University of Bombay, which held the first Matriculation examination in October 1859. In 1861 a Marathi class was opened in the Grant Medical College, which, together with a Gujarathi class opened in 1874-75, formed the nucleus of the existing medical school at Poona and Ahmadabad.\n\nMr. Erskine's scheme for differentiating the several grades of educational institutions by means of entrance tests was not fully carried out until 1865-66, when the Government colleges found themselves strong enough to restrict their lectures to students who had passed the Matriculation examination of the University. Owing also to the increased efficiency of the high schools, it was found possible to enforce an entrance standard and give a definite aim to the studies of the schools of the next lower grade, in connection with which Mr. Howard organized a system of open exhibitions or scholarships to high or first-grade schools. The distribution of English schools underwent some modification by the opening of the Jagannath Shankarsett school in 1857 and of the Goculdas Tejpal high school in 1858, both of which were established on a system similar to that of the partially self-supporting schools, the founders contributing half the salary of the master and providing the school-house and furniture, while Government paid the balance of the master's salary. In 1858-59 an English class was opened in one Marathi and one Gujarathi school, thus giving rise to the modern second-grade anglo-veracular schools, while the vernacular schools proper were subdivided into superior vernacular schools and village schools. In the former the boys of the first class studied the complete series of vernacular reading books, were well-versed in arithmetic and knew something of geography and history, while in the latter reading, writing, simple arithmetic and elementary geography only were taught. On the introduction of the Public Service Certificate examination in 1866, the superior vernacular schools commenced to teach up to the 2nd class certificate, which qualified for Govern-\nment employ, while inferior schools confined their tuition to the entrance standard for English schools. By 1862-63 Bombay contained 3 second-grade Anglo-veracular schools, 3 superior vernacular schools, and 6 village schools, and the period under review also witnessed the opening of several private institutions, notably the Fort and Proprietary high schools, the Framji Nasarwanji Patel anglo-veracular school at Khetwadi, the Jacob Sassoon free school and the Breach Candy road English school.\n\nThe extension of primary education on the partially self-supporting system was continued by the Educational Department until the middle of 1858, when the Government of India pointed out that this practice was inconsistent with the terms of the Despatch of 1854, directing that the education of the masses should be promoted by subsidizing indigenous schools. The Bombay Government in reply pointed out that the system of partial self-support was practically the same as the grant-in-aid system, the sole difference being that under the former system Government assumed regular control over the appointments and actions of the masters and thus afforded the public a substantial guarantee that their contributions would be properly expended. The Supreme Government, while acquiescing in this view, ordered that no new schools of this class should be opened without their sanction, and thus virtually stopped the extension of primary education, and obliged the Educational Department to confine its activities to the consolidation and improvement of existing schools. Towards the spread of female education the Department still did little; and it was left almost entirely to private enterprise and benevolence to found schools for the weaker sex. Among the most notable institutions privately endowed prior to 1865 were the Parsi girls' school opened in 1858, convent schools in the Fort, Byculla and Lower Mahim, the St. Joseph's schools at Mazagon and Cavel, St. Anne's school at Byculla, the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney school at Khetwadi, the Alexandra Native Girls' English institution, founded in 1860, and a Marathi School for Hindu girls opened by the Society for the Propagation of\nthe Gospel in 1864. Physical education also was first provided for during these years by the opening in 1858 of a gymnastic institution, which subsequently expanded into the present Sir Dinshaw Manockji Petit Gymnastic Institution on the Esplanade.\n\nThe year 1865, in which the one-anna cess for local education and improvements was first levied, witnessed the appointment of Sir Alexander Grant as Director of Public Instruction and the creation of a Deputy Inspectorship of Marathi schools in the island. The administration of both Sir Alexander Grant and his successor, Mr. J. B. Peile, C.S., resulted in a considerable increase of resources and in general educational progress. For example, the one-anna cess, which was at first levied as a voluntary rate, was made compulsory in 1869; the Bombay Municipality subscribed Rs. 10,000 to the primary schools in 1866, and only withdrew the sum in the following year on discovering that the civic revenues could not legally be so applied; the series of Gujarathi and Marathi text-books were revised and stereotyped; and in 1868 two new first-grade anglo-veracular schools were opened in Phanaswadi and Chandanwadi. The Government second-grade schools had meanwhile increased to 8, and the vernacular schools to 25 (15 Marathi and 10 Gujarathi); while in 1868-69 encouragement was extended to higher education by the establishment of 9 government scholarships of \u00a3200 per annum, tenable in England for three years by students seeking a university degree or admission to the Indian Civil Service. Two of these scholarships were allotted to Bombay. But the period was chiefly remarkable for the introduction of the grants-in-aid code or system of payment by results, which arose out of the recommendations of a conference of managers of private schools, convened by Sir Alexander Grant in 1864. Although a few exceptional grants had been made before that date to certain charitable institutions, the history of aided education in Bombay must be rightly held to commence with the introduction of this code in 1865,\n\n---\n\n1 Local Committees were formed at this time to promote the opening of new schools in various parts of the island. (General Administration Report, 1865-66.)\ndesigned, as it was, for the benefit of any private primary or secondary school, which was controlled by a board of management and was not maintained solely for private profit. Under its provisions the maximum grants per head under the several standards varied from one rupee to Rs. 4 in vernacular schools, from Rs. 6 to Rs. 30 in anglo-veracular schools, and from Rs. 10 to Rs. 150 in European and Eurasian schools, together with special grants for pupils who passed the Matriculation, F. A., and B. A. examinations. A capitation grant of Rs. 2 in anglo-veracular and of 8 annas in vernacular schools was also allowed on the annual average attendance of pupils, while grants were also awarded for good needlework to the pupils of European and Eurasian girls' schools. On the introduction of the code in 1865, 4 European and Eurasian schools, 3 anglo-veracular high schools, and 7 vernacular schools were registered in Bombay for grants-in-aid, aggregating a little more than Rs. 12,000; while, besides these, 10 schools received fixed grants and 6 received no aid, but were open to inspection by officers of the Educational Department. The grant-in-aid code rules and standards, as drawn up by Sir Alexander Grant, remained in force until April, 1870, when further help towards the salaries of assistant teachers and the construction of school buildings was accorded, and the standards were so remodelled as to ensure that the instruction given in a primary, middle, or high school should form a complete course in itself. Thus the private institutions in Bombay received state aid in three different ways. The majority were awarded pecuniary grants in payment of examination results and for the average attendance of pupils; a few charitable institutions received fixed grants paid annually so long as they were reported efficient by the Educational Department; while others again received special sums for the construction of buildings, boarding houses and gymnasia and for the purchase of books and apparatus.\n\nDuring this period European and Eurasian education benefited by the foundation of the Diocesan Board of Education in 1866-67 and of the Bombay Scottish Educational Society in 1866. The former opened the\nBishop's school at Byculla, St. Peter's school at Mazagon, and St. John's school at Colaba, while the latter set to work to provide a good education for the children of European parents born in India. Government also fostered the education of European and Eurasian children by according special monetary grants to such as passed the higher standards and were willing to study in the University, thus encouraging a class, which had hitherto held aloof from liberal education, to compete with Hindu and Parsi youths in the study of the arts, medicine and civil engineering. Female education likewise received a stimulus by an annual assignment of Rs. 10,000 made by the Government of India in 1868, and by the visit of Miss Carpenter to India and the consequent establishment of female training schools at Ahmedabad, Poona and Bombay. The Bombay school, which was endowed with twelve scholarships, ranging in value from Rs. 15 to 25, existed until 1872, when irregular attendance obliged the authorities to close it; and at the present day the only legacy of Miss Carpenter's philanthropic mission are the Mary Carpenter scholarships for girls, which are annually awarded by the National Indian Association of London to pupils of the recognized girls' schools in Bombay. More successful than the Bombay normal school was a Gujarathi girls' school, opened in the Fort in 1859 by the Trustees of the Gokuldas Tejpal Charities, to which all Gujarathi-speaking Hindu girls are admitted free of charge. The school, which opened with 60 pupils, now contains more than 200.\n\nMr. Peile himself was responsible for the amelioration of Muhammadan education, by obtaining for the Muhammadan schools in Bombay a fair share in the Government grant-in-aid, and by offering special opportunities to Muhammadans to attend the vernacular training-colleges.\n\nThree other features of the educational administration of this period deserve special mention. The first was the institution in 1871 of the Public Service Certificate examination. Up to 1866 a mixed committee, comprising members of the Revenue, Judicial and Educational Departments, had presided over an annual or biennial\nexamination for admission to the lower grades of the public service; and this system yielded place in that year to the issue of first class and second class certificates by the Educational Department at the time of the annual examination in each school. A fee of one rupee for a first class certificate and of eight annas for a second class certificate was levied from candidates, it being laid down by Government at the same time that none except holders of such certificates and matriculated students of the University would be eligible for Government employ. Finally in 1871 these arrangements were revoked in favour of an examination held annually at the headquarters of each collectorate and in Bombay, and the fees for first-class and second-class certificates were raised respectively to Rs. 3 and one rupee. The second chief feature of the period was the re-organization in 1868 of the supply of trained school-masters, whose numbers had not increased proportionately with the increase in the number of schools. By means of a system of apprenticeship as pupil-teachers for two years, followed by a year in a training-college and two years of systematic training elsewhere, coupled with the grant of proficiency allowances and pensions, Mr. Peile managed to effect a marked improvement in the personnel of the teaching-staff in primary schools. The third salient event of his administration was the recognition accorded to public libraries, which from 1868-69 were presented with copies of each book purchased from the fund for the encouragement of literature. In Bombay 17 libraries were registered and thus indirectly linked with the Educational Department, among them being the Mulla Firoz library, the Bombay Native General library, the Jamsetji Nasarwanji Petit institute, the Dhanjibhoy Framji reading-room and library, the Jamsetji Nasarwanji Petit Girgaum library, the Muljibhai Jivraj Khoja reading-room and the Bhuleshwar library.\n\nThe history of education from 1872, when Mr. K. M. Chatfield became Director of Public Instruction, to 1882 when the Education Commission was appointed, is concerned chiefly with the extension of primary education and the improvement of higher and collegiate tuition.\nThe former object occupied the chief attention of the Bombay Government, who decided that any large increase in secondary and higher schools should result rather from State-aided private enterprise than from the direct action of their own educational agency. The Bombay primary schools, which up to 1871 had subsisted solely on the Government grant and the general fee fund of the Central Division, were benefited in that year by a grant of Rs. 10,000 by the Bench of Justices, which was subsequently (1878) augmented to Rs. 15,000 by the Bombay Municipality. This amount had been increased on various occasions since that date, but had never quite sufficed to bring the primary schools into line with the other institutions of the city.\n\nNevertheless, the policy of Government bore fruit in due season; for the Census Officer of 1881 was able to point out that since the Census of 1872 very considerable progress had been made in the education of the population. The percentage of the male population under instruction had risen from 5\u00b70 to 7\u00b76, and of the female population from 1\u00b78 to 2\u00b78; while the proportion of educated males and females had risen, respectively, from 17\u00b75 to 24\u00b79 and from 4\u00b70 to 6\u00b73. This result was mostly due to the opening of new schools. For example, the Antonio deSouza school, which is still held in the Gloria church at Mazagon, the St. Xavier's branch school at Girgaum, the Antonio da Silva school at Dadar, and St. Joseph's Portuguese school at Umarkhadi, had been added to the list of so-called English-teaching schools, in which the proportion of pupils of European descent does not suffice to constitute them European schools; while in 1872, the list of private vernacular institutions was enlarged by the opening of the Mugbhat school. A decided impetus was vouchsafed to female education by the opening in 1873 of the first Government Gujarathi girls' school at Charni road, which was followed by the opening of the first Marathi girls' school at Kamathipura in 1876. Parsi girls benefited by the foundation of the Merwanji Sethna\n\n---\n\n1 Other schools of this kind, now (1909) existing, are the St. Peter's high school for boys at Mazagon, founded in 1883; the St. Isabel's school at Matiharpakhadi; and the Barretto boys' school at Cavel.\nschool in 1871, and Beni-Israel girls by the opening of a female normal school and a Marathi school in Umarkhadi in 1874; the Methodist Episcopal mission founded a similar school in Grant road in 1873-74; the Zenana Bible and Medical mission opened a high school for girls at Girgaum in 1874; while the Frere-Fletcher school in the Fort, so named after Sir Bartle Frere and the Reverend W. K. Fletcher, was opened by Sir Richard Temple in 1878. Other notable features of this period were the opening of the first railway school in 1878 by the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway company, and the institution of night schools. Among the latter, two commenced work in 1873-74 without any aid from Government, while between 1878 and 1886 the Theistic Association started no less than six night-schools, the first being opened at Cheulwadi near Thakurdwar in the former year.\n\nThe number of mixed schools for children of both sexes was increased by the establishment of an Israelite school in 1875, financed by the Bene-Israel Benevolent Society, and of the American Mission high school, which commenced work in 1877. The Sir J. J. School of Art which up to 1873-74 was managed by a committee as an aided institution was in that year re-organized and placed under the control of the Educational Department. Lastly the period was remarkable for the foundation and recognition in 1875 of the Anjuman-i-Islam, which has since played a prominent part in the education of the Muhammadan population of the city. A fresh stimulus was given to physical education by the foundation in 1874 by public contribution of the Jamsetji Nasarwanji Petit gymnasium at Khetwadi.\n\nIn the year 1882 an Education Commission was appointed by Government to enquire into the working of the existing system of public instruction and into the further extension of that system on a popular basis. They recommended inter alia that the system of payment by results should not be applied to colleges, which should obtain aid\n\n---\n\n1 The school was established in 1860, and was known as the Fort Christian school. The name was changed to Frere-Fletcher school in 1878 with the consent of Government, who contributed to the cost of the building and granted the site.\non other considerations; that secondary schools should be established by the State on the grant-in aid system; that primary education should have an exclusive claim on municipal and local funds; that, as many private schools were inefficient, the grant by results should be raised for both boys' and girls' schools; and that the maximum rate of Government aid, which they fixed at one-half the entire expenditure of an institution, should be allotted only to primary schools, girls' schools and normal schools. As a result of the commission's labours, the grant-in-aid code was amended and republished in 1886-87, among the additions made being rules requiring all candidates for admission to a Government or aided school to furnish leaving certificates from their last school; the examinations for public service certificates were modified in 1888; and in the same year certain recommendations of the commission regarding middle and high school scholarships were adopted, four middle schools and two high school scholarships being allotted to Bombay city. The subject of training college certificates was also discussed, and as a result an additional or first year's certificate was created in 1887, which enabled men, who fared badly in the first year's test, to serve at once as lower assistant schoolmasters. But the most noteworthy result of the commission's labours was the foundation of the Joint Schools Committee for the purpose of primary education in Bombay city, which, in accordance with the City of Bombay Municipal Act of 1888, was composed of eight members, four being appointed by Government and four by the Municipal Corporation. Bye-laws defining the committee's duties and powers were framed and sanctioned by Government, and on the 1st January, 1890, all primary schools in Bombay together with appliances, as well as\n\n---\n\n1 This first year's certificate was abolished in 1895. The maximum and minimum salaries of teachers holding first, second and third years' certificates were fixed, respectively, at Rs. 20, Rs. 40, Rs. 60, and Rs. 9, Rs. 11, and Rs. 15.\n\n2 The first Joint Schools Committee was composed of Mr. Grattan Geary, the Honorable Mr. N. N. Wadia, Rao Bahadur G. N. Nadkarni, Rao Saheb V. S. Desai, appointed by Government, and Dr. Blaney, the Honorable Mr. Telang, the Honourable Mr. Abdulla M. Dharamsi and Mr. K. N. Kabraji, appointed by the Corporation.\nthe balance of the Presidency Education fund, composed of school-fees, Government grants and Municipal contributions, were handed over by Government to the Corporation. Among the Government schools transferred to them were eleven girls' schools and six second-grade anglo-vernacular schools, to which they added in 1893-94 an Anglo-Gujarathi school at Nall Bazaar. In return for performing the work of inspection of primary schools, the Committee received from Government the annual sum which Government had budgetted for this purpose, before the transfer took place, and were further allowed to utilize the services of the two Government officials who had hitherto acted as Deputy Inspectors of the Marathi and Gujarathi schools.\n\nThis period witnessed the foundation by Bishop Meurin in 1886 of a school for the deaf and dumb at Grant road, and also the amalgamation of the four Government anglo-vernacular schools, the Fort Branch, the Jagannath Shankarsett, Chandanwadi and Phanaswadi schools, into the Elphinstone middle school, which is located in the old buildings of the former Elphinstone Institution next door to the Small Causes Court. The latter event arose out of the desire of Government in nowise to restrict the progress of grant-in-aid and private schools. The public also commenced during these years to evince a desire for special and scientific research by the foundation of the Bombay Natural History Society in 1885, of the Anthropological Society in 1886, and of the Bombay Art Society in 1888; while Government opened fresh careers for the youth of Bombay by the foundation of the Veterinary College at Parel in 1886 and of the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute in 1887.\n\nThe most remarkable features since 1897 were the amendment of the constitution of the Indian Universities and the declaration of the educational policy of the Indian Government in 1903-04. The further extension and development of the principles laid down in the Despatch of 1854 and affirmed by the Commission of 1882 have been sought and ensured by a variety of means calculated to infuse primary and secondary education with new vitality. Thus in 1899 an annual examination for teachers in secondary\nschools was instituted; the grant-in-aid code was again revised in 1903-04 and the system of payment by results finally abolished; considerably increased grants have been made to primary and secondary education; the work of the vernacular text books revision committee has been completed, and some of the revised works are already in use in primary schools; the method of assessing grants to secondary schools has been revised; while the formal recognition of unaided schools has enabled the Educational Department to apply a moderate system of control to those institutions. In Bombay city we may remark the appointment in 1903 of an Inspectress of girls' schools, who also supervises the girls' schools of the Northern Division of the Presidency, and the appointment by the Joint Schools Committee in 1904 of a Superintendent of municipal schools with two assistants.\u00b9 A Teachers' association was formed in 1898 with the object of improving the status and qualifications of school-masters and of discussing the educational questions of the day;\u00b2 a training college for secondary school-teachers was opened in 1906 and accommodated for the time being in the Elphinstone high school: and under the auspices of the Joint Schools Committee, drill, physical education and gymnastics are becoming a regular branch of the curriculum in all classes of schools. Since April 1st, 1908, the cost of primary education has been wholly defrayed by the Bombay Municipality. The Joint Schools Committee has ceased to exist and the schools are now administered by the Municipality.\n\nThe most noteworthy girls' school, founded by private enterprize during this period, were Bai Ratanbai Panday's school opened in 1898 and Miss Bennett's anglo-veracular school at Khetwadi: but that the general progress of the age is gradually overcoming the inherited prejudice against female education is sufficiently proved by the rise in the number of municipal girls' schools from 11 to 25 and of aided girls' schools from 25 to 33 in 1909.\n\n\u00b9 The control of the three Deputy Educational Inspectors serving under the Joint Schools Committee was transferred to the Educational Department in 1904.\n\u00b2 The total number of teachers in the Bombay Municipal Schools is (1909) 386.\nThe Muhammadans also have imbibed something of the spirit of the times. Two new Urdu schools were opened in 1895 at Colaba and Madanpura, a Deputy Educational Inspector for Urdu schools was appointed the following year, and by 1909 the total number of Urdu schools had increased to 28 (25 for boys and 3 for girls), including 3 night-schools but excluding 2 aided primary Urdu schools. The Joint Schools Committee also turned their attention to the education of the depressed classes, not only by aiding mission schools which receive such children, but by founding four special Marathi schools for their benefit,\u2014a policy which resulted in 857 children from the poorest and most debased communities being under instruction in 1909.\n\nAmong special educational institutions recently founded are the American Mission school for the blind opened in 1900 and the Victoria Memorial school for the blind\u2014a primary school with industrial classes\u2014opened in 1902; the American Mission laundry school opened in 1903, the Techno-Chemical Laboratory founded by Professor Gujjar in 1900 for the provision of higher instruction in chemistry and technology; and lastly several institutions for commercial education. The principal seat of commercial education is the Byramji Jijibhoy college of commerce, the Principal of which also conducts a commercial night-school, founded in 1900; and the rest comprise Mr. S. R. Davar's commercial educational institution, which works on the bureau system obtaining at Antwerp, Paris, Berlin and Liverpool and prepares pupils for the chief commercial and accountancy examinations in England, and Mr. N. R. Mistri's accountancy institution in the Fort, which imparts a knowledge of book-keeping, mercantile law, banking and currency, short-hand, type-writing and mensuration to youths studying at local colleges or holding clerical appointments in mercantile firms. Several short-hand, type-writing, and book-keeping classes in the Fort, Kalbadevi and Girgaum\n\n---\n\n1 These and a Deaf and Dumb institute opened in 1886 are classed as Primary aided schools.\n2 This is now classed as an Arts College.\n3 In 1908 a series of lectures were arranged and Professor Lees Smith was invited by Government of Bombay to deliver lectures and instruct the public in Indian economics. The lectures were delivered in the Byramji Cawasji Institute.\nprepare students for the London Chamber of Commerce examination, which is annually held in Bombay, while stenotypy or machine short-hand and script phonography have also been introduced into the curriculum of a few schools. The increasing desire for a commercial education is shown by the large number of youths who appeared for the London Chamber of Commerce examination in 1906, and has led Government to include commerce in the list of optional subjects for the School Final Examination.\n\nAmong the secondary schools opened since 1897 are the Aryan Education Society's high school and middle school at Girgaum, the Esplanade high and middle schools opened in 1898, a school founded in Mandvi by H.H. the Aga Khan for children of the Imaimi Ismaili Khoja community, the Lady Northcote Hindu orphanage in 1903, the Goan Union school opened in old Dabul Church in 1904, and a Jain high school founded by Babu Pannalal Punamchand in 1906. The municipal grant to primary education rose from Rs. 80,000 in 1898-99 to 2 lakhs in 1909; and, together with the income from fees and the Government contribution of nearly Rs. 73,000, enabled the Joint Schools Committee to increase the number of municipal schools to 98 and of aided schools to 111, to strengthen the teaching-staff and raise their salaries, and to provide suitable furniture and apparatus to the municipal schools. The Committee also revised the curriculum for primary schools in 1900, whereby the course ceases at the fourth standard in which the rudiments of English are taught, uniformity of instruction in Marathi, Gujarathi and Urdu schools has been secured, and the pupils' burden of study has been to their advantage much lightened.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation has also not forgotten the prime need of proper school-buildings and accommodation. Prior to 1890 all primary schools, excepting two at Ghorupdeo and Varli, were located in hired buildings, and even at the present date (1909) most of the primary schools and a certain number of aided secondary schools occupy inconvenient or insanitary houses. On the other\n\n---\n\n1 The minimum pay of untrained teachers in Municipal primary schools is Rs. 12, and the maximum Rs. 15. Trained teachers receive a minimum salary of Rs.14 and a maximum of Rs.30, Rs. 50, or Rs. 70 according to the class of their training-certificates.\nhand the Bhuleshwar schools were provided with a suitable building about 1890, half the cost of which was contributed by Government. A buildings fund was opened by the Corporation in 1895, two well-constructed and sanitary buildings were erected from the memorial funds raised to Lord Harris, Governor of Bombay (1890-95) and Mr. S. S. Bengali, and in order to meet the need of housing the municipal primary schools, a programme for expenditure of 10 lakhs on the construction of school buildings was undertaken in 1907 by the Corporation at the instance of Government, who decided to provide a moiety of the cost at the rate of one lakh a year for five years from April 1907. There is, therefore every reason for hoping that the primary schools will in the near future be as well accommodated as the Government and aided colleges and the Government secondary schools.\n\nBesides the Government, municipal and private institutions, conducted on Western lines, Bombay contains several indigenous schools, conducted by natives of India on traditional methods, which fall within the triple classification of religious, semi-religious, and secular schools. Among the religious schools are the Shri Wal-keshwar Vedic Pathashala established in 1903 on Malabar\n\n---\n\n1 One most important institution is a class for training Sanitary Surveyors under the Executive Health Officer of the Bombay Municipality. This class was first opened in 1901 and was till recently confined to 12 Government students, of whom 8 were Engineering graduates and 4 Medical graduates. Their fees at the rate of Rs. 25 were paid by Government. If a sufficient number of the above were not available diplomates of the Veterinary College and passed students of the Engineering class of the Sind College were admitted into the class. Since the beginning of 1910 the Royal Sanitary Institute of London has agreed to co-operate in the examination of the class and to grant its certificates to the successful students. The class has now been thrown open to private students who have passed the Matriculation or School Final Examination or the entrance examination of any university other than Bombay. In order that the Municipalities may take advantage of these facilities, their servants are exempted from the preliminary qualifications at the discretion of the Executive Health Officer. The Bombay University has recently established a degree of Bachelor of Hygiene, one of the conditions, for qualifications to sit as a candidate for the degree being a six months practical course of Public health administration under the supervision of the Health Officers of Bombay, Calcutta or Madras. Similarly a class has been opened by the Bombay Municipality to impart instruction to medical students in vaccination.\nHill, which teaches young Brahmans, the Hindu ritual, the Jijibhoy Dadabhoy Parsi Madressa founded in 1837 for the teaching of the Zoroastrian Scriptures in the original Zend and later Pehlvi versions, and about 131 Muhammadan schools which expound the Koran and teach a little Urdu. The partly religious schools are the Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit Pathashala, established about 1886 near the Gowalia Tank, the Valibai Gujarathi and Sanskrit girls' school opened at Kalbadevi about 1891, the Ayurveda Vidyalaya, established at Girgaum in 1896, the Vidya Lakshmi Pathashala opened at Bhuleshwar in 1897, the Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy's Zarthoshti Madressa, founded in 1863 at Chandanwadi, which teaches Parsi graduates and under-graduates the religion, philosophy and history of the Avesta, the Mulla Firoz Madressa founded in 1854 at Dhobi Talao, and about 20 Muhammadan institutions. The most important of the latter are the Madressa Mahomed Ibrahim Makhba, established in Kazi street in 1834, the Madressa Muhammadiya, established by Sir Adamji Peerbhoy in 1883, opposite Charni Road station, the Madressa Muhammadiya of the Jama Masjid, founded in 1873, and the Madressa Hashimiya at the Jackeria Masjid, all of which give free instruction in religion, logic, Arabic, metaphysics, Persian literature, and the theology of Islam.\n\nThe secular schools, which number (1909) 75, and are institutions peculiar to the Hindu community, are practically primary vernacular schools which have gradually cast aside their time-honoured curricula in favour of the Government departmental standards of instruction, the reason for the change being that almost all the masters now appointed are men, who have received a Government public school education. Most of the Hindu and Parsi schools in the first two classes, and a few Muhammadan schools, have been privately endowed, and in some of the latter, conducted by Maulvis, no fees are charged to the pupils. Usually the fees vary from four annas to Rs. 2, and the master receives his emoluments either in kind or in cash, but more frequently in both forms. He also is accustomed to receive presents on the occasion of a pupil's patipuja or slate-ceremony, thread ceremony and marriage, and on the day when a pupil begins to learn writing,\nwhile in some Muhammadan schools he receives one pice and a wheaten cake from each pupil every Thursday.\n\nThe following table shows the number of schools and pupils in Bombay City at successive decades since 1820 and in 1909:\n\n| Year | High Schools | Middle Schools | Primary Schools | Special Schools |\n|------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n|      | Number | Attendance | Number | Attendance | Number | Attendance | Number | Attendance |\n| 1820 | Boys    |            | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1830 | Boys    | 1*         | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1840 | Boys    | 550        | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1850 | Boys    | 916        | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1860 | Boys    | 901        | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1870 | Boys    | 2,994      | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1880 | Boys    | 3,539      | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1890 | Boys    | 8,829      | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1900 | Boys    | 7,682      | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n| 1909 | Boys    | 11,176     | Girls   |            |        |            |        |            |\n\n* This High School is the Elphinstone Institution.\n\u2020 These Middle Schools are the Education Society Schools. The primary schools of 1820 belonged to the Bombay Education Society, those in 1830 to the Native Education Society, and those in 1840 and 1850 to the Board of Education. No accurate information about missionary and private schools during these years is available. They are therefore omitted.\n\u2021 This was a normal school for female teachers and was afterwards closed.\n\nThe University of Bombay was first established and incorporated by an Act of 1857. The general object of the foundation was to ascertain, for the better encouragement of Her Majesty's subjects in Bombay in the pursuit of a regular and liberal course of education, by means of examination, the persons who have acquired proficiency in different branches of learning and to reward them by degrees, marks of honour, etc. The constitution was considerably modified by an Act of 1904.\nThe University consists of the Chancellor, who is the Governor of Bombay for the time being, the Vice-Chancellor, who is appointed for a period of two years by the Governor-in-Council from among the Fellows, and the Fellows. These constitute the Senate.\n\nFellows are *ex-officio*, nominated and elected. The *ex-officio* Fellows, the number of whom may not exceed ten, are the Chief Justice, the Bishop of Bombay, the two Members of Council, and the Director of Public Instruction. Of the ordinary Fellows, the number of whom may not be less than fifty nor more than a hundred, ten are elected by certain registered graduates, *viz.*, by Doctors or Masters in any Faculty or by others who graduated in any Faculty not less than ten years before the date of registration, ten are elected by the Faculties, and the remainder are nominated by the Chancellor. Fellows are elected or nominated in the first instance for five years, but they may be re-elected or re-appointed. But, if any elected or nominated Fellow has not attended a meeting of the Senate, other than a Convocation or meeting for conferring degrees, during the period of one year, the Chancellor may declare his office to be vacated.\n\nThe Senate is divided into the Faculties of Arts including Science, Law, Medicine and Engineering. The last includes Agriculture. Every Fellow is assigned by the Senate, on the recommendation of the Syndicate, to one or more of the Faculties. Each Faculty is presided over by a Dean, who is elected by the members of the Faculty. The chief business of the Faculties is to advise and report upon matters referred to them for opinion by the Syndicate. They can also make recommendations to the Syndicate or propose Bye-laws or Regulations for the consideration of the Syndicate.\n\nThe Syndicate is the executive body of the University. It consists of the Vice-Chancellor, as Chairman, the Director of Public Instruction, and thirteen Fellows who are elected for one year by the several Faculties in the following proportion:\n\nFive by the Faculty of Arts, one of whom is elected separately to represent the Physical and Experimental Sciences.\nThree by the Faculty of Law.\nThree by the Faculty of Medicine.\nTwo by the Faculty of Engineering.\n\nAny member of the Senate may make recommendations or propose bye-laws to the Syndicate, and no proposal may be entertained by the Senate that has not, in the first instance, been considered by the Syndicate or submitted for a period of at least three months for consideration by the Syndicate. Very wide powers are in fact exercised by the Syndicate, but it is by law subject in all matters to control by the Senate, and no regulations have any force until they are approved by the Senate, and confirmed by the Governor-in-Council. The Senate must meet once a year, but the Vice-Chancellor, who presides as Chairman if present, may summon a meeting at any time, and must do so on the requisition of any six members.\n\nThe entrance to the University is by the Matriculation examination, which is open to candidates from schools recognized by the University, who are over 16 years of age. After Matriculation none can present themselves for any University examination, unless they have gone through a prescribed course of study at a College affiliated to the University and recognized for the purpose of that course of study; affiliation and recognition are accorded by Government, acting on reports and information submitted to them by the Senate.

Sc.\u2014four years; LL.B.\u2014two years after graduation in Arts; Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery (soon to be abolished)\u2014five years; Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery\u2014six years; Bachelor of Agriculture\u2014four years; Bachelor of Engineering\u2014four years.\n\nAny Bachelor of Arts may present himself for the examination for the Degree of M.A. Any Bachelor of Laws may, two years after taking the Degree of LL.B., present himself for the examination for the Degree of Master of Laws. After going through certain prescribed courses of study or practice, varying from five years to one year, a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery may present himself for the examination for the Doctor's Degree (M.D.). The examination for the Degree of Master of Civil Engineering is open to any Bachelor of Arts or Science who has practised as a Civil Engineer for at least three years after taking the Degree of L.C.E. (now B.E.)\n\nThe University may also, under certain conditions, confer honorary degrees. The honorary Degree of LL.D. has been conferred five times.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The recipients of this honour were the Marquis of Ripon, Mr. William Wordsworth, Sir Raymond West, Mr. R.G. Bhandarkar and Mr. F.G. Selby.\nThe accounts of the University are examined and audited by a Board of Accounts, which is appointed annually by the Senate and meets ordinarily once a quarter. They are further submitted once every year to the Governor of Bombay in Council for such examination and audit as he may direct.\n\nThe endowments of the University, the interest on which is appropriated to certain fellowships, scholarships and prizes amount to thirteen lakhs. The yearly income is derived from interest on accumulation, and examination fees. The last account sheet showed an income of 2.25 lakhs and an expenditure of 1.89 lakhs.\n\nUniversity Results.\n\n| Passed in | 1861 | 1871 | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1909 | Total number passed till the end of 1909 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|----------------------------------------|\n| Matriculation | 39   | 227  | 388  | 916  | 1,218| 1,638| 34,331                                 |\n| Bachelor of Arts | 4    | 14   | 36   | 129  | 238  | 331  | 5,533                                  |\n| Bachelor of Science | -    | -    | 2    | 3    | 6    | 14   | 156                                    |\n| Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery | 4    | 6    | 14   | 22   | 28   | 89   | 1,064                                  |\n| Licentiate of Agriculture | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 52                                     |\n| Bachelor of Agriculture | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 26                                     |\n| Licentiate of Engineering | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 26                                     |\n| Bachelor of Laws | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 747                                    |\n| Master of Laws | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 1,788                                  |\n| Master of Arts | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 1                                      |\n| Doctor of Medicine | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 9                                      |\n| Master of Civil Engineering | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | -    | 1                                      |\n\nThe Elphinstone College originated in a meeting of the citizens of Bombay held on the 28th August, 1828, to\n\n---\n\n1 See The Elphinstonian, September, 1906; Bombay Quarterly Review, 1855; Times of India, 10th May, 1863, 20th January, 1894, April 3rd, 1897; April 1906. Mrs. Postans' Western India in 1838, I, 46; Lady Falkland's Chow-chow (1857) I, 49.\ndecide upon a suitable testimonial to their departing Governor, Mountstuart Elphinstone, whom, in the words of one of those present, all persons regarded \"as their common father and friend\". A sum of Rs. 50,276 subscribed at the meeting was devoted to the cause of education in accordance with a general resolution \"that the most satisfactory and durable plan of carrying their public wishes into effect is by accumulating a fund of money to be vested in Government securities from the interest of which, according to its amount, one or more Professorships (to be held by gentlemen from Great Britain until the happy period arrives when natives shall be fully competent to hold them) be established under the Bombay Native Education Society, for teaching the English language and the arts and sciences of Europe; and that these Professorships in compliment to the person in reference to whom the meeting has been convened, be denominated the Elphinstone Professorships\". The final amount subscribed reached a total of nearly 23 lakhs, which subsequently accumulated to Rs. 44 lakhs; and in 1835 the Elphinstone Institution was formally constituted, the first Professors arriving and commencing their labours in February, 1836. In 1855, the first Native Professor, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, was appointed; and in the following year the professorial element, constituting the College, was separated from the Elphinstone Institution, which thenceforth was known as the Elphinstone High School. The Elphinstone College was formally recognized by the Bombay University in 1860. Since 1845 the office of Principal of the College has been held in succession by Dr. Harkness (1845), Sir Alexander Grant (1862), Professor Chatfield (1866), Dr. Wordsworth (1874), Professor Oxenham (1890), Professor Hathornthwaite (1894), Professor Macmillan (1900), Professor Sharp (1905) and Professor Covernton (1909).\n\nSeveral changes of situation has the College undergone since its foundation in 1835. The first Professors in 1836 occupied a room in the Town Hall, the Elphinstone Institution itself being housed in a building described in 1855 as \"a disgrace to the present advanced state of education in Bombay\"; and as being \"overcrowded, badly\nsituating and unventilated\". This building stood near the present Small Cause Court on the site of the Elphinstone Middle School; and a few months after the above words were penned the College was removed to more commodious premises, to the west of Babula Tank and opposite to the Grant Medical College and the Jamsetji Jijibhoy Hospital. Here the College remained until 1861-62, when a move was made to a bungalow, now known as Tanker Villa, on the margin of Gowalia Tank; and thence the institution again migrated in 1871 to a new building on the Parel road, now occupied by the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute. In 1888 the College experienced its final transfer to the Fort, where it occupies half of a building originally intended for the Government Central Press, the adjoining plot of vacant land being used as a playing-field by the students of the College. Government have however recently decided to utilize this plot for a new college of science and has offered in its place the use of a plot on the Oval facing the Secretariat. The present college buildings have been found small and inconvenient and the question of another transfer has sometime been under discussion.\n\nThe property and endowments of the College are vested in four trustees, the annual income amounting to about Rs. 96,000, of which Rs. 16,000 represent the income of endowments proper. Nearly Rs. 40,000 are received as fees, and the balance represents a grant from Government. Besides the original endowment for Elphinstone Professorships, there are three scholarship funds, two in memory of Sir Raymond West, formerly Chief Justice of Bombay, and the Earl of Clare, and the third established by H. H. the Gaekwar of Baroda, and nine prize funds for excellence in Natural Science, Sanskrit, English, Mathe-\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Quarterly Review, 1855, p. 123.\n\n2 This house was razed to the ground in 1904. A new chawl has been erected on the site.\n\n3 The proposal to open a central Science Institute or College of Science is still (1910) under consideration. Municipal offers have been received from Sir Jacob Sassoon (Rs. 10,00,000), Sir Currimbhoy Ebrahim (Rs. 4,50,000) and Mr. Chunial Madhavlal of Ahmadabad (Rs. 4,00,000).\nmatics or History. Forty-five scholarships, varying in value from Rs. 9 to Rs. 20 per month, are annually awarded, while Government maintain six Dakshina Fellowships of Rs. 50 per month apiece, for the encouragement of graduates preparing for higher degrees. The latter assist the ordinary staff in the supervision and tuition of the students. The College tuition-fee is Rs. 60 per half-year.\n\nThe subjoined table shows the number of students, amount of fees and total expenditure of the College at different periods:\n\n| Year   | Number of Students | Amount of Fees | Total Expenditure |\n|--------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| 1870-71 | ...                | 133            | 9,243             | 73,538            |\n| 1880-81 | ...                | 175            | 16,757            | 80,385            |\n| 1890-91 | ...                | 253            | 22,174            | 94,954            |\n| 1900-01 | ...                | 300            | 34,476            | 71,291            |\n| 1908-09 | ...                | 365            | 40,394            | 93,218            |\n\nThe courses taught are those for the degrees of B.A. and M.A. and also (when necessary) of B. Sc., lectures being given in English, Sanskrit, Persian, French, Logic and Moral Philosophy, English and Indian History, Political Economy, Mathematics, Physics, Botany, Zoology and Chemistry. Between 1862 and 1909 the number who obtained the B.A. degree was 1,130 and the M.A. degree, 122. The tutorial staff comprises five European professors, who are members of the Indian Educational Service, six Native professors, a Shastri for Sanskrit, an assistant teacher of Persian, and a Librarian who also acts as Superintendent of the College hostel. The hostel, to which a new wing has recently been added in memory of the late Mr. Justice Telang, is situated about a quarter of a mile from the main building and accommodates about one-third of the total number of students now on the rolls. The residents in the hostel pay a half-yearly fee of Rs. 23 for rent, lights, service, etc., in addition to the tuition-fee. Other noteworthy adjuncts of the College are the library, containing about 10,000 volumes, to the upkeep of which Government contributes Rs. 1,500 a year.\nand the physical, chemical and biological laboratories, of which the first-named is now fully equipped for the use of students preparing for the B. A. degree. Membership of the College Gymkhana Club affords the students ample means of recreation, for the College cricket team has won the Northcote Challenge Shield four times, and the hockey team is regularly entered for the annual Aga Khan Hockey Tournament.\n\nThe Wilson College owes its origin to an English school opened in 1832 in Military Square in the Fort by the late Dr. John Wilson, who collected a public subscription for this purpose, and conducted the school jointly with the Reverend Robert Nesbit. In 1835 the Church of Scotland officially recognised the school, which thenceforth was styled the General Assembly's Institution; the standard of instruction was gradually raised, and under the auspices of a staff, which included the founder, Mr. Nesbit and Dr. Murray Mitchell, the school attained in those pre-university days to the status of a college, carrying its pupils far beyond the high school stage of English education. A commodious building was then erected by public subscription near Ramwadi, Kalbadevi road; but in 1843, when the building was just completed, the Disruption took place, which divided the Church of Scotland into the Free and Established Churches, and to the latter Church the building passed under its old name. Here the Established Church conducted a high school for many years, until the trustees of the Gokuldas Tejpal charities purchased the building and devoted it to the high school which they still maintain.\n\nMeanwhile the Free Church, to which Dr. Wilson and his colleagues adhered, had to find a new home for their educational work. A building was erected in Khetwadi near Ambroli House, in which Dr. Wilson spent the greater portion of his life; and this building, which was long known as the Free General Assembly's Institution, accommodated both a school and a higher section, which was recognized by the University as an affiliated College in 1861. By 1880 the largely-increased number of pupils\n\n---\n\n1 The school was familiarly known to Bombay residents as \"the school of the four pillars,\" in allusion to four massive pillars which formed a conspicuous feature of the building.\nled the authorities to decide upon separating the school from the college and upon housing the latter in a new building. In 1882 Dr. Mackichan undertook the task of raising the requisite funds in Scotland, and collected about \u00a36,000, to which several Native Chiefs of Western India added donations in memory of Dr. Wilson. The Government of Bombay at the same time granted Rs. 87,000 towards the cost of the building and also the site at Chaupati on which the Wilson College now stands. The foundation-stone was laid by Sir James Fergusson on the 10th March, 1885, and the building, designed by Mr. John Adams, was formally opened by Lord Reay on the 14th March, 1889. The original plan included a block of students' quarters, to which additions were afterwards made, thus raising the total cost to more than 2 lakhs: and fresh extensions, costing Rs. 50,000, have recently been made. A large piece of ground on Kennedy Sea Face has been assigned to the College for Gymkhana purposes. The old building in Khetwadi, which was handed over to the high school, has been enlarged by the addition of a third storey, and is now known as the Wilson High School.\n\nThe number of pupils in the College rose from 18 in 1870-71 to 64 in 1880-81, 223 in 1890-91. In the next five years the numbers rose rapidly to over 500; but the outbreak of plague at the end of 1896 drove many students away from Bombay Colleges. Subsequent figures are 376 in 1900-01, 425 in 1905-06, and to 518 in 1909. The staff consists of the Principal and 14 professors who teach the courses for B. A., B. Sc., and M. A. degrees, as laid down by the Bombay University. Of these nine are Europeans. Laboratories for practical work are attached to the College, which has prepared 929 graduates since its affiliation. The roll of the College also includes 31 lady-students, of whom 19 are Parsis, 8 Hindus, 3 Christians and one is a Muhammadan. The College is supported partly by fees and partly by a Government grant and contributions by the Free Church of Scotland.\n\nSt. Xavier's College was founded in 1868 with the object of educating the Roman Catholic youths of the Bombay Presidency, and was affiliated to the Bombay University in\nthe year following.\u00b9 Though primarily intended for the benefit of followers of the Roman Catholic faith, the College from the outset admitted students of other denominations, and consisted of two distinct portions, the High School and the College proper, which were both accommodated in a building in Cavel until 1873. In that year the large building, situated on the Carnac road, near the Framji Cowasji Institute, was completed at a cost of 26 lakhs, the amount being met by public subscription and by a grant of Rs. 61,308 from the Bombay Government; and here both the School and College were located for nearly a generation. The building is composed of two wings, divided by a quadrangle, but linked by a central block surmounted by a tower, 120 feet in height.\n\nBy 1885 the need of further accommodation made itself felt, and, as a temporary measure, the College boarding establishment was transferred to St. Mary's Institution at Mazagon. A small block had been added to the east wing in 1883 to serve as chemical laboratory; but the difficulties arising from pressure of space were not definitely obviated till 1890, when the existing College building on Cruickshank road between the Elphinstone High school and the Cama Hospital was completed at a cost of more than 1\u00bd lakhs. From 1891 to 1900, the lower division of the High school was accommodated in the new building but since the latter date the whole school has been in occupation of its old quarters, and the new building has been exclusively reserved for the College. While lacking the large hall, which is so marked a feature of the older building, the College premises contain several lecture-rooms, physical, chemical and biological laboratories, as also library and residential quarters for the professors, who are nearly all Jesuit Fathers.\n\nThe number of students at decennial periods since the foundation of the College has been as follows:\u2014in 1870,\n\n\u00b9 The funds for its foundation were obtained by public subscription, one of the chief promoters of the movement being Dr. Leo Meurin, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bombay, from 1867 to 1886. The first Principal of the College was the Rev. Father J. A. Willy.\nIn March 1909, the number amounted to 372, the increase being most marked in the case of students for the M.A. degree. From 1873, when the first student from the College passed the M.A. examination, down to 1900, the College could boast of only 22 Masters of Arts, while, during years 1900 to 1909, 57 students have taken this degree, and the Chancellor's Medal\u2014one of the most coveted honours in the University\u2014has been awarded five times to students of St. Xavier's. Up to 1903 the College possessed only 4 endowed scholarships, but by the help of some of the friends and old students of the College that number has been raised to 16 and since 1891 three fellowships from the Dakshina Fund have been placed at the disposal of graduates of the College. An annual grant-in-aid of about Rs. 10,000 is received from Government. The professorial staff consists of the members of the Society of Jesus and four Indian professors.\n\nThe new college hostel was opened in June 1909; it stands on a plot of 5,000 square yards adjoining the College grounds granted to them by Government for this purpose. The College and High school are independent of one another. St. Xavier's High school contains about 1,400 boys, who are educated up to the Matriculation standard, and some of whom after passing the Matriculation examination continue their studies in the College. The High school, like the College, receives an annual grant from Government of Rs. 10,000. The income from fees amounts in the case of the College to about Rs. 30,000 and in the case of the High school to about Rs. 45,000, which together with the Government grants is spent upon maintenance.\n\nThe Grant Medical College, situated at the junction of Parel and Babula Tank roads was founded in 1845 in memory of Sir Robert Grant, Governor of Bombay\n\n---\n\n1 The Foundation-stone of the College was laid by the Bishop of Calcutta on March 30th, 1843. Beneath the stone was laid a silver plate bearing the following inscription:\u2014\"In the reign of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria and under the Government of the Honourable Sir George Arthur, Bart., K.C.H., Governor of Bombay, the foundation-stone of the Grant Medical College to be erected on this spot at the joint expense of the Honourable East India Company and of true friends of the late Right Honourable Sir Robert Grant, G.C.H., in memory of eminent Christian virtues, and the just and enlightened administra-\n(1835-38), with the object of \"imparting, through a scientific system, the benefit of medical instruction to the natives of Western India\". A moiety of the cost of the building was defrayed by Sir Robert Grant's friends, the remainder by Government. With the exception of certain endowments for the encouragement of deserving students, the College is entirely supported by Government, and is under the immediate control of a Principal, subordinate to the Director of Public Instruction. Lectures are delivered in English on every branch of medical science by European and native Professors, the former usually being members of the Indian Medical Service, assisted by Lecturers and Tutors and Fellows of the College, who are generally Licentiates of Medicine and Surgery of the Bombay University, and by Honorary Medical Officers. The present teaching staff consists of nine European and two native Professors, one European and one native lecturer, one Demonstrator (belonging to the cadre of Civil Assistant Surgeons) and 26 tutors and fellows. Besides there are Honorary Medical Officers who give clinical instruction to students at the hospitals of the city. Formerly the College conferred upon its students a diploma or license to practice medicine with the designation of \"Graduates of the Grant Medical College;\" but in 1860 the College was affiliated to the University as an institution for medical education and therefore ceased to grant such diplomas. Attached to the College is a Laboratory for scientific medical research, the gift of Mr. Framji Dinsha Petit, which was opened in 1891.\n\nThe students fall into two classes, namely, those who are graduates and under-graduates of the Bombay University or of any other University recognised by the latter, and who are educated for the medical degrees of M.D., L.M. & S.,\n\ntion of that distinguished person, was laid with solemn prayer to Almighty God by Daniel, Bishop of Calcutta and Metropolitan of India on Thursday, March 30th, 1843, in the presence of the Governor and other chief personages of the Presidency of Bombay, Captain W. B Goodfellow, Bombay Engineers, Architect. Times of India, 22nd April, 1843. A medical school had been started in 1825 by Mr. Elphinstone's Government and placed in charge of Dr. McLennan. This scheme was developed by Sir Robert Grant. Prior to 1845 medical science was confined entirely to the members of the covenanted medical service.\nand M. B. B. S., and European and Eurasian students, who are selected by competitive examination at various Indian centres and who are educated at Government expense for the grade of Military Assistant Surgeon. Since the establishment of the College, 51 Graduates with the old collegiate diploma, 974 Licentiates of Medicine and Surgery, and 7 holders of the M. D. degree have passed through the course. The total number of students during the last four decades and in the year 1908-09 is shown in the following table:\n\n| Year    | Number of Students |\n|---------|--------------------|\n|         | Civil | Military |\n| 1870-71 | 95    | 164     |\n| 1880-81 | 238   | 42      |\n| 1890-91 | 178   | 25      |\n| 1900-01 | 401   | 38      |\n| 1908-09 | 482   | 44      |\n\nThe average annual income of the College during the last five years was Rs. 78,470, and the expenditure was nearly 1\u00bd lakhs. The latter includes the emoluments of the Professors, most of whom receive a consolidated salary as Professors of the College and Medical Officers of the attached hospitals. The College is endowed with 30 separate scholarship and prize funds, amounting in the aggregate to Rs. 1,85,000, out of which Rs. 1,11,300 are lodged with Government and the remainder with trustees appointed by Government.\n\nNo public libraries existed in Bombay during the 18th century; but the Company appear to have maintained a library for their own use as early as 1715. The Reverend Richard Cobbe, writing to the Directors, remarked: \"I have sent your Honours a catalogue of books contained\n\n---\n\n1 The course of study for the M. B. B.

M. & S. course are stopped.\nin the Honourable Company's library with an account of such as were by the Governor and Council thought wanting, requesting the same may be sent over or any other books Your Honours shall think more useful and necessary\". In 1804, the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (then the Literary Society) established its library, and between that date and the middle of the century some ten libraries sprang into existence. Among these were the Mulla Firoz library, established in 1831, to receive a bequest of manuscripts from one Datna Mulla Feroz, which mostly contains books and manuscripts dealing with the Zoroastrian religion and is free to all, and the Native General Library, which was established in 1845, in a hired house in Dhobi Talao, and was patronized by all sections of inhabitants. Another institution of this period was the Native Book Club, which was accommodated in a room of the General Assembly's Institution. Many fresh institutions of this character were founded during the latter half of the 19th century, among the first and most popular being the J. N. Petit Institute, which originated in a reading-room opened by Parsi students.\n\nThe most flourishing Musalman institutions are the M. J. Khoja Library and the library of the Anjuman-i-Islam. A statement giving details of the chief libraries existing in Bombay City will be found as an appendix at the end of this chapter.\n\n---\n\n1 The Church of Bombay by Cobbe.\n2 There is a reference to a circulating library in 1860 in the Bombay Courier.\n3 The meeting to establish the Library was held in a house near Trinity Chapel, Dhobi Talao; and the first Managing Committee consisted of 7 European and 7 Native gentlemen. The number of members and subscribers was 70. When the Framji Cowasji Hall was opened, it was arranged to incorporate the Native General Library with it. In 1865 the Hall was completed and the library was removed there. At the suggestion of Sir T. Perry, the Students' Literary and Scientific Society had been amalgamated with it in 1852.\n4 On the first April 1866, a number of Parsi Students of the Elphinstone College collected a small number of books and housed them in a building in Mody street, Fort. The library was opened under the name of the Fort Improvement Library. In 1857 a regular committee was established to manage it, and Government gave it aid. In 1866 the name was changed to the Fort Reading Room and Library. In 1891 Mr. N. M. Petit offered 25,000 in memory of his son Jamsetji, who was for many years the Director of the Institution. Its name was accordingly changed again to the Jamsetji Nasarwanji Petit Fort Reading Room and Library.\nThe history of journalism in Bombay commences with the publication of the *Bombay Herald* in 1789 and of the *Bombay Courier* in 1790. The former disappeared after a brief, almost meteoric, existence, while the latter continued to exist, as a separate publication, until 1847. Who its original proprietors were cannot be definitely stated; but its express object was the support of Government, and it was for many years known as the official organ. The office of the paper was in Forbes street. In 1792 it enjoyed the exclusive patronage of the Bombay Government and continued to publish the orders of Government in full until 1830, when the *Bombay Government Gazette* made its first appearance, under the auspices and editorship of Colonel Jervois of the Bombay Engineers.\n\nAmong the chief contributors and supporters of the *Courier* were Mr. Elphinstone, who ventilated his views on native education in its pages, Colonel Vans Kennedy, Sir Alexander Barnes, Sir Henry Rawlinson, and Mr. Bell, a Member of Council.\n\nIn 1791 the *Bombay Gazette* appeared for the first time, and shared journalistic honours with the *Courier* until 1819, when Captain Stocqueller arrived in Bombay. He, after a brief period of military duty, bought a paper called the *Argus*, which had been recently started by one Mr. Beck, and republished it under the name of the *Bombay Chronicle*. The two leading journals were described by him as \"composed almost entirely of selections from English papers with an occasional law report, while the Editor seldom found nobler occupation than the record of a ball and supper, or a laudatory notice of an amateur performance.\" The *Bombay Chronicle* died a natural death, when its editor returned to England about 1822; but\n\n---\n\n1 *Bombay Gazette*, 1st July, 1906; \"Reminiscences of a Journalist\" by Captain J. H. Stocqueller, published in *Times of India*, 17th July, 1872.\n\n2 Mr. Bell was peremptorily ordered by the Court of Directors to sever his connection with the *Courier*, which enjoyed the monopoly of all Government advertisements for Rs. 40,000 annually. Captain J. H. Stocqueller bought his share in the paper for Rs. 26,000.\u2014*Times of India*, 17th July 1872.\n\n3 \"Reminiscences of a Journalist\" by Captain Stocqueller, *Times of India*, 10th July, 1872.\nin 1827 Captain Stocqueller again sought these shores and commenced to issue the Iris, which for a time had phenomenal success in connection with the dispute between the two leading sects of Parsis on the subject of the Zoroastrian calendar. Mr. Henry Roper, afterwards Chief Justice, became one of this paper's most valued contributors; and shortly afterwards the proprietors of the Courier, who watched the progress of the Iris with considerable misgivings, persuaded Captain Stocqueller to amalgamate his journal with theirs and become editor of the Courier on a salary of Rs. 1,000 a month. The gallant Captain was extraordinarily energetic and of far less compromising nature than the modern pressman. For several weeks he filled the pages of the Courier with violent attacks upon the Bombay Gazette, which ended in his fighting a duel with the editor of the latter journal, whom he described subsequently as \"a pugnacious retired mariner.\" He next commenced to find fault with Sir John Malcolm's scheme for reforming the salaries of officials and the batta of the Bombay troops, earning in the latter matter so much gratitude from the officers of the Bombay Army that they aided him to commence the publication of a \"Sporting Magazine and Racing Calendar.\" Finally, with the help of Robert Xavier Murphy, an Irish Catholic and interpreter of the Supreme Court, he succeeded in forming a General Library at Bombay, and that accomplished, retired in 1830 to Calcutta to edit the Harkara.\n\nApparently by this date Bombay journalism had distinctly improved in character and tone; for Fontanier, the French Vice-Consul at Basta, who visited Bombay in 1835, remarked:\u2014 \"Que l'on prenne une publication de Calcutta, de Madras et surtout de Bombay, un journal par exemple, et l'on est saisi de tristesse. Il est impossible de ne pas remarquer le talent, la science, et surtout les vues d'utilit\u00e9 qui ont pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction; alors on les compare involontairement avec le fatras, l'inutile verbiage, le profonde ignorance qui caract\u00e9risent les feuilles Europ\u00e9ennes.\"\n\nThe chief English papers in 1838 were\n\n---\n\n1 Times of India, 17th July, 1873.\n2 Voyage dans l'Inde. Paris, 1844.\nthe *Bombay Gazette*, the *Bombay Courier*, and the *Bombay Times*, the last named of which appeared for the first time in 1838; while Native journalism was represented by the *Darpan* (Mirror), a Marathi publication, edited by Bal Shastri, and confined to local and domestic matters; the *Chabuk* (Lash), which followed a more outspoken policy and was printed in Gujarathi; the *Samachar*, also a Gujarathi paper, and the *jam-e-Jamshed* (cup of life), edited by a Parsi and treating principally of commercial matters.\u00b9 Two years later (1840) journalism received a considerable impetus by the publication of at least six new monthly magazines, among them being the *Dig Darshan* and *Vidya Sagar* in Marathi, the *Bombay Magazine* and the *Bombay Sporting Magazine* in English, while seven native newspapers, owned by Parsis, Hindus and Muhammadans, catered for the taste of the native public.\u00b2 In 1844 appeared the *Bombay Witness*, a religious weekly, which never paid expenses, and was given up in December 1846; in 1845 the *Bombay Mail* was instituted as a monthly summary of Bombay affairs for the English public at home; an *Indian Sporting Review*, published at the *Bombay Gazette* office and characterized as full of \"elegance, wit, spirit and sprightliness\", ousted the *Sporting Magazine* in the same year; while in 1846 a new daily paper was issued under the title of the *Bombay Telegraph and Eastern Intelligence*.\u00b3 The *Courier* was merged in the *Bombay Telegraph*, which became the *Telegraph and Courier*.\n\nMeanwhile Indian journalism had not stood still; for by the middle of the nineteenth century Bombay possessed six Gujarathi newspapers, notably the *Samachar*, first issued in 1822, the *jam-e-Jamshed*, which started in 1831, the *Duyan Prasarak*, a magazine started in 1847, and the *Rast Goftar*, which was first published as a fortnightly in 1851. The neighbourhood of the old Bread Market in the Fort might have been described as the Fleet street of Bombay in those days, so far as native\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Mrs. Postans' Western India in 1838, Vol. I, 69.\n\u00b2 *Bombay Times*, 16th May 1840, and 12th June 1844.\n\u00b3 *Bombay Times*, 6th July 1844; 26th February and 30th April 1845; 27th June 1846.\npublications were concerned; for here could be seen the offices not only of the three papers above mentioned, but also of the *Parsi Reformer*, the *Darpan*, the *Durbin* (Telescope), and the *Bagh-e-Nashiyat* (Garden of Wisdom), edited by Mr. Naoroji Kabraji. The general spread of education was also noticeable in the demand for the publications of local scientific societies. The Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society, which were printed during the first quarter of the century, had to be discontinued on the score of expense; but a longer life was vouchsafed to the Transactions of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, of the Agri-Horticultural Society, of the Medical and Physical Society and of the Geographical Society.\n\nThe movement for the publication of new European journals steadily progressed. A weekly paper, the *Spectator*, appeared early in 1847, the *Bombay Times* joined the ranks of daily papers in 1850, a *Bombay Quarterly Magazine* was issued from the Byculla Press in the same year, and these were followed by the *Bombay Guardian*, an evening paper, in 1851, the *Bombay Herald*, a bi-weekly, in 1855, and the *Bombay Standard* started by Dr. Buist in 1858. Most of these disappeared or were absorbed in other papers as the years went by, as was also the case with more than one vernacular paper, issued between 1840 and 1870. Those which preserved the even tenour of their way were the *Bombay Gazette*, which had altered its title to the *Gentleman's Gazette* about 1842, and the *Bombay Times*, which absorbed the *Standard* (1859) and the *Telegraph and Courier* (1861) and became the *Times of India* in 1861, and among Native Journals, the *Indu Prakash*, an Anglo-Marathi journal dating from 1862, and the weekly *Gujarathi* which first appeared in 1879. These were followed a\n\n---\n\n3 Mr. K. N. Kabraji's Reminiscence published in *Times of India*, 1901. The *Darpan* was the first Marathi daily. It appeared in August, 1849.\n\n4 *Bombay Times*, 6th January 1847; 18th September, 1850; 12th March, 1851; 16th December, 1854.\n\n5 In 1849 Mr. Jagannath Shankarsett sued the proprietors of the *Gentleman's Gazette* for libel, in that they published the story of an attempt to cheat a Marwadi by a fat Hindu, and the frustration of the plot by a wise Parsi. The plaintiff was nonsuited.\nlittle later by the *Kaiser-i-Hind*, published first in 1882, and in 1888 by the *Hindi Punch*. Vernacular journalism in general received no little impetus from the famous Maharaja Libel Case of 1862, which arose out of the startling but wholly justifiable charges laid against the high-priests of the Vallabhacharya sect by the late Mr. Karandas Mulji in the columns of the *Satya Prakash*, which was amalgamated subsequently with the *Rast Goftar*. The public conscience was unquestionably stirred to its depths by the disclosures made during the hearing of the case; and the vernacular press of that date must be held to have merited in great degree the eulogy which Sir Joseph Arnold in his judgment passed upon the individual defendant:\u2014\"At a risk and at a cost\" he remarked \"which we cannot adequately measure, these men have waged determined battle against a foul and powerful delusion. They have dared to look custom and error boldly in the face, and proclaim before the world of their votaries that their evil is not good, that their lie is not the truth. In thus doing they have done bravely and well. It may be allowable to express a hope that what they have done will not have been in vain, that the seed they have sown will bear its fruit, that their courage and consistency will be rewarded by a steady increase in the number of those, whom their words and their example have quickened into thought and animated to resistance, whose homes they have helped to cleanse from loathsome lewdness, and whose souls they have set free from a debasing bondage.\" Among other local papers which upheld the policy of Mr. Karondas Mulji at this juncture were the *Bombay Saturday Review*, the *Bamdad*, the *Apektyar*, the *Shamshir Bahadur*, the *Dost-e-Hind*, the *Dnyanodaya* and the *Khoja Dosta*.\n\nSince 1880 the number of journals, both English and vernacular, has steadily increased, and the native press has made great strides in printing during the last fifteen years. At the present date (1909), there are altogether 131 newspapers and periodicals printed in Bombay, and the number of books annually published by the local presses ranges from 700 to 1,000.\nThe first printing press appears to have been established in Bombay in 1674, in consequence of the following letter despatched by the Deputy Governor and Council of Bombay to the Court of Directors in 1670. \"Bimgee (Bhimji) Parrack (Parakh) makes his humble request to you that you would please to send out an able printer to Bombay, for that he notes a curiosity and earnest inclination to have some of the Brahminy writings in print, and for the said printer's encouragement he is willing to allow him \u00a350 sterling a year for three years and also to be at the charge of tools and instruments necessary for him. And in case that will not be sufficient, he humbly refers it to your prudence to agree with the said printer according as you shall see good, and promises to allow what you shall order. It is not improbable that this curiosity of his may tend to a common good, and by the industry of some searching spirits produce discoveries out of those or other ancient manuscripts of these parts which may be useful or at least grateful to posterity.\" The Court of Directors thereupon engaged Mr. Henry Hill as \"Printer for the Island of Bombay and despatched him from London in one of their ships\" with a printing-press, type, and a considerable quantity of paper. On his arrival in 1674, Bhimji was disappointed to find that Hill, albeit an expert printer, was not a founder and was quite unable \"to cut the Banian letters;\" and he therefore wrote once again to the Court of Directors who replied by sending out a type-founder in 1678.\n\nFrom that date up to 1778 no information is available regarding printing presses in Bombay. But from a calendar \"for the year of our Lord, 1780, printed by Rustom Caresajee (Karsedji) in the Bazar,\" it appears that English printing was performed by a Parsi about the year 1778. The following twenty years witnessed the introduction of journalism and the establishment of regular printing presses, for example the Bombay Gazette press founded by Douglas Nicholson and the Bombay Courier press, which commenced work about 1790. The difficulties in the path of the press managers of those days were\n\n---\n\n1 India Office Records. Bombay Gazette, 1st July, 1906.\nconsiderable. For the publication of an almanac the European Manager had a staff of \"six Portuguese lads from the toddy topses of Mahim, who had been taught to read prayers in Latin. They knew the letters of the English alphabet, but could not read a first English primer. These men were assisted by half-a-dozen Maratha compositors, who could fix type into their sticks ex-tempore, and who judged of a particular letter by its appearance only.\"\n\nAt the close of the eighteenth century newspapers and presses were subjected to various restrictions, one of them being that no article could be published unless it had been approved by the Chief Secretary to Government. But several of these disabilities were removed during the Governorship of Mountstuart Elphinstone; and by 1835 the presses had become practically free from official interference or supervision, though it was still understood that in accordance with an order of 1826, Government servants were forbidden to act as Editors or Proprietors of any newspaper. In 1834 an Editors' room was opened in the Secretariat. As regards native printing presses the earliest appears to have been the Bombay Samachar press, opened in 1812, which published the first Gujarathi calendar in 1814 and the first edition of the Bombay Samachar in 1822. About 1830 Government opened a press for their own official publications, which was taken over by the Byculla Education Society in 1848. This Society held the monopoly of all Government printing for a considerable period. By 1867 Bombay contained about 25 printing presses, the chief of which were the Times of India, Bombay Gazette, and Byculla Education Society's presses, Ganpat Krishnaji's press, the Imperial and Oriental presses, and the Indu Prakash, Jam-e-Jamshed, Akbar-i-Soudagar and Darpan presses. By 1878 the number of presses had increased to 53, including the Government Central Press and 48 presses under native proprietorship. Of the latter 29\n\n---\n\n1 Times of India, May 1st, 1896.\n2 Gujarathi type was moulded in Bombay for the first time in 1797 by a Parsi printer in the service of the Bombay Courier Press, for the purpose of Gujarathi advertisements, which occasionally appeared in that paper.\nissued newspapers and periodicals and the remainder performed job printing of various kinds. At the present date (1909) Bombay contains 120 printing presses.\n\nThe Times of India was founded in 1838, with the title of the Bombay Times. This paper was at first a bi-weekly, appearing on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and owed its origin, in great measure, to Lord Metcalfe's action of 1838, which granted freedom to the press in India and encouraged capitalists to embark upon journalistic enterprises. The syndicate, which founded it and which received much encouragement from the Governor, Sir Robert Grant, was composed of eleven European merchants in Bombay, Mr. (afterwards Sir) Jamsetji Jijibhoy, two eminent barristers and a member of the medical profession. Dr. Brennan, Secretary to the Chamber of Commerce, was the first Editor and was succeeded in 1839 by Dr. Henderson of the Elphinstone College, and for a few months by Dr. Knight of the Bengal medical service. In May 1840 Dr. Buist was specially despatched from Scotland to edit the paper, which during the eighteen years (1840-57) of his tenure of office changed its character considerably and expanded on the 2nd September 1850 into a daily paper. In December 1857 Dr. Buist resigned his post in consequence of a difference of opinion between himself and the proprietors regarding the policy of the paper during the Mutiny, and was succeeded by Mr. Knight, who witnessed in 1861 the alteration of the title of the journal to the Times of India.\u00b9 In 1863 the editorship was offered\n\n\u00b9 In 1858 Dr. Buist started a paper of his own the Bombay Standard, which was amalgamated in 1859 with the Times and was known for a few months as the Bombay Times and Standard. Similarly the Bombay Telegraph and Courier was merged in the Times in 1861. The Courier was the oldest Bombay newspaper, having been founded in 1790. During the early years of the nineteenth century it threw under the proprietorship of Mr. Luke Ashburner of Bombay and Bhandup; and in 1847 it was amalgamated with the Telegraph. In 1872, eight years after his retirement, Mr. Knight commenced to publish the Statesman, which was also merged in the Times in 1873.\n\nIn 1861 the paper was purchased by Messrs. Knight and Mull from the native proprietors; and on the retirement of the latter Colonel Nassau Lees (1825) became sole proprietor. In 1889 Messrs. Curwen and Kane purchased the paper from his heirs, and they in turn gave place to Messrs. Bennett, Coleman & Co., who now own the paper.\nthrough Sir Alexander Grant of the Bombay Educational Department to the famous Oxford scholar, Mr. Thomas Hill Green, who, however, was persuaded to refuse the offer by Mr. Benjamin Jowett, the Master of Balliol; and for a short period in 1863-64 the editorial chair was filled by Mr. Louis Jennings, who had journeyed to India as special correspondent of the London Times. Robert Knight's successors were Messrs. Martin Wood, Grattan Geary, Henry Curwen, T. J. Bennett, C.I.E., who had previously been connected with the Bombay Gazette, and L. G. Fraser. The paper is now conducted by Dr. H. S. Reed, LL.D.\n\nThe original offices of the Times of India were located in Maneckji Petit's buildings (now destroyed) near the end of the Colaba Causeway. Thence they were removed in succession to Rutherford street, Military square, in the Fort; to Bell lane, Medows street, opposite to what was known till 1905 as the Fort Chapel; and to Church Gate street. From about 1886 to 1898 the offices of the paper occupied a red-brick building, adjoining Messrs. Kemp & Co.'s shop, at the south end of Parsi Bazaar street; and were removed in the latter year to the building now occupied by the Royal Insurance Company, opposite to the Cathedral. In 1903 a final move was made to the Times Building, opposite the Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company, which was specially designed and erected for the proprietors.\n\nThe paper has described and commented upon the chief events in the history of India during the last seventy years. Among these may be particularly mentioned the 1st and 2nd Afghan wars, the conquest and annexation of Sind, the Abyssinian war, the famine of 1877-78, the Tibetan Expedition, the Delhi Coronation Darbar of\n\n---\n\n1 Nettleship's Memoirs in T.

Kabraji's Reminiscences, republished in Times of India, 1901.)\n1902-03, and the Indian Tour of their Royal Highnesses\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales in 1905-06.\n\nThe *Bombay Gazette* was first published in 1791 under\nthe editorship of Mr. Macklin, who was succeeded in 1810\nby Mr. Fearon and a little later by a Mr. Adolphus Pope,\nwho was Sheriff of Bombay in 1820. He yielded place in\n1821 to Mr. Fair, who indulged in somewhat outspoken\ncomments on current affairs and was eventually deported\nabout 1823, in consequence of an article which gave um-\nbrage to Sir Edward West, then Recorder of Bombay.\nDuring the early half of the nineteenth century the *Bombay\nGazette* incurred considerable odium by its support of the\nmissionary movement in general and of Dr. John Wilson in\nparticular, and was actually boycotted by the Parsi com-\nmunity after the result of the litigation arising out of\nDr. Wilson's conversion of two Parsi boys. Matters\nremained thus until 1840, when the paper passed into\nthe hands of new proprietors, who altered its name to\nthe *Gentleman's Gazette*. This title lasted, however,\nfor twelve months only, and gave place once more to\nthe old name when Mr. John Connon took his seat in\nthe editorial chair. Being subsequently appointed Chief\nPresidency Magistrate, Mr. Connon found his oppor-\ntunities as editor considerably curtailed and began to\ndevote more and more of his leisure to the promotion\nof charitable and educational institutions;\u00b9 and he\nwas considerably relieved when Mr. J. M. Maclean\ncame out to take his place in 1859. The latter,\nhowever, relinquished his post at the end of a year, and\nMr. Connon continued to edit the paper until 1863, when\nhe sold the business to Messrs. Maclean and Sharman.\nDuring the proprietorship of these two, the journal\nexercised a powerful influence on local politics and took\na prominent part in internal affairs between 1860 and\n1870, being to a great extent instrumental in effecting\nthe reconstruction of the Bank of Bombay and in direct-\ning the improvements which followed the demolition\n\n\u00b9 The letters on the Royal Tour, which appeared in the *Times\nof India*, received the honour of being adopted in a revised form\nas the official record of the Tour.\n\u00b2 The John Connon School on the Esplanade is the only existing\nmonument to his philanthropy in Bombay.\nof the old Fort. Among its best known contributors at this date were Sir Bartle Frere, Sir Alexander Grant, Mr. Anstey, Sir George Birdwood and Mr. Lockwood Kipling. Mr. Maclean also played no small part in the foundation of the Bombay Municipal Corporation, of which he was for many years an active member; and his policy was followed by Mr. Grattan Geary, to whom he sold the paper in 1880. After Mr. Geary's death, the journal was conducted by his widow and the present editor, Mr. G. C. Plinston, until 1906, when it passed into the hands of a syndicate formed in Bombay, which reduced its price from 4 annas to one anna.\n\nThe Advocate of India was founded by the late Dr. Thomas Blaney, C.I.E., in 1885 as an organ of the educated Indian population, and experienced very little success until 1894, when its present proprietor and editor took charge of it. The journal, which is published every evening, preserves an independent line on all matters of Indian and Anglo-Indian interest, and has on several occasions, notably in the matter of the treatment of the Muhammadan pilgrims to Mecca, aided the settlement of disputed questions of administration. The offices of the paper are situated in Apollo street, where the proprietors, Messrs. Gordon & Co., also publish the weekly Sporting Age, which first appeared in June 1906.\n\nThe Bombay Samachar, the oldest vernacular newspaper in India, was founded by Mr. Fardunji Marzban, the pioneer of native journalism in Western India, in 1822. Appearing first as a weekly, it was converted in 1832 into a daily paper, but was forced by lack of resources to revert to a bi-weekly issue in 1833. In 1855, however, it again appeared as a daily, and has remained so up to the present time. Since 1870 the paper has been the property of the Minocher Homji family, who conduct it for the benefit of all sections of the public. The tone of its articles is moderate, and it exercises a wholesome influence upon the Gujarathi press in outlying districts of the Presidency.\n\nThe Rast Goftar, an Anglo-Gujarathi weekly paper, was first published in 1851 by a small body of Parsi residents, of whom the best-known is Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji,\nM.P. Ten years later, after suffering considerable pecuniary loss owing to its progressive policy of reform, it was amalgamated with the *Satya Prakash* of the late Mr. Karsandas Mulji, and from that date up to 1902 it was edited by the late Mr. K. N. Kabraji. Save for a short period succeeding its first issue, the paper has always been printed at the *Daftar Askara* press, which was originally situated in Bazaar Gate street near the Bomanji Wadia fountain, and was thence removed to the modern Homji street (then King's Barrack lane), and finally in 1881 to its present premises in Cowasji Patel street. The *Rast Goftar*, which originally consisted of one sheet and has since been gradually raised to eight, has always represented the views of the educated reformers of the Parsi community and preserved an attitude of strict loyalty to the British Government.\n\nThe *Jam-e-Jamshed* first appeared as a weekly paper in 1831 and was converted into a daily in 1853. At its zenith it was the organ of the Parsi Panchayat and an authority upon all social questions affecting the Parsi community. Of late years, although still reflecting the views of that community alone, it has set itself in vehement opposition to the ideals and methods of the Indian National Congress.\n\nThe *Kaiser-i-Hind*, a weekly paper founded by Mr. F. C. Mehta in 1882, is notable as the first Parsi newspaper to inaugurate a special telegraphic service for itself from England, and its proprietors had the honour of invitation to the Press Congress held at St. Louis in 1904; while the weekly *Gujarati*, founded in 1879, is the most influential of Gujarat Hindu journals in Bombay and is a staunch upholder of the views of the Indian National Congress. One of the oldest and most influential Anglo-Marathi journals is the *Indu Prakash*, which was started in 1862 for the advocacy of social, religious and political reforms.

Heitor da Silveira named it the \"Island of the Good Life,\" which he would scarcely have done, if the climate had proved very deleterious, while Fryer in 1673 spoke of the country people and Portuguese in old days living to a good old age, which he believed to be largely due to their temperate habits. But subsequent to the cession and up till the close of the first decade of the 18th century, the island acquired an evil reputation and the mortality, particularly among the English, rose to an alarming figure. \"I reckon the people of Bombay,\" wrote Fryer in 1673, \"walk in charnel-houses, the climate being extremely unhealthy, as first thought to be caused by bubsho, rotten fish; but, though that be prohibited, yet it continues as mortal. I rather impute it to the situation which causes an infecundity in the earth, and a putridness in the air, what being produced seldom coming to maturity, whereby what is eaten is undigested; whence follow fluxes, dropsy, scurvy, barbiers, gout, stone, malignant and putrid fevers, which are endemic diseases.\" More fatal than all was a disease known as \"mordisheen\" to the Portuguese, which appears to have been choleraic in nature. Throughout the entire period between 1670 and 1710 there are continual references in official records to\n\n---\n\n1 Fryer's New Account, 69. He mentions the drinking of \"phul arrack\" and \"foul women\" as among the chief causes of disease in his day.\n2 Ibid. Bombay Gazetteer. Materials, III. 542.\n3 Mordisheen was doubtless a corruption of the Marathi Modai, from Modane, to break, in allusion to the internal agony which characterized the attacks. It was further corrupted by the English into Mort de Chine or the Chinese death (vide Yule's Hobson-Jobson). The treatment of this disease was almost more terrible than the disease itself, consisting of the application of a red-hot iron ring about an inch in diameter to the patient's stomach.\nthe great unhealthiness of the island,\u00b9 and on more than one occasion the Company's servants asked to be excused on this account from serving in Bomhay.\u00b2 Moreover circumstances were not improved by the fact that the island was often destitute of a physician\u00b3 and that the consignments of medicines, which were spasmodically sent out by the Court of Directors, often proved to be bad.\u2074 Philip Gyfford and John Petit, writing in 1676, remarked:\u2014\"We have buried upwards of 50 men, most new men; they die generally of fluxes which for the most part takes all it seizeth by reason of the bad diet and lodging and ill-government of our people in their sickness, and also they living so remote they cannot be looked after as they ought.\" In 1690 it was reported that there were only 35 Englishmen in Bombay, who were not ill,\u2075 while in the following year there were only five civil servants alive and all of them hors de combat.\u2076\n\nVarious reasons for the unhealthiness of the climate were put forward by the Company's representatives in Bombay. Writing in 1671 to the Court of Directors, they opined that it was due to the habit of manuring the cocoa-nut palms with putrid fish,\u2077 while in 1673 Aungier\n\n\u00b9 Commissioners at Bombay to Surat, October 30, 1668; described great sickness among the soldiery and emphasized want of medicines, \"especially Marmalade of Bussora for the flux, the epidemical disease of this place.\" Bombay Council to Court, November 18, 1671; Surat to Court, January 31, 1685; Surat to Court, December 13, 1690; Bombay to Court, June 1, 1696.\n\n\u00b2 Sir John Child, when appointed Accountant of Bombay in 1676, refused to go there.

In 1680 a Surgeon on 45 shillings a month and an Assistant on 30 shillings a month were sent out from England.

Cobbe in his book on the Church of Bombay remarked that James Hamner lived on the island for 22 years and Aisalalie for 28 years, but that such instances were not common. Cobbe's predecessor, Watson, died in 1710, within a year of his arrival.\n\n\u2077 Hamilton writing of Bombay in 1700 remarks:\u2014\"Its ground is sterile and not to be improved. It has but little good water on it, and the air is somewhat unhealthful, which is chiefly imputed to their dunging their cocoa-nut trees with buckshoe, a sort of small fishes their sea abounds in. They being laid to the trees putrefy and cause a most unsavoury smell; and in the mornings there is\nremarked in his report that after the first intermission of the rains in May or June and after their total ceasing in October the air and water are unwholesome by reason of the crude pestiferous vapours exhaled by the violent heat of the sun into the air and vermin created in the wells and tanks which renders those months most sickly to the inhabitants and especially to Europeans. One of the chief reasons was doubtless the gradual silting-up of the creeks which divided Bombay into a group of islets. At high-tide the sea swept through the breaches, overflowed the major portion of the island, and laid a pestilential deposit highly productive of malaria; and the conviction of the truth of this suggestion led the Court of Directors between 1684 and 1710 to constantly emphasize the need of stopping up the breaches (e.g., at Varli) and reclaiming \"the drowned lands.\" Added to such natural causes was the dissolute life led by the majority of Europeans at this epoch. \"I cannot,\" wrote Ovington, \"without horror mention to what a pitch all vicious enormities were grown in this place. Their principles of action and the consequent evil practices of the English forwarded their miseries and contributed to fill the air with those pestilential vapours that seized their vitals and speeded their hasty passage to the other world. Luxury, immodesty and a prostitute dissolution of manners found still new matter to work upon.\"\n\nBetween 1690 and 1708 circumstances were aggravated by a violent epidemic of plague which helped to justify the dictum that in Bombay \"two monsoons were the age of a man,\" and which forced from Sir Nicholas Waite the cry:\u2014 \"We are six, including your council, and some of us often sick. It is morally impossible without an overruling Providence to continue generally seen a thick fog among those trees that affects both the brains and the lungs of Europeans and breeds consumptions, fevers and fluxes.\"\n\nThe Revd. John Ovington also wrote in 1689 that \"fish manure is a mortal enemy to the lives of Europeans. We arrived here at the beginning of the rains and buried of the 24 passengers we brought with us above 20, before they were ended and of all our own ship's company above 15. The prodigious growth of vermin and of venomous creatures at the time of the monsoons do abundantly demonstrate the malignant corruption of the air.\"\n\n1 Aungier's Report. December 15, 1673.\n2 Edwardes' Rise of Bombay, 124.\nlonger from going underground, if we have not a large assistance.\"\n\nThe excessive mortality caused the greatest anxiety to the Court of Directors, who endeavoured to afford temporary relief to their factors by the despatch of medicines and Surgeons from home. They also advised the Bombay Council to issue orders prohibiting the \"buckshawing\" of the toddy trees in the Mahim and Varli woods, to allow the free perflation of the western breeze, to stop the breaches, to burn continual fires and to put chalk in the drinking water. Accordingly in 1708 fish manure was universally prohibited, dry manuring being permitted up to 1766 when it was discovered that the indulgence was turned to bad uses, and this practice also was discontinued: while by 1720 a dam had been constructed across the Great Breach at Mahalakshmi, and a considerable area of marshy ground had been drained. This gradual reclamation of land from the inroads of the sea coupled with better medical attendance\n\n---\n\n1 Ovington's Voyage to Surat.\n\n2 Edwardes' Rise of Bombay, 124. The plague appeared in Aurangzeb's camp in 1684 and 1689; at Surat in 1684 and 1690; at Bassein in 1690, and in Bombay at intervals from 1689 to 1702. Dr. Genalli Careri, who visited Bassein in 1695, described it as \"exactly like a bubo, and so violent that it not only takes away all means of preparing for a good end, but in a few hours depopulates whole cities\" (Churchill's Voyages IV., 191). A letter from Bombay to the Court of 1st June 1696 mentions that Bombay had had no plague that year, but that it was very violent in Bassein, Thana and Chaul. Nevertheless, there were at that date on the island only 27 men who were not sick.\n\n3 Ovington's Voyage to Surat, 1689.\n\n4 Grose referring to this period in 1750 writes:\u2014 \"Bombay had long borne an infamous character for unhealthiness. It was commonly called the burying-ground of the English; but this was only until an experience, bought at the expense of numbers of lives, had rendered the causes of such a mortality more known and consequently more guarded against. Among others the principal causes doubtless were first the nature of the climate, and the precautions and management required by it not being so sufficient as they now are. Formerly, too, there obtained a practice esteemed very pernicious to the health of the inhabitants, employing a manure for the cocoa-nut trees that grow in abundance on the island, consisting of the small fry of fish and called by the country name \"buckshaw\", which was undoubtedly of great service both to augment and meliorate their produce. There are some, however, who deny it and insist on the ill consequences of this manure to be purely imaginary, or at least greatly exaggerated. But all are agreed that the inhabitations in the woods or cocoanut groves are unwholesome from all wanting a free current through them and from the trees themselves diffusing a\nand a more temperate style of living introduced a considerable change for the better, and by the middle of the 18th century, Bombay had not only lost entirely her former reputation for insalubriety but was even accounted a tolerably healthy station. Grose, writing in 1750, remarked, \"the climate is no longer fatal to the English inhabitants as it used to be, and is incomparably more healthy than that of many of our settlements in India. The most common disorders are fever, blood-fluxes, cutaneous eruptions and a sort of ulcer called ringworms. The barbiers, a violent disorder that generally ended in rendering all the limbs paralytic, and the mordechin which is a fit of violent vomiting and purging that often proved fatal, are distempers hardly now known on the island. In short this place, the name of which used to carry terror with it in respect to its unhealthiness, is now no longer to be dreaded on that account, provided any common measure of temperance be observed, without which the tenure of healths in any climate must be hazardous.\" In spite of Grose's remarks, however, the sanitary condition of kind of vaporous moisture unfavourable to the lungs, a complaint common to all closely wooded countries. There has also been another reason assigned for the island having grown healthier from the lessening of the waters by a breach of the sea being banked off. This however does not seem to me a satisfactory reasons. There is still subsisting a great body of salt-water in the inside of the breach, the communication of which with the sea being less free than before the breach was built must be in proportion more apt to stagnate and breed noxious vapours. The improvement is due therefore more to different diet and manner of living of the Europeans, and also to the place being provided with more skilful physicians than formerly, when there was less niceness in the choice of them. Surgeons and Surgeons' mates of ships, and those none of the expertest, used to be admitted almost without any, or but a superficial, examination. The same negligence was also observed with respect to the gallies and other armed vessels of the Company in those parts. The pay was too slender to invite into such service any capable persons. Mr. Phipps, one of the former Governors, wherein he proposed making retrenchments by way of currying favour with his masters at home by the falsest and most ominous economy, observed the Surgeon's pay rated as Rs. 42 (that is five guineas). Mr. Phipps said the figures are by some mistake transposed and curtailed the pay to Rs. 24.\"\n\nIves, who visited Bombay towards the middle of the eighteenth century, says\u2014\"The island of Bombay has of late been rendered much more healthy than it was formerly by a wall which is now built to prevent the encroachment of the sea, where is formed a salt marsh, and by an order that none of the natives should manure their cocoanut trees with putrid fish.\" (Voyage from England to India by Edward Ives, 1754).\nBombay was far from perfect. In 1757, for example, there was a serious epidemic among the labourers employed on the fortifications, which necessitated the appointment \"of a country doctor,\" whose medicine, it is satisfactory to note, met with great success; while little or no attention was paid by the inhabitants to the advice and orders of the special officer, styled \"Scavenger,\" who was appointed about this date to supervise the cleansing of streets. In fact, according to a consultation of the 18th November 1757, the town had become so dirty that the Bombay Government decided to appoint a member of the Board to the office of Scavenger and to defray the cost of a sufficient number of labourers and scavenging carts by a tax upon the townspeople. The mortality, at this date, was also high. Ives, writing in 1754, notes that \"there were seldom less than 3 or 4 burned every night near the water's edge under Malabar Hill,\" and at the close of the eighteenth century the mortality was about 500 per month.\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century it appears from statistics of deaths collected by the Police that the average annual mortality varied between 4,000 and 8,000, this figure rising in 1804 to 26,000 in consequence of the great famine in the Konkan and the resultant immigration of a very large number of famishing and moribund people. The most common causes of death were fever and liver complaints, and Viscount Valentia, who was in Bombay in 1809, records the fact that the loss of the use of the limbs was a not infrequent result of the land breeze which blew every evening, \"bringing with it noxious vapours from the rank vegetation which springs up in the marshy boundary of the bay immediately after the rains are over.\"\n\nIn 1812 a definite attempt to secure the better con-\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Gazetteer. Materials, III. 554.\n2 Niebuhr, who visited Bombay in 1763, remarks that the island was much healthier than it was formerly, and that this resulted chiefly from the building of vellards to shut out the sea. The new Hornby Vellard was built between 1771 and 1784.\n3 The mortality figures for 1803 and 1805 were respectively 8,000 and 10,000. The famine affected the city death-rate in both years. (Trans. Bombay Literary Society 1819).\nThe Wonders of Ellora by T. B. Seely, Captain in the Bombay Native Infantry. 1825, pp. 3, 4, 5.\nservancy of the town was made by the passing of Rule, Ordinance and Regulation I, which empowered the Justices of the Peace to check nuisances on roads and thoroughfares and make structural improvements in the streets of the town. The general conservancy rested with the Court of Petty Sessions, which had to obtain the sanction of Government to all improvements that seemed to it necessary. These arrangements apparently met with some success; for Captain Seely, who was in Bombay in 1835, remarked that \"the climate of Bombay is preferable to most parts of India, having a refreshing sea-breeze, commonly called from its healthful effects 'the Doctor.' There is now very little wood on the island, no marshes, and but few large pools of stagnant water. To these causes much of the sickness that prevails in other parts of India must be attributed and the salubriety of Bombay caused it to be resorted to by invalids from the other Presidencies and the interior.\" A further step forward was taken in 1845 when a Board of Conservancy was established to supervise sanitary and other measures for the improvement of the public health; but the activities of the board were somewhat curtailed by the fact that they were not vested with legal authority to check nuisances. In consequence Act XIV of 1856 was promulgated which gave the necessary legal status to the board, and bye-laws under it were framed. Two years later (1858) however the board had fallen into considerable disrepute, in consequence largely of the venality of its inferior servants,\u00b9 and a new body corporate, composed of three Municipal Commissioners, was appointed to supervise the conservancy of the town. Finally on the 1st July 1865, the triumvirate of Municipal Commissioners was superseded by a new Municipality, which was charged with the entire control of the urban administration, the executive power and responsibility being vested in a Municipal Commissioner appointed by Government for a limited term of years. At the present date the sanitary welfare of the city is supervised by an Executive Health Officer, subordinate to the Municipal Commissioner and the Municipal Corporation.\n\n\u00b9 Valentia's Travels II.\nIn spite of the fact that the city contains many insanitary areas and has a very large low-class population, the Municipal administration of the last thirty years has gone far towards improving its general sanitary condition. Cholera for example, which was practically epidemic during the first half of the nineteenth century, and was responsible for very great mortality, has appeared only spasmodically since 1866, while the demolition of the walls of the old Fort and the ramparts, which was carried out at the instance of Sir Bartle Frere, the removal of palm-groves and the filling-up of old tanks and wells has done much to reduce the fever mortality. On occasions fever has claimed a large toll of human life; for example between 1863 and 1866, when commercial activity led to an unexampled immigration of the labouring classes, and again in 1877 when the city was filled with famine-stricken people from the Deccan, Gujarat and Rajputana. But apart from the mortality engendered by special and temporary circumstances of the above nature, the health of the city has been largely improved by the more recent achievements of Municipal administration; guinea-worm, for example, which was once very common and led to the abandonment of Matunga as an artillery station, as well as bowel-complaints have been much reduced in prevalence and severity by the provision of a regular and copious water-supply, which has taken the place of the sewage-polluted supply, formerly drawn from the tanks and wells of the island; while the construction of solid bandars, harbour-works and roads for the original foul and muddy foreshore, the substitution of an underground drainage system for the old uncovered drains and sewers, the more careful scavenging of streets and roads, the introduction of building bye-laws and the supervision of individual houses, the removal of offensive trades to the north of the island, and the introduction since 1877 of compulsory vaccination, have severally contributed towards counteracting the high mortality which would otherwise have prevailed among a very numerous and heterogeneous population. Since 1902 also the Municipality has maintained registration offices with dispensaries attached to\n\n---\n\n1 Trans. Med. and Phys. Soc. II., 1853-54 p. 56.\n2 See article on Water-supply in Chap. X.\nthem in the various districts of the city, the medical officers in charge of them being charged with the duty of professionally attending and prescribing for the poorer classes free of cost; while a certain number of nurses and properly-trained midwives are also entertained for the benefit of the female population.\n\nIn spite however of the gradual improvement introduced during the last thirty or forty years, Bombay is still characterized by a high rate of mortality at certain seasons of the year. Its unhealthiness can be traced to the existence of insanitary slum-areas, which are low-lying and water-logged during the monsoon, and which contain many old buildings, unfit for human habitation. The houses in these areas look on to tortuous and narrow lanes and are ill-ventilated, dirty, dark and overcrowded. Many of the houses have no plinth and lie below the level of the street, which renders the ground-floors perpetually damp. The privies in such areas are usually adapted to the basket system, which permits of much excreta flowing into the open drains. The drainage indeed in some places is exceedingly defective, while in others the houses lie close to large godowns for the cleaning and storage of grain which serve as the breeding-places and playgrounds of rats. Insanitary bullock-sheds also, which give rise to the saturation of the soil with dung, are to be found in the immediate vicinity of houses occupied by the lower and less cleanly classes of the population, and proper drainage cannot be effected inasmuch as the houses often lie below the level of the sewers, and the level of the sub-soil water is unusually high. A permanent amelioration of these conditions can only be effected by the gradual demolition of such areas, the erection of suitable dwellings for the poor, the provision of ventilation in and around dwelling-houses, the paving and cementing of all passages between houses, the abolition of the present privy system in favour of the water-carriage system, the regular and systematic inspection of houses, the provision of washing and bathing places in the street and the strict enforcement of the\n\n---\n\n1 These Municipal dispensaries are maintained at an annual cost of about Rs. 4,000 and treated 86,687 patients in 1907.\nordinary sanitary laws. These measures are being gradually introduced.\n\nThe chief diseases prevailing in Bombay from season to season are small-pox, cholera, fever, dysentery, diarrhoea, diseases of the nervous system, phthisis and diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems and plague. During the five years ending 1909, the average annual number of deaths arising from these causes was as follows:\n\n| Disease                          | Number of Deaths | Percentage |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------|\n| Diarrhoea and Dysentery          | 3,485            | 8\u00b72%       |\n| Diseases of nervous system       | 2,040            | 4\u00b78%       |\n| Phthisis                         | 2,763            | 6\u00b75%       |\n| Other diseases of respiratory    |                  |            |\n| system                           | 9,157            | 22\u00b70%      |\n| Plague                           | 8,393            | 19\u00b77%      |\n| Fever                            | 3,519            | 8\u00b72%       |\n| Cholera                          | 505              | 1\u00b71%       |\n| Small-pox                        | 804              | 1\u00b78%       |\n\nDiseases of the respiratory system are numerous among infants in consequence chiefly of the imperfect ventilation and insanitary condition of many houses. Cases of jigger and of Malta fever have sometimes been imported, as for example, in 1899 and 1900, but their spread was checked by very stringent measures.\n\nCholera visited the island frequently during the early portion of the 19th century. In September 1846 it carried off 5,000 people and re-appeared in rather milder form in the following year. During 1848, its effects were hardly noticeable, but about the middle of August 1849 it was again introduced from the Deccan and Konkan, and by the end of the year had been responsible for 2,000 deaths. During the next five years it was practically epidemic, the annual mortality reaching a maximum of 5,485 in 1851. Between 1855 and 1858 the mortality gradually declined, but rose again to 2,000 in 1859. On this occasion the disease was introduced from Wai in Satara District, through the Konkan, and prevailed in the city till about the middle of 1860, when it slowly subsided. The respite was however brief; for in November of the latter year it suddenly re-appeared among the families of the sepoys.\n\n---\n\n1 See Bombay Courier August\u2014October 1818. Between August 1818 and August 1819, 2,42,771 persons were attacked with cholera. Ibid., October, 1819; May, 1821 and June 1821.\nbelonging to the native regiment on the Esplanade and carried off more than 400 persons in December and about 600 in January 1861. Throughout 1862 it was responsible for about 200 deaths a month on the average, and after a partial subsidence in February 1863 it suddenly re-assumed epidemic form in December of that year, and killed 4,800 persons during 1864. Between 1865 and 1875 the annual mortality from cholera stood at roughly 300; but in 1877 a great influx of people from the famine-stricken districts of the Presidency introduced it once again in epidemic form. A similar immigration took place in 1900, when more than 4,000 persons died in the city of the disease. The few cases that now occur usually appear between July and September, and are carefully watched by the urban health authorities, who on receiving information of an outbreak in the Deccan or elsewhere endeavour to impose upon the people such precautionary measures as the boiling of water and milk before use, the prohibition of the use of well-water for drinking purposes and of the consumption of over-ripe fruit; the cleansing and disinfection of drains, galis, etc.; the evacuation of infected houses and the early demand for medical aid. The city is always liable to sudden infection by persons wandering from the great religious fairs and gatherings, which take place in various parts of the Presidency; but in consequence of the provision of a proper water-supply and the more effective control of conservancy and sanitation now maintained, cholera has become less common and less virulent than in the earlier period of the last century.\n\nDysentery and diarrhoea flourish in the dirtier localities, and arise from the irregular and insanitary habits of the people. The poorer classes often neglect to cover their food, thus allowing full scope to the taint of flies, while their children are fed irregularly upon an unsuitable diet. Tarwadi, Dongri, Varli, Kamathipura, Tardeo, Mahim, Byculla and Sion are the areas in which these diseases chiefly take root, while among classes the Native Christian is a prominent sufferer owing to his practice of residing in over-crowded koors or clubs with a common mess. Diseases of the respiratory system and phthisis, which annually\ncarry off about 13,000 persons, arise from the faulty construction of houses, absence of light and ventilation, and the feeble stamina of children. Mill-operatives are peculiarly liable to pulmonary troubles, owing to the varying temperatures to which they are subjected and to the inhalation of dust particles. These diseases are most prevalent among the Muhammadan and Hindu lower-class population, in particular among Muhammadan females, whom the pardah-system debars from enjoying the full benefit of the open air. The mortality is highest in and Nagpada, Kamathipura, Chakla and Byculla. Diseases of the nervous system appear to attack chiefly Parsis, Musalmans and Native Christians, and are more prevalent in Dhobi Talao, and Nagpada and Chakla than elsewhere. The annual mortality is about 2,000.\n\nSmall-pox is far less prevalent than it was in earlier years. Between 1850 and 1877 it was an annual epidemic, introduced as a rule by Muhammadan pilgrims arriving in the city on their way to Mecca, and was responsible for about 1,000 deaths every year. The maximum was reached in 1876, when 3,174 people died of the disease. Since the passing of the Vaccination Act of 1877, which rendered vaccination compulsory in the city, small-pox has assumed epidemic form on five occasions only, namely in 1883, 1900, 1903, 1905 and 1908. The average annual mortality for 33 years since 1877 has been 522. Early notification of possible outbreaks, coupled with continued efforts to popularise primary vaccination and re-vaccination have done much towards ridding Bombay of a disease which was once unusually virulent. The recent steps taken by Government to erect pilgrim-camps, and thus prevent the uncontrolled distribution of pilgrims throughout the city will go far towards lessening the risk of infection.\n\nExcluding plague, the chief scourge in Bombay is fever. In old days, before the introduction of improvement schemes and the immigration of the industrial classes, fever originated in the impurity of the water-supply, de-\n\n---\n\n1 For further details, see article on Vaccination.\n2 Times of India, 17th November 1869. Paper read at the rooms of the East India Association by Mr. Tait on the population and mortality of Bombay.\nfective drainage, and in the marshy condition of the soil resulting from the unchecked inroads of the sea. Subsequent to 1860, when the labouring classes and immigrants from famine-areas commenced to annually seek the city in search of work and food, the mortality was largely augmented. In 1862 for example the number of deaths from fever was 7,000, and rose to 9,000, 12,000, 19,000 and 10,000 in the next four years. The poorer classes, who had been enticed hither by the prospect of lucrative employment during the share mania, were the greatest sufferers and succumbed to the hard work, exposure, want of nutritious food, the vitiated air of the warrens in which they were forced to reside and the dissipation induced by the receipt of high wages, which jointly characterized that period. In 1876 Bombay was first brought into contact with famine fever, the chief peculiarity of which is that it is usually most prevalent at seasons when there is least malaria and declines when remittent fever begins to increase. The unusual atmospheric conditions of Bombay augment the mortality among those who seek refuge in the city, and together with the overcrowding resulting from limited accommodation are responsible for the active propagation of fever in its various forms. A pure and abundant water-supply and the fresh sea-breeze which blows athwart the island, are the two chief agents in checking the further spread of fevers, which find ample chance to flourish amid the squalor of the poorer quarters. The chief types of fever are enteric fever, malaria, ague, remittent and relapsing fevers. In 1909, 2,800 deaths from fever were recorded, of which 92 were ascribed to enteric, 293 to malaria, 2,322 to ague and remittent fever, and 93 to relapsing fever. Enteric fever is mainly spread by the water in milk, by oysters and other shell-fish and by uncooked vegetables, which have been exposed to infection during growth. Leakages from Bhandarwada reservoir are in some degree responsible for the prevalence of malarial mosquitoes, which are very prevalent in Chakla, the Esplanade, Mandvi, Umarkhadi, the Market and Walkeshwar sections. Mazagon, Tarwadi and Byculla have a very low death-rate from malaria, but are notorious for the prevalence of ague and remittent fever, which are due possibly to the\nfact that these areas are not properly drained and contain many cess-pools. The type of fever most prevalent in Dongri is relapsing fever, which is caused by overcrowding, filth and starvation, which exists to a marked degree in this area. Typhoid attacks chiefly Europeans and Eurasians, and natives rarely suffer from this type of disease.\n\nPlague.\n\nPlague, which has caused such havoc among the population during the closing years of the nineteenth century was first officially recognized in September 1896, when a genuine case of the bubonic type was discovered in Mandvi in a house facing the north side of the Masjid bridge. As mentioned above Bombay suffered from this disease during the closing years of the seventeenth and the opening years of the eighteenth century; and records exist to show that about the year 1832 the native population of Bombay was ravaged by a disease closely akin to plague. The phenomena preceding the outbreak of the disease in 1896 were briefly the following:\n\n1. An excessive rainfall (i.e., 15 inches above the average) which lasted for only half the normal period.\n2. A mean annual temperature higher, with the exception of a single year, than it had been during the preceding fifty-one years.\n3. An abnormally high level of sewage after heavy rain in the arterial sewers of the city.\n4. Increased humidity.\n5. The existence of masses of wet grain in dark granaries situated beneath human dwellings.\n6. A daily balance of about 5 million gallons of water in the soil\u2014a balance indicating danger at any time.\n\nAfter the first genuine case had been discovered,\u00b9 the disease spread rapidly and by December the mortality of the city had attained alarming dimensions. Measures designed to control the spread of the epidemic were\n\n\u00b9 Dr. A. G. Viegas, a member of the Municipal Corporation and the Standing Committee, was the first person to draw public attention to the nature of the disease (Michael's History of the Corporation, p. 189).\nentrusted to a Special Plague Committee appointed by Government and invested with very full powers. Attempts were then made to enforce the segregation of persons who had been in contact with a plague-patient, the removal of the patients to some properly equipped hospital and the disinfection of clothing and premises. These measures were essentially unpopular, and, besides adding a stimulus to emigration on a large scale, the population fleeing as much from an unreasoning fear of all forms of control as from terror of the epidemic, eventually led to riots and bloodshed. The position was one of extreme difficulty. The sanitary service of the city was in the hands of halatkhors or scavengers; and had they joined the general exodus, the city would in a short time have been rendered uninhabitable. At the same time the exodus of panic-stricken residents threatened to carry the plague over the whole of the Presidency and even beyond its limits. Attempts were made to enlist the co-operation of the leaders of the various native communities, and by degrees calmer feelings began to prevail. With the subsidence of the epidemic in the hot weather Bombay tended to resume its normal aspect. But in the interval the exodus had been enormous (it was roughly estimated at one quarter of the population), the disease had been spread far and wide by heedless fugitives, business had almost been brought to a standstill, and the weekly mortality had risen to the appalling figure of 1,900. Annually since the fatal year of 1896 plague has been epidemic in the city. The highest rates of mortality, per week, reached in succeeding years were:\n\n| Year     | Mortality |\n|----------|-----------|\n| 1897-98  | 2,250     |\n| 1898-99  | 2,450     |\n| 1899-1900| 2,820     |\n| 1900-01  | 2,620     |\n| 1901-02  | 2,594     |\n| 1902-03  | 1,902     |\n| 1903-04  | 2,604     |\n| 1904-05  | 1,785     |\n| 1905-06  | 1,812     |\n| 1906-07  | 2,180     |\n| 1907-08  | 1,340     |\n| 1908-09  | 1,250     |\n| 1909-10  | 1,152     |\n\nThe usual season of maximum mortality is February or March. By degrees it came to be recognized that the continued existence of the plague, combined with the passive resistance of the people to measures which they\nfailed to approve, rendered drastic expedients both undesirable and inoperative. After the abolition of the first Plague Committee Government maintained for several years a specially organized plague administration in the city, charged with the carrying out of moderate measures of disinfection and isolation, as far as possible with the concurrence of the victims. Assistance was given for the evacuation of seriously infected localities by the erection of temporary health camps in various parts of the island. Finally in 1901 the control of the plague operations was handed over to the Health Department of the Municipality, working under the orders of the Municipal Commissioner as Plague Commissioner, and with that department the control still (1910) rests.\n\nHow the disease was first introduced into the City is a problem still unsolved. It may have been brought by sea from Hongkong or from Southern China; it may have been conveyed from the Persian Gulf; or, as others suggest, the infection may have been carried from Kumaon and the Gharal Hills by pilgrims. Perhaps the most plausible theory is that plague was conveyed from the Persian Gulf and Arabia either by pilgrims who visit Bombay annually to the number of 20,000, or by rats or by merchandise. The two forms of the disease, the bubonic and pneumonic, differ in this respect that, whereas the former is but slightly contagious, the latter is one of the most virulent contagious maladies, the sputum of a patient attacked with pneumonic plague being full of plague bacilli. Leaving aside inoculation with Haffkine's serum, which is a precautionary measure of the highest importance at present but little understood by the mass of the people, the attention of the authorities is now directed towards undermining the disease by general measures of sanitation and conservancy, such as the structural alteration of insanitary houses, the speedy removal of material likely to harbour infection, the instruction of the masses in personal hygiene, the accurate registration of deaths and investigation into the origin of each case, the provision of adequate hospital accommodation, the evacuation of infected areas, the more constant cleansing of galis, drains,\n\n3 Imperial Gazetteer of India.\nand streets, and the poisoning of rats. The success of these measures cannot as yet be adequately estimated; but it appears that both the general mortality and the plague mortality have somewhat declined since 1903, while there has been a marked improvement in the registration of births and deaths and the notification of infectious diseases. The percentage of deaths certified by medical practitioners in the city to the total mortality rose from 7 per cent. in 1903 to 21 per cent. in 1909, while the total number of cases of infectious diseases notified by medical men in 1909 was 19 per cent. of the total number of deaths as against about 2 per cent. in 1901. The chief difficulties experienced by the local authorities in combating the disease arise from the absence of any strong public opinion, the fatalistic tendencies of the Indian and the lack of appreciation of the value of life, popular ignorance of the elementary principles of sanitation, and from the opposition to remedial measures dictated by creed-prejudice. Nevertheless measures, such as the segregation of those attacked and the abandonment of infected areas, which were in the early days of the disease imposed upon the population by order and were consequently strongly resented, are now spontaneously resorted to by the people themselves, and there are grounds for hope that by dint of perseverance other measures of general sanitation will be gradually adopted.\n\nThe registration of vital statistics, which was performed by the Police from 1850 to 1867, has since the latter year been in charge of the Health Department of the Bombay Municipality. A table showing the number of births registered in Bombay from 1867 to 1909 is given on the next page. The birth-rate per 1,000 of population since 1901 has been between 21 and 25 and rises higher than this (between 29 and 39) in the case of Musalmans, Jains, Bhattias, Parsis, Eurasians and Jews. The birth-rate per 1,000 of female population between 15 and 45 years of age was in 1909 143.5. Births are comparatively few, as many of the poorer people send their wives to their native villages for delivery.\n\n---\n\n1 See Report of Municipal Commissioner for 1867.\nThe following table shows the average number of births by caste during the quinquennial periods ending in 1901 and 1906 and the ratio of births per 1,000 of population:\n\n| Caste or Race          | Population in 1901 | Average number of births for 5 years ending 1901 | Average number of births for five years ending 1906 | Ratio per 1,000 of population for 5 years |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Jains                  | 14,248             | 233                                           | 516                                               | 16\u00b73                                     |\n| Brahmins               | 31,078             | 239                                           | 420                                               | 7\u00b77                                      |\n| Lingayats              | 2,144              | 9                                             | 36                                                | 4\u00b72                                      |\n| Bhattias               | 5,359              | 69                                            | 159                                               | 12\u00b78                                     |\n| Hindus (other)         | 396,501            | 5,275                                         | 8,776                                             | 13\u00b73                                     |\n| Hindus (low caste)     | 73,617             | 1,571                                         | 2,701                                             | 21\u00b73                                     |\n| Musalmans              | 155,121            | 2,161                                         | 3,794                                             | 13\u00b79                                     |\n| Parsis                 | 46,231             | 1,045                                         | 1,245                                             | 22\u00b76                                     |\n| Jews                   | 5,357              | 122                                           | 186                                               | 22\u00b77                                     |\n| Native Christians      | 29,645             | 414                                           | 576                                               | 13\u00b79                                     |\n| Eurasians              | 3,258              | 86                                            | 92                                                | 26\u00b74                                     |\n| Europeans              | 12,273             | 158                                           | 179                                               | 12\u00b78                                     |\n| Negro Africans         | 626                | 3                                             | 6                                                 | 4\u00b77                                      |\n| Buddhists              | 395                | 2                                             | 4                                                 | 5\u00b70                                      |\n| Other and unknown      | 153                | 3                                             | 8                                                 | 19\u00b76                                     |\n| **Total**              | **776,006**        | **11,391**                                    | **18,688**                                        | **14\u00b76**                                 |\n\nRatio of births per 1,000 of population:\n\n- Ending 1901: 24\u00b70\n- Ending 1906: 24\u00b70\nThe number of deaths from various causes from 1848 to 1909 is given in Appendix I at the end of the chapter. During the opening years of the 19th century, the annual mortality was between 4,000 and 6,000, which was augmented on occasions, such as the famine of 1804 and the cholera epidemic of 1818 and 1819, to a much higher figure. Captain Hall, writing in 1832, remarked that \"in ordinary seasons the deaths in Bombay may be taken at 17 daily, making the annual mortality about 6,205;\" but the gradual growth of the city and the annual epidemics of plague during recent years have raised the annual mortality to an alarming figure. The figure of 79,350, recorded against the year 1900, was largely due to the presence of cholera, small-pox and fever, which attacked the large swarms of famine-stricken immigrants with great severity.\n\nThe mortality is highest in Tarwadi, Second Nagpada, Kamathipura, Umarkhadi, Khara Talao, Byculla and Dongri, where it averages from 60 and 80 per cent. of population. In some of these areas the density of population is excessive, and the inhabitants suffer from the impurity of the soil and air, which is more pronounced here than in other more open and less water-logged areas. Speaking generally it may be laid down that abnormal seasons of heat or rainfall are followed by a rise in the general death-rate of the city, while the infant mortality is largely augmented by absence of proper nourishment, insanitary conditions of living and by the semi-religious and semi-social prejudices and practices of the bulk of the population. Hard labour of a kind unsuited to womanhood exercises considerable influence over the death-rate among females of the poorer classes, while the seclusion enforced among the women of certain sections is a decided factor in the spread of such diseases as phthisis, which flourish in the ill-ventilated and dirtier quarters of the city. Of the total number of deaths the largest number is of infants under one year and averages from 20 to 24 per cent. of the total mortality.\n\n---\n\n1 Fragments of Voyages and Travels, p. 75.\n2 See the Annual Reports of the Municipal Commissioner for further details.\ntality among children between one and five years averages about 10 per cent. of the total mortality.\n\nThe details of infirmities according to the Census of 1901 are as under:\n\n|        | Insane | Deaf and Mute | Blind | Leper | Total |\n|--------|--------|---------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Males  | 270    | 119           | 279   | 769   | 917   |\n| Females| 109    | 61            | 105   | 121   | 496   |\n| Total  | 379    | 190           | 484   | 3     | 1443  |\n\nIn 1901 there were about 270 insane in the Lunatic Asylum; 350 lepers were in the Lepers' Home, Matunga, and the Schools for Blind and Deaf and Mute were attended by about 100 persons. No prosecutions have been made under the Leprosy Act, but all possible precautions are taken to segregate them. The Matunga Asylum is hardly large enough to accommodate all the lepers that from time to time wander about the city. In 1831 a society was organized to afford relief to the blind and lame, but it was abolished in 1846 for want of funds. There are a certain number of charitable houses in which infirm beggars receive aid. The blind wander from street to street begging, and are seen near the temples in large numbers on public holidays.\n\nAs early as 1668 the unhealthiness of the climate impressed upon the East India Company's servants in Bombay the prime need of a hospital. The Commissioners, writing to Surat in October of that year, stated that many of the soldiers were ill, and that medicines were urgently needed, \"especially marmalade of Bussora for the flux, the epidemical disease of this place\"; while three years later the Bombay Council referred to their \"having had a very sickly time and having buried several persons\". But, notwithstanding the high mortality, no definite steps towards establishing a proper \"hospital for sick English,\" were taken until Gerald Aungier had assumed the reins\n\n---\n\n1 Commissioners to Surat, October 8th, 1668.\n2 Bombay Council to Surat, November 18th, 1671.\nof Government;\u00b9 and it was really due to his forcible representations that in 1675 the Court of Directors formally sanctioned the erection of a hospital, agreeing at the same time to allocate towards the cost of building \"two-thirds of the fines and penalties received for the use of the alms-houses at Poplar.\"\u00b2 The Bombay authorities thereupon set about finding a suitable site, and informed the Directors that they estimated the cost of a building, capable of accommodating fifty or sixty patients, at \u00a3160;\u00b3 the Council at Surat had a plan drawn up and sent orders down to Bombay that the annual cost of maintenance was not to exceed Rs. 1,000;\u2074 and in 1676 the Court of Directors despatched Dr. Wilson from England as first Physician, in the hope that he would prove \"a great benefit and happiness to the Island.\" It appears, however, that the proposed building was never erected, and that instead a new Court of Judicature was built in the bazaar, while the old Court situated on the Esplanade to the south-east of the present Cooperage was transformed into a hospital in 1677.\u2075\n\nThis hospital, the first ever known in Bombay, was in use until some little time prior to the year 1733, when a new building was erected near the Marine yard, nearly opposite the present Great Western Hotel.\u2076 The cost of completing it was defrayed by the imposition of a half per cent. duty on trade. From 1740 onwards it was inspected weekly by a Board composed of the Land Paymaster, the Marine Paymaster and the Commandant of the Station, and seems to have been the chief resort for sick persons in\n\n\u00b9 Aungier to the Directors, January 15th, 1674.

As early as 1781 they had called for plans and estimates for a hospital to be built at Mody Bay \"behind the present old revetment laying between the two-gun battery and the cremaillere work\"; but the fact that a map of the great fire of 1803 shows the General Hospital in its old place, hampering the Marine yard, is conclusive evidence that no definite action was taken for many years. In addition to this general hospital in the Fort, there were at the close of the eighteenth century a hospital for native troops on the Esplanade and a convalescent home on Old Woman's Island (Colaba).\n\nThe year 1824 witnessed the final relinquishment of the Marine yard hospital in favour of a new building erected in Hornby road for the use both of the garrison and the European civil population. The site had been occupied\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Gazetteer Materials, III, 596-8. Note that Edward Ives, writing of Bombay in 1754 remarks:\u2014\"Our hospital at Bombay was without the town-wall; and in order to make my attendance on it the more convenient, Mr. Delaguarde, a factor in the Company's service, was so obliging as to give me the use of a very commodious house which lay near the hospital and belonged to him as Superintendent of the Powder Works\". This may have been the old hospital.\n\nFrom Valenti's Travels it appears that there were hospitals in Bombay in 1809 \"opened for the gradual administering of relief to such as were too much exhausted to feed themselves.\"\n\n2 Forbes' Oriental Memoirs. The hospital on Old Woman's Island was known in 1758 as the King's (Seamen's) Hospital, and was appropriated ten years later as a convalescent home. The sepoy hospital was opened in 1769. There was also an Artillery hospital at the Matunga Cantonment during the early years of the nineteenth century. Stocqueller (1819) describes it as well-tenanted. \"Newly arrived Assistant Surgeons had a fine field for the study of the disorders peculiar to India in the persons of the wretched occupants of the planks and trestles which formed the bedsteads. An easy-going old gentleman was the full Surgeon of the batteries; who usually went his rounds, accompanied by a Dresser, and some youths, and who had a summary method of disposing of his patients. 'Give him two pills' was the invariable remedy.\" (Times of India, 10th July, 1872).\n\n3 Times of India, Oct. 27th, 1893. Mr. D. E. Wacha writes: \"As a boy I knew a congeries of thatched buildings in Hornby Road with a compound, which was known as the hospital. A portion of the compound, with the gates, may be still seen where the\nby a gun carriage factory, which was removed to Colaba about 1820. This hospital continued to be used until 1860, when the medical authorities condemned it, and Government determined to sell it with the land on which it stood, and devote the sale-proceeds to the erection of a new hospital on the Cooperage. Meanwhile, it was decided to use the European Artillery barracks in Fort George as a temporary hospital, and they were vacated by the troops in 1861; the hospital in Hornby road was sold in 1862 for 3 lakhs, and in December of the same year the Executive Committee for the removal of the ramparts was directed to find a suitable site near the Cooperage for the new building. Plans for a building, costing 5 lakhs, including surgeons' residences, costing 1 lakh, formed the subject of a competition and the laying of the foundations on the Esplanade parade ground was actually proceeded with until the Sanitary Commissioner put a stop to the work on sanitary grounds. In consequence, interest in the matter languished until 1876, when the temporary huts in Fort George were relinquished in favour of a building known as the Officers' Quarters which had previously been used partly as the residence of the House Surgeon and partly as a convalescent and contagious ward, and no definite step towards the construction of a proper hospital was taken until 1886, when, on the initiative of Lord Reay and Sir M. Melvill, plans were prepared and culminated in the laying of the foundation-stone of the present St. George's Hospital in 1889.\n\nSir Jamsetji Jijibhoy Parsi Benevolent school stands. The principal portion of the hospital and its compound is now represented by the premises of Bhesania, the Silk-Merchant.\"\n\n1 Times of India, Jan. 2, 1865. The Committee awarded the palm to the design of Captain Wilkins, but stated that none of the designs complied fully with the conditions specified, particularly in the matter of cost. The Bombay Government replied that they did not wish to withhold the premia; whereupon the Committee, contrary to all practice, melted the two prizes of Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 1,000 in one crucible, and divided the contents among seven competitors.\n\n2 The Government of India also did not approve of the plan of the building. The foundations, which cost nearly a lakh, now lie buried under the ground in front of the Bombay Gymkhana.\nApparently little was done towards providing State aid to the native population prior to the opening of the nineteenth century. Captain Hall, who visited Bombay shortly after the great famine of 1802-04, records that \"several great sheds were erected as hospitals on the smooth greensward lying just beyond the foot of the glacis and reaching nearly across the Esplanade in front of the northern line of the fortifications. Numerous surgeons, some military and some belonging to the civil establishment, were called in from various out-stations and placed in charge of these and other infirmaries.\"\n\nAbout 1809 a kind of Native General Hospital was in existence, which treated daily about 20 patients and was supported solely by Government. The inmates were chiefly paupers sent in by the police. In 1834, in pursuance of resolutions adopted at a public meeting, the Bombay Native Dispensary was opened in buildings granted rent-free by Government; and a few private dispensaries, notably one opened in Girgaum road in 1846, commenced to afford medical aid to the native population. The popularising of medical institutions and European remedies was largely the work of the Committee of the Native Dispensary, formed in 1836.\n\nBy 1865 Bombay contained the Jamsetji Jijibhoy Hospital, including an Obstetric Hospital, and an Eye Dispensary, which was closed on the completion of the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Ophthalmic Hospital in that year, a Police Hospital, the Byculla Schools Hospital, and the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard Dispensary: while in 1874 the Jehangir Nasarwanji Wadia Dispensary at Mahim, opened several years before, was formally recognised by Government for a grant-in-aid, and the Gokuldas Tejpal Native General Hospital was opened for the benefit of native patients resident in areas distant from the J. J. Hospital. About this date the Native Dispensary opened a branch at Colaba, which was\n\n---\n\n1 Fragments of Voyages (1832), 64.\n\n2 Times of India, July 13, 1842. The dispensary was established by Drs. Makie and Bremner, and was maintained by public subscription and a monthly donation from Government of Rs. 300.\nshortly afterwards abolished. This indirectly led to the opening of a branch in Khetwadi in 1877, which subsequently became the Nasarwanji Petit Charitable Dispensary. This was followed a decade later by a movement to afford medical relief to native women, who are, as a rule, averse to treatment by male doctors, and in 1885 the Bombay Committee of the Medical Fund for the Women of India opened a temporary hospital for in-door patients at Khetwadi, the out-door patients being treated at the Jafar Suleman Dispensary for women and children, which was opened near the Crawford Market in the next year. In the following year (1886) the Pestanji Hormasji Cama Hospital was opened, whereupon the Khetwadi hospital was closed, and its inmates were removed to the former institution. The year 1890 witnessed the opening of the Bomanji Edalji Albless Obstetric Hospital, which stands in the compound of the Cama Hospital, and is under the same executive staff. In 1890 the Acworth Leper Asylum at Matunga was opened, and in 1892 the Obstetric wards of the Jamsetji Jijibboy Hospital were replaced by the Bai Motlibai Wadia Hospital and the Sir Dinsha Maneckji Petit Hospital, and an out-door department for both these hospitals was provided by the Dwarkadas Lallubhai Dispensary for women and children.\n\nFull statistics of the number of private practitioners, who mostly own dispensaries, are not available; but, according to the census of 1901, Bombay contained 282 chemists and druggists, 555 diplomaed medical practitioners, 398 medical practitioners without diplomas, 106 midwives and a considerable number of nurses.\n\nThe following table shows the growth of medical institutions in Bombay city and island, and details of their work, and expenditure at different periods since 1890:\n\n---\n\n1 The Jafar Suleman Dispensary was opened by Lady Reay on the 29th March 1886.\nThe foundation stone of the St. George's, or the European General Hospital, was laid by Lord Reay on the 22nd February, 1889; and the building was completed according to the design of Mr. J. Adams in December 1892, at a total cost of 6 lakhs. It accommodates 130 patients, including the inmates of five special wards. Additions have recently been made which include a new hospital for women, adjoining the north end of the men's hospital, and accommodating 97 patients, an obstetric ward, a children's ward and seven special wards. This building, which takes the place of the old hospital in the artillery barracks, was completed in 1907 at a cost of Rs. 4,34,801, and forms, together with the men's hospital, a very imposing structure. In the compound of the hospital are special smallpox wards, accommodating 16 patients and built in 1905 and wards for measles, which consist of two temporary structures erected in 1906, for the accommodation of ten patients, while European plague patients are treated temporarily (1909) at the Maratha Plague Hospital. The staff of the hospital comprises\n\n---\n\n1 For early history see general history of hospitals, supra, Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. XXVI, III, and Times of India of 4th June and 17th December, 1892, and 27th October, 1893.\na Physician in charge and a Resident Surgeon, both of the Indian Medical Service, and four Military Assistant Surgeons, who are resident on the premises; while the nursing staff is composed of a Lady Superintendent with one assistant, 8 charge sisters, 34 nurses, 7 probationers, and a house-keeper with an assistant.\n\nTrained European nurses were first employed to the number of three in 1876, their number being increased to six between that date and 1885; and in the latter year the entire nursing-work was taken over by the All Saints' Sisters, who received from Government in return a monthly grant of Rs. 340. This system continued until 1902, during which period the Sisters brought the nursing to a high state of efficiency, and trained a very considerable number of candidates for this duty. To assist the Sisters in their self-imposed task, a Nursing Fund was opened in 1889, the committee of which formed itself into the St. George's Hospital Nursing Association, when the Sisters resigned their duties in 1902. The committee of the Nursing Association consists of 12 members, of whom 3 are appointed by Government. Visiting committees report every month to the Main Committee, which also appoints a Ladies' Visiting Committee to visit the female wards. The Nursing Association now provides the whole of the present nursing-staff numbering 49 and costing annually Rs. 47,000, of which Rs. 23,500 are provided by Government and the balance by the Port Trust and public subscriptions. Since 1886 an additional staff of private nurses has also been maintained. These, who number (1909) sixteen, attend patients in all parts of the Bombay Presidency and occasionally visit other Provinces. Both the hospital and private nursing staffs are housed in three blocks of buildings facing the new women's hospital, two of which were built by Government at a cost of more than one lakh and the third was built by the Nursing Association at a cost of Rs. 45,000. Prior to 1894 the whole nursing staff was very poorly accommodated on the ground floor of the old women's hospital. The Association has also built and endowed a cottage at Nasik at a cost of Rs. 5,000 for the use of nurses on leave during the monsoon.\n\n---\n\n1 The Association is registered under Act XXI of 1860.\nThe following table shows the work, income, and expenditure of the Hospital at different periods since 1880:\n\n| Year | Number of patients treated | Number of beds available | Number of surgical operations | Expenditure Rs. | Percentage of cost paid by Government |\n|------|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 1880 | 1,304 (In-door) 1,395 (Out-door) | 130 | 873 | 65,273 | 82.7 |\n| 1890 | 1,233 (In-door) 1,776 (Out-door) | 136 | 528 | 74,473 | 61.2 |\n| 1900 | 2,613 (In-door) 2,790 (Out-door) | 208 | 1,167 | 1,22,165 | 54.5 |\n| 1908 | 2,764 (In-door) 1,389 (Out-door) | 227 | 411 | 1,76,020 | 95.9 |\n\nOwing to the noise of the G.

Designed to afford medical relief to the native poor of all classes, the main building consists of 18 wards, containing 237 beds, of which 58 are set apart for female patients, while a detached building, containing 34 beds, is set apart exclusively for Parsi male patients, and a second separate building with 25 beds is allocated to chronic or incurable cases. The medical staff comprises a Senior Medical Officer, who like other medical officers at Government institutions, is under the control of the Surgeon-General with the Government of Bombay, a Senior Surgeon, a first and a second Physician, and a second Surgeon, a House Surgeon of the Military Assistant Surgeon class, three other Military Assistant Surgeons and six Honorary Medical Officers, including an Honorary Physician in Skin Diseases and an Honorary\n\n---\n\n1 Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy's contribution was Rs. 1,61,030.\nSurgeon in Dentistry. The Nursing Association provides a considerable staff of hospital and private nurses. On the 25th September, 1906, Lord Lamington laid the foundation stone of the Sir William Moore Operation Theatre, which cost about Rs. 61,500. Out of this sum Lady Moore contributed Rs. 33,528.\n\nThe following table shows the work, income and expenditure of the Jamsetji Jijibhoy Hospital at different periods since 1880:\n\n|                  | 1880 | 1890 | 1900 | 1908 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of Patients treated |      |      |      |      |\n| In-door          | 4,659| 7,095| 6,173| 5,390|\n| Out-door         | 29,344| 43,553| 33,937| 22,259|\n| Total            | 34,003| 50,648| 40,112| 27,649|\n| Number of Beds available | 440 | 440 | 352 | 296 |\n| Number of Surgical Operations | 5,287 | 6,357 | 4,548 | 2,854 |\n| Expenditure (Rs.) | 1,50,430 | 1,59,220 | 1,06,525 | 1,29,307 |\n| Percentage of cost paid by Government | 99.7 | 99.9 | 94.5 | 96.3 |\n\nThe Sir Cowasji Jehangir Ophthalmic Hospital adjoins the Jamsetji Jijibhoy Hospital and was built in 1866 at a cost of nearly one lakh, given by the late Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney. It originally contained accommodation for 28 male and 12 female in-patients, many of whom come from outstations. Lack of accommodation led to the construction of a new building, costing Rs. 60,000 of which Sir Cowasji Jehangir has subscribed half. The new building contains an out-patient department, a major operating-room, a nurses' room, surgeon's office, and full accommodation for 30 more patients, and also affords better facilities for the practical instruction of students of the Grant Medical College. Though the work in this hospital is of a more varied nature than in other parts of India, the bulk of the in-patients are persons requiring operations for cataract. An Ophthalmic Surgeon, who is an officer of the Indian Medical Service, is attached to the Hospital.\n\nThe following table shows the work, income and expenditure of the Cowasji Jehangir Ophthalmic Hospital\n\n---\n\n1 It was opened for patients on July 21st, 1866.\nat different periods since 1870:\n\n| Year | Number of patients treated (In-door) | Number of patients treated (Out-door) | Total | Number of beds available | No. of Surgical operations | Expenditure (Rs.) | Percentage of cost paid by Government |\n|------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 1870 | 54                                  | 5,699                                 | 6,183 | 40                       | 600                       | 3,448             | 100%                                |\n| 1880 | 484                                 | 8,833                                 | 9,317 | 40                       | 1,105                     | 4,767             | 100%                                |\n| 1890 | 506                                 | 15,110                                | 15,616 | 35                       | 2,530                     | 5,014             | 98.8%                               |\n| 1900 | 812                                 | 16,497                                | 17,309 | 40                       | 2,375                     | 10,131            | 99.2%                               |\n| 1908 | 1,032                               |                                       |       |                          |                           |                   |                                     |\n\nTo the east of the Jamsetji Jijibhoy Hospital on the Babula Tank road lie the Bai Motlibai Obstetric Hospital, the Sir Dinsha Maneckji Petit Hospital for women and children, and the Dwarkadas Lallubhai Dispensary, which jointly provide accommodation for 60 women and 20 children, and are utilized as institutions for the training in midwifery and gynaecology of the students of the Grant Medical College. The Bai Motlibai Hospital, which annually admits more than 800 cases was built by the lady whose name it bears at a cost of Rs. 1,52,061; the foundation stone was laid by Lord Reay in March, 1889; and the completed building, as designed by Mr. John Adams, was opened by Lord Harris in March, 1892. Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit built the second hospital, which annually admits more than 600 cases, for Rs. 1,19,351; Lord Reay laid the foundation stone in January, 1890, and Lord Harris formally opened the building in March, 1892. The architect of the former hospital also designed this building. Lord Harris likewise opened on the same date the Dwarkadas Lallubhai Dispensary for women and children, which cost nearly Rs. 10,000, and annually treats about 9,000 patients. The staff of the three institutions comprises a Physician of the Indian Medical Service in charge, a House Surgeon of the Military Assistant Surgeon class and two honorary obstetric physicians.\n\nThe following table shows details of the work, income, and expenditure of the Bai Motlibai Wadia and Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit Hospitals and the Dwarkadas Lallu-\nThe Pestanji Hormasji Cama Hospital for women and children, with which are connected the Bomanji Edalji Albless Obstetric Hospital and the Jafar Suleman Dispensary, originated in a movement commenced in 1882 by Mr. G. Kittredge, Mr. Sorabji Shapurji Bengali and others, to afford medical assistance to Indian women. In the following year Mr. Pestanji Hormasji Cama offered one lakh of rupees, which he eventually increased to Rs. 1,64,300 for the erection of a hospital for women and children to be under the sole charge of medical women; and although the medical officers of the Jamsetji Jijibhoy Hospital endeavoured to obtain Mr. Cama's donation for an addition to that hospital, which was lamentably deficient in accommodation for female patients, yet the wishes of Mr. S. S. Bengali and others were acceded to by Government, and a suitable site on the Esplanade was granted for the building now known as the Cama Hospital. The foundation-stone of the building was laid by H. R. H. the Duke of Connaught on the 23rd November, 1883; and in the following month Dr. Edith Pechey arrived from England as First Physician, and carried on her work in a small bungalow at Khetwadi until the hospital was opened for occupation in August 1886. Meanwhile, Mr. Cumoo Jafar Suleman had given Rs. 20,000 for the erection of a dispensary for women and children, which was opened in 1886, on a site adjoining the Crawford Markets, as part of the Cama Hospital; and in 1890 a further addition\n\n---\n\n1 The total cost of the building was actually Rs. 1,71,722. It was designed by Khan Bahadur M. C. Murzban.\nwas made in the form of the Bomanji Edalji Albless Obstetric Hospital, which cost Rs. 59,640, and was designed for the special accommodation of obstetric cases. The three buildings form practically one institution, financed and controlled by Government and the medical staff comprises a First Physician, who is appointed by the Secretary of State, a Second Physician and a senior and a junior House Surgeon, who are appointed locally and reside on the premises. An adequate staff of nurses, whose salaries are paid by Government, is maintained and the Countess of Dufferin Fund also supports, as an adjunct of the hospital, a training-school for nurses and midwives, which was opened in 1887. The nurses, who obtained certificates from this school up to the end of 1909, numbered 225 and belong to the European, Jew, Brahman and other Hindu and the Muhammadan communities. In many cases they are sent to Bombay as students by up-country municipalities and by the authorities of Native States, and subsequently return to practice in those areas. The nurses' quarters, which were originally constructed out of donations from the Countess of Dufferin Fund and from Mr. Cama, have been recently enlarged at the joint expense of Government and the fund; and in 1909 a private institute for nurses was opened to meet the demand for Indian Nurses for Indian families.\n\nThe following table shows the work, income and expenditure of the Cama and the Albless Hospitals, and the Jafar Sulzman Dispensary at different periods since 1883:\n\n| Year | P.

Under the auspices of Lord Northcote, the new hospital, which stands in close proximity to the Grant Medical College at the junction of Parel road and one of the new roads made by the Improvement Trust, was commenced, and was finally opened by Lord Lamington in August, 1904. It can accommodate ninety-four patients at present; and it is the intention of Government to add a lunacy ward to the building, in which vagrants and all persons, whose mental condition the Presidency Magistrates desire to ascertain can be kept under observation. The hospital is in charge of the Police Surgeon.\n\nThe following table shows details of the work, income and expenditure of the old and new Police Hospitals, Bombay, at different periods since 1891:\n\n|                      | 1891   | 1900   | 1908   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of patients treated |        |        |        |\n| In-door              | 2,291  | 2,077  | 2,721  |\n| Out-door             | 39     | 57     | 141    |\n| Total                | 2,330  | 2,134  | 2,862  |\n| Number of beds available |      |        |        |\n|                      | 35     | 35     | 94     |\n| Number of Surgical Operations | |        |        |\n|                      | 1      | 56     | 79     |\n| Expenditure Rs.      | 6,782  | 6,957  | 15,423 |\n| Percentage of the total cost paid by Government | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n\nThe Gokuldas Tejpal Native General Hospital owes its origin to an outcry raised in 1865 for a second hospital for natives of India; and the late Mr. Rustomji Jamsetji Jijibhoy offered to provide Rs. 1,50,000 that year, if\n\n---\n\n1 Up to 1866 sick policemen were sent to the J. J. Hospital. In that year the stable of the old Hamilton Hotel was assigned as a separate Police Hospital and did duty till 1870 when the Municipality temporarily placed a workshop at the disposal of the police. The building however was very unsuitable and the source of great complaint. It was eventually supplanted by the Northcote Police Hospital.\nGovernment would grant Rs. 1,00,000 and a site, and if the Municipal Corporation would support the hospital. The financial crisis, following upon the share mania, subsequently prevented Mr. Rustomji from carrying out his intentions, and the scheme was held in abeyance until 1869, when Mr. Crawford, the Municipal Commissioner, induced Mr. Gokuldas Tejpal to provide 14 lakhs towards the cost of the building. Government and the Municipal Corporation thereupon expressed themselves willing to abide by the previous arrangement; the building was designed by Colonel Fuller, R. E., and commenced in May 1870, and was finally completed at a cost of about 3\u00bd lakhs on the 8th April, 1874.\u00b9 The site was granted by Government. The Hospital accommodates about 120 patients. The medical staff consists of a Medical Officer of the Indian Medical Service, a House Surgeon of the Military Assistant Surgeon class and four Civil Medical Assistants.\n\nThe following table shows details of the work, income and expenditure of the Gokuldas Tejpal Native General Hospital at different periods since 1874:\n\n| Year     | Number of patients treated (Indoor) | Number of patients treated (Outdoor) | Total | Number of beds available | Number of surgical operations | Expenditure (Rs.) | Percentage of the total cost paid by Government |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1874-75  | 1,141                             | 6,309                               | 7,450 | 120                      | 135                           | 75,063            | 34.9%                                         |\n| 1880     | 4,234                             | 17,904                              | 22,138| 120                      | 1,865                         | 35,430            | 34.9%                                         |\n| 1890     | 3,648                             | 14,905                              | 18,553| 120                      | 2,307                         | 45,019            | 38.8%                                         |\n| 1900     | 2,890                             | 13,450                              | 16,340| 120                      | 1,907                         | 50,195            | 36.9%                                         |\n| 1908     | 4,795                             | 9,500                               | 14,335| 120                      | 840                           | 61,317            |                                               |\n\nThe Colaba Lunatic Asylum was established in 1826 and was originally designed for the accommodation of 70 inmates. About the year 1850 the number of patients began to increase rapidly, and a new bungalow was therefore constructed for the use of the Superintendent, his old quarters in the asylum being altered.\n\n\u00b9 For detailed account of the building see the Annual Report of Civil hospitals and dispensaries, 1874-75.\nfor the use of patients. Twelve years later (1872) further accommodation was found necessary, and two new blocks were erected, one for European male patients and the other for females. The older portion of the asylum consists of a centre block with two wings, forming three sides of a square, a kitchen, and a library; and, coupled with the later buildings above mentioned, has accommodation for 258 patients. In 1902 all the native patients were removed to the Narottamdas Madhavdas Asylum at Naupada, near Thana, and since that date only Europeans, Eurasians (who have adopted European habits), Parsis and Jews have been admitted to Colaba.\n\nThe asylum is situated on the western side of Colaba Point, and covers an area of between four and five acres. It stands upon trappean rock of the green stone variety, cropping up above the surface of the soil, which is composed of red earth and a loose calcareous sand containing decayed marine deposits. As early as 1850, it was recognized that the Asylum was, in point of situation and accommodation, far from satisfactory; and in view of its obvious disadvantages, Government have recently decided to erect a new Central Asylum at Yeraoda near Poona, to which, when completed, the inmates of the Colaba Asylum will be transferred.\n\nThe following table gives details of the number of patients and of the expenditure of the Asylum from 1870 onwards:\n\n| Year | Number of Insane | Daily average number of Insane | Expenditure |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n|      | Criminal | Non-criminal | Criminal | Non-criminal | Rs. |\n| 1870 | 20       | 335           | 25        | 209          |     |\n| 1880 | 62       | 495           | 51        | 245          | 63,413 |\n| 1890 | 68       | 388           | 48        | 225          | 69,225 |\n| 1900 | 45       | 451           | 32        | 263          | 75,270 |\n| 1905 | 11       | 219           | 7         | 133          | 59,759 |\n| 1908 | 12       | 217           | 10        | 145          | 67,227 |\n\nDuring the year 1908, 31 European and 41 native patients were admitted to the asylum. Of these 24\nwere suffering from melancholia, 23 from mania, 9 from dementia, 11 from delusional insanity, 3 from idiocy and 2 from general paralysis of the insane. In most cases the primary causes of mental complaints are the use of intoxicating drugs and over indulgence in spirituous liquor, epilepsy, sunstroke, self-abuse, fever and congenital diseases. The asylum is in charge of a medical officer of the Indian Medical Service as Superintendent and a Military Assistant is in sub-charge.\n\nThe first step towards the foundation of a leper asylum in Bombay was taken by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bombay in 1883, who requested Government to place at his disposal for five years one of the old forts at Sion, Matunga, Sewri or Varli, together with a certain area of culturable land in the vicinity, with a view to converting it into the head-quarters of a leper colony. The request could not, for various reasons, be granted, and large numbers of lepers therefore continued as before to collect and ask alms in the crowded portions of the city. One band in particular settled in 1889 around the Nakhoda tank on the Esplanade, between St. Xavier's College and the Elphinstone High School, and were with difficulty dislodged; and this circumstance, in combination with the pressure of public opinion, induced Government in 1890 to issue a notification declaring \"black leprosy\" an infectious disease, dangerous to life, and ordering that all lepers should be sent to the Edalji Framji Albless Leper Home on Trombay island or to the Dinshaw Maneckji Petit Leper Hospital in Ratnagiri. As however the Trombay Asylum had very limited accommodation and the Ratnagiri Asylum was so far off, considerable difficulty was experienced in carrying out these orders. About this date Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit offered Government one lakh of rupees for the erection on Trombay island of a new asylum, the foundation-stone of which was laid by H. R. H. the late Prince Albert Victor of Wales on the 25th March 1890. Meanwhile public opinion had once again been aroused by a letter from Lady Thompson in the \"Times of India,\" and the Municipal Commissioner, Mr. H. A. Acworth, I.C.S., determined to make some provision for the housing of lepers, pending the\ncompletion of a proposed leper home on Trombay island. Under his auspices a public subscription was set on foot, which by May 1892, amounted to nearly one lakh, among the largest subscribers being H. H. the Gaekwar of Baroda, H. H. the Thakore Saheb of Bhavnagar, H. H. the Rao of Cutch, and H. H. the Aga Khan. As a site for the asylum, Mr. Aclworth chose a plot of municipal ground, which had once contained military barracks; several of the old plinths still existed and were capable of adaptation to the new structures. The ground lies on the east of the Matunga road, about two miles north of Government House, Parel, and one-and-half miles from Dadar station. Completely hidden by trees from the road, it is bounded on the west and south by stretches of rice-land, leading to the salt-works, and beyond them by the harbour; while an ample supply of water is obtainable from the Vehar main, which runs along the Matunga road.\n\nThe work of construction commenced in August 1890, under the orders of Mr. Rienzi Walton, Executive Engineer to the Municipality, and the chief buildings, together with comprehensive drainage arrangements, were completed in June 1891, at a cost of Rs. 63,000. By 1897 the asylum was capable of accommodating 300 lepers; in 1900 an additional area was enclosed, on which were built two new wards with accommodation for 50 more patients; while in 1904 Mr. Janardhan Gopal Mantri erected, at his own cost, three small cottages for the use of lepers belonging to the better classes. At present (1909) the asylum can accommodate 350 persons, and is in charge of a medical officer appointed by the Municipal Corporation, aided by a house surgeon and a leper school master. The average annual income of the asylum is about Rs. 48,000 while the average annual expenditure amounts to Rs. 46,000. The inmates of the asylum are thoroughly contented, and have no desire to stray away from their very comfortable quarters; and the degree to which their convenience has been studied is proved by the existence of a Roman Catholic church, a Hindu temple, and a Muhammadan mosque, which were erected by public subscription within the grounds between 1891 and 1893. In 1904, the asylum was provided with a complete installation of X-rays.\nand high frequency currents, which have proved of considerable value for the treatment of the disease.\\footnote{A medical committee expressed the following opinion in 1905:\u2014\u201cThe treatment has resulted in decided improvement in the majority of the cases, and we consider that it should be continued for a further period of one year.\u201d}\n\nAttached to the asylum is a very successful sewage farm, constructed by the late Special Drainage Engineer to the Municipality. When the asylum was opened in 1891, all sullage flowed into large pits, where it was treated with lime, the affluent being afterwards utilized for the irrigation of crops of maize, jowar, lucerne-grass and guinea-grass. But as the general system lacked perfection and the lime proved deleterious to the growth of crops, two settling or septic tanks were constructed, the affluent from which is full of nitrites and nitrates, so favourable to vegetable growth. The marsh gas, engendered by the gradual disintegration of the sewage, is collected in the tanks, subjected to special purification, and utilized for the working of a small gas-engine for cooking-purposes and for the lighting of a considerable portion of the asylum.\\footnote{For further particulars, see Drainage Problems of the East by C. Carkeet-James, Bombay, 1906.} The fodder grown on the farm is chiefly consumed by the bullocks of the Municipal Health Department, while the few vegetables also grown are purchased by the diet contractor for the use of the inmates of the asylum. The net profits of the sewage farm amount to about Rs. 5,000 a year.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hov\u00e9, the Polish Savant, who visited Bombay in 1788, the first attempt at public vaccination was made in that year by Mr. Farmer (presumably one of the Surgeons of the East India Company), who \u201cinoculated about thirteen hundred old and young, out of which he did not lose more than two.\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d adds Dr. Hov\u00e9, \u201chas remarkably abated the small-pox.\u201d\\footnote{Tours in Bombay: Government Selection XVI, 194. Dr. Hov\u00e9 says (same page):\u2014\u201cSmall-pox has appeared in Bombay since the possession and commerce of Europeans.\u201d Small-pox, like measles, appears to have been known in India and China several centuries before the rise of Islam (Nidana, 191-193) and to have spread from Asia to Europe. Still Dr. Hov\u00e9\u2019s information may...}\nattempt to introduce vaccination was apparently made until the commencement of the nineteenth century, when Sir William Jenner, by securing the services of a series of volunteers who submitted to be vaccinated in the course of a voyage to India, was enabled to transmit cow-pox from arm to arm, until Ceylon and India were reached. It is also recorded that about the same date Dr. De Carro, a native of Goa, who was resident in Vienna in 1799, sent a portion of his lymph to the Earl of Elgin (1766-1841), then British Ambassador at Constantinople, who in turn transmitted it to Bombay. Meanwhile the Company's representatives in India were making every effort to impress the value of vaccination upon the minds of the people, who were stoutly opposed to the practice in the first instance. In 1803, the Bombay Government forwarded to the Court of Directors \"twenty copies of a pamphlet recently published at this Presidency by Dr. George Keir, of the medical establishment, containing an account of the introduction of cow-pox into India,\" and added that \"the zealous exertions of that gentleman have proved a principal means of securing the blessing of the discovery to this island\": while in other parts of India the public disinclination to vaccination was overcome to some extent by a pious fraud, in the shape of a Sanskrit poem on the subject composed by Mr. Ellis of Madras, and inscribed on old paper to give it an appearance of extreme antiquity.\n\nDuring the Governorship of the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone (1819-1827) considerable success was achieved, the whole Presidency, including Bombay island, being divided into four charges, each under a European vaccinator. But the progress was necessarily slow in view of\n\nbe so far correct that, with the Portuguese, a fresh or fiercer form of small-pox may have been brought into Western India. If so, it explains why the small-pox mother is Sita (Sitala) the Cold, and why she cannot be pacified till she is made cool. Also the fact that in many of her images Sita carries a child in her arm, not on her hip; and finally why the begging devotees of Sita call themselves Padres or European priests and are perhaps the only Hindu religious beggars who ask alms of Europeans as of right.\u2014Bombay Gazetteer Materials III 563.\n\n1 Bombay Town and Island Materials, III, 564. An advertisement appears in the \"Bombay Courier\" of July 17th, 1802, to the effect that \"Dr. Keir will inoculate children whenever they choose to apply\" etc.\nthe fact that people of all classes believed small-pox to be spirit-caused, and that the only permissible remedy was to tie nim twigs to the cradle or bed of the patient, deck him with flowers, and perform other actions symbolical of the ejectment of the disease. To submit a child to medical treatment on western lines was held, and indeed is still considered by some of the lower classes, to be offensive to the goddess of small-pox. In the year 1858, the first Superintendent of Vaccination, the late Dr. Ananta Chandroba was appointed, the control of operations in the town having been vested up to that date in one of the professors of the Grant Medical College, and in 1872 an attempt was made to introduce compulsory vaccination in the island. The proposal, however, had to be dropped as premature; and it was not until after the severe small-pox epidemic of 1873-76 that a Compulsory Vaccination Act (I of 1877) was drafted and brought into force.\n\nSince the introduction of that Act, Bombay has been divided for the purposes of vaccination into six districts, with one public vaccinator and two permanent public vaccine stations to each district. The entire control of the operations vests in the Bombay Municipality under Act III of 1907. Besides the central vaccine stations which are open daily, other stations are opened on fixed mornings in various parts of the city.\n\nUp to the last decade of the nineteenth century, it was customary to vaccinate by a single puncture\u2014a process which gradually ousted an indigenous method reported to be still in vogue in the Portuguese territories of Goa; but considerable controversy took place in the local press during the early eighties as to the amount of immunity guaranteed by a single puncture, and after the publication of the report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination between 1890 and 1900, this method was discontinued in favour of vaccination by multiple punctures. The latter\n\n---\n\n1 The \"Times of India\" for the 6th June 1861 mentions the fact of a Parsi lady, whose child was attacked with small-pox, walking from the Fort to the Bhuleshwar temple on a Sunday afternoon carrying a pot of chunam (lime), which she allowed to drip on to the ground as she walked. At the temple she performed several ceremonies, paid fees to the guardians of the temple, and then returned home in the same manner. The Bhuleshwar temple has always had a special connection with the small-pox deity.\nprocess has now yielded to vaccination by scarification, as by this method a larger dose of vaccine can be administered in infancy, and the bulk of the people, who, with the single exception of the Parsis, are much averse to re-vaccination, are thereby rendered more immune. One may however remark the fact that the occurrence in the city of severe epidemics, such as those of 1875-76 and 1899-1900, does induce many persons to be re-vaccinated. Of the former epidemic it is recorded that the public severely taxed the resources of the Government vaccination station by flocking thither in crowds, while during the course of the latter outbreak as many as 31,000 persons submitted to re-vaccination. Throughout the earlier portion of the nineteenth century, vaccination was performed from arm to arm; but in 1869 animal vaccination was introduced chiefly through the exertions of Surgeon-Major Blanc, I.M.S., whose patience and tact went far towards allaying public opposition to the measure. The compulsory Vaccination Act of 1877 permits the use of animal lymph only, and makes inoculation with variolous matter penal. From 1877 to 1905 the lymph in use in the city was exclusively animal, either pure or preserved in capillary tubes. Since 1905 vaccination direct from the calf has been largely superseded by the use of glycerinated vaccine, which is far more economical and offers equally satisfactory results. The percentage of successful cases with fresh and preserved glycerinated lymph for the year 1909 was respectively 99'32 and 97'94. A further development, namely the use of chloroformed vaccine, is now being initiated.\n\nUp to 1890-91 a steady increase both in the number of operations and the proportion of the population protected took place; but since 1896 a series of famine years, which enhanced the price of calves, and the annual recurrence of plague in the city have tended to retard further progress; while the removal of the Central Vaccine Depot from the heart of the city to Parel and the high rents which have to be paid for the public vaccine stations in other parts of the city are to some extent responsible for the increased expenditure of late years. The city, however, no longer suffers from frequent\nepidemics of small-pox; and when outbreaks do occur, they are far less virulent than in the period preceding the introduction of the Compulsory Vaccination Act.\n\nThe following table shows the annual number of deaths from small-pox before and after the introduction of the Compulsory Vaccination Act:\n\n| Year | Number of Deaths | Year |

Wyborne (Deputy-Governor, 1686-1690); and according to a deed of 1715 was situated to the east of Bombay Green and to the north of the Honourable Company's bandar. In 1761 Admiral Cornish, who succeeded Admiral Steevens, declined to live in the house on the ground that it was so full of vermin as to be scarcely habitable, and consequently the Bombay Government rented Mr. Whitehill's house on the site of the north-west corner of the present Elphinstone Circle (now partly occupied by Messrs. Kemp & Co.'s buildings), until about 1764, when Mr. Hornby's House, now the Great Western Hotel, was taken for the purpose. Other houses than this may have been rented occasionally between 1764 and 1770; but from the latter date until 1795, Mr. Hornby's spacious mansion was devoted to the use of the Commander-in-Chief of the fleet in India. It was probably about 1795 that Admiralty House was moved to the great block of buildings to the north of Forbes street and west of Apollo street, used in 1894 as Messrs. Finlay Moir and Company's offices, which Dady Nasarwanji constructed between 1790 and 1800. This house\n\n---\n\n1 Voyage from England to India in 1754.\n2 Bombay Gazetteer Materials III., 565. The house was bought by the Company from John Hill in 1715 for Rs. 3,000 and re-sold to him again, soon afterwards. Admiral Charles Steevens died in the house in 1761. See Grose's plan of Bombay (1750), Vol. I, facing page 32.\nmust have been a centre of business and gaiety in 1795 when Rear-Admiral Rainier left Bombay in charge of the expedition against Ceylon; in 1810 when Admiral Bertie and the Bombay Marine set out against Mauritius; in 1811 when Rear-Admiral Stafford led an expedition against Java; and in 1824 when Commodore Grant fitted out the Asia built in Bombay, and led an expedition against Rangoon. Meanwhile Mr. Hornby's House had served since 1800 as the Recorder's Court, though for some little time after its establishment the Admiralty stores continued to be stored in the house.\n\nBetween 1840 and 1864 Admiralty House, or rather the Commodore's House, was probably some bungalow in the Marine Lines. In the latter year the Secretary of State directed the Bombay Government to provide a house for the Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces in the East Indies, and in accordance with these orders a bungalow at the south end of Marine Lines, which Government had purchased in 1860 for Rs. 14,877, was handed over to him. The Admiral took possession of it on the 22nd November 1864; and this house continued to serve as Admiralty House up to 1903.\n\nIn 1905 the new house facing the south end of the Cooperage at the corner of Wodehouse road was completed. The bungalow in Marine Lines has now been demolished.\n\nAnthropological Society.\u2014The Anthropological Society of Bombay was founded in April 1886 for the purpose of promoting the prosecution of anthropological research in India, by investigating and recording facts relating to the physical, intellectual and moral development of man, and more specially of the various races inhabiting the Indian Empire. The affairs of the Society are managed by a council composed of a President, 2 Vice-Presidents, a Secretary and Treasurer, and 5 mem-\n\n---\n\n1 For full details of the earlier history, see Bombay Gazetteer Materials, pp. 565\u2013572.\n\n2 The founder and first President of the Society was Edward Tyrell Leith. Among the most distinguished members have been H. R. H. the Duke of Connaught, Sir Monier-Williams, the Right Reverend Robert Caldwell (Bishop of Tinnevelly), Professor T. H. Huxley, Professor Montegazza, Professor J. Darmesteter, Dr. Adolf Bastian, Count Angelo de Gubernatis, Dr. Paul Topinard, and Professor Rudolf Virchow.\nbers: and monthly meetings are held in the rooms of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in the Town Hall, at which papers upon matters of anthropological interest are read and discussed. These papers, together with reports of proceedings, are published in a journal, of which the first number appeared in December 1886, and which has now reached its eighth volume. The Society established a small museum and library, both of which were handed over in 1896 to the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in return for the use of the latter Society's rooms. The former, which contains some interesting exhibits, may eventually be housed in the Prince of Wales' Museum of Western India. The Society corresponds and exchanges publications with similar scientific societies in Great Britain, Australia, America, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Japan. The annual income of the Society is about Rs. 700, including interest on an invested sum of Rs. 2,500.\n\nBai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals.\u2014The Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals was opened by Lord Dufferin in 1882, and owes its existence in great measure to the activity of the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. A resolution to establish a dispensary having been formed and several Bombay merchants having offered donations in cash and kind, Sir Dinshaw M. Petit, who was greatly interested in the work, offered a large plot of land with a bungalow at Parel, valued at that date at Rs. 45,000, for use as a hospital, provided that the building should bear his wife's name. The hospital was opened for work in 1884 with three wards, one accommodating 26 horses and the other two 90 bullocks, and, thanks to the liberality of several Bombay residents, has considerably expanded since that date. At the present date (1910) the hospital contains three wards, accommodating 66 horses, an isolation ward for 16 horses, and a special loose box for one tetanus patient and a colic ward with two special loose boxes for horses suffering from colic. There are also 5 cattle wards, accommodating 256 herd of cattle, and a cattle operating shed and two dog wards for 28 dogs. An operating theatre is about to be built. The annual expendi-\nture of the hospital is about Rs. 50,000, and the income is chiefly derived from donations. Under the terms of an agreement with Government, the hospital is entitled to the gratuitous veterinary services of the teaching staff of the Government Veterinary College, and in exchange provides a large bungalow belonging to the trustees of the hospital for the use rent-free of the College. An executive committee of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals administers the affairs of the hospital, which levies certain fees for the admission of animals. All classes of animals are treated at the hospital both as indoor and outdoor patients comprising horses, cattle dogs and various other pet animals and birds. In 1909, 3,171 animals were treated as inpatients in the hospital, the various classes of animals treated comprising 745 horses, 1,906, cattle and 520 dogs. The number of outpatients treated was 1,106.\n\nBank of Bombay.\u2014By the year 1836 the rapid extension of commerce and a considerable increase of capital in Bombay impressed upon the public mind the need of a bank upon the island; and accordingly on the 26th December, 1836, a public meeting was held in the office of Messrs. John Skinner and Co., which adopted \"a prospectus for a bank for the Presidency of Bombay\" and appointed a provisional committee to secure a Charter for it. It was agreed that the Charter should be modelled on that of the Bank of Bengal; that the business of the bank should be confined to receiving deposits, keeping cash accounts discounting bills and drafts and other investments, and to issuing bank notes in the current coin and bank post-bills, payable at short dates; that the capital of the bank should be 30 lakhs, divided into 3000 shares of one thousand rupees apiece; and that 300 shares should be reserved for Government. Within a month from the date of the meeting, applications for shares were received for nearly double the agreed amount of 30 lakhs, and with\n\n---\n\n1 For several years previous the average balance of sums placed in the Treasury by a few merchants only had amounted to more than 20 lakhs. This fact, coupled with the serious inconvenience in the transfer of large sums arising from the currency, and with the need of a place of discount for traders, led the public to believe in the expediency of a bank similar to the banks already existing in Calcutta and Madras.\nthe sanction of the Governor-in-Council the capital was raised to 50 lakhs. The request for a Charter was approved by the Bombay Government; and to prevent delay in the event of the Court of Directors refusing to take the shares reserved for Government, two forms of Charter were prepared and executed, one of which provided for the holding of shares by the Honourable Company and the other omitted this provision. Both Charters were despatched to England in January 1837, the opening of the bank being deferred until one of the Charters should be returned with the confirmation of the Court. In the meantime, however, a second public meeting was held, at which it was resolved that if neither Charter was sanctioned within eight months, a Joint-Stock Bank should be established, the same committee appointed to watch the interests of the Chartered Bank being nominated for the Joint-Stock Bank.\n\nGreat delay occurred in the confirmation of the Charter by the Court of Directors. Not only was the project stoutly opposed by certain Bombay capitalists, who had hitherto enjoyed a practical monopoly of banking; but prior to the arrival of the Despatch from the Bombay Government, the Directors had asked the opinion of the Government of India on a scheme for a Bank of India, and consequently declined to deal with the Bombay proposals until an answer had been received from India on the larger question. The greatest impatience was manifested in Bombay; and after extending the period of eight months originally fixed for opening the Joint-Stock Bank, and on learning from their representative in England in December 1837 that the Court of Directors were as far from sanctioning the Charter as ever, the subscribers to both banks held a public meeting on the 20th March 1838, and resolved that if the Charter had not been sanctioned by the 1st October 1838, all accounts relating to the Chartered Bank should be closed.\n\nBut on the 29th September 1838, just as the foregoing resolution was about to be carried into effect, the Court of Directors signed a despatch sanctioning an Act of Incorporation, which together with the proposed Act was forwarded to the Bank Committee by the Bombay Govern-\nment on the 27th November. The Act was accepted at a general meeting of the Bank on the 18th December 1838; but further delay was caused by the refusal of the Government of India to recognise the right of subscribers to the benefit of the Act of Incorporation, and by their decision to offer for sale by public auction all shares except those reserved for Government. Against this decision the Bank Committee appealed in the strongest terms to the Governor-General, Lord Auckland, and also in February, 1839, to the Court of Directors, pointing out at the same time that in spite of the Directors' orders the draft Act of Incorporation differed materially from the Act incorporating the Bank of Bengal. Eventually in December 1839 formal intimation was received that the Court of Directors had decided the question in favour of the subscribers, and that the publication and passing of the Charter of the Bank would take place without delay. The proprietors on the date of the Court of Directors' Despatch (September 29th 1838) were chosen as those on whom the Act of Incorporation should be conferred. On the 17th February, 1840, Act III of 1840, constituting the Bank, was passed by the Government of India; and on the 15th April 1840, the Bank commenced business with a capital of 52\u00bd lakhs, including three lakhs subscribed by the Bombay Government. Three of the nine Directors were nominees of Government: and the Bank enjoyed the privileges of a note issue, the maximum limit of which was fixed at two crores, and the smallest denomination of notes issued being Rs. 10.\n\nUp till 1863 the Bank prospered under prudent management, paid good dividends to the shareholders and never, it is said, incurred greater losses in the aggregate than Rs. 25,000. In November 1848, it faced a curious panic which lasted for some days and was caused by a few\n\n---\n\n1 The Bombay Bank Commission remarked in their report:\n\n\"Another element of prosperity was the power to issue so large an amount of notes; but in 1860 the Government of India determined to deprive the Bank of this power and establish a paper currency of its own. As compensation for this, Government proposed to entrust the management of the General Treasuries, Pay Office and Currency Department, with their respective cash balances, to the Bank. But this proposal was subsequently modified, and only the Treasuries and Pay Offices were transferred to the charge of the Bank.\"\nforged notes being put into circulation in the city, payment of which was refused by the Bank. This being the first case of forgery of this kind known in Bombay, the run upon the Bank was for a time excessive.\n\nIn 1861 the Board of Directors determined, in consequence of new arrangements for the note issue, to prepare an Act similar to that of the Bank of Bengal and empowering the increase of the Bank's capital to 210 lakhs. This Act (X of 1863), which received the assent of the Governor-in-Council, differed from Act III of 1840 in that (a) it allowed the discount of any negotiable security; (b) it allowed advances to be made on the security of shares in public companies in India and did not require that all the calls on such shares should be paid up; (c) it allowed an advance to any one firm for a larger amount than 3 lakhs and for a longer period than 3 months; (d) it allowed advances on all goods and merchandise, whether perishable or not; (e) it contained no definite provision against the overdraft of accounts; (f) it contained no provision prohibiting any discount or loan, unless the cash in the bank equalled one-fourth of all the claims outstanding against it at the time; and (h) it empowered the proprietors to increase the capital at a special general meeting, provided such increase did not exceed 2 crores and 10 lakhs.\n\nThe passing of the Act was at once followed by an extraordinary increase of the Bank's capital. At a special general meeting held on the 21st September 1863, it was resolved to double the capital by the issue of 5,225 new shares of one thousand rupees each; while at a second meeting on the 7th March 1864, suggested by Mr. Cowasji Jehangir, a proposal to further enhance the capital by 52\u00bd lakhs was unanimously carried. The latter resolution was however rescinded on the 9th June 1864, in favour of a proposal to issue one new share to every old share, thus making the paid-up capital 209 lakhs.\n\n---\n\n1 \"Much fault was found with the Directors for these increases of capital. But the first increase of 52\u00bd lakhs was necessary and did no more than supply the deficiency occasioned by the Bank's loss of their note circulation; while the second increase was largely justified by the increased trade of the port, the opening of several branch banks and the inadequacy of the Bank's capital to meet the public wants during great financial pressure. The final increase of capital by 104\u00bd lakhs was clearly unwise. Had the Bank only\nSuch were the conditions at the outset of the most eventful period in the history of the Bank (June, 1864 to April, 1865). By 1863 symptoms of wild speculation, consequent upon the extraordinary rise in the price of cotton caused by the American War, had already appeared, and they developed with amazing rapidity on the foundation in June, 1864, of the Bombay Reclamation (Back Bay) Company, and the Financial Association of India and China. During the remainder of that year and the early part of 1865, companies were floated for every imaginable purpose, from banking to livery and veterinary supply, their shares in most cases being sold at high premia; and the Secretary of the Bank, arrogating to himself unrestricted power and unchecked by any supervision on the part of the Directors, advanced many lakhs of rupees to individuals and ephemeral companies on no other security than a promissory note. The discount list was discontinued; no loans were submitted for sanction to the Board or the weekly committee; money was constantly advanced to persons already heavily indebted to the Bank; the only restriction placed on the Secretary by the resolution of August 6th, 1863, regarding advances on the security of shares, was practically evaded; and large sums were loaned for much longer periods than three months, no difficulty being made about renewal if the interest was regularly paid. The failure of the Bank was thus rendered inevitable, contributory causes being the negligence of the Presidents and Directors, the exceptional nature of the period which demanded more than ordinary vigilance from everyone connected with the Bank, and the complete absence of sound legal advice and assistance. At a special general meeting held on the 13th January 1868, it was resolved to wind up affairs and to appoint a liquidator, who issued a report on the 12th November 1868, showing that of the paid-up capital a sum of Rs 1,88,99,334 had been irretrievably lost.\n\nThe third period of the Bank's history commences in 1868\u20141910. January 1868, when the Bank was reconstructed under the\n\nwaited for the effect of the increase determined upon on the 7th March 1864, the last 52\u00bd lakhs would probably never have been raised, since the Bank had more money than it could safely invest.\"\u2014Report of the Bombay Bank Commission.\ntitle of the New Bank of Bombay, Limited. Its capital was fixed at one crore of rupees, divided into 20,000 shares of five hundred rupees apiece; a prospectus was issued on the 19th July 1867; and subscriptions were invited from the shareholders of the old Bank and the public for the first issue of 10,000 shares at par. The allotment, in which shareholders of the old Bank had a preference, was made on the 16th December, 1867, and the shares were paid up in full by March 1868. Government contributed 6 lakhs and remained shareholders until 1875, when their shares were sold. Of the remaining 10,000 shares, 8,327 were issued to shareholders of the old Bank at par and 1,673 were privately sold by the Directors at a premium of 19%. In 1876 the Presidency Banks Act was passed, under which the Bank, under its earlier title of Bank of Bombay, as also the other Presidency Banks of Bengal and Madras were constituted and have since continued to work. By this Act the Bank's operations are confined to India and are strictly circumscribed. Since 1868 the Bank has made steady progress, and in addition to building up a large reserve fund has paid gradually enhanced dividends to its shareholders. In 1878 and again in 1898 it passed through a period of great anxiety. The semi-crisis of the former year was in great measure a reflection of the failure of the City of Glasgow Bank; while the difficulties of 1898 were due to shortage of money caused by an extraordinary combination of political and financial events. For scarcely had the effects of the famine of 1896-97 disappeared, when trouble arose on the North-West Frontier, which still further deranged the finances of Government. So great was the strain that in the autumn of 1897 Government were compelled to discontinue remittances to England and to recall previous remittances by buying drafts on India in London. These facts, coupled with the low level of trade balances in 1897-98, and the fact that no rupees had been coined since 1893, produced a very severe strain on the money market and raised the Bank rate from 10 per cent. in January 1898 to 13 per cent. in February, at which figure it remained until May when it was reduced to 12 per cent.\nThe tension was gradually relieved after the middle of June by a rise of the trade-balance in favour of India, by considerable imports of gold for currency purposes and by large disbursements by Government in payment of Council drafts.\n\nThe Reserve Fund, which is held entirely in public Financial securities, now (1909) amounts to 103 lakhs, its progress condition and busi ness by quinquennial periods since 1868 being shown in the subjoined table:\n\n| Year | Rupees |\n|------|--------|\n| 1868 | ...    |\n| 1873 | 4      |\n| 1878 | 13,00  |\n| 1883 | ...    |\n| 1888 | 24,25  |\n| 1893 | 41,00  |\n| 1898 | ...    |\n| 1903 | 54,00  |\n| 1908 | 1,01,00|\n\nIn thousands of rupees (000s omitted).\n\nThe average annual net profits earned by the Bank at different periods have been:\u20141868 to 1877, 7\u00b758 lakhs; 1878 to 1887, 9\u00b759 lakhs; 1888 to 1897, 14\u00b788 lakhs; 1898 to 1907, 18\u00b711 lakhs.\n\nThe dividends paid to shareholders since 1868 are shown in the following table:\n\n| Year | Per Cent. | Year | Per Cent. | Year | Per Cent. |\n|------|-----------|------|-----------|------|-----------|\n| 1868 | 4\u00b779      | 1882 | 9\u00b750      | 1897-1900 | 11     |\n| 1869-71 | 5\u00b750   | 1883 | 7\u00b750      | 1901 | 12       |\n| 1872 | 7\u00b750      | 1884 | 9\u00b750      | 1902-03 | 11     |\n| 1873-74 | 8\u00b750   | 1885 | 7\u00b750      | 1904-05 | 13     |\n| 1875-76 | 7\u00b750   | 1886 | 9        | 1906 | 13       |\n| 1877-78 | 8\u00b750   | 1887 | 10\u00b750     | 1907 | 13       |\n| 1879 | 6\u00b750      | 1888 | 11\u00b750     | 1908 | 13       |\n| 1880 | 7\u00b750      | 1889-90 | 10     | 1909 | 13       |\n| 1881 | 8        | 1895-96 | 12     |\n\nThe Bank deals with two classes of deposits, namely, Government and \"Other\" deposits. The former were considerable in the early days of the Bank's existence, but were largely reduced in 1874 and now form only a small proportion of the total deposits.\n\nOf \"Other\" deposits, there are current deposits payable at call and bearing no interest; fixed deposits of Rs. 500 and upwards bearing interest varying from 4 to 3 per cent. and Savings Bank deposits of sums varying from 4 annas\nto Rs. 1,000, bearing a fixed interest of 3 per cent. The increase during recent years of these three classes of deposits jointly is shown in the following table:\n\n| Year | Average Balance in Lakhs | Year | Average Balance in Lakhs | Year | Average Balance in Lakhs |\n|------|--------------------------|------|--------------------------|------|--------------------------|\n| 1868-72 | Rs. 196                  | 1883-87 | Rs. 211                  | 1898-1902 | Rs. 414                 |\n| 1873-77 | Rs. 140                  | 1888-92 | Rs. 357                  | 1903-07 | Rs. 693                 |\n| 1878-82 | Rs. 206                  | 1893-97 | Rs. 357                  | 1909  | Rs. 963                 |\n\nThe Bank is authorised to discount bills, and to advance and lend money and open cash credits upon securities detailed in the Presidency Banks Act, and is also authorized to grant advances and loans to the Secretary of State for India in Council without any specific security.\n\nThe following is a comparative statement of the Bank\u2019s total annual advances and discounts since 1868:\n\n| Period | Average Amount in Lakhs | Period | Average Amount in Lakhs |\n|--------|-------------------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| 1868-72 | Rs. 115                  | 1888-92 | Rs. 288                 |\n| 1873-77 | Rs. 160                  | 1893-97 | Rs. 281                 |\n| 1878-82 | Rs. 190                  | 1898-1902 | Rs. 380                |\n| 1883-87 | Rs. 221                  | 1903-07 | Rs. 540                 |\n|        |                         | 1909   | Rs. 651                 |\n\nThe Bank rate for loans against Government securities usually reaches a maximum during the period January to April in each year and touches its lowest point between July and September.

Up to 1896 the Government Savings Bank was also managed by the Bank but was transferred in that year to the charge of the Post Office. With a steady increase in dividends and regular additions to the reserve fund, the value of Bank shares has been gradually enhanced, the present (1909) quotation being Rs. 1,500 per share.

The Gujarat and Berar branches are chiefly engaged in financing the cotton and mill industries, while the Sind branches principally finance the wheat crop.\n\n---\n\n1 In 1864 a branch of the old Bank of Bombay was established in Bhavnagar and carried on business until the failure of the Bank.\nThe original premises of the Bank were in the building now (1910) occupied by Messrs. Ralli Bros. in Rampart Row; and most of the daily business was transacted on the floor now tenanted by Messrs. Badham, Pile and Co. About 1860 the Bank was removed to a new stone building, now the Currency Office; and in 1862, when the Elphinstone Circle scheme was brought forward, the Bank took up land there and commenced the erection of the present building, which was completed, and to which the Bank was removed, in 1866. The Currency Office building was then sold by public auction to the Presidency Bank, one of the mushroom associations which sprang up during the share mania, but two years later Government, having decided to have a currency office of its own, purchased the building from the Presidency Bank at a price which gave the latter a profit of two lakhs.\n\nBombay Art Society.\u2014The Bombay Art Society was founded in 1888 with the object of encouraging art, particularly among amateurs, and of educating the native public to an appreciation of its merits. Since that date eighteen exhibitions have been held, of which three were held in the Secretariat, two in the Town Hall, and the remainder in the School of Art building. About 10,000 pictures have been exhibited and more than Rs. 20,000 has been distributed in prizes. The Society has also held an annual conversazione during the last few years, at which private collections of porcelain and pottery, collections of water-colour sketches, and examples of embossed leather work have been exhibited. The Society depends for its funds upon the subscriptions of members and has from time to time also received grants from Government. The publication of a journal is under consideration.\n\nBombay Bacteriological Laboratory.\u2014The Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory, which occupies Old Government House, Parel, was originally opened by Mr. Haffkine in a small room in the Petit Laboratory on the 8th October, 1896, under the title of the Plague Research Laboratory.\n\n---\n\n1 This building is described in the Bombay Times of the 28th March, 1840, as having been formerly occupied by Messrs. Nicol and Co. and Mancharji Nasarwanji, and as \"nearly in front of the present temporary entrance into the Fort.\"\nWhile the laboratory acts as a general research institute for the Bombay Presidency, plague research still remains one of its chief duties. Here Mr. Haffkine first prepared his plague prophylactic, and here the Plague Research Commission, working upon facts and materials accumulated by the staff of the Laboratory throughout a period of ten years, made their discoveries in connection with the aetiology of plague. Here also the second Plague Research Commission has been working since 1905.\n\nThe plague prophylactic or anti-plague vaccine is a culture of the plague-bacillus, which, after growing in broth for a period of at least six weeks, is sterilised or killed, carbolised and then placed in hermetically-sealed glass bottles. Each bottle contains as a rule 20 cubic centimetres of the vaccine, which is the equivalent of five full doses. The broth or soil in which the plague-germs are cultivated is manufactured from goat's flesh or wheat flour. The plague germ is isolated either from the blood or the bubo of a patient suffering from the disease, and is purified by growing it in test-tubes containing broth-jelly, which is made by adding seaweed known as agar-agar or chini ghas to the liquid broth. The germ is then thoroughly identified as the plague bacillus by submitting it to a number of tests, is cultivated in a Pasteur flask for a period of not more than 14 days, and is finally multiplied by transference to several larger flasks, each containing one litre of broth. These flasks, sown with the plague-germs, are placed in rows on long tables, and are kept there in semi-darkness for a period of three months. During this period the plague-germs multiply enormously, so that the broth, which was clear when brought into the room, becomes extremely turbid. The germs in these flasks are, after a further test, killed by being subjected to a temperature of 55\u00b0C or 131\u00b0F for fifteen minutes\u2014a process effected by submerging the flasks in hot water. The vaccine thus formed is then introduced into special glass bottles by a patent aseptic process, and these bottles are despatched from the laboratory for use in various parts of India. Since the institute opened up to the end of 1909 the total number of doses sent out was more than 8 million.\nBesides preparing anti-plague and other vaccines the laboratory also serves as a pathological diagnosis institute. Pathological specimens of all sorts are examined and reported on. Slide preparations made from blood, ulcers, etc., are stained and examined, serum sent in blood capsules is tested, sections from tumours are prepared, diseases of animals, such as plague in rats, rabies in dogs and anthrax in cattle, are reported upon. Mosquitoes, fleas, biting-flies and other insects are examined and identified, as also are snakes. Scientific apparatus, chemicals, stains, sera, etc., are supplied to Government hospitals and dispensaries. According to the figures for the last ten years the average annual cost of the laboratory has been approximately Rs. 1,34,489.\n\nBombay Baroda & Central India Railway Offices.\u2014The administrative offices of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway Company were originally located at Surat, whence they were removed to Bombay about the year 1863 and located at Lal Bagh, Parel. Thence they were moved to Dhanji street, Grant Road, and from there to Medows street and finally to Church Gate street where they occupied the building now (1909) used by the Royal Insurance Company. In 1894 the present offices, opposite Church Gate station, were commenced and were completed in 1899 under the direction of the architect, Mr. F. W. Stevens, at a cost of 7\u00bd lakhs. The building is faced with blue basalt stone, and the domes, mouldings, capitals, columns, cornices and carvings are in Kurla, Dhrangadhra and Porbander stone. The length of the west fa\u00e7ade is 276 feet, and the height of the central tower is 160 feet. The central gable is crowned by a group of figures representing \"Engineering\" from the studio of Mr. Roscoe Mullins of London. Two carved heads of Colonels French and Kennedy, the pioneers of the Company, also by the same sculptor, are placed in the circular panels between the arches of the central carriage porch on the west. These have weathered badly and are shortly to be replaced by facsimiles in bronze, prepared by Mr. C. Burns. The building consists of three floors, devoted to offices, and in the centre below the dome is an extra floor for the storage of records. The main entrance\nhall, facing Church Gate station, is 25 feet square and is floored with coloured marble. The ceiling is of panelled teak, decorated in light shades of cream and gold. From this hall corridors lead down the entire length of the building and give access to the various offices. On the ground floor are the season-ticket office, the chief cashier's office and the departments of the Chief Medical Officer, the General Traffic Manager and the Traffic Superintendent. On the first floor are the offices of the Locomotive Superintendent, the Secretary, the Agent, the Police Superintendent and the Chief Engineer, while the whole of the second floor is occupied by the Audit department with the exception of the central room under the tower, which is reserved for the use of officers of the Company. A printing-press is located in the record room in the tower. The building was partially destroyed by fire on the 15th November 1905, during the illuminations in honour of the visit of T. R. H. the Prince and Princess of Wales. The damaged portion was rebuilt a year later under the supervision of Mr. C. F. Stevens.\n\nBombay Club.\u2014The Bombay Club arose out of the old Indian Navy Club, which was opened in 1845 and dissolved in 1862, and possesses relics of the latter in the shape of a Burmese bell in the entrance hall and several handsome candelabra. The club-house was originally situated in Rampart Row, next to the present offices of the P. and O. S. N. Company, and moved in 1875 to its present quarters in Esplanade road. Situated in the heart of the European business quarter and close to the High Court, it is largely frequented by merchants, bankers, brokers, solicitors and barristers.\n\nBombay Hunt.\u2014The first notice of a pack of hounds in Bombay belongs to the year 1830, prior to which date sport was confined to hunting with a \"bobbery pack\" and to annual \"rides\" round the island. In 1810, for example, the programme of the ride consisted of breakfast at Malabar Point at 9 a.m., then a sharp trot to \"the Breach,\" Love Grove and Varli, ending up with tiffin at one o'clock in Mahim college. After tiffin the party rode\n\n---\n\n1 For a more detailed description, see Times of India of 10th February 1894.\nvia Mahim, Sion and Mazagon to Hope Hall, where dinner was served at 6 p.m.; The Courier had a notice in March, 1811, that \"The Picnic meets this morning at gun-fire on the course, where the hounds will throw off. A numerous field and great sport is expected. Afterwards bobbery hunting until breakfast, which has been ordered for fifty at the Stand at 9; the party will then proceed to Lowjee Castle, where various Hindustani gymnastics, pigeon-shooting, tumbling, juggling, etc., will be exhibited till 4, when a dinner in the real English style will be served up for the same number as at breakfast. The sports of the day to conclude with music, fireworks.\" In 1830 the \"Bombay Foxhounds\" were in existence, and owing to the difficulty of obtaining foxes or jackals in sufficient quantity, a drag was usually arranged. On occasions, however, a few foxes were sent down by road from Poona to Panvel and thence across the harbour to be eventually turned down in the Parel district. In 1862 the Bombay Hunt was founded under the patronage of the Governor, Sir Bartle Frere, by the residents of Bombay and Thana; and after the construction of kennels on the Byculla flats, hunting was commenced in the northern portion of the island with 15 couple of \"undersized foxhounds, which had run as harriers,\" imported from England. The venture unfortunately met with scant success. In the first place the huntsman, brought out from England, proved useless, being unable \"to ride, hunt the hounds, halloo, or speak the vernacular\"; hunting itself over the flats was impeded by railway construction, and the ground was so bad for scent that resort was perforce made to \"drags of red herring and aniseed\"; while thirdly the climate of the flats proved so deleterious to the health of the hounds that by March 1863 only one hound and seven \"country dogs\" were alive. These circumstances, coupled with the difficulty of importing hounds from England and keeping them alive for even a few months,\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Courier, August 25th, 1810.\n2 Times of India, 20th April 1898.\n3 The meeting was held on the 28th January 1862 in the Old Town Barracks.\nled to the disbanding of the hunt in March 1863. In 1870, a well-known sportsman named Hartopp, who was passing through Bombay, was asked to send out a double pack from Lord Fitzwilliam, and about 20 couple of hounds were duly received in October of that year. The hunt was accordingly resuscitated, its affairs being managed by a committee consisting of Messrs. A. T. Crawford, H. Cleveland, T. Taylor and others. These hounds nearly all died in the early part of 1871; and Bombay remained without a pack until 1873, when a fresh lot were imported and kennelled at Love Grove under the charge of a European whipper-in called Philson. The mastership of this pack was held by Mr. N. Symons, Mr. G. K. Remington and Mr. Cecil Gray in succession. A fresh lot of hounds was annually imported and hunting was regularly carried on over the southern portion of Salsette, until 1890, when, in consequence of a meeting held in December 1889, the present Jackal Club, with its headquarters at Santa Cruz in Salsette, was established.\n\nSince that date the Bombay Hunt has continued to hunt regularly over Salsette island, importing about October in each year 30 couple of English foxhounds, which are usually sold in batches at the close of each season (March) to other hunt committees or private persons in India. In 1901 the hounds were moved from Bandora to new kennels at Santa Cruz. Owing to the steady northward expansion of the city, and the colonization of much that was open country but a few years ago, it is probable that the Bombay Hunt will be forced to leave the Salsette country and seek its sport in more distant parts of the Thana District. At the close of each season the Jackal Club holds a point-to-point race meeting which constitutes one of the last social fixtures of the Bombay cold weather. The affairs of the hunt are managed by a Committee and Honorary Secretary, elected annually by the subscribers.\n\n---\n\n1 Records of the Bombay Hunt.\n2 The Bombay climate proves extremely trying to imported hounds, and in spite of excellent management, the Bombay Hunt has on more than one occasion had to record considerable mortality among its hounds. Since 1892-93 the office of M. F. H. has been\nBombay Natural History Society.\u2014The Bombay Natural History Society was founded on the 15th September 1883 by eight residents of Bombay for the purpose of exchanging notes and observations on zoology and of exhibiting interesting specimens of animal life. The possibility of establishing a museum was not at that date contemplated. The first few meetings of the Society were held in the Victoria and Albert Museum at Byculla; but in 1884 Mr. H. M. Phipson offered the use of a room in his office in the Fort, which resulted in a greatly increased membership and better attendance at the meetings. To this room, which was situated in 18, Forbes street, Mr. Phipson added the use of others, which continued to serve as the headquarters of the Society until December 1885, when the present more suitable premises at 6, Apollo street, were obtained. In the month of May 1885 the Society divided its activities into separate sections, to ensure the more scientific treatment of zoological phenomena; and in January 1886 issued, under the editorship of Messrs. R. A. Sterndale and E. H. Aitken, the first number of its now widely popular journal. From 1888 to 1898 the journal was edited by Mr. H. M. Phipson, from 1898 to 1905 by Messrs. Phipson and Millard, from 1905 to 1907 by Mr. W. S. Millard, assisted by Messrs. Comber and L. C. H. Young, and from 1907 onwards by the same gentlemen, assisted by Messrs. R. A. Spence and N. B. Kinnear. The journal has now reached its twentieth volume. The Society possesses a valuable reference library containing about 1,000 volumes, and good collections of birds, snakes, lizards, small mammals, insects, marine and land shells, fishes, birds' eggs and a herbarium. It also owns a fine collection of horns, heads and skulls of Indian mammalia and the nucleus of a geological collection.\n\nThe eight gentlemen were:\u2014Mr. J. Macdonald, Mr. E. H. Aitken, Colonel Swinhoe, Mr. J. C. Anderson, Mr. J. Johnstone, Dr. Atmaram, Dr. Maconochie and Dr. Sakharan Arjun. A Natural History Society had been started in 1856, but lasted only three years. Its promoters were Dr. Don, Dr. Leith, Dr. Carter, Mr. Jenkins, Registrar of the Supreme Court, and Dr. Buist.\nThe collections are limited to the Oriental region. The Society now consists of more than 1,300 members. In 1903 the Bombay Government agreed to contribute an annual sum of Rs. 2,500, which was increased in 1907 to Rs. 5,000, to permit of the Society engaging a trained assistant from Europe to superintend the museum.\n\n**Bombay Observatory (Colaba).\u2014** The observatory is situated located at the extreme end of Colaba, which runs about three miles south-west from the Fort and separates the harbour from Back Bay. The mean level of the observatory compound is 32 feet above the mean level of the sea. The nearest elevated ground is Malabar hill, lying north-north-westwards at a distance of about 5 miles on the opposite side of the bay, while that which subtends the largest vertical angle (but less than $1^\\circ 7'$) as seen from the observatory is the southern hill of the island of Karanja, situated east-south-east at a distance of about 8 miles across the harbour. The peculiar situation of the observatory, surrounded as it is by sea, has a remarkably regulating effect upon the oscillations of the meteorological and climatic factors; and as regards wind, since the average gradient from Bombay to the Western Ghats is a little more than 1 in 100, its peculiar situation must influence but little the winds that reach Bombay from over the sea, which is the prevalent direction and those blowing from landward. The observatory is built upon the red sandy soil which characterises the neighbouring hills and through which the basaltic trap of Bombay crops up at intervals. The exact geographical position of the observatory is\u2014$18^\\circ 53' 45''$ N., $72^\\circ 48' 56''$ E.\n\nThe important services rendered to the Indian Marine by the purely astronomical observatory of Madras induced the Honourable East India Company in 1822 to establish another observatory at Bombay. The site, the present one, was enclosed in 1823. The building was erected in 1826 by Mr. Curwin, the first Astronomer in charge. For a period of nine years, work does not appear to have been carried on systematically, as no details of the instruments used or of the work done can be traced. It is however recorded that once during the period all the instruments\nwere sent back to England, as in the Astronomer's opinion they were found to give very unsatisfactory results. In 1835 the observatory was placed under the charge of Mr. Orlebar, who was also Professor of Astronomy at the Elphinstone College. The transit instrument was installed in 1840 along with a sidereal clock and two mean time clocks [all of which are in order and in use up to the present date] for the purpose of giving time to the shipping in the harbour and facilitating the rating of chronometers of private ships and ships of the R. I. Marine and the Royal Navy\u2014work which still forms a part of the routine. Time signals were first communicated to the harbour by a ball service at Bombay Castle, for which an electric clock communicating with the Castle clock was specially installed, the observatory clock keeping the latter under control by electric currents. The extension northwards of the harbour later on necessitated an additional ball service and clock, which were installed at the Prince's Dock in 1891. Time signals were given formerly at both places at local times, but at present the balls are dropped at 8-30 A.M., Standard Time, at the Prince's Dock, and at 2 P.M. at the Castle every week day throughout the year. A new transit instrument, a new sidereal clock, two Riefler sidereal clocks, and a chronograph for facilitating star observations were added to the equipment between 1897 and 1909.\n\nNo meteorological or magnetical observations taken before 1841 are on record. On the recommendation of the Royal Society, however, systematic observations began in that year and the observatory was associated in the prosecution of research in meteorology and magnetism (besides continuing its astronomical work) with the colonial observatories of Toronto, Hobarton, St. Helena, Singapore, the Cape of Good Hope, and with the Indian observatories at Simla and Madras. From this year the active life of the observatory may be said to have commenced. In 1842, Mr. Orlebar, the Professor of Astronomy at the Elphinstone College, was succeeded by Dr. Buist, but the appointment of Astronomer at the observatory was subsequently held by officers of Her Majesty's Navy, stationed at Bombay. This ar-\nrangement continued till 1864, during which period continuous records of astronomical, magnetical and meteorological observations were secured. But the work was not wholly satisfactory; and the generally defective condition of the equipment of the observatory resulted in the appointment by Government of a committee of inquiry which, after a full investigation, recommended that (1) a full equipment comprising the latest type of recording instruments should be procured, and (2) a full-time and fully-qualified officer should be appointed as Director. These recommendations were at once acted upon, and Mr. C. Chambers was selected as the first Director in 1865. The change thus initiated has more than fulfilled the anticipations which were then formed regarding the utility of the institution, which now claims to be recognized as a first-class institution of well-established reputation in the scientific world. Both the magnetical and meteorological branches were, as recommended, fully equipped with photographic and mechanically self-recording instruments and with other auxiliary instruments for eye observations.\n\nThe activity of the observatory under Mr. Chambers' r\u00e9gime is apparent from the published papers and volumes of the observatory for the years 1865 to 1894, which contain valuable contributions to the sciences of meteorology and magnetism. On the death of Mr. Chambers in February 1896, Mr. N. A. F. Moos, Professor of Physics at the Elphinstone College, was selected by Government to fill the vacancy, and the institution has since been under his direction. During this period, the instruments in the astronomical, magnetical and meteorological departments have been adequately supplemented from time to time by new ones in keeping with the advance of science.\n\nIn 1898 the observatory was selected by the Government of India as one of the stations for the prosecution of inquiry in the science of seismology in connection with the international scheme initiated by the British Association for the advancement of science. Instruments for recording earthquakes have been installed since, and the work of observation and investigation in this branch of science has been added to the regular daily routine work. The publication of volumes giving the observations and investigations\nin the sciences of magnetism, meteorology and seismology has been continued to the present date. Since 1899 the observatory has been under the direct control of the Government of India.\n\nThe introduction of electric tramways in all the larger cities of the world has affected almost all important observatories, vitiating their magnetic observations and compelling the removal of at least that part of the work to protected sites in the neighbourhood, safe from the disturbing effects of the electric currents. Bombay has not escaped the fate of other observatories. Fortunately, however, means were taken in time to preserve the continuity of the Bombay record. A magnetic branch of the observatory was erected on a suitable site sufficiently far away from Bombay to be beyond the vitiating effects of electric traction and yet near enough to show almost similar magnetic conditions. The site, which was finally chosen in 1902, is at Alibag on the coast of the mainland, about 18 miles south-east of Bombay. The observatory buildings were ready in January 1904, and were equipped with a full set of new magnetic instruments ordered out from England. The work of the duplicate series\u2014that of comparison of the Colaba magnetic record with that of the new site at Alibag\u2014commenced in March 1904, and has given sufficient data to link up the Alibag series with that of Colaba, and to allow of the magnetic work at the latter station, which was stopped in March 1906, being practically carried on as a continuous series at Alibag.\n\nThe appliances and powers of the observatories at Colaba and Alibag are directed first to the prosecution of enquiries into the sciences of terrestrial magnetism, meteorology and seismology; secondly to the publication of recorded facts and observations, their reduction and discussion, and to the distribution of such publications amongst the learned societies and men of science in all parts of the world; and thirdly to astronomical observations for the purposes of time keeping, and to the signalling of time for the purposes of navigation. For these purposes, the observatories are equipped with various magnetical, meteorological and seismological instruments installed in separate\nbuildings, specially constructed for their accommodation.\n\nThe main observatory buildings at Colaba are located on the top of a small mound sloping somewhat abruptly on its eastern side. The centre of the main building is occupied by a tower, surmounted by a wooden dome on which are mounted the anemometers and the receiver of the Callendar's sunshine recorder, at a height of 50 feet from the ground. On the second and first floors of this tower the recording parts of the Robinson Beckley's anemometer, of the Dines' pressure tube anemometer and of the Callendar's sunshine recorder have been installed. In the astronomical observatory the two transit instruments and two sidereal clocks are mounted on isolated stone pillars, while a small room to the north contains the collimator meridian marks similarly mounted. There are also a chronograph, two mean time clocks and an electrical clock for controlling the harbour clock by electrical currents, with galvanometers in circuit for noting the regular working of the connections and for receiving at the observatory return signals of the exact instant of the dropping of the time-balls both at the Prince's Dock and at the Castle. The Government store of chronometers for the Royal Navy and Royal Indian Marine is also kept here.\n\nA large room to the west of the astronomical observatory is used as a computing room, the western end of the room being partitioned off and fitted up as a photographic operating room. The buildings for the accommodation of other magnetical, meteorological, and seismological instruments lie to the north of this main building. These consist of: (1) the underground room containing the horizontal force magnetograph, the declination magnetograph, the vertical force magnetographs Nos. 1 and 2, the barograph, the Richard thermograph, Riefler's sidereal clock, barometer No. 48 and a seismograph for recording vertical movements; (2) the magnetometer office and the electrometer tower, the first of which contains the horizontal force magnetometer, the declination magnetometer, the declination transit instrument and Newman's standard barometer No. 58; (3)\nthree small rooms for the accommodation of (a) the Milne's seismograph (with 3 thermometers), (b) the Colaba seismographs Nos. 1 and 2, and a sensitive level, and (c) seismograph the Omori-Ewing; (4) the thermograph (louvre) shed containing the photographic dry and wet bulb standard thermometers and the recording apparatus, two standard thermometers for eye-observations and for standardising the thermograph curves, and the photographically registering pluviograph apparatus, the receiving funnel of which is freely exposed on the top of the shed; (5) an open space to the west of the thermograph shed containing the Newman's and Symons' rain gauges and two surface ground thermometers; (6) an old thermometer shed containing the 5 ground thermometers and a cage for the maximum and minimum (air and wet) thermometers; and (7) the library room (originally used as a lecture room and subsequently as the meteorological office) to the south of which in an open space are placed the solar and the nocturnal radiation thermometers. To the north and completely separated from these are the quarters of the assistants and the observer. The Director's bungalow is connected with the main building known as the astronomical observatory.\n\nThe routine operations of the observatory thus consist in maintaining in continuous action the autographic instruments (magnetical, meteorological and seismological); in taking eye observations five times a day of these instruments; in reducing the data thus secured and in putting them into the proper form for publication and investigations; in supplying weather and other reports to several offices and men of science, and in supplying the requisite information on magnetical, meteorological, seismological and other allied questions to Government officers and others. In the astronomical department the observations of the stars or the sun are made with sufficient frequency for the correct rating of Government chronometers of the Royal Indian Marine and the Royal Navy, and for directing the falls of the time signal balls on the towers at the Castle and Prince's Dock. Since 1909 magnetic observation has been wholly carried out at the branch observatory in Alibag.\nThe following is a complete list of the instruments in the observatory and shows the dates on which the records obtained from each of them were commenced:\n\n| No. | Name of Instrument                                      | Year in which first used | Remarks                                                                 |\n|-----|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|     | **Meteorological**                                     |                          |                                                                         |\n| 1   | Barograph and Thermometer                              | 1871                     | Photographic Register, Hourly tabulation.                               |\n| 2   | Photographic Air Thermometer                           | 1871                     | Do. do.                                                                  |\n| 3   | Photographic Wet-bulb Thermometer                      | 1871                     | Do. do.                                                                  |\n| 4   | Pluviograph                                            | 1875                     | Do. do.                                                                  |\n| 5   | Robinson Beckley's Anemograph                           | 1867                     | Velocity and Direction, writes mechanically Hourly tabulations.         |\n| 6   | Robinson Beckley's Anemograph                           | 1906                     | Do. do.                                                                  |\n| 7   | Dines' Pressure Tube Anemometer                         | 1897                     | Velocity, single gusts, writes mechanically Hourly tabulations.         |\n| 8   | Richard Frere's Barograph                              | 1897                     | Writes mechanically.                                                    |\n| 9   | Richard Frere's Thermograph and a Thermometer           | 1903                     | Writes mechanically (in the Magnetograph room).                         |\n| 10  | Callendar's Sunshine Recorder                           | 1906                     | Writes mechanically.                                                    |\n| 11  | Barometer No. 58 and Attached Thermometer               | 1842                     | Eye observations 5 times a day since 1873;

(afterwards Justices) Badruddin Tyabji and Kashi-nath T. Telang and Mr. (now Sir) Pherozesha M. Mehta, on the ruins of the Bombay Association which had been founded in 1851, and of the Bombay Branch of the East India Association, founded by Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji in London in 1867. A large number of native gentlemen joined the new association, among the more prominent being Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy (3rd Baronet), Sir Dinsha Petit (1st Baronet), Mr. J. N. Tata, Sir Mangaldas Nathubhai, Messrs. Varjivandas and Narottam Madhavdas, Raghunath N.\nKhote and Nakhoda Mahomed Ali Rogay. During the twenty-three years of its existence the Association has made numerous representations to the governing authorities on local, provincial and imperial matters; it has also on important occasions called public meetings, as for example one in the Town Hall for the purpose of raising a memorial to the late Professor Henry Fawcett, and another in its own rooms to elect Mr. (now Sir) N.G. Chandavarkar as a delegate to London on the occasion of the general elections of 1885 to submit Indian public opinion to the British electors. In 1897 the Association was invited by the Government of India to select a representative to give evidence before the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure; and it has also been privileged to select, in its turn, a Director for the London Imperial Institute. The Association has a council of management with three honorary secretaries and is presided over by a chairman. It possesses an important library. On more than one occasion the Association has had the honour of receiving in its room distinguished members of the British Parliament, among them being Lord Reay, Lord Rosebery and the Right Honourable Mr Bryce.\n\nBombay Races.\u2014The earliest reference to horse racing in Bombay is contained in the following extract from the *Bombay Courier* of the 25th November, 1797:\n\n\"A plan having been set on foot for establishing races at this Presidency, which has hitherto met with very general encouragement, this is to give notice that in the course of next month a race will be run for a purse of 50 pounds. After the race there will be breakfast for the ladies and gentlemen at the race stand and a ball and supper in the evening.\" By the 21st December 1797, sufficient funds had been subscribed by \"the gentlemen of the settlement\" to allow of two plates being run, the first for colts not above 5 years old and the second for aged horse, and the 10th January was fixed as the first day of the two days' meeting. Instructions were issued to the public that the first heat would be run at 7 a.m., and that breakfast would be served in tents \"on the high ground opposite Colonel Jones' house.\" The meeting proved\n\n---\n\n*Bombay Courier*, December 28th, 1797.\nhighly successful, among those who played a prominent part being one Captain Hall of the Sullivan, \"who, as a friend to the Turf, saluted the last day's race with fifteen guns.\"\u00b9 The ground upon which these races were run was with the sanction of the Bombay Government purchased by the stewards and managers and the balance of the funds subscribed for the first races mentioned above was devoted to improving the course.\u00b2 By 1800 the Bombay Turf Club had been established, and in that year presented a prize of one hundred gold mohurs, to be added to a sweepstake of Rs. 100 apiece, with a view to encourage the breeding of horses by gentlemen in Bombay and its dependencies.\n\nIn 1839 the races had expanded into a five days' meeting held at what is now the Byculla Club, and organised by \"the friends of the turf\" who arranged to have a dinner and a selling lottery in the club on the evening of the opening day. According to Mrs. Postans the races took place annually in January and were well patronised. The course was kept in good order, and the leading jockey, 'the Chiffney of Western India,' was a Muhammadan called Safruddin, who \"might, when attired in his racing-gear, be mistaken for an English Jockey.\"\n\nAbout 1880 the race-course was moved to the present site at Mahalakshmi, which is now held on lease from the City Improvement Trust. Of recent years racing has become very popular with all classes, the chief supporters being native and Arab gentlemen, some of whom own valuable racing studs. During the cold weather five or six hundred horses may be seen training on the course. Bombay is the head-quarters of Arab racing; and of late years many Australian and English race-horses have been imported. The Bombay Races take place every February; but extra meetings are held every Saturday and sometimes on Wednesday and holidays during the cold weather. During the cold weather of 1909 nearly 2\u00bd lakhs were given away as prize money.\n\n\u00b9 Bombay Courier, 13th January 1798.\n\u00b2 The land is described in the Collector's Records as \"Salt Batty.\" The Collector's order transferring the land to the stewards is dated 23rd January 1798.\nBombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals:\u2014In December 1874 the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was founded by Mr. Cleveland, General Ballard, the Rev. Dr. Wilson, Mr. (now Sir) William Lee-Warner and other residents of Bombay, with a view to check the improper treatment of animals in the Bombay Presidency. The Honourable Mr. Justice Bayley was first president of the Society. The Society employ paid officials to warn the public and to institute prosecutions whenever necessary. More than 14,000 animals were taken before the magistrates during 1908-09 and a large number are annually sent for treatment to the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals, which was opened in 1884 and is connected with the present Bombay Veterinary College by an agreement between Government and the Trustees of the Hospital. The Society has branches at Karachi and Ahmadabad.\n\nByculla Club.\u2014The movement to found the Byculla Club probably arose from the existence of the Sans Souci Club, founded in 1785 by Mr. Torrie, Senior Member of Council, and of the Highland Society which came into existence on May 2nd, 1821, under the presidency of the Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay. Neither of these clubs possessed property or permanent premises. In 1832 a preliminary meeting for the foundation of a permanent club and premises was held; and after considerable difficulty and delay had been experienced in obtaining a site and building, a committee of management reported that the Grove at Mazagon, situated near the present Mazagon post office was suitable and could be rented for the purposes of the club for Rs. 225 per month. This proposal apparently failed to find favour, for in June 1833 the club, which had hitherto styled itself the Bombay Club, had established itself in the Byculla Assembly Room under the title of the Byculla Club. The Byculla Assembly Room had been open since the 1st January 1823, and formed part of the race-stand attached to the old race-\n\n---\n\n1 Subsequently the Society's jurisdiction was limited to Bombay Island. Act XI of 1890 for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was introduced into Bombay by Government Notification of 31st August 1891.\ncourse, which was then known as the Byculla Turf. The original assembly-room is now the Club reading-room; a second public room was added to it shortly after the foundation of the Club in 1833, and further additions were made in 1841. In 1845 the billiard-room, hall and entrance were completed, and the accommodation of the Club was further enlarged in 1855 and 1864. The kiosk was erected at a cost of Rs. 1,000 in 1869, and a racquet court was built in 1874. Among the most noteworthy features of the Club in the present day are its gardens, which contain several rare plants and exotics. One of the earliest notices of the Byculla Club appears in the Bombay Courier of the 11th January 1839, to the effect that the Club entertained Chevalier Ventura, General of the army of Ranjit Singh, while the most recent notable function was the entertainment of Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales at a ball on the 13th November 1905.\n\nChurches.\u2014Prior to 1675, the English in Bombay possessed no church of any kind, and for more than forty years after that date the only place for divine worship was a room situated in the Castle and called the Fort Chapel. Sir George Oxinden interested himself in the question of providing a proper church; in 1672\n\n---\n\n1 The crest of the Club represents the Byculla Turf pavilion of 1814 and is reproduced from a picture on the wall of Bobbery Hall given as an illustration to the satire Qui Hi published in 1816. For early history of the Byculla Club see Times of India, February 17th, 1894. In 1812 Bombay had a Bachelors' Club.\n\n2 An illustration in Colonel Davidson's Memoirs of a Long Life, now framed and hung in the Club, shows the east front of the Assembly Rooms as it appeared in 1834. It will be noted that while the pillars on the ground-floor of the Assembly Room closely resemble the verandah pillars under the Club race-stand, in the verandah outside the Secretary's office double pillars in the style of the main porch have been substituted for the single pillars of the sketch. The upper storey has also been shaded by a verandah, and the tops of the windows have been altered from round Roman or Portuguese to flat Grecian. These changes were probably completed in the year 1845.\n\n3 Fryer's New Account of East India and Persia:\u2014\u201cThe English have neither church nor hospital, both of which are mightily desired.\u201d\n\n4 Maclean's Guide to Bombay. Cobbe (Account of the Bombay Church) describes the chapel as \u201ctwo upper rooms, beat into one.\u201d\n\n5 Hamilton in his New Account of the East Indies, I. 187-188, writes:\u2014\u201cNotwithstanding the Company was at so much charge in building forts, they had no thoughts of building a church. Sir\nand again in 1674 Aungier wrote to the Court of Directors desiring \"by God's assistance to erect a small church for public worship in the centre of the town;\" and in 1674 a regular scheme for building a garrison-church was projected. The Council at Surat favoured the proposal, declaring that such an edifice was much needed, not only for the use of the English, but also that \"natives and foreigners might be so impressed with feelings of reverence for our wholly reformed religion that happily they might wish to embrace it.\" The plan of a building was submitted by the President at Surat for the Court's approval in 1676, it being designed to seat a thousand people, and \"to be of a form proportionable to our usual churches in England, but plain and free from superfluous ornament.\" The expense, which was to be defrayed by voluntary contributions, was largely borne by the Company's servants, who \"came forward freely and conscientiously, some offering one year's wages, some half a year's, and the least a quarter.\" It was hoped that the Company itself would make good the balance.\n\nThe collections amounted to Rs. 50,000, and an organ was provided, the funds being entrusted to the Chaplains of Bombay and Surat for the provision of building materials, pending the receipt of formal sanction from the Court of Directors. After much discussion, the present site (at the corner of Elphinstone Circle, then the Bombay Green) was chosen; the building\n\nGeorge Oxenden began to build a church, and charitable collections were gathered for that use. But when Sir George died (1669), piety grew sick and the building of churches was grown unfashionable. Indeed, it was a long while before the island had people enough to fill a chapel, that was in the Fort; for as fast as recruits came from Britain, they died in Bombay, which got the island a bad name.\"\n\n1 Letter from President Aungier and the Bombay Council to the Court, dated June 14, 1672; and President Aungier's Report, 1673-74.\n\n2 Letter from Surat Council to Bombay, January 11th, 1676. Bombay Town and Island Materials. Part III, 580. A general form of prayer was introduced in 1698.\n\n3 In their letter of 17th January, 1676, the Surat Council wrote to the Court:\u2014\"The place is not yet fully resolved on. Some propose the church should be erected on Mendham's Point, which is our usual burying-ground, and that was proper enough as to ourselves. But it will not answer our main designs of inviting the natives to repair thereto and observe the gravity and purity\nwas commenced; and at the date of Sir John Child's governorship (1681-1690), the walls had been raised to a height of fifteen feet. Then for some reason the work suddenly languished; the funds mysteriously disappeared; and the bare walls remained till a generation later a gathering-place for animals\u2014an object of derision to the natives and a reproach to the English in Bombay.\n\nBut the scandal was removed on the arrival in Bombay on the 21st September, 1714, of the Reverend Richard Cobbe, Chaplain to the East India Company. On June 19th, 1715, being the first Sunday after Trinity, he\n\nof our devotions. For that place is quite out of the way of concourse, and will seem wholly appropriated to the English. Wherefore others think it may be as convenient to build the church near the present town or between it, and the place designed for the English and Europeans to inhabit in, and to be adjoining to the high road leading to the great street or bazar of the present town, to the end that being open and free to all to enter without scruple, some may be persuaded at first out of curiosity to visit it and see our way of devotion therein, etc.\"\u2014Bombay Town and Island Materials, Part III, 580.\n\n1 Hamilton (New Account of East Indies. I. 18-188) writes:\u2014\n\n\"There were reckoned above \u00a35,000 had been gathered towards building the church, but Sir John Child, when he came to reign in Bombay, converted the money to his own use, and never more was heard of it. The walls were built by his predecessor to five yards high, and so it continued till the year 1715. Then Mr. Boone came to the chair, who set about building it, and in five years' time finished it by his own benevolence and other gentlemen who by his persuasions were brought in to contribute. The Company also contributed something towards that pious end.\" Hamilton's accusation of embezzlement against Sir John Child was never refuted and was never definitely corroborated. Cobbe in his Account of the Church remarks that \"the late wars or collusion or fraud of all or any of the Trustees\" had prevented the further progress of the work. He described the walls as half-finished and ruinous. In his book (printed 1766) appears a letter to him from George Bourchier to the following effect:\u2014\"I wish you better success than your predecessor who built little, raised and destroyed abundance of money to no purpose; he had furnished a stately organ, which I saw in the Fort. What is become of it God knows.\" This organ was \"broken and useless\" in Cobbe's time. It is possible that the improvement of the Fort Chapel by Sir John Wybourne may have obviated the immediate need for a church and induced lack of care in the control of the funds. A Bombay general letter to the Company, dated 20th December 1686, runs as follows:\u2014\"The new Deputy-Governor, Sir John Wybourne, has made the house in the Fort much more commodious than ever it was, having fitted up a very convenient chapel out of two rooms situated in the middle of the house, where there is room enough for four times the number of people that we have on this Island.\"\u2014Bombay Town and Island Materials, Part III, 581.\npreached a great sermon, exhorting the English community to \"wipe away the reproach of being godless in the sight of the heathens,\" and to complete the ruinous edifice. The appeal fell not upon deaf ears. Money and benefactions were readily offered; the foundation-stone of a new edifice was laid by the Deputy-Governor, Mr. Stephen Strutt, on the 18th November, 1715, and on Christmas Day, 1718, the Church was formally opened by order of the Governor, Charles Boone. When first completed, it was described as \"suitable in some measure to the dignity of our Royal Settlement, and big enough for a\n\n---\n\n1 The text of the sermon was 2 Samuel, vii. 2:\u2014\"See now I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains.\"\n\n2 Cobbe (Account of the Church) writes:\u2014\"After Sermon in the morning I waited on the Governor, the Honourable William Aistabie, according to custom, at his lodgings in the Fort, before dinner, who was pleased to address me very friendly in these words:\u2014'Well, Doctor, you have been very zealous for the church this morning.' 'Please, your Honour, I think there was occasion enough for it, and I hope without offence!' 'Well then, if we must have a church, we will have a church! Do you see and get a book made, and see what everyone will contribute towards it, and I will do first.' This was accordingly done, leaving a blank for the Company's subscription, which was afterwards filled up with ten thousand rupees.\"\n\nAmong those who contributed were \"John Barnes (alias a shipwreck man), Rs. 40, Isaac King alias Pereira (a converted Jew), Rs. 6, a fine upon Bundarees at Worlee, Rs. 18, and a fine inflicted upon Joseph Hornall for a misdemeanor, given by the Governor's order; Cornelius Sodington (for my wife when I have one), Rs. 20; Cumsha (a Chinaman), Rs. 150, and Chunqua (a Chinaman), Rs. 90.\"\u2014Cobbe's Account.\n\nCobbe also wrote for subscriptions to the Council at Madras, who demurred on the grounds that \"the structure was three times larger than was necessary, and the fabric appeared to be rather magnificent than useful.\" Cobbe replied:\u2014\"I am sorry to find your Christian zeal, so much spoken of in these foreign parts, so degenerate and confined as not to extend itself beyond the bounds of your own territories, but upon conditions.\"\n\n3 Cobbe, writing to the Chief of Calicut and Tellicherry on the 10th January 1719 (Account of the Church), thus describes the opening:\u2014\"On Christmas Day 1718, the Governor and Council, attended by the free merchants, military and other inhabitants of the place, proceeding from the Fort in great order to the Church, and approaching the great door at the west end, were met by the Chaplain in his proper habit, and introduced repeating the 24th Psalm (Lift up your heads, O ye gates: even lift them up, ye everlasting doors) with the Gloria Patri. The Church was dressed with palm-branches and plantain-trees, the pillars were adorned with many wreaths of greens, and the double crosses over the arches looked like so many stars in the firmament. Service began as usual on Christmas-Day, but with this additional satisfaction, the making a new Christian the same day in the new\nCathedral,\" and as an illustration of the manners of that age, it may be mentioned that in order to keep the fabric\n\nChurch\u2014a good omen doubtless of a future increase. The Governor, Mrs. Parker and Mrs. Crommelin, who stood gossips, came down to the font in time of Divine Service, where the child was baptized, according to order, by the name of Susanna. A whole crowd of black people stood round about, among them Ramaji and all his caste, who were so well pleased with the decency and regularity of the way of worship, that they stood it out the whole service. When the sermon from Isaiah LVI. 7 was over, the Governor and Council and ladies repaired to the Vestry, where having drunk success to the new Church in a glass of sack, the whole Town returned to the Governor's lodgings within the Fort. Here was a splendid entertainment\u2014wine, music and abundance of good cheer. After dinner the Governor began 'Church and King,' according to custom. In addition, upon this occasion, a compliment of twenty-one great guns was given from the Castle, which were answered by the European ships in the harbour; with several other healths, drinking and firing till almost four o'clock. Lest so good an opportunity should slip, by the Governor's leave, the Chaplain brought in the subscription book, and got above Rs. 2,400 to the Church, of which, for example's sake, the Governor launched out Rs. 1,000 himself.\"\n\n1 Cobbe (Account of the Church) writes:\u2014\"The Church is indeed a structure deservedly admired for its strength and beauty, neatness and uniformity, but more especially for its echo. The roof is arched with three regular arches of stone, supported by two rows of pillars and pilasters on each side, with a large semi-dome at the east end to receive the communion-table, like that of St. Paul's, London, ascending by three steps, and a rail to separate it from the body of the Church. Its situation is very commodious, in the midst of the inhabitants, within the town-wall, and at a due distance from the Castle; as to its extent, it is larger than either of the English Churches at Madras or Bengal, or any of the Portuguese Churches in Bombay.\"\n\nGrose (Voyage to the East Indies) wrote in 1750:\u2014\"The only English Church at Bombay, and which is full sufficient for any possible congregation of them at it, is a building extremely neat, commodious and airy, being situate on what is called the Green.\n\nIves (Voyage from England to India) described it in 1754 as \"a very handsome large edifice, and in comparison of those which are to be met with in the other settlements, it looks like one of our cathedrals.\"\n\nForbes (Oriental Memoirs, I. 152) remarks that\u2014\"The only Protestant Church on the island stood near the centre of the town, a large and commodious building with a neat tower.\"\n\nMrs. Graham (Journal of a Residence in India) speaks of it in 1813 as \"large, but neither well served nor attended.\" Bishop Heber (Journey through India) in 1829, Mrs. Elwood (Narrative of an Overland Journey to India) about 1830, and Mrs. Postans (Western India) in 1838, all refer to the Church in terms of admiration.\n\nJames Douglas (Bombay and Western India, II, 253) quotes an article to show that at the commencement of the nineteenth century the Church was floored with cow-dung and lighted with panes of the pearl oyster-shell instead of glass.\nin repair a duty of one-half per cent. was levied on all goods imported into Bombay.\n\nIn 1814 Bombay became an Archdeaconry of the See of Calcutta, the first Archdeacon being the Rev. G. Barnes, and on the 7th June 1816 the Church, which had previously been occasionally called St. James's, was consecrated by Dr. Middleton, the first Anglican Bishop in India, in the name of St. Thomas the Apostle. A generation later (1835), Bombay was raised to the dignity of a Bishopric, and on the arrival of the first Bishop, Dr. Carr, who was installed on the 21st February 1838, St. Thomas's Church was notified by Government to be the Cathedral Church of the See. To commemorate this event, the old belfry, which Cobbe had raised \"in order for a sea-mark, as high as funds could tower it,\" was replaced by the present tower at a cost of Rs. 16,000; and a clock was purchased by public subscription at a cost of 500 guineas. In 1863 Archdeacon W. K. Fletcher formulated a scheme for rebuilding the Cathedral, and a Committee was formed to carry out the work, which numbered among its mem-\n\n---\n\n1 Maclean's Guide to Bombay, 229. A Parsonage House was bought by Government in 1738 and continued as such till 1801. The site lies about thirty yards south of the south-west corner of the Cathedral. The house was abandoned in 1801 because the clergyman was unable to sleep owing to the proximity of a Cotton Screw.\n\n2 Cobbe's Account of the Church (1766), 57-59. James Douglas (Bombay and Western India, II, 252) says:\u2014\"The original steeple ended in a kind of lantern, as we see in Grose's print. The upper portion of the present clock-tower dates only from about 1838. The bell of St. Thomas's half-way up the steeple was the gift of Governor Boone, and is a most interesting memorial. It was cast in Bombay, and a very fine bell it is. The inscription on it is now almost undecipherable, and cannot be read without a considerable craning of the neck. It runs:\u2014LAUS DEO IN USUM ECCLES. ANGLII, BOMB., AN. DOM 1719. SINE CHARITATE FACTI SUMUS VELUT AES SONANS.\"\n\n3 The Bombay Times of January 23rd, 1839, contains the following note:\u2014\"The new clock intended to be placed in the Cathedral tower has been shipped on board the Thomas Coutts. It is of the most perfect workmanship that Messrs. McCabe & Co. can produce, is made with four copper dial plates and double hands, and is constructed to strike the quarters; while the situation selected for it, the base of the upper tower of the beautiful turreted spire of the Cathedral, now nearly finished, will render it perfectly visible to the shipping in the harbour. The Cathedral is being modernised under the able supervision of the Superintending Engineer.\"\nbers Mr. (now Sir George) Birdwood and Mr. (now Sir L. H.) Bayley, a former Judge of the High Court. The stone of the renovated cathedral was laid by the Governor, Mr. (afterwards Sir Bartle) Frere. Three years later Bombay passed through the ordeal of bankruptcy which followed upon the share mania, and the work of renovation was perforce brought to a close. The only portions of the scheme completed were the chancel, which was fitted up in its present condition during the episcopacy of Bishop Douglas, the fountain at the west entrance for the erection of which Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney subscribed Rs. 7,000, and the organ-chamber in which stands the magnificent instrument built expressly for the Cathedral by Messrs. Bishop and Starr at a cost of Rs. 15,000. On the 14th March 1906, public meeting was held and a committee was appointed to carry out further improvements, estimated at Rs. 52,400, and consisting chiefly in the restoration of the organ, the installation of electric light and fans, and the erection of new choir-stall and a Bishop's throne and pulpit.\n\nThe most interesting portions of the building are the tessellated pavement in the chancel, which was laid down in memory of Archdeacon Fletcher; the three upper clerestory windows erected to the memory of Michael Scott, a merchant, and five lancet windows erected by the Royal Engineers to the officers of that corps. The finest memorials are those erected to the Honourable Jonathan Duncan, Governor of Bombay (1795-1811); to Captain Hardinge, R. N., a younger brother of Lord Hardinge, who fell in the victorious naval engagement off the coast of Ceylon between the British ship San Florenso and the French frigate La Pied Montaise; to Stephen Babington, reviser of the judicial code, whose statue now stands in the Town Hall; and to Bishop Carr, whose effigy in marble, in full episcopal robes, reposes in the southern transept. Other monuments of historical interest are those to Brigadier-General Carnac, who defeated the Shahzada in 1761; to John Watson, Superintendent of Marine, who was killed at the siege of Thana in 1774; to Admiral Maitland, to whom, when in command of\n\n---\n\n1 Maclean's Guide to Bombay, 230.\nH. M. S. *Bellerophon*, Napoleon surrendered; to Colonel Burton Barr, who won the battle of Kirkee; and to Major Eldred Pottinger, the heroic defender of Herat. An attractive specimen of Bacon's sculpture is the medallion in memory of Mrs. Kirkpatrick on the wall.\n\nIn the monument chest are preserved two silver chalices of considerable age. The first, which Mr. Douglas has styled \"the oldest tangible memorial of our existence as an English settlement,\" was presented by Gerald Aungier to the Christian community of Bombay in 1675. It bears the following inscription:\u2014\u201cHunc calicem eucharistae sacrum esse voluit Honorabilis Geraldus Aungierus, insulae Bombaiae Gubernator, ac pro rebus Honorabilis Anglorum Societatis Indies Orientalibus mercatorum agentium praeses.\u201d Of the other chalice no record whatever remains, nor can one hazard a conjecture as to how it came into the possession of the Cathedral. The following words are inscribed upon it:\u2014\"The gift of the Greenland merchants of the City of York, 1632.\u201d\n\nThe representatives of several Bombay families are buried in the enclosure of the Cathedral, which was not regularly used till after the abandonment of Mendham\u2019s burying-ground in 1760; but the opening of the Sonapur cemetery in 1763 obviated the necessity for any general use of the Cathedral yard for this purpose. Among those whose remains are buried inside the Cathedral one may mention the Reverend N. Wade; the wife of Sir Richard Bouchier, who was Governor of Bombay from 1750 to 1760, the Honorable Jonathan Duncan, Lady West, wife of a former Chief Justice, Sir W. Syers, the first Recorder of Bombay, Sir Robert Oliver, the first Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy, Sir C. H. Chambers, Sir James Dewar, and Sir David Pollock, Judges of the High Court, Admiral Inglefield, and General Kinnersly.\n\nAmong the other better known Churches of Bombay is St. Andrew\u2019s Church, sometimes called the Scotch Kirk, which stands at the corner of Apollo street. In 1813 the East India Company resolved to appoint a minister of the Church of Scotland at each of the\n\n---\n\n1 See Bombay and Western India by J. Douglas, II, 252.\nPresidency towns in India and directed that suitable places of worship should be erected. Two years later Mr. Clow, the first Church of Scotland Chaplain in Bombay, reached India, and in 1816 the foundations of St. Andrew's Church were laid between what was then the Court House and the Ramparts. In April 1819, the Church was opened for public worship, and in 1823 the spire was added. The organ, which was one of the first organs used in the worship of the Reformed Church of Scotland, was given by the congregation in 1867 at a cost of Rs. 4,800. The Church has recently been greatly improved by the introduction of electric light and fans and the provision of a new roof.\n\nHoly Trinity Church on the Esplanade, which was opened for worship in 1890, belongs to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which commenced work in Bombay in 1836, and built a chapel and schoolhouse at Sonapur in the years 1840 and 1842 respectively. In 1883 the chapel and the school, which was then known as the Indo-British Institution, were moved to a plot adjoining the School of Art and here in 1887 the foundation-stone of the church was laid. The Church of St. John the Evangelist at Colaba was built in 1857 in memory of the officers, non-commissioned officers and private soldiers who fell by sickness or by the sword in the campaigns of Sind and Afghanistan, A.D. 1838-43. The names of the officers are inscribed on tablets in the chancel. Special memorials of officers who died during the last Afghan war were erected in 1882. The wall behind the altar has been decorated with mosaic tiles by the 19th Regiment, N.I., in memory of three of their officers; a reredos has been erected by the friends of twelve officers of various corps; the altar was given in memory of two officers; and the marble pavement in memory of those who were brethren of the Guild of the\n\n---\n\n1 The present spire was erected in 1827 in place of the original spire which was destroyed by lightning in 1826. When Mr. Clow landed (1815) he had to hold service at first in the Mess-room of the Town Barracks and afterwards in a room in the old High Court. The Bombay Tract Society was founded in the vestry of St. Andrew's Church in 1827.\n\n2 The site of the original Trinity Chapel is now occupied by a market (K. N. Kabraji's Reminiscences, 1901).\nHoly Standard. The general memorial of all the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Bombay Army was erected over the principal entrance in 1883. The colours of the old 24th Regiment, N.I., are preserved in the building. Other churches are St. Nicholas' church, opposite the dock gates in Frere road, which is chiefly intended for the use of sailors; the Wesleyan Methodist church on Colaba Causeway, the foundation stone of which was laid by Lord Reay; All Saints' church on Malabar Hill built in 1882; the Bombay Baptist church in Bellasis road; the United Free Church of Scotland in Waudby road, opened in 1896; the Bowen Memorial church on Apollo Bandar; St. Mary's church at Parel, built in 1883; Christ church on Parel road, of which the history is closely connected with that of the Education Society's schools, near which it stands; St. Peter's church in Mazagon opened in 1859, which contains a memorial window to those who were drowned in the P. & O.S.S. Carnatic; Girgaum Mission church, opened in 1869; St. Paul's church, Kamathipura, opened in 1871; and the Baptist church opened in 1874. The present site of St. Peter's church has been acquired by the Port Trust in connection with their new railway to Sion; but a new building will be erected in the immediate neighbourhood.\n\nAt the date of the cession of Bombay to the English, the chief Roman Catholic churches on the Island were those of N. S. de Esperan\u00e7a, N. S. da Salva\u00e7\u00e3o, N. S. de Gloria, San Miguel, and the chapel of N. S. de Bom Conselho. The church of N. S. de Esperan\u00e7a originally stood on the Esplanade, the only sign of its former existence now remaining being the cross which stands on the open ground near the Native Infantry lines. In 1760 it was removed in connection with the defences of Bombay, and another was erected in its place at the cost of Government in Kalbadevi. This is a Propaganda church under the Archdiocese of Bombay, and is now a cathedral. This was probably the church to which Fontanier referred\n\n---\n\n1 For further details see Bombay Times of 30th January 1858 and Maclean's Guide to Bombay. Amongst the donors was Sir Cowasji Jehangir.\n\n2 Govind Narayan's Description of Bombay\nin 1844 in the words:\u2014\u201cLa grande \u00e9glise catholique de Bombay est peut-\u00eatre la plus belle construction de l'\u00eele, apr\u00e8s la maison de ville : elle est dans la ville noire et est dirig\u00e9e par un cur\u00e9 ; ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et ses revenus sont consid\u00e9rables.\u201d The other churches mentioned above are still in existence, having been improved and rebuilt from time to time. N. S. de Gloria is supposed to have been endowed and built by Antonio Pessoa, Lord of the Manor of Mazagon (1548-71). It was rebuilt and renewed in 1810. It is a spacious church capable of accommodating 2,000 people. It is the cathedral of the Bishop of Damaun. The other Padroado churches (under the Bishop of Daman) are the church of Cavel (N. S. de Saude, or Our Lady of Health) built in 1794; the church of Dabul (St. Francis Xavier's national church\u00b9) erected in 1872; N. S. de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o built in 1596 and repaired in 1858; and the San Miguel church of Upper Mahim, built probably in 1540. Santa Cruz de Parel (the church of the Holy Cross) was originally an affiliated chapel built in 1883. It was raised to the dignity of a church in 1904. The chapel of N. S. de Bom Conselho is now affiliated to San Miguel.\n\nThe Propaganda churches under the Archdiocese of Bombay are the cathedral church of N. S. de Esperan\u00e7a at Kalbadevi; St. Anne's church in Nesbit road, Mazagon; N. S. de Rozario, Mazagon; the church of the Holy Name, Fort; and the chapels of Mount Carmel, St. Joseph, St. Teresa and St. Anne. The chapel of Mount Carmel, was erected in 1721. Since 1905 it has been closed. The church, which stands on Wodehouse road, was designed by Mr. W. A. Chambers and was opened for worship in January 1905. The fa\u00e7ade of the building is surmounted by two lofty towers, and is flanked on either side by the residence of the Roman Catholic Bishop and the Convent school. The church bears the title of \u201cthe Church of the Holy Name\u201d and serves as a parish church for Roman Catholic residents in the Fort. The old church in Bhuleshwar, referred to above, is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Bombay.\n\n\u00b9 It is known as the National Church, as being the most popular church among the Goans.\nCotton Green:\u2014The original Cotton Green of Bombay was known as the Bombay Green and occupied the area between the old Secretariat on the south, the entrance to Bazaar Gate street on the north, the Town Hall on the east and the Cathedral and Church Gate street on the west. It was a spacious area, described by Grose in 1750 as \"pleasantly laid out in walks and planted with trees round which are mostly the houses of the English inhabitants.\" In 1813 a writer spoke of it as \"covered with bales of cotton and other merchandize entirely unprotected,\" furnished with cotton screws, and surrounded by trees of which the most noteworthy was a tamarind, beneath which it was customary to hold public auctions. Up to 1823, the mercantile community was allowed to stack cotton on the Green. Around the Green were various public offices, and on an enclosed portion stood the statue of the Marquis Cornwallis, protected by masonry arches, and surrounded by a railing where palanquins waited for hire. The neighbourhood of the statue was described in 1842 as somewhat of an eyesore, being strewn with coconut shells, old shoes and rags; and on this account possibly the question of converting the Green into a garden was brought forward. Two years later (1844) the Agricultural Horticultural Society of Western India was reported to the contemporary press to have commenced making a flower garden on the Green, the stony parts next to the Town Hall being converted into \"rock-works, mounds, tanks and canals.\" No definite alteration of the Green however took place until 1863, when Mr. Forjett, the Police Commissioner, conceived the idea of converting\n\n---\n\n1 Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I.

This tree was cut down in November, 1846 (Bombay Courier, 13th November 1846).\n4 Mrs. Postans' Western India in 1838, Vol. I., p. 25.\n5 Times of India of 4th June 1842 and October 26th, 1842.\n6 Ibid., June 5th, 1844 and October 23rd, 1844.\nthe portion in front of the Town Hall into a Circle. Lord Elphinstone and Sir Bartle Frere in turn warmly supported the scheme. The Municipality bought up the whole site and re-sold it at a considerable profit in building lots under certain building conditions to English mercantile firms, and by 1865 the Elphinstone Circle was practically completed and ready for occupation.\u00b9 The Elphinstone Circle garden was completed about the date of the visit of H. R. H. the Duke of Edinburgh in 1872. In the centre of the garden is an ornamental fountain, and to the east of it are the statues of the Marquis Cornwallis and the Marquis Wellesley.\u00b2\n\nThe present Cotton Green is situated at Colaba, and was first set apart for the purpose about the year 1844. It occupies an area on either side of the Colaba Causeway of about 1\u00bd miles square, each native dealer renting a plot proportioned to the extent of his business, which is known as his jatha. The Cotton Exchange is the general meeting-place between buyer and seller, business beginning soon after mid-day. The European merchant, through his dalal or broker, arranges the prices and terms of purchase, after which he proceeds to the jatha where the bulk of the cotton lies in the packages as received, from up-country, and selects it bale by bale, stamping with a private mark whatever reaches the standard bought and rejecting anything inferior. The cotton is then weighed and sent to the presses in the neighbourhood, where the loose country packages are opened out and the contents then packed by powerful pressure into bales of about 10 cubic feet containing 3\u00bd cwt. net of cotton. Of late years, a large proportion of the crop has been bought and pressed ready for shipment by European agency up-country.\n\n\u00b9 Times of India, 2nd January 1865; Annual Administration Report, Bombay Presidency, for 1862-63. The land sold by the Municipality fetched 14 lakhs, while the amount paid to Government as owners of the Green and to the proprietors of the extra space required was only 8 lakhs. James Scott, Chief Engineer to the Elphinstone Land Reclamation Company, designed the Elphinstone Circle frontages.

The cotton season opens at the Diwali in the month of November, when the dealers bring out to their jathas the balance of the previous crop which has been stored throughout the monsoon; and from that date until the monsoon again breaks in the following June, the place forms a striking picture of busy life, rendered peculiarly attractive by the singular and varied costumes of the people. The busiest time of the year falls in March, April and May.\n\nIt is now under contemplation to remove the Cotton Green from Colaba to Mazagon in connection with the new Port Trust harbour works on the east of the island and the new Harbour Branch railway.\n\nCustoms House:\u2014From 1665 to 1714 the English Customs House was situated at Mody Bay, to the east of the Town Barracks near the Fort market. It formed a part of what was known as the India House, regarding which and their other properties, the Court of Directors remarked in July 1684:\u2014\"We understand we have great warehouses as also an hospital, a large house called the East India House, as also the cheutry (chhatri) or bandar and great stables. Of all of these little use is made, and no profit at all to the Company. On the contrary the Sidi when he is there with the Mughal fleet makes use of them to live in and to secure and fit his rigging. This will make but a mean account for the great expenses the Company have been at in erecting such chargeable edifices. We therefore would desire you to spend some serious thoughts and to invent some means whereby these buildings may be employed to make us some better return for our great cost.\"\n\nFive years after this complaint, the Sidi turned the building to worse uses than a rope walk, for according to Hamilton, he placed \"four great guns in the Customs House, commonly called the India House.\" Though the Customs House was at Mody Bay, the chief bandar or landing place, on which stood the great chhatri or pavilion alluded to above, was at the present (1909) Town Customs bandar; and on this account probably\n\n---\n\n1 Maclean's Guide to Bombay (1900), pp. 201, 202.\n2 Bombay Gazetteer Materials, III, 589.\nGovernor Aislalie was induced in 1710 to build new warehouses at the Bandar head.\n\nThe warehouses built in 1710 formed the nucleus of the present (1909) Customs House which bears on a slab over the porch the East India Company's arms and below them a much defaced inscription \"The Honourable Aislalie, Esq., 1714.\" As the masonry seems throughout to be of the same age and style, there is little room for doubt that the whole fa\u00e7ade of the building was completed in that year. The inner flat-roofed row of buildings parallel to the street front and between that front and the bandar basin originally ran in an unbroken line, and up to the year 1758 comprised three storeys instead of two. The precise date of their construction cannot be traced, but in all probability they are older than the street-front, and they were certainly used originally as warehouses. In 1728 the bandar pier was rebuilt, and in 1755 Captain DeFunck, the Company's Engineer, proposed to throw a fortified line in front of the warehouses, which at that date were defended only by a small battery on the bandar pier. Two years later (1757-58) the warehouses were altered in order to provide living accommodation for the Company's covenanted servants, who had hitherto resided within the Castle. The alterations took the form of two buildings at each end of the Bandar which to-day (1909) form the wings of the Customs House. It was in the inner flat-roofed block of warehouses that Forbes, the author of Oriental Memoirs, lived when a young writer in the Company's service and described how, unable to afford either supper or a light, he spent the evenings reading by moonlight a small-type Shakespeare on the flat roofs. In 1788, when Rama Kamati's building in Bazaar Gate street had become very ruinous, Government offered to the Mayor's Court a room and offices in the front row of warehouses; but the members of the Honourable Court rejected the offer with scorn on the grounds that the situation was inconvenient, and\n\n---\n\n1 A statement has been made that the Customs House front was originally a Portuguese barrack. There is no evidence to support this statement, and in all likelihood the Portuguese had no barracks outside the castle.\n\n2 Oriental Memoirs, I, 166. This was in 1770.\nthat it would be highly derogatory to their dignity to sit there.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1802 the front row of warehouses was turned into the Customs House, and continued to be utilized unaltered until 1840, when a considerable number of complaints were made regarding the inadequacy of the building for the transaction of commercial business. Trade had increased so greatly since 1814 that both the wharf and the bandar were the scene of continuous confusion; and the goods of individual merchants were continually being mislaid or altogether lost. In response to these complaints and a strongly-worded memorial from the Chamber of Commerce, some amelioration of these conditions was effected. But the Customs House, as it appears to-day (1909), is the result of extensive alterations carried out in 1895, which consisted of the addition of the top storey, the facing of the walls to represent stone blocks and the erection of the porch,\\(^2\\) which has since been surrounded by grass plots and beds of plants. Electric lights and fans were installed in the building in 1908. A tablet has been placed near the front gate commemorative of Sir Charles Pritchard's work in connection with the Customs and Salt duties.\n\nDadar Distillery:\\(^3\\)\u2014The Dadar distillery was opened on the 1st January 1879. Previous to that date, distillers were permitted to set up stills in their own houses and in the plantations, so that it was exceedingly difficult to control the manufacture of toddy spirit or regulate the duty chargeable upon it.\\(^4\\) The distillery is situated about 7 miles from the Fort and about 50 yards distant from the Dadar station of the B. B. & C. I. Railway, and lies on the border of the cocoa-nut plantations which stretch from Varli to Mahim. It is enclosed by a masonry wall 10 feet high, and inside are a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For further details, see Bombay Gazetteer Materials, III, 580-592.\n\n\\(^2\\) Times of India, June 13th, 1895.\n\n\\(^3\\) In connection with special enquiries made between 1726 and 1736 among a scheme for the purchase of Bombay by the Portuguese Government, it was reported that two distilleries existed at Mahim and Bombay \"where the juice or sura of brab and coco-palms was made into country-spirit yielding an estimated revenue of Rs. 2,000, representing a sale-value of Rs. 20,000.\"\nwell and a small tank from which water for distillery purposes is obtained. The liquid toddy refuse is eventually emptied into the sea. The distillery is in charge of a chief inspector, assisted by one inspector and three sub-inspectors of the Excise Department, and is guarded by Abkari peons. It is open from 6-30 A.M. to 7-30 P.M. The general duty of the chief inspector consists in seeing that distillers conform to their license conditions and observe all rules. The gauging inspector brands all casks used for the removal of liquor, tests all the liquor passed out, and is responsible for seeing that the liquor passed out agrees in quantity and strength with the entries in the permits.\n\nThe duty is levied at the rate of Rs. 3-5-6 per gallon of 25\u00b0 U. P. and Rs. 1-10-9 per gallon of 60\u00b0 U. P. In addition to the duty, an establishment contribution of Rs. 0-1-6 per gallon, irrespective of strength, has been levied since the 1st August 1888. There are (1910) about 17 licensed distillers, most of them being Bhandaris; and the liquor manufactured by them amounts to about 32,000 gallons of 25\u00b0 U. P. and 62,000 gallons of 60\u00b0 U. P. per annum. The revenue realized from the duty amounts to about Rs. 1,75,000 a year.\n\nToddy is brought from the oarts and plantations by the tappers in earthen pots holding about 4\u00bd gallons. Each pot is marked with the distiller's license number and with its capacity in gallons and pints. As the pots enter the distillery, the quantity they contain is noted under the distiller's number; and the total quantity introduced is posted up daily in the account books of the distillery. Toddy is usually brought in between 6-30 A.M. and 12-30 noon and between 4-30 P.M. and 7-30 P.M. There is one kind of still in use at Dadar\u2014the hath bhatti. It comprises a copper boiler, a hollow trunk of the cocoanut tree or betel-tree, bound with coir connecting the boiler with the receiver and condenser, and the receiver and condenser, which is made of copper. The full capacity of the copper boiler ranges from 32 to 46 gallons, and it costs about Rs. 40, and that of the receiver and condenser is about 22 gallons. The cost of the latter is Rs. 17.\nToddy brought into the distillery is placed in open barrels until fermentation is complete, which usually takes two or three days. The boiler of the *hath bhatti* is charged with 22 to 38 gallons of toddy according to its size. At the first distillation the manufacturer usually draws from 6 to 13 gallons of liquor of strength varying between 50\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 U. P.; when 25\u00b0 U. P. liquor is to be made in the *hath bhatti*, from 6 to 14 gallons of toddy with 6 to 11 gallons of *rasi* (i.e., 60\u00b0 U. P. liquor) are placed in the boiler and distilled. Very weak liquor is subsequently drawn and is used for reducing the strengths to the prescribed standards. Toddy spirit of 25\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 U. P. only is allowed to pass out of the distillery, and the strength of liquor must not be reduced by the addition of water but of weaker spirit.\n\nThe liquor is sold at the rate of Rs. 9\u00bd per gallon of 25\u00b0 U. P. and Rs. 4 per gallon of 60\u00b0 U. P. in the liquor-shops of the city and of the Salsette and Bassein talukas of the Thana District. Maratha mill-hands from the Konkan, the Kolis, Agris and Goanese are the chief consumers of *feni*, while *rasi*, which is drunk warmed, is in great favour in Varli, Sewri, Mahim and Matunga.\n\n**David Sassoon Industrial and Reformatory Institution.**\n\nIn 1843 Dr. Buist founded near his house at Sewri a school of industry intended both for the reformation of juvenile criminals and for the improvement of industrial arts. In 1856 the school had so far progressed that the committee of management applied to Government for aid; and while the matter was still under consideration, the Sassoon family came forward with an offer to deposit Rs. 30,000 in the Government treasury and to provide suitable premises for a juvenile reformatory, provided that Government would agree to contribute a sum equal to the interest on the deposit and lend the services of an Engineer as Superintendent of the institution. This arrangement having been approved, the school of industry, under the title of the David Sassoon Industrial and Reformatory Institution, was removed from Sewri to Chunam Kiln road in 1857, where it still stands. Owing however to the expansion of\n\n---\n\n1 K. N. Kabraji's Reminiscences in \"Times of India,\" 1901: Mumbaicha Vrittant, Gen. Admin. Report, 1855-57, p. 43.\nthe city, particularly in the neighbourhood of Grant Road, it has recently been decided to remove the reformatory to a more outlying site, and a large plot of land at Matunga near the B.B. and C.I. Railway line has been purchased by Government for this purpose. In addition to being taught English and the Indian vernaculars the boys are well-drilled and receive instruction in various handicrafts, such as carpentry, carriage-building, painting, brass-moulding and wood and iron turning. Some of them are from time to time apprenticed to printing presses and steam factories. The staff of the reformatory comprises a Superintendent, instructors in carpentering, smithy and fitting work and painting, a drill master, a drawing master, an engine driver, and 6 teachers of the vernacular languages. Medals and prizes are annually competed for by the boys. The maximum number of boys in the institution is 230.\n\nDocks.\u2014In addition to the Government Dockyard, Bombay contains three wet docks and four dry docks, excluding the Alexandra and the Hughes docks now (1910) under construction. Of these three are owned by private steam navigation companies.\n\nThe need of a dry dock was brought to the notice of the East India Company by the Council at Bombay in 1686, and from a despatch of the Court of Directors in 1689-90 it appears that the construction of a dock was sanctioned in that year. Large quantities of iron were despatched from England for the construction and repair of vessels; but no steps towards the preparation of a dry dock were apparently taken until 1748. Up to that date indeed the only dry dock in Bombay was described as a mud basin in and out of which the tide flowed at will. This basin was in 1748 chosen as the site of a dock, which was opened in 1750, and during the next fifteen years two more docks were added. These docks in the Government\n\n---\n\n1 See separate article on the Government Dockyard infra.\n2 The P. & O. S. N. Company's two docks and the British India S. N.

These docks contained a public landing-place, the use of which was restricted, and merchant ships were allowed to be docked in them on payment of certain fees. As regards private docks mention is made of a mud dock in Mazagon in 1767 and 1776. Hamilton speaks of a good dock for small vessels in 1810, which in 1859 was handed over to the P. and O. Company, who are still in possession of it. It is known as the P. and O. Company's small dock. Another is the British India Company's dock constructed in 1845 by a Persian merchant, Aga Mahomed Rahim Shirazi. The P. and O. Company leased this dock from 1846 to 1870, when the British India S. N. Company became tenants of it. The Ritchie dock of the P. and O. Company was built between 1859 and 1867. It was designed to take one of the largest steamers owned by the Company at that date, when cleared of all stores and cargo. The dock has been considerably improved since that date, is furnished\n\n---\n\n2 See the Voyages of Grose (1750), Ives (1757), Niebohr (1763), and Parsons (1775).\n\nDuring the 17th century the Customs bandar and the Mahim bandar were the only landing-places in Bombay. In Mahim Bay ships of 800 tons were built and launched until the opening of the 18th century. The bay subsequently silted up and was abandoned. The chief landing-place was the Customs bandar close to the present Customs House. During the first half of the 19th century the landing-places in use in Bombay were the Town, Masjid, Bori, Mahim, Customs House, Mazagon, Back Bay, Carnac, Clare, Colaba, Apollo, Jakaria and Chinch bandars. The Apollo bandar was not much used until after it was repaired in 1819. The Bori bandar was improved in 1832. All these landing-places were imperfect and of use only at certain hours. At low water a traveller had to be carried ashore through the mud. In 1870 the Harbour and Pilotage Board improved the Mazagon pier and made additions to the Apollo pier. The other bandars and wharves were improved in subsequent years. In 1881 Bombay possessed 38 bandars and wharves including the docks. Of these the Gur-Carriage bandar was closed and given to the B. B. & C. I. Railway Company, who built the Colaba Railway station on the site. Bombay now possesses 41 bandars and wharves. See also Vol. I. Chap. I. For details of docks between 1810 and 1872, sec. Bombay Gazetteer Materials II, 520 and 521.\n\nThe Mazagon Dock is mentioned in 1813 as a good dock for small shipping.\nwith all stores required for construction and repair and can accommodate more than one steamer at a time. Another dry dock is mentioned as owned by the Viegas Company, which was constructed to berth vessels of 800 and 900 tons.\n\nDuring the progress of the Crimean War the demand for wet-dock accommodation for merchant-vessels began to be loudly voiced. The plans of the period show that a few wharves were in existence which were possibly used by small craft; but the bulk of the ships loaded and discharged in the stream. Various proposals and schemes were put forward, committees were formed to decide the question; but no definite step was taken until 1872 when the Elphinstone Estate was selected. Work was commenced in 1875. About the same date certain private docks were opened for the encouragement of trade, the most noteworthy being the Sassoon and Company's dock at Colaba, which was subsequently purchased by Government for the Port Trustees and is now used for the shipping and landing of military baggage and stores during the trooping season, and for the landing of railway material and the shipping of cotton, jute, etc., during other months. It was the first wet dock built in Bombay to enable large ships to discharge and load alongside a wharf, and was excavated from the solid rock. Other private wharf-owners prior to 1877 were the Colaba and Frere land companies. The Prince's Dock which occupies the site of the old Elphinstone basin in Mody Bay was commenced, as above stated, in 1875 and completed in 1880; while by 1885 an extension of it, called the Victoria Dock, was also ready for use. The continued expansion of trade has rendered further dock accommodation necessary, and as a result a new wet dock (the Alexandra) with a dry dock (the Hughes) opening out of it are now under construction. They are planned to take vessels of the largest size that are likely to trade with the port during the next thirty or forty years.\n\n1 The question was first raised in 1810 but was not seriously considered.\nThe first stone of the Prince's Dock\\(^1\\) was laid by H. R. H. The Prince's Dock, the Prince of Wales on the 11th November, 1875, with full masonic honours, and the dock was opened for the first time on the 1st January, 1880.\\(^2\\) At the opening ceremony several unfortunate accidents occurred to the steamers taking part in the procession, which so prejudiced the public mind that the dock was practically boycotted for a fortnight. The marine insurance companies declared that their policies did not cover this new risk and the owners of steamers, with the approval of many importers and exporters, declined to use it. On the 9th January Captain Morland, the Port Officer, approached one of the partners of Messrs. Graham and Co. and asked him to assist in frustrating the boycott by berthing a steamer of the Anchor Line or Hall Line in the new dock; and on receiving the personal assurance of the Governor (Sir Richard Temple) that the firm should suffer no loss from detention or damage to cargo, Messrs. Graham and Co. sent the Anchor Line S.S. Italia into the dock on the 15th January. After much opposition from native mercantile firms who had been misled by the mukadams (loading and unloading agents), and by dint of satisfying the fears and objections of the influential export firms Messrs. Graham and Co. were enabled to load and unload their vessel without difficulty. This action demonstrated to the satisfaction of the most prejudiced and timorous the great advantages afforded by the dock; and the S.S. Italia was shortly followed by other steamers belonging to the same line and the Hall Line. Neither the Peninsular and Oriental Company nor the British India Company made use of the dock till some time later.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Prince's Dock is situated on the Elphinstone estate. In 1875 Mr. Ormiston designed an enormous basin, the Elphinstone basin and this basin has been altered and merged in the dock.\n\n\\(^2\\) The last stone of the dock was laid by Sir Richard Temple on the 10th April, 1879 and the water was then admitted into the dock. For further details see \"Times of India\" of 12th April 1879 and 6th January 1880.\n\n\\(^3\\) In return for their action the Port Trustees allocated two wharves on the west side of the dock to Messrs. Graham and Co., and also granted free entrance to their steamers for a certain period, and subsequently entrance at an exceptionally reduced rate.\nThe dock has an area of 30 acres of water, is 1460 feet long and 1000 feet wide, and has walls 37 feet deep. From the north end a jetty, 700 feet long by 240 feet wide, runs down the centre of the dock. The length of berth-accommodation is 5960 feet and along the outer wall adjoining the harbour 1590 feet. It affords a total quay of 6910 feet including the effective portion of the outer harbour wall. There are two entrances, the northern 66 feet and the southern 55 feet in width. The depth on the sills of both is $28\\frac{1}{4}$ feet at high water ordinary spring tides. The dock can accommodate 16 steamers alongside the wharves.\n\nThere are fifty-five movable hydraulic cranes for working cargo, capable of lifting 30 cwt. through a height of 60 feet; and at the head of the jetty is a crane which is capable of raising 30 tons; also a five-ton hydraulic capstan for warping vessels into the dock. The gates and sluices are worked by hydraulic machines.\n\nThere are also two capstans, capable of sustaining a strain of 5 tons, and two of 11 tons, for warping vessels at the entrances. Eleven closed transit sheds, having an area of 416,509 square feet, have been erected on the wharves, besides nine warehouses with an area of 191,965 square feet. Fresh water is laid along the wharf, and is available from numerous hydrants for ordinary use and in case of fire.\n\nThe dredging operations in the Prince's Dock channel alter both the depth and shade of it, by bringing the scour from the passage west of Butcher's island across the north-east and south-west extremes of the bank. The leading mark for the centre of the channel is a disc on the small flagstaff on the north side of the north entrance to the dock, in line with a double disc in the back-ground bearing W $\\frac{1}{2}$ N.\n\nThe beacon on the north end of Cross island spit is about a hundred feet south of the Prince's Dock channel, the limits of which are defined by two cones on poles on the north side, and two drums on poles on the south side. The masonry and excavations of the dock were contracted\n\n---\n\n1 Some of them are upper storeyed and built according to the principles of fire-proof construction.\nfor by Messrs. Glover & Co. at a cost of 42 lakhs. The total cost was 76 lakhs. The material excavated in forming the dock was utilized for the further reclamation of Mody Bay to the south of the site.\n\nThe dock traffic office is placed at the entrance to the Prince's and Victoria Docks and is provided with a large turret containing a clock and surmounted by a time ball that falls daily at 8-30 a.m. The traffic office was commenced in January, 1888 and completed in 1890. In 1881 the Sassoon dock and the Arthur and Mazagon Powder Works bandars were closed for dutiable traffic and the Customs Department was concentrated at Prince's Dock, Carnac bandar and the Town Customs House.\n\nThe Merewether dry dock, situated at the north-west corner and opening out of the Prince's dock, is so named after Colonel Merewether, R.E., a former Chairman of the Port Trust. The opening ceremony was performed on the 3rd March 1891 by Lord Harris. The dock is principally intended for the painting and cleaning of vessels and the execution of slight repairs. In special circumstances it is also used for heavy repairs. The dock has an entrance length of 530 feet, a breadth at the entrance of 63\u00bd feet and a depth on the sills of 25\u00bd feet at high water ordinary neap tides. Should a vessel be found not to be properly on the blocks or not to be shored satisfactorily, it is possible at once to raise the level of the water and keep the vessel water-borne as long as may be necessary. The fees charged for the use of the dock vary according to tonnage, subject to a minimum of Rs. 400 for the first day.\n\nThe construction of the Victoria Dock was commenced in January 1885; the ceremony of admitting water into the basin was performed by Lady Reay on the 21st February 1888; and on the 12th March of the same year the dock was opened. The dock absorbed the old Masjid and Nicol bandars, and the material excavated during its construction was principally utilized in forming two\n\n---\n\n1 It was commenced in February 1883. The material obtained in excavating it was utilized in effecting an extension of the reclamation at Tank bandar. The cost of construction was 17\u00bd lakhs.\n\n2 For further details see \"Times of India\" of 5th March, 1891.\nlarge jetties in Mody Bay. The Victoria Dock, which together with Prince's Dock, cost 221 lakhs, was designed to provide for the loading and unloading of vessels requiring deep-water berths. It has an area of 25 acres of water, is 1,270 feet long and 1,000 feet wide and has three jetties on its western side, each 400 feet long and 230 feet in width. The length of berth accommodation is 7,425 feet, and the total length including the effective portion of the outer harbour wall is 7,805 feet. The communication passage with the Prince's Dock is 64 feet wide and is closed by a caisson. The dock has one entrance, 80 feet wide, and a communication passage 64 feet wide. At high water ordinary spring tides there is a depth of 30\u00bd feet on the sill, the bottom of the dock being 3 feet lower than the sill. Fifty-eight moveable hydraulic cranes are provided for dealing with cargo, and on the south jetty is a crane capable of raising 100 tons through a height of 40 feet. Closed transit-sheds covering an area of 674,323 square feet have been erected on the wharves, besides 4 warehouses with an area of 200,402 square feet.\n\nThe Sassoon Dock at Colaba is situated close to the present Cotton Green and was opened in 1875 by Messrs. D. Sassoon & Co. In 1879 it was purchased by Government on behalf of the Port Trustees, and was used for several years afterwards as a boat basin and landing-place for troops. It is now used for the landing of cotton, wool, coal, railway materials, military stores and baggage accompanying troops from foreign or customs ports and for the shipping of cotton, wool, hemp, jute, rags, seeds and military stores. There are a troop-shed and quarters in the dock for the use of military drafts and reliefs. Excavated out of the solid rock, the dock measures 645 feet in length by 292 feet at its broadest part and covers a water-area of 3\u00bd acres. The entrance is 40 feet wide and the sill is 26\u00bd feet below the level of the wharves. The depth of water varies from 18 feet on the sill at high water neap tides to 21\u00bd feet at high water spring tides and occasionally reaches 23\u00bd feet. The wharves have a frontage of 1,500 lineal feet, and an area of 2\u00bd acres, but there are in addition to this space upwards of 18,000 square yards of adjoining land that can be used for storage, &c.\nVessels of 18 feet draught can enter or leave the dock, and for those drawing up to 20 feet there will be sufficient depth of water during the eight consecutive days of spring tides. Moorings have been laid down off the entrance in a position where there are 24 feet of water at low spring tides, and other buoys are fixed for warping and checking vessels as they enter and leave the dock. It is calculated that vessels of 300 feet long could enter easily, but the dock is best suited for steamers up to about 1,000 tons net register, of which it can accommodate five at a time alongside the wharves. If necessary three more vessels lying outside the others could be worked by means of staging. The wharves are provided with lines of rail for the removal of goods up to 20 tons in weight, and the dock is connected by a siding with the Colaba terminus of the B. B. & C. I. Railway.\n\nThe new Alexandra Dock and the Hughes Dry Dock are now (1910) under construction, the foundation-stone of the former having been laid by H. R. H. the Prince of Wales in November 1905. The former is designed to cover an area of 49\u00bd acres and to afford a length of nearly 3 miles of quay, including the outer wall. The entrance will be 100 feet wide and the sill is 33\u00bd feet below mean high water level. The bottom of the dock is 2 feet lower, affording a depth of 36\u00bd feet for vessels to load during ordinary neap tides. The dock is to be completely equipped with hydraulic cranes, railway sidings and sheds, and provision is made for mail steamers, before entering the dock, to land passengers at the mole on which a railway station is to be built with a branch railway connecting with the main lines serving Bombay. The dry dock will run parallel to the wet dock entrance and will be 1,000 feet in length with an entrance 100 feet wide and with a sill 33\u00bd feet below high water ordinary neap tide. The docks are estimated to cost 373 lakhs and are being constructed by Messrs. Price, Wills & Reeves. The contract with this firm for the masonry and excavation work was signed on the 19th April 1904 and provides for the entire completion of the works by the 1st June 1912.\n\n---\n\n1 Report of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, 1874-75, pp. 9-10\n2 Review of Bombay Port Trust Operations, 1873-1905.\nThe granite for the hollow quoins and sill stones of the iron gates was prepared in Cornwall, while most of the granite for copings, etc., is being obtained from Hyderabad (Deccan). Rubble is being quarried at Udwada on the B. B. & C. I. railway, and at Mandwa and Hog island across the harbour, and other stone is being obtained from Sewri on the island of Bombay and from a quarry beyond Thana on the G. I. P. railway.\n\nThe position of the Government Dockyard on the east side of the island was originally determined by the existence of the bay, which in early days formed the only secure anchorage for small vessels. This bay, which has been so altered as to be barely recognizable today, comprised the lower portions of the present Bombay and Duncan docks, a part of the wet basin, and the waters lying between Bombay Castle point on the north and the entrance gate of the lower Bombay dock on the south. Frequent by native craft from the earliest times, the bay was first used as an anchorage for European vessels in 1531, when Nuno da Cunha, the Viceroy of Goa, selected it as the rendezvous of his expedition against Diu; and since that date the site of the present dockyard has formed the principal maritime area of Bombay. During the early years of British dominion, the need of a good dock was continually emphasized by the authorities both at home and abroad; for the only dry dock at that period was a mud basin situated on the modern site of the Middle and Lower Bombay docks, near the centre of the Dockyard, in and out of which the tide flowed at will. No definite step however was taken until January, 1748, when the Bombay Council decided to borrow a sum not exceeding\n\n---\n\n1 The Portuguese, on obtaining regular possession of Bombay in 1532, commenced fortifying the Island. Old foundations, apparently dating back to the epoch of Portuguese dominion, were discovered during the excavation at the Dockyard in 1905-06.\n\n2 Bombay Town and Island Materials II, 516. Sir John Wyborne, Deputy Governor, wrote in 1686:\u2014\"All ships in these seas, when they know of a dock where they can lie securely, will come to clean and repair. Had there been a dock, the ship Falcon had not left her bones here. We can only say it will be a necessary profitable work, when done.\" Up to 1704 the arrangements for repairing ships were described as \"wretched\"; but they were somewhat improved under the auspices of Sir Nicholas Waite between 1704 and 1707.\nRs. 5,000 for the construction of a proper dock on the site of the mud basin, and to indent upon Tellicherry for the timber required for the dock-gates. In July, 1750, they were able to declare the dock completed and to fix the dues payable by ships using it, namely \"Rs. 150 for the first spring, and Rs. 100 for every spring they remain in afterwards.\" This dock, which was enlarged in 1751, was the first dry dock constructed in India and is now known as the Upper Old Bombay Dock. It measures 209 feet in length, 47 feet in breadth, and 15 feet in depth, and forms the western section of the southernmost of the two lines of docks, lying parallel to one another near the centre of the Dockyard.\n\nThe dock proved such a success that the construction of a second outer dock was sanctioned in 1754 and completed in 1762. The latter, which shows traces of hurried workmanship, is now known as the Middle Old Bombay Dock and measures 183 feet in length, 51 feet in breadth and 20 feet in depth. It is said to have cost Rs. 12,000 and to have been \"capable of holding a 70 gun ship.\" A third outer dock appears to have been commenced about the same date, and was completed by the end of 1765. It is now the Lower Old Bombay Dock, and measures 256 feet in length, 51 feet in breadth and 20 feet in depth. For the next forty years these three docks, one within another were the boast of Bombay and the wonder of travellers;\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town and Island Materials, II. 517.\n2 In 1756, while the work was in progress, Captain Pearse of the Edgcote requested that the protecting dam might be broken and his ship be allowed to pass in. On his agreeing to pay the cost of demolition and any extraordinary expenses that its absence might entail upon Government up to the time the dock-gates were fixed, his ship was allowed to enter.\n3 Apparently progress was very slow; for Admiral Cornish wrote from Trincomalee in June 1762 urging the completion of the dock before the return of the squadron. \"The dock,\" he added, \"is of the utmost consequence. It is the only means of preserving the two capital ships of the squadron.\"\n4 See Grose's Voyage (1750) and Ives' Voyage (1758). Niebuhr in 1763, before the completion of the third dock, wrote: \"Among the large number of good arrangements made by the English in Bombay for trade and shipping, the dock is much the most considerable and important. The work is partly rock-cut, partly of cut-stone. Two ships can be careened at a time, and a third basin is preparing. The work though costly brings a considerable return. Strangers pay very dear for liberty to careen in these...\"\nand they attained such popularity that the Bombay Government were able to enhance the dues from the original Rs. 150 and Rs. 100 to Rs. 450 and Rs. 350 in the case of English ships, and Rs. 600 and Rs. 500 in the case of foreign vessels. The three divisions of the dock, as may be seen today, are not in the same line, owing to the fact that, to save the labour of cutting and blasting, the constructors of those days were obliged to follow the general trend of the rock and to content themselves with cutting away only such portions as jutted inconveniently into the area of excavation.\n\nIn 1782, during the Governorship of Mr. Hornby, the Admiral requested that either new docks might be constructed or the old docks altered for the greater convenience of the squadron; but no action was taken until 1804, when the Court of Directors desired the Bombay Government to arrange for the construction of a 74-gun man-of-war. Colaba and Butcher island were both examined for sites for a dock suitable for the building of so large a vessel, but it was eventually (1805) decided to build a new dock in the Dockyard and to entrust the work of construction to Lieutenant Crozier of the Engineers. A second new dock was also sanctioned about the same date, the estimated cost of the two together being 2\u00bd lakhs. Owing to an unfavourable report upon Lieutenant Crozier's arrangements, the work was subsequently entrusted to Captain Cowper, who, in spite of the want of trained artizans, of interruption by the tides, and of the very solid nature of the rock, had by the close of 1807 cleared away all his predecessor's work and had completed the first of the two new docks. This dock, which was named after the Governor, Mr. Jonathan Duncan, is now known as the Upper Duncan Dock, and measures 286 feet in length, 63 feet in breadth and 23 feet in depth, the sides being of fine cut stone and the bottom of solid basins. When I was in Bombay, I saw a ship of war belonging to the Imam of Sanaa, which he had sent to Bombay solely on purpose to be refitted.\" Parsons the traveller spoke in 1775 of \"such a dry dock as perhaps is not to be seen in any part of Europe either for size or convenient situation. It has three divisions and three pairs of strong gates etc\". Forbes also mentions the three excellent decks in 1776.\nTo the Honourable JONATHAN DUNCAN\nGOVERNOR of BOMBAY,\nthis PLAN of BOMBAY HARBOUR\nis Inscribed by his most obliged\nand most obedient Servant\nJames Horsburgh\n\nScale of six Nautic Miles\nmasonry. By July, 1810, Captain Cowper had also completed the outer or repairing dock, now known as the Lower Duncan Dock, and was thanked for his \"peculiar and eminent merits in planning and executing the great undertaking.\" The total cost of both docks was 3\u00bd lakhs. In 1841 the Lower Duncan Dock was widened and improved, and now measures 246 feet in length, 64 feet in breadth, and 18 feet in depth; while in 1843 similar improvements were sanctioned to the Upper Duncan Dock, and were completed by Captain Estridge in July, 1847, the total outlay upon improvements to both docks amounting to more than one lakh.\n\nIn 1890 the need of increased accommodation for vessels of the Royal Navy and Royal Indian Marine led to the extension of the Duncan Dry Dock at a cost of more than 4\u00bd lakhs, and also to the construction at a cost of 1\u00bd lakhs of a wet basin, a dry dock for torpedo-boats, and of hydraulic warping-capstans. The wet basin, which lies between the old Customs bandar and the Government dry docks, is triangular in shape, has a water area of five acres, and can accommodate eight vessels of the Royal Indian Marine. It is 26 feet in depth and has a wharfage of 1,600 feet, while at the entrance, which is 60 feet in width, it is furnished with a hauling caisson constructed on the latest principles. In the north-west corner are a small dry dock, capable of accommodating two torpedo-boats, and a boat-slip for the repair of light craft. The designs for the wet basin and for the alterations to the Duncan Dock were prepared by Captain Porter, R.E., and the\n\n---\n\n1 The Courier of the 2nd January, 1808, contains the following reference to the keel of the 74-gun vessel, which was laid in the Duncan Dock\u2014\"While this paper is going to press, a Royal Salute is firing as a signal that the silver nail has been driven in and united the stem and keel of the new 74.

(Annual Register for 1808). At the west end of the dock, on a blackened slab about eight feet below the pier level, are carved these words\u2014\"This Dock was erected during the government of the Honourable Jonathan Duncan, Esquire, by Captain William Cowper of the Engineers, 1807.\"\n\n2 The first ship to enter the dock after the completion of these improvements was the P. & O. Company's steamship Braganza.\ncost of the works, including the cost of engines and machinery, exceeded 16\u00bd lakhs.\n\nIn 1735 the Dockyard enclosure was occupied by Marine Officers' quarters, seamen's quarters, a jail (on the site of the present Marine Office) and other buildings. A public thoroughfare ran through the yard, which was bounded on the north by the Doctor's house, now the northern portion of the Marine storehouse; on the east by the harbour; on the west by a wall containing the marine gate and running south to the Apollo Gate of the Fort; and on the south by the ramparts which extended southeast to the Royal Bastion (situated close to the tank near the saw-mills) and north-east from that point to the entrance of the Lower Bombay Dock.\n\nAt the present date (1910), the principal entrance to the Dockyard is the main gate (opposite the Great Western Hotel), built prior to 1798 and surmounted by a clock-tower and flagstaff similar to those in the Royal Dock-\n\n---\n\n1 The improvements to the Duncan Docks resulted in increasing their length by 60 feet, their width by 48 feet and their depth by 7 feet. The works from start to finish occupied 2\u00bd years, during which time about 2,000 workmen were daily employed.\n\n2 The jail and other old buildings were finally removed and the public thoroughfare closed in 1805. Until 1884 the Doctor's House was the office of the Marine Storekeeper. In 1750 (see Grose's map of Bombay) the Bandar pier, which projected from the old Company's warehouse, and is now represented in altered form by the area between the present Dockyard and Customs basins, was the principal and the official landing-place. Viscount Valentia says free access was allowed to the bandar throughout the day. The Bandar house or Company's warehouse was rather nearer the Dockyard than the present Custom House, which dates from 1802, and next the warehouse on the south lay the house of the Superintendent of Marine, and the Marine Storehouse (including the quarters of the Marine Paymaster), which was purchased in 1720 from Captain Ingram for Rs. 3,300. These houses occupied the present site of the Customs godown and the Government Press. South of them again were the General Hospital occupying a portion of the present Opium warehouse, and the Doctor's House, both of which were annexed to the Dockyard premises between 1828 and 1830.\n\nAlthough the general demolition of the ramparts took place between 1864 and 1865, the portion running north-east from the Royal Bastion was not demolished till 1894. Built into it near the gate of the Middle Old Bombay Dock were two curious caverns, formerly used as an ammunition-store, and latterly as a receptacle for tar and other inflammable substances (see Douglas's Bombay and Western India, I, 144). The wall, forming the western boundary of the dockyard, disappeared gradually as the store-houses were enlarged.\ncovered in about 1760; while the latter, described in 1759 as \"a shed the coopers work in,\" was actually situated within the Dockyard until 1742, when pressure of space obliged Government to remove it to a warehouse on the water's edge belonging to Mr. Broughton. From that date the Cooperage continued to occupy hired buildings until 1781, when Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes protested against the proximity of the buildings to the garrison, and Government resolved to \"erect a proper shed upon the Apollo ground for the reception of the King's provisions.\" This shed has given the Cooperage area its name and was in use until 1886, when the new stores were built in the Dockyard. The Sheers were built in the Dockyard shortly after the completion of the Duncan Dock in 1810, and, rising to a height of 85 feet and surmounted by a flag staff and vane bearing the East India Company's crest, formed a conspicuous landmark for nearly a century. Having become untrustworthy, they were gradually dismantled, the last portion being removed in 1905.\n\nParallel with the Duncan Dock is the steam factory, built about 1838, in which the iron vessels Ariadne and Medusa, destined for the China war of 1840, were put together, and the first steamers employed in maintaining communication between Bombay and Suez were built. The present building is replete with all the latest machinery requisite for the construction of modern marine engines.\n\nThe first master-builder was Lowji Nasarwanji Wadia of Surat, who served from 1735 to 1773, and may be said to have founded the reputation of the Dockyard. Perhaps the most famous member of this family (the Wadias) was Jamsetji Bomanji, who built for the British Navy several line of battleships and frigates, remarkable\n\n---\n\n1 Parsons, writing in 1775 of the Rope-walk, says that for \"length, situation and convenience, it equals any in England, that in the Kingsyard, Portsmouth, alone excepted; and, like that, it has a covering to shelter the workmen from the inclemency of the weather at all seasons. Here are made cables and all sorts of lesser hemp-ropes, both for the Royal Navy, Honourable Company's ships, and merchant-vessels. Besides which all kinds of cables, hawsers, and lesser ropes are made of cocoanut fibre and called eyar (coir).\"\nfor their strength and seaworthiness; but several other descendants of Lowji received testimonials from the Court of Directors, the Bombay Government and from British Admirals for their fidelity and meritorious services to the nation. The last master-builder was Khan Bahadur Jamsetji Dhanjibhoy, who retired in 1885. The list of vessels built by members of the family between 1735 and 1863 comprises 170 war vessels and other craft for the East India Company, 34 war ships for the Royal Navy, 87 merchant vessels for private firms, and 3 vessels for the Imam of Muscat. Since 1885 the work of construction and repairs has been in charge of a Chief Constructor, trained in the Royal Dockyards, and assisted by a full staff of European officers. The original work of the Dockyard included the building of all kinds of vessels, the docking and repair of naval squadrons, the fitting-out of expeditions, and the up-keep of anchorages and subsidiary duties. Though the work at the present time (1910) is nominally the same, it has greatly increased, and through the substitution of steel and iron for teakwood has changed in character. A new class of skilled artificers and mechanics has displaced the former builders in wood, while the very complete steam and electric plant now in use enables the authorities, with only a small temporary increase of hands, to cope successfully with any sudden emergency.\n\nDuring the earlier years of British dominion some kind of marine establishment was maintained on the site of the Dockyard under the orders of the Commodore of the Company's Marine. Among the officials of the establishment were a Marine Storekeeper, a Marine Paymaster,\n\n---\n\n1 Rear-Admiral Sir. T. Troubridge wrote to the representative of the family in 1802:\u2014\"I have pledged myself you will produce ships that will eclipse those built in England.\" Maclean's Guide to Bombay.\n\n2 These ships, built of teak, were so strong that many of them lasted for 50 or 60 years. It is on record that the Bombay grab, built in 1739 for the Bombay Marine, was \"a staunch and stout vessel\" at the age of 60. The brig Emparate, built in 1828, is still quite sound in the hull; while H.M.S. Meeanee, built at Bombay in 1844 and now serving as a hospital ship in Hongkong harbour, is reported absolutely sound.\n\n3 Surat Diary. I. 1660-96. The pay of this appointment in 1670 was raised from \u00a30-1-6 to \u00a30-2-0 per day. Apparently these officials had other more lucrative sources of income than their salary.\nand a Purser Marine, the two latter offices being combined some time before 1736 and separated again in that year. The Purser Marine was charged with the supply of all provisions and necessaries to ships and had to furnish a monthly bill for them to the Marine Paymaster, who had \"the charge and direction of watering and ballasting the Company's vessels and of purchasing what timber and coir were wanted for their service.\" By 1739 however the post of Marine Paymaster had been abolished, and the Purser Marine, who presumably performed his duties, was granted Rs. 80 per month for salary and diet, Rs. 20 for house-rent, but no house and no palanquin-coolies.\n\nThe post of Superintendent of Marine was created about 1739; and by 1742 the marine establishment included, in addition to that official, 8 Commanders, of whom one was styled Commodore, a Purser Marine in charge of the accounts and victualling, a Master Builder, and others in charge of the several departments. In 1754 the post of Master Attendant had also been created, and in 1777 the holder of the post ranked as the second senior officer in the marine and acted as assistant to the Superintendent for the administration of port duties and the sailmaking and rigging establishments. In 1778 the Superintendentship of Marine in Bombay was abolished; and the Court of Directors ordered the creation of a Marine Board, which however was not actually constituted until 1785 and then only existed for about a year. In its place the two junior members of Council were created Comptrollers of Marine in rotation and were expected to see that the various Marine officials carried out the orders of the Court of Directors, while all orders relative to details of dockyard and marine management were issued by the President of the Council. So matters remained until 1798, when the Marine regulations were revised and the\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town and Island Materials, III, 210, 211, 212.\n2 Ibid., p. 213.\n3 The salary of the Superintendent of Marine in 1739 was \u00a3220 a year. This was raised in 1754 to \u00a3250, on the understanding that if quarters were provided, the salary was to be reduced by Rs. 240 a year. Bombay Town and Island Materials, III, 251.\n4 Bombay Town and Island Materials, III, 251.\n5 Ibid., 255.\nBombay Marine was created a naval service for war purposes only. A Marine Board was constituted, consisting of a civilian Superintendent, a Master Attendant, a Commodore, and two Captains, the latter four posts being held by the four senior officers of the service. The Board conducted all business relating to the Dockyard and the financial details of the service, while the chief executive power was vested in the Superintendent, subject to the control of Government. Under this scheme the post of Comptroller of Marine was abolished, and the Dockyard came under the direct supervision of the civilian Superintendent of Marine.\n\nFrom 1830 to 1863 the Dockyard was administered by the Superintendent of Marine (styled later the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy), aided by a Master Attendant, Boatmaster, Secretary and Accountant, Marine Judge-Advocate and Draughtsman, Marine Storekeeper, Marine Paymaster, a Master-builder, and an Assistant to the Superintendent. Of these, the Master Attendant dealt with the administration of the Port outside the Dockyard, was head of the Harbour and Pilotage Board (now merged in the Port Trust), and supervised the docking of vessels and the maintenance of moorings. In 1859 all his dockyard duties were transferred to a Dock-\n\n---\n\n1 The Boatmaster's post was abolished soon after 1830.\n2 This official was largely concerned with finance. He later became Naval Assistant to the Military Auditor-General; as Draughtsman he performed the duties subsequently assigned to the Indian Naval Draughtsman.\n3 This office is the only one which has existed with alterations, since 1670.\n4 This office was held by a civilian and was subsequently divided into the two offices of Deputy Naval Paymaster and Accountant to the Dockyard, both filled by senior Pursers of the Indian Navy.\n5 This office was later divided into two posts, namely, the Assistant Superintendent, Indian Navy, and Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief, Indian Navy. The office is now that of the Assistant Director, Royal Indian Marine.\n6 The office of Master Attendant expanded greatly between 1830 and 1863. In 1859 there were three Assistant Master Attendants, a Senior Pilot and 14 Junior Pilots. He supervised the work of the Boatswain of the yard and the Master-sailmaker. In 1873 his office was located in the Dockyard in the quarters now occupied by the Cashier's office. The office was transferred in that year to the Port Trust building.\nmaster's establishment; and he was thenceforth responsible only for the commercial work of the port. Fourteen years later (1873) his title was altered to that of Port Officer. Meanwhile in 1867, when the Indian trooping-service was organized, the Dockmaster was appointed agent for transports, and later Assistant Resident Transport Officer. In 1878 the first naval constructor (Mr. Barnaby) was appointed from England; while the Superintendent of Marine became successively in 1882 and 1892 Director of Her Majesty's Indian Marine and Director, Royal Indian Marine. A post of Consulting Naval Officer to the Government of India was created in 1874 and abolished in 1880; and similarly the post of Assistant Secretary, Military (Marine) Department, created in 1880, was merged in that of Assistant Director in 1884.\n\nAt present (1910) the Director, Royal Indian Marine, is in charge of all branches of the Government Dockyard, and is also Resident Transport Officer and a Member of the Defence Committee. Besides the Assistant Director, the following officers are included in the Dockyard Staff:\u2014The Staff Officer, Chief Constructor, Constructor and Assistant Constructor, Inspector of Machinery, Marine Storekeeper, and Engineer in charge of the factory; while the subordinate staff includes five foremen, an electrician, a mechanical draughtsman, a master-rigger, master-sail-maker, assistant surgeon, and others. The business of the Dockyard is conducted on the system obtaining in the Royal Dockyards in England, the upkeep of buildings, docks, basins and roads being in charge of the Military Works Department, and the auditing of the accounts being carried out by an Examiner, who belongs to the Military Accounts Department of the Government of India.\n\nThe following is a list of the wars, expeditions, etc., for which the Government Dockyard, Bombay, has fitted out vessels:\n\n- **1717-18** ...

The School Department was again separated from the parent institution in 1856 and became thenceforth a High School.\n\nUp to 1856 the combined institutions occupied premises on Carnac road near the Small Causes Court; and the school retained these premises after the separation. In 1872 Sir Seymour Fitzgerald laid the foundation stone of a new building for the school, which is called the Sassoon building, in consideration of a contribution by Sir Albert Sassoon of 1\u00bd lakhs towards the total cost of the building, which exceeded 5\u00bd lakhs. The building was designed by Mr. Molecey and comprises 32 class-rooms. At the rear is a large play-ground, and there is also a covered play-ground for recreation during the monsoon.\n\nPupils are taught the official high-school standards; and the school is divided into a Marathi and Gujarathi side, each of which contains about 300 pupils. The fee-rate is Rs. 3 for the two lower standards and Rs. 4 for the two higher. Sanskrit, Persian, French and Drawing are taught, and there is also a Science laboratory. Much attention is paid to physical education. The staff of the\n\n\u00b9 This expedition was despatched in record time. Orders were received at the Dockyard on the 6th September. The first transport left Bombay on the 17th September; and after that they were despatched at the rate of two a day. The troops numbered 5000, together with followers, ammunition, guns and three months' supplies.\nschool comprises a Principal, 39 masters, including the drill-master, and a cricket-coach. The income of the school is derived from Government contributions, the Elphinstone Trust Fund and fees. The expenditure amounts to rather more than half a lakh per annum. A secondary teachers' training College, established in 1906, is also located in the school-building.\n\nFire Temples.\u2014Fire is the chief object of Parsi veneration and the Fire Temple is the public place of worship.\u00b9 The Atesh Behram (the fire of Behram), 'the angel of success,' which is composed of sixteen kinds of fire, is worshipped in four temples in Bombay, and the Atesh Dadghan or Proper-place Fire is kept in a Fire Temple known as the Agiari or Place of Fire, and is also called Dare-meher, i.e., the Gate of Mercy.\u00b2 Bombay possesses 35 such places. A list of Atesh Behrams in Bombay is given below:\n\n| Name          | Locality       | Date of opening | Remarks                                      |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Dady Sett's   | Girgaum Behram | 1783            | Founded by Dady Nasarwanji                   |\n| Banaji's      | Charni road    | 1845            | Founded by Framji Cursetji and Rustomji Cowasji and Dada-bhoy Rustomji Banaji. |\n| Wadia's       | Princess Street| 1830            | Founded by the sons of Hormusji Bomanji Wadia. |\n| Anjuman's     | Chandanwadi    | 1897            | Founded by subscription.                    |\n\nThe first two Atesh Behrams were consecrated according to Kadami rites and the last two according to Shensai.\u00b3 The first Agiari founded was the Fort Agiari, built by Banaji Limji in 1709 and rebuilt by his family in 1845. The second was built in the same locality by\n\n\u00b9 Some of the rich Parsis keep the sacred fire in their own houses, taking special care to see that it never dies out.\n\u00b2 For detailed account of the Sacred Fires and Temples, see Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. IX, Part II.\n\u00b3 For these divisions see footnote 2 on page 193 of the Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. IX, Part II.\nManeckji Nowroji Sett in 1733 and rebuilt in 1891. Each temple has a priest whose duty it is to read the religious books and to keep the fire burning. The priests wear white dress, including the turban. Since 1862 classes have been opened and special training is given to those who wish to be priests and Dasturs. A description of one Atesh Behram and one Agiari is given below:\n\nIn May 1896 the foundation stone of the Anjuman's Atesh Behram at Chandanwadi was laid by Dastur Dr. Jamaspjee Minocherjee Jamaspasna, M.A., Ph.D., High Priest of the Parsis, with great pomp and ceremony. The building which was constructed from subscriptions collected from the Parsi community was completed in 1897, and was opened for use after the performance of a Jasan or thanksgiving ceremony. The building which cost about Rs. 2,30,000 has an imposing fa\u00e7ade, the front walls, which are wrought in Porbandar stone bearing rich carving and medallions representing some of the well-known symbols of the Zoroastrian religion. The structure is built in the Persipolitan style, and the frontage particularly is an imitation of the palace of King Jamshed. The latest sanitary improvements have been introduced in all parts of the building which is well lighted and ventilated. The porch is a magnificent work of art, and so is the sanctum sanctorum where the sacred fire has been installed.\n\nThe shrine is about 25 feet long and an equal number of feet in width and in the centre of it is placed a marble pedestal, upon which stands the huge silver ewer containing the sacred fire. No one, except the officiating priests, is allowed to enter the room which is partitioned off by brass railings and there, besides the bells which ring in and ring out the five gehs or portions of the day, are to be found swords and other weapons used by the ancient Persians to prevent intruders from defiling the fire. Next to the sanctum sanctorum is\n\n---\n\n1 Probably these may be the two Fire Temples noticed by Mrs. Postans in the Fort. In speaking of them she says: \"They are described as consisting of a spacious hall having a central arch of masonry surmounting the vase of sacred fire.\"\nthe prayer hall which is 55 feet long and 55 feet wide, the height between the floor and the ceiling being nearly 21 feet. The prayer hall is carpeted with Brussels carpets of rich workmanship, the ceilings being covered with silk and satin bordered with tassels of silk. The entrance hall is paved with Minton tiles and on the walls on three sides of it are marble tablets bearing the names of the different donors who have given large sums for the construction of certain portions of the building. On the first floor, which is approached by a grand staircase, is a magnificent hall, 65 feet long and 56 feet wide, the roof, which is about 20 feet high, being supported on four fluted columns with coronas bearing horses' heads in Porbandar stone. The hall, which is used on festive occasions, contains portraits of the principal donors. The hall is named after Mr. Dadabhoy Nasarwanji Contractor, who paid about Rs. 20,000 for its construction. There are two large ante-rooms on each side of the hall, one of which is intended to be used as a library, and contains some ancient Persian literature.\n\nThe fire in Maneckji Sett's Agiari was installed in the year 1733 by Maneckji Nowroji Sett. The old building showed signs of decay, which led to the erection of handsome new building at a cost of about one lakh of rupees by Mr. Jalbhoy Ardesar, the eighth lineal descendant of the founder. It is built in the ancient Persian style of architecture, and its facade alone presents an appearance which is as unique as it is rare in the Western capital of India.\n\nThe Adaran fire was installed in this temple on 5th November 1891. It is placed in a large silver censer, estimated to have cost about Rs. 7,000. The hall in which it is placed cannot be entered by any except the officiating priest or his immediate assistant. It is built entirely of marble facing, and compares favourably with any building of its class in elegance and simplicity. The chief problem in the erection of a fire-temple is how to get rid of the smoke. In the present instance a number of ventilating appliances have been provided.\n\nDuring the time the building was under erection the Adaran fire was removed to Maneckji Sett's qart in the\nFort, a portion of the place having been set apart for the exclusive purpose and for the use of the priests in charge. All the arrangements for the removal and reinstatement were made under the directions of Mobed D. M. Adrianwala, the hereditary priest officiating in the temple. A portion of the building is devoted to the dedication of the Dadgan fire and to the performance of certain rituals enjoined by Parsi custom and usage.\n\nGeneral Post Office.\u2014The new General Post Office stands close to Victoria Terminus, fronting Fort street, and is arranged with the object of affording the staff every facility for dealing quickly with the enormous volume of postal traffic. The chief feature of the building is the central hall which rises throughout the height of the building to the great dome, surmounting the structure. The style of the building is Indo-Saracenic, and the materials used are local basalt with dressings of yellow stone from Kurla and white stone from Dhrangadra. It was designed by Mr. John Begg, lately Consulting Architect to Government. The ground floor accommodates the inland and foreign parcel departments, registration and mail departments; the first floor contains the savings bank, correspondence and accounts departments; while on the second floor are the offices of the Postmaster-General, the dead letter office, and the residential quarters of the Presidency Postmaster.\n\nGolf Club (Royal Bombay).\u2014The Royal Bombay Golf Club was founded on the 9th January 1842, at a meeting held under the direction of Mr. H. H. Glass of the Civil Service. In August of that year the Secretary, Dr. G. Buist, received a letter from the Secretary of the Blackheath Golf Club, which after congratulating Bombay golfers upon the establishment of a club, informed the committee that the Captain of the Bombay Club should consider himself ex-officio an honorary member of the Blackheath Golf Club. The letter also expressed a hope that Bombay would in time be in a position to send a\n\n---\n\n1 For further details of the Anjuman's Atesh Behram and this Agiari, see \"Times of India\" of October 15th, 1897 and of November 6th, 1891.\n\n2 The present (1909) General Post Office stands opposite the Public Works Secretariat on the Esplanade.\ndeputation to compete upon the Blackheath links, to which Dr. Buist replied in humorous terms, pointing out *inter alia* that the first printed notice of the game as played in Bombay had been despatched to England by the same packet which carried General Pollock's account of the forcing of the Khyber Pass and Sir Robert Sale's victory at Jellalabad. In 1843 Dr. Buist sent a second letter to the Blackheath Golf Club, informing the members that a medal, which the Bombay Club had decided to present to their Blackheath brethren, had been despatched by steamer in July and appeared to have been lost in the wreck of the *Memnon*, and that therefore he was dispatching a duplicate medal for presentation to the Club. This medal, for which an annual competition is held, is still in the possession of the Blackheath Club.\n\nFor about five years the Bombay Golf Club flourished, but disappeared about 1848, and was not resuscitated until 1855. The revival was however only temporary, owing to the departure from India of the \"keener players,\" and in 1861 the club, bereft of most of its members, died a natural death. For the following nine years no club existed; but on the 16th November 1869, Messrs. Robert Stevenson (of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank) and Edward Morris (of the Agra Bank), in concert with others, reconstituted the club under the title of the Royal Bombay Golf Club. In 1875 the Club was amalgamated with the Bombay Gymkhana, and has flourished steadily ever since, the only check to its prosperity having occurred in 1886-87, when the eastern and northern portion of the course was taken up for buildings. This disability, however, was subsequently obviated by the extension of the course to the western portion of the *maidan*. The following trophies are annually competed for by the members of the Club:\u2014The \"Forty-two\" silver medal, struck in commemoration of the foundation of the club; the Blackheath Gold medal, presented in 1856 by the Royal Blackheath Golf Club; the Wimbledon cup, presented by the London Scottish Golf Club in 1878; the Calcutta medal, presented by the Calcutta Golf Club in 1881; the Madras medal, presented by the Madras\n\n---\n\n* Chronicles of Blackheath Golfers by W. E. Hughes.\nGolf Club in 1882; the Golfer's cup, subscribed for by members in 1891; the Macdonald cup, presented by Dr. Macdonald in 1897; and the St. Andrew's gold and silver medals and the St. George's gold and silver medals presented annually by the Bombay Gymkhana.\n\nGovernment Central Press.\u2014The Government Central Press is situated next door to the Custom House in a building originally used as a hydraulic cotton press, and was organized in 1872 by Mr. Kingsmill, the former Superintendent of the Education Society's Press at Byculla. Departmental printing-presses had been introduced into the Secretariat in 1860, and these were amalgamated twelve years later into the Central Press, which was at that date housed in the Town Barracks (now the Supply and Transport Offices) in Bazaar Gate street. On Government vacating the Old Secretariat and in response to a demand of the Military authorities for the restoration of the Town Barracks, the Central Press was removed to the Old Secretariat, now known as Sardar's Buildings. Here it remained until the sale of the building in 1888, when Government decided to erect a special building for it near the new Secretariat. This building, now the Elphinstone College, was however not allotted to the Press, which eventually found accommodation in its present quarters in Custom House road. The question of moving the press to Yeraoda near Poona is now under consideration.\n\nEstablished for the printing of Government orders and documents only, the Press issues all Government reports, notifications, the weekly Government Gazette, the Bombay series of Indian Law Reports, and special forms, financial and otherwise. Large quantities of standard Government forms used to be printed at the Central Press, but are now produced at the Yeraoda Jail Press in Poona. The Press is in charge of a Superintendent aided by two trained Deputy Superintendents, employs about 670 hands, and is divided into the following departments:\u2014machine and press, reading, composing, binding and folding, and clerical. A branch press, under the supervision of an Assistant Superintendent and employing 150 hands, is maintained in the Secretariat for the printing of urgent\nGovernment notifications, resolutions and proceedings; while a stereo and type foundry, instituted in 1889, supplies both presses with all type. In 1907 the Government Central Book Depot was abolished and the Superintendent, Central Press, now undertakes the stocking, sale and despatch of Government and other publications including the Sanskrit series which were ultimately transferred to the old medical stores building in 1908. Up to the year 1873, the compositors were paid a monthly wage, after which the piece-work system was introduced. This at the outset caused a strike among the employ\u00e9s but on the authorities importing fresh hands from Madras, they returned to duty, and have worked on the piece-work system ever since. In 1887, the existence of the Government Central Press was jeopardised by a proposal to give all work on contract to local private presses; but after the receipt of a report by a special Committee, Government decided to retain the press. The same question was again considered in 1909; and after enquiry it was found to be more economical to retain the press. The employ\u00e9s of the Central Press include Hindus, Muhammadans, Parsis, Bene-Israel and Native Christians, of whom the Parsis are the most efficient compositors, and the Hindus are the most capable employ\u00e9s in the foundry. Members of these two communities share the work of proof-reading and examination with the Native Christians in equal proportion. Among the Hindus, the Maratha predominates, the balance being composed of Brahmans, Bhandaris, Vanis, Sonars, Kasars, Telis, Shimpis, Kumbhars and Kolis. The average monthly earnings of a piece-work compositor are about Rs. 27; of those in the press and machine department from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20, while folders and binders earn from Rs. 5 to Rs. 34; and the employ\u00e9s in the foundry from Rs. 5 to Rs. 60 a month.\n\nThe following statement shows the financial results of the working of the Government Central Press (in thousands of rupees) at various periods since 1873-74:\n\n| Year    | Income | Expenditure | Year    | Income | Expenditure |\n|---------|--------|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|\n| 1873-74 | Rs. 2,60 | Rs. 1,79     | 1903-04 | Rs. 4,48 | Rs. 3,48     |\n| 1883-84 | Rs. 3,56 | Rs. 2,27     | 1905-06 | Rs. 5,20 | Rs. 3,41     |\n| 1893-94 | Rs. 3,95 | Rs. 2,83     | 1908-09 | Rs. 4,39 | Rs. 3,42     |\nGovernment Houses.\u2014The earliest Government residence was Bombay Castle, which was named by the Portuguese \"the Great House.\" In 1626 it was described as warehouse, priory and fort, and contained a square house which served the Portuguese as a place of retreat till relieved by troops from outside. The Dutch and English burned it in October of that year; but in 1634 it still served as the residence of the Lord of the Manor and was well protected at his own expense. It was this house which the Arabs partially destroyed in 1661, so that, according to Aungier, when the English took possession of it \"there was little more than the walls left.\" Shortly after the cession of Bombay, the house was put into repair, and by 1673 Dellon, the French traveller, described it as \"a fine fort in which the English President generally resides.\" Several writers, namely Hamilton, Grose, Ives and Valentia have described the Castle in detail; and it was in the Fort House that Grose had supper with William Wake, the Governor, in 1750. It is marked \"Governor's House\" in his map of Bombays, and now faces the visitor as he enters the gate of the old Bombay Arsenal with a board upon it inscribed \"Pattern Room.\" It lies behind the Town Hall and between the Mint and the Custom House.\n\n1 All Government Resolutions and orders are addressed even to this day from \"Bombay Castle.\"\n\n2 When the English took possession of this island, they found, in that part of it which chiefly commands the harbour, an old fortified house, the residence of the Portuguese Governor, and though this house might have served for other valuable uses, they were tempted to make of it the centre house of the Castle, which they built round it. It is, however, impossible to conceive in every sense a more inconvenient structure and the same or perhaps less cost than the reparations and additions have stood into the Company would have built a much better mansion now from the ground. For the false economy of preserving this old piece of building, which needs only to have been demolished or thrown away, had such effect that it hindered the English not only from consulting a more commanding position to the harbour, which is that of Mendham's Point but made them blind to the disadvantage of the Fort, built round it, being overlooked by an eminence near it called the Dungharee Point, on which there is only a small untenable little fort of no defence which serves now for the town prison for debtors or criminals.\"\u2014Grose.\n\n3 See plate facing p. 32 of Vol. I.\n\n4 Douglas's Bombay and Western India, Vol. I. pp. 138, 139.\nIn 1757 the Bombay Government on the advice of Capt. De Funck decided that most, if not all the upper part of the Fort House must be pulled down, and resolved to purchase Mr. John Spencer's house in Apollo street. This house was purchased in the same year by Government and transformed into Government House. It was known as \"New House\" until 1767, and after that as the \"Company's House\" or the \"President's House.\" In this house Governor Jonathan Duncan died in 1811; and after that date the Governors gradually discarded it as a residence in favour of Parel, which became a hot-weather residence about 1750, and of Malabar Point. In 1829 it ceased to be Government House and became the Secretariat, the Governor's residence having been removed to Parel. It continued to be occupied by the Secretariat till 1873, and was known for a long time after the removal of the Secretariat from it as the \"Old Secretariat.\" It was sold by Government in 1886 and on its site stand at present the buildings known as the \"Sardar's Palace Buildings.\" It is of this Government House Bishop Heber in 1825 wrote:\u2014\"Though large and convenient, it is little used except for holding Councils, public darbars, and the despatch of business. It is a spacious dismal looking building, like many of the large houses in Bombay, looking like a Stadthouse in a Free German City.\" Valentia had described it a few years earlier (1802-06) as a handsome building with several good apartments, but inconvenient by reason of the largest apartment on both floors being a passage to other rooms.\n\nAt the date of Fryer's visit to Bombay, a church and convent belonging to the Jesuits stood on the site of Government House at Parel. The principal establishment of the Society was at Bandora, where they had also a college, which was defended like a fortress with seven cannons,\n\n---\n\n1 According to a statement at p. 50 of the Monthly Miscellany for 1850, Parel is a shortened form of Non-Pareil the Peerless. This, whether intentional or otherwise, is nothing more than one of the meaning-making family of jokes. The joke may possibly have been suggested by Neibhur's French remark, 1763-64, Voyage II, 12, that in the whole of India there is nothing equal \"point de\nbesides small arms. When Bombay was ceded to the English, the Bandora college claimed much land and various rights in the island. On the claims being disallowed, the Jesuits threatened a resort to arms and went so far as to assist the Sidi in his successful invasion of the island in 1689-90. As a punishment, when the war was\n\npareille' to Parel's splendid dining and ball rooms. Compare Hobson-Jobson, \u00a742. In 1554 the name Parel, with Verella (Vadala), Varel (Varli) and Siva (Sion), occurs in Botelho's list of Aldras or hamlets under the town of Mahim. Compare Hobson-Jobson, \u00a713. There seems no reason to doubt that the name of the house is taken from the name of the village. The probable origin of the village name is the tree Paral or Padel (Heterophragma Melonoides or Bignonia Suaveolens) the Tree Trumpet Flower.\n\nIn support of this derivation, Mr. A. Cumine, I.C.S., noticed that Parel is the centre of a group of tree names. East lies Vadala, the Banyan Grove, south Chinchpokli, the Tamarind Dell, west Mingut Mandli, the Prickly-pear tract, and north Madmala, the cocoa-palm orchard, now known as the Mahim Woods. Beyond this group are Kambala hill, apparently the grove of Kamal or Kamal, also called Shimti (Odina Wodiar); Byculla, Bhaya-khala, the Cassia fistula Level, bhaya being a local Kunbi form of bawa; Umarkhadi, the fig tree creek; Babula tank near the Jamsetji Hospital and Babulnath on the east slope of Malabar Hill called after the Babul or Acacia Arabica; Planasvadi, the jack garden in Bhuleshwar; Bhendi Bazar, from its row of Bhendis, (Hibiscus populnea), north of Paldoni; Sattad, the seven brabs, and Vadachi Gadi, the banyan shop row in the Old Town; Ghinchi Bandar, the tamarind, landing below Nowroji Hill, and Amli-agal (in front of the tamarind) the bullock drivers' name for Elphinstone Circle from the old tamarind at the north-east corner of the Cathedral.\u2014Bombay Gazetteer Vol. XXVI, Pt. III, page 595.\n\nAnother equally plausible derivation of \"Parel\" is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"The early history of our island is, as Dr. da Cunha remarks, closely interwoven with the history of its temples; and it is admitted by all that, some time after Bhimdev's immigration, a Prabhu, named Mankoji founded a shrine in Parel village, and perpetuated his name in the title of the deity, who is known as \"Mankeshwar\" or Mankoji's god in these days. It is extremely unlikely that the Panchkalshis should have possessed no shrines, peculiar to their community. Moreover it is stated as a fact that they built three temples under the patronage of the Raja, two for their family deities Wageshwari and Chandika, and a third to Mahadev. Now the \"lingam\" of this Mahadev is said to be Swayambhu or non-artificial, and was therefore held to be of equal importance and sanctity with the celebrated \"ling\" of Vaijanath at Parali in the Deccan. Therefore the third temple which the Panchkalshis built was called the shrine of Parali Vaijanath Mahadev; and as the deity's title was Vaijnath Mahadev, the first portion of the title was given to the village in which his temple stood. The present temple of Mahadev, which is stated to rest on the exact site of the original temple, stands in the middle of the \"Paral,\" \"Paral,\" or \"Parel\" village.\u2014\"The Rise of Bombay,\" by S. M. Edwardes, p. 34.\nover, all their property on the island, including the monastery and lands at Parel, was confiscated. In 1720 the building was alienated from its original use, and from that date Parel House was used as an occasional residence up to 1829, and thereafter until 1883 as the permanent residence of the Governors of Bombay.\n\nOf Government House, Parel, Grose writes in 1750:\n\n\"At Parel the Governor has a very agreeable country house, which was originally a Romish chapel belonging to the Jesuits, but confiscated about 1719 for some foul practices against the English interest. It is now converted into a pleasant mansion house and what with the additional buildings and improvements of the gardens, affords a spacious and commodious habitation. There is an avenue to it of a hedge and trees near a mile long; and though near the seaside, is sheltered from the air of it by a hill between. Here the Governor may spend most part of the heats, the air being cooler and fresher than in town; and nothing is wanting that may make a country retirement agreeable.\"\n\nMr. W. Hornby (1776) was the first Governor who took up his residence in the Parel House. His name is inscribed on a small tablet on the walls. Records show that dances and balls used to be held at this house on the birthday of H. M. King George III and of the Queen Consort, annually on the 4th of June and the 18th of January respectively. About 1803, Sir James Mackintosh, then Recorder of Bombay, writes: \"We live about 5 miles of excellent road over a flat from our capital. We inhabit by the Governor's kindness his official country house, a noble building with some magnificent apartments and with two delightful rooms for my library, in which I am now writing, overlooking a large garden of fine parkish ground.\" \"In 1804 the Governor (Jonathan Duncan) gave a grand ball at Parel, when that sheet of water, to which succeeding generations of wearied dancers have repaired to recruit the exhausted energies, became a fairy scene of gorgeous fireworks, which blazed away far into the night and early morning over the faces of fair women and brave men.\"\n\nThe original building was enlarged and embellished by Mountstuart Elphinstone (1819-27). Heber in his\n\n1 \"Glimpses of Old Bombay\" by James Douglas, page 15.\n\"Narrative of a Journey through India,\" (1838) describes the appearance of Parel House as \"very handsome, having a fine staircase and two noble rooms, one over the other, of 75 or 80 feet long, very handsomely furnished.\"\n\n\"The lower of these\" he continues \"which is the dining room, is said to have been an old and desecrated church belonging to a Jesuit College, which had fallen into the hands of a Parsi, from whom it was purchased by Government about sixty years ago. Behind the house is a moderate-sized old fashioned garden in which is planted a slip of the willow, which grows on Bonaparte's grave. Adjoining is a small paddock or rather yard, full of different kinds of deer, who are fed like sheep by hand, and another little yard containing some wild animals.\"\n\nThe latter included \"a royal tiger, stretched at his ease in a cage\", a tiger cat, a porcupine, an ostrich, and an orang-outang. The house was repaired during the r\u00e9gime of Viscount Falkland (1850). Sir Seymour Fitzgerald and Sir Philip Wodehouse also had the house repaired and refurnished in good style. It was during the latter Governor's r\u00e9gime that H. R. H. the Prince of Wales (His Late Majesty King Edward VII) occupied a room in the building from the 8th to 15th November 1875.\n\nThe chief receptions held in this house were those in honour of H. R. H. the Duke of Edinburgh in 1870, of the officers of the French frigate L'Artemis in 1838, of the king of Siam in 1872, and of the Archduke Ferdinand in 1893.\n\nSir Richard Temple refused to live at Parel, because the house was so much out of the way, and he transferred his head-quarters to Malabar Point. Sir James Fergusson, who followed Sir Richard, occupied Government House, Parel, in November 1880. In his time all the rooms at Parel were called by the names of towns. Thus one room was known as Madras, another as Agra, the third as Lahore, etc., the names being painted over the doors in half-inch letters. The rooms in the Aide-de-Camps' bungalow were named Aden, Zanzibar, Kandahar, Quetta, Sibi and Khelat. In 1883 Lady Fergusson died of cholera in the house. This house, which was the permanent residence\n\n---\n\n1 Mrs. Elwood's Narrative of an Overland Journey to India, 1830.\nof the Governor from 1849, was abandoned after the term of office of Sir James Fergusson (1880\u20141885). After this, the house was offered to the Municipal Commissioner for the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute. In 1897 the advent of plague suggested its use as a convenient hospital and within its walls hundreds of plague patients were treated in 1897-98. In August 1899 the Plague Research Laboratory was removed thither, the opening ceremony of the laboratory being performed by Lord Sandhurst. The house continues up to now to be occupied by the laboratory, which has since been styled \"The Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory.\" The garden in the compound of the house is very spacious and well looked after. The house and ground have been vested in the City of Bombay Improvement Trust under section 60 (1) of Act IV of 1898, at a valuation of Rs. 9,91,407 and are dealt with by that body under the provisions of the Act.\n\nThis very agreeable resort, known as Marine Villa in old records, is pleasantly situated on the summit of Malabar Point, a bold promontory which runs out into the ocean on the western side of the island. It commands a splendid view of the greater part of the island. On this part of the hill there stood about 1774 a lofty tower, in which Raghunathrao passed the period of his exile from Poona and whence he sallied forth occasionally to pass through the holy cleft (Shri Gundi) at Malabar Point. The ruins of this tower have been noticed by Maria Graham in her Journal of a Residence in India 1813. In Price's memorials (1839) it is stated that Malabar Point was the occasional retreat of the Governor, General Medows, Sir Evan Nepean, who was Governor of Bombay from 1812 to 1819, had a small room at Malabar Point, and his successor the Hon'ble Mountstuart Elphinstone (1819\u20141827) erected a bungalow, which Heber describes as \"a very pretty cottage in a beautiful situation on a rocky and woody promontory and actually washed by the sea spray.\" Lady Falkland, wife of Viscount Falkland (Governor, 1848 to 1853), was very fond of Malabar Point, and it is said that she spent one or two hot seasons here. Malabar Point, which was in use for many years more or less as a hot weather or occasional\nresidence, became the permanent residence of the Governors of Bombay after the abandonment of Parel House at the end of Sir James Fergusson's term of office (1880-1885), and it being the only residence in Bombay available for the Governor much money has been spent from time to time in making it suitable for the purpose. A dining-hall, billiard room, porch and verandah were constructed in 1868; considerable alterations were made in 1877, and many improvements and additions have been made since that date. H. R. H. the Prince of Wales (now H. M. King George the Fifth) stayed here in 1905.\n\nAt present Government House consists of a number of good bungalows, besides the residence of the Governor, which are used for various purposes including the accommodation of the officers on the staff of the Governor and of the offices of the Private and Military Secretaries. Quarters are also provided in the grounds for servants, bandsmen, clerks of the Private and Military Secretaries, and others. The entrance lodge was built by Sir Seymour Fitzgerald. After ascending Walkeshwar road one notices half way up, a winding lower road leading to Government House, which together with the upper road is lined with well-tended trees, shrubs and creepers. The lower road was first constructed by Lord Elphinstone (1853-1860) and was widened in 1869, in which year were also constructed the lodges at the entrance of the road. The drive along this road affords charming glimpses of Bombay. The House has a bandstand, which is situated on the east side of the dining hall. It also boasts of an extensive garden, which is under the superintendence of an expert European gardener specially appointed to supervise the Government House gardens both in Bombay and Poona. A flagstaff 100 ft. in height stands at Government House, and a flag is kept floating on it all the time that the Governor is in residence. It may be noted that a small fort has been built here in connection with the harbour defences and is guarded with heavy artillery. Government House is almost uninhabitable during the monsoon as Malabar\n\n---\n\n1 The old Malabar Hill battery was recently relinquished by the Military Department, and the site has been made into a lawn.\nPoint is exposed to the full fury of the wind and waves; but during the rest of the year it is a far more agreeable residence than Parel. Electric lights and fans were installed throughout the house in 1908-09.\n\nGovernment Veterinary College:\u2014The history of the Government Veterinary College at Parel is closely interwoven with that of the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital. When the question of establishing the latter was mooted, the Bombay Government asked the trustees to attach a Veterinary College to the hospital and offered to treat gratuitously all animals lodged in the hospital. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals agreed to the proposal on certain conditions (see article on the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals), and in 1886 the Veterinary College was established on the Hospital premises. But in 1906 Government bought for one lakh of rupees the adjoining premises belonging to Mr. Framji B. Jeejeebhoy and there erected a suitable College at a cost of Rs. 94,490. A hostel for the accommodation of 78 students has also been built at a cost of Rs. 81,921 on the same premises. The College building contains a large museum, library and chemical laboratory and three lecture rooms. The College authorities have in their charge the Sir Dinshaw Manekji Petit pathobacteriological laboratory, pharmacy and shoeing shed.\n\nThe special objects of the College are the training of competent native practitioners for the subordinate Government Veterinary service, for service in Native States, and for special posts under municipalities and district local boards. The Principal is the administrative head of the institution, and is subject to the control of the Director of Public Instruction. The appointments of Principal and Assistant Principal are held by officers of the Civil Veterinary Department. The staff comprises three teachers, who are graduates of the College, and a shoeing-smith instructor who is a pensioned European farrier-sergeant. Students, who have passed the Matri-\n\n---\n\n1 In the first year 60 pupils entered the College, of whom 28 were Parsis, 27 were Hindus and the rest were Musalmans, Jews, Europeans and Eurasians.\nulation or School Final examination, or who pass the College entrance test (which is equivalent to the 6th English standard), are admitted to the College, and after a full course of study, present themselves for an examination, which, if successfully passed, entitles them to the diploma of G. B. V. C. or \"Graduate of the Bombay Veterinary College.\" The College fee is Rs. 60 per annum. Twenty-one Government scholarships valued at Rs. 15 each, tenable for three years, are awarded to the sons of landholders or others engaged in agricultural pursuits. The college is now (1909) attended by 106 students.\n\nDuring the twenty-four years that the College has been in existence, 236 students obtained the diploma, and practically all of them have obtained employment under Government, local bodies, or Native States. Some have prospered as private practitioners in and outside India. The average annual expenditure of the College, including the salaries of the teaching staff, for the last ten years was nearly Rs. 47,520, and the average income from students' fees for the same period was Rs. 3,739. During the decade the Bombay Municipal Corporation contributed annually Rs. 2,500 towards the maintenance of the College.\n\nGymkhana.\u2014Among the chief clubs for out-door recreation are the Bombay, Hindu, Parsi and Islam Gymkhanas. The Bombay Gymkhana for European residents was instituted on the 19th June 1875, as the result of a meeting of members of various sporting clubs held in the office of Messrs. W. Nicol & Co. Prior to that date any one desirous of boating, pigeon-shooting or playing out-door games was obliged to become a member of several separate clubs, and it was not till 1872 that the amalgamation of these clubs into a single central Gymkhana was agreed upon and a site for a pavilion obtained from Government. As a result of the meeting of 1875, a pavilion was erected at an initial cost of Rs. 18,000 on the open ground adjoining the junction of Esplanade and Waudby roads, and the hockey and football club, the golf club, cricket club, gun club and boat club were all within a short period affiliated to the new Gymkhana.\nThe first President of the Gymkhana was the Honourable Mr. Lyttelton Bayley, and the number of members enrolled in 1875 was 150, which has now (1909) increased to 2,982. The pavilion was subsequently enlarged at a cost of Rs. 7,000; but, having been found insufficient for the needs of the club, it was recently replaced by a new double-storeyed pavilion facing the cricket ground, which was completed in September 1907, and opened by the Governor of Bombay in the following December. The Gymkhana contains a racquet-court built in 1882 between the Gymkhana Chambers and Mr. Tata's residence. Under the auspices of the club, a Rugby Football Tournament, Athletic and Sporting Meetings and Tennis and Racquet Tournaments are annually held, while the management of the Aga Khan Hockey Tournament and the annual Presidency Cricket Match are also vested in it.\u00b9 The Hindu Gymkhana, more correctly styled the Parmanandas Jivandas Hindu Gymkhana, arose out of a Hindu cricket club, established in 1878, the members of which paid the modest subscription of 2 annas a month. In 1892, during the Governorship of Lord Harris, the Bombay Government granted the club a plot of ground on the Kennedy sea-face for cricket-pitches and for the erection of a pavilion, which was completed in 1894, together with tennis-courts and a cricket-ground at a total outlay of Rs. 24,936. This sum was largely met by handsome donations from Messrs. Gordhandas Parmanandas, Gordhandas G. Tejpal, Gordhandas Khatau, H. H. the Maharaja of Idar, H. H. the Maharaja of Darbhanga and others. The club, which started by playing matches against the local Parsi clubs, has since 1886 arranged matches with the Poona Gymkhana, the Oxford University Authentics, the Aligarh College and the European Presidency team. The number of members is 378 and the reserve fund of the club amounts to nearly Rs. 14,000. The pavilion contains an oil-painting of Lord Harris, who formally opened the Hindu Gymkhana in 1894. The Parsi Gymkhana was opened on the Kennedy sea-face near the Marine Lines station of\n\n\u00b9 For a more detailed account see a pamphlet \"The Bombay Gymkhana Club,\" issued by the Managing Committee.\nthe Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway in 1888, prior to which date the club had contented itself with a tent pitched on the open ground opposite the Wellington fountain. Cricket and tennis grounds were laid out and a pavilion was erected, which was in 1900 replaced by the existing pavilion at a cost of Rs. 40,000. Besides facilities for outdoor sports, the pavilion contains a good billiard table, and the club generally supervises and arranges all matters appertaining to Parsi cricket and athletics. The number of members is about 300, and the invested funds of the club amount to Rs. 8,000.\n\nThe Islam Gymkhana, also situated on the Kennedy sea-face between the Parsi and Hindu Gymkhanas, was established by subscriptions from the Bombay Muhammadan community in 1892; the pavilion, cricket and tennis grounds being completed in the following year. Billiards and chess are played in the pavilion. The total number of members is about 250.\n\nThe Ladies' Gymkhana was established on January 1st, 1879. It is managed by a committee consisting of an honorary lady president, a working gentleman president, an honorary lady vice president, a gentleman as honorary secretary and treasurer and six ladies and six gentlemen. The wives of the various Governors of Bombay have honoured the gymkhana by accepting the post of honorary lady president. The number of members as present (1910) is 289, of whom about 135 use the gymkhana during some portion of the year. There are four tennis courts and three badminton courts which are well patronized throughout the year. The latter are in a covered shed and have lately been lighted by electricity. There is also a pavilion built in 1896. Another attraction is the beautiful garden and the magnificent view of Back Bay and the City of Bombay seen from the pavilion terrace and two balconies in the garden. During the cold weather subscription dances are sometimes held, or the place is lent by the committee to members for private dances, the centre badminton court having been laid with a dancing floor.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Recently a Commercial Gymkhana and the Princess Victoria Mary Ladies' Gymkhana have been opened. The latter counts\nHigh Court.\u2014In 1670 the administration of justice was in the hands of Justices who held their sittings in the Custom Houses of Bombay and Mahim, the former being situated near the present (1909) Town Barracks. In 1675, when a Judge was appointed, a house was taken as a Court of Judicature, and about a year later Government decided to buy, for the use of the Court, the Deputy-Governor's house, which was at that date the property of a Portuguese lady. Part of this building still exists within the Castle. The house however was never used, and the Judge continued in his original hired quarters until 1677, when the Court was housed in Mapla Por. Mapla Por owed its existence to Gerald Aungier's proposal in 1671 to build a \"Fair Common House wherein might be also appointed chambers for the Courts of Justice, warehouses or granaries for corn and ammunition, as also prisons for several offenders,\" all these buildings to be located in the large enclosure on the west side of Bohra Bazaar street. In 1677 the work of building this Court of Judicature was so far advanced that Government deemed it unnecessary to use the house of the Deputy-Governor. The new court-house also served as a Town Hall, where sessions were held, and probably as an Admiralty Court, of which Dr. St. John was appointed Judge in 1684. In 1676, in consequence of the Company's displeasure at the heavy charges incurred in erecting new buildings at Bombay, President Aungier offered to take the Court-house on to his account, provided that the Company allowed him a reasonable rent for its use as a hall of justice and prison. This arrangement seems to have been carried out and continued until 1720. In 1720 rent-free accommodation was provided for a Court and Town Hall in Bazaar Gate out of the forfeited estate of Rama Kamati.\n\nFrom 1720 to 1786, when the Bazaar Gate Town Hall was sold, the Courts of Justice continued to hold their sittings in Rama Kamati's buildings, though for the use of the quarter-sessions during the latter years of this\n\nboth European and Indian Ladies among its members. Both these Gymkhana are situated on the open ground to the north of Wodehouse Bridge, parallel to the Oval. A Japanese Gymkhana has also been opened in the same locality.\nperiod, private buildings, such as the theatre, were occasionally rented. After the sale of Rama Kamati's Court-house and Town Hall in 1786, accommodation had to be provided for the Mayor's Court and its records. At a consultation of the 24th August, 1786, Government directed the land-paymaster to appropriate a dry and secure room in the back part of the large house rented of Mr. Hornby, that is the present Great Western Hotel, for the lodgment of the records of the Honourable the Mayor's Court. In reply to the Court's disapproval of this arrangement and their request for some more suitable place, the Board on the 30th August 1786 resolved that the Mayor's Court be acquainted that Government had come to a determination of building a new Town Hall, and that until the new hall was finished, the Court would be accommodated with a room in the house rented of Mr. Hornby, if convenient to them. Until March 1788, the Mayor's Court continued to occupy the room in Mr. Hornby's house, which was then known as Admiralty House; and on the 17th of that month Government offered the Court a set of rooms in the bandar, that is the present Town Customs House. This proposal was disapproved by the Mayor's Court, which decided that it would be highly derogatory to its dignity to sit there. After some correspondence Government decided on the 25th March to give the Court accommodation in a portion of the Marine House, at that time occupied by the Secretary to the Marine Board. After the arrival of Sir William Syer, the first Recorder, the Recorder's Court for some time held its sittings in Colonel Jones' house in Marine street, which is now (1909) represented by the Port Trust Apollo bonded warehouses; but in 1800, in consequence of numerous inconveniences, the Court asked Mr. Maister to let them the Admiralty House or present Great Western Hotel at a fixed rent, to which Mr. Maister, on behalf of Mr. Hornby, agreed. In 1879 the Court, which in 1824 was styled the Supreme Court and in 1862\n\n---\n\n1 The site of this theatre is now occupied partly by the Elphinstone Circle and partly by the road in front of Messrs Kemp & Co.\n\n2 The old Sadr Adalat or appellate court was housed in the bungalow of Byramji Jiljiboy, east of the J. J. Hospital. In 1838 it was called Claremont and was occupied by the civil auditor.\nwas named the High Court, was removed from Hornby House to the present (1909) High Court buildings on the Esplanade.\n\nThe High Court is situated between the University Buildings in and the Public Works Secretariat and is 562 feet in length by 187 in breadth. Its general height to the east is 90 feet, and the central feature is 178\u00bd feet in height. The building, which is early English-Gothic, was designed by Colonel J. A. Fuller, R.E., and was completed at a cost of Rs. 16,44,528. The walls are of rubble and chunam faced with blue basalt roughly dressed and in shallow courses.\u00b9 The Judges have two private staircases on the western side of the building in the octagon towers on either side of the porch. The main staircase and entrance for the general public are on the east. The Sessions Court is decorated in cream and gold and contains, among other portraits, one of Sir John Peter Grant, which was subscribed for by the people of Bombay. Electric lights and fans have now (1910) been installed throughout the building.\n\nHotels and Taverns.\u2014Prior to 1845 Bombay contained no hotel worthy the name, but a large number of low-class taverns. Viscount Valentia, speaking of Bombay at the opening of the 19th century, remarked the evil influence which \"the Tavern\" exercised upon newly joined cadets, and Mrs. Graham mentioned the same place in 1813 as being quite unfit for the reception of ladies. Twenty-two years later Fontanier wrote:\u2014\"Il n'y avait qu'un seul hotel \u00e0 Bombay, et j'y pris une chambre; mais on ne pouvait y vivre autrement qu'en public. La chaleur \u00e9tait extr\u00eame lorsqu'on restait dans un appartement ferm\u00e9. Les d\u00e9penses d'ailleurs \u00e9taient \u00e9normes.\"\u00b2 But in the year 1837, the Hope Hall Family Hotel was opened at Mazagon, which for many years served as the principal hotel in Bombay. In 1844 Bombay still contained an enormous number of taverns, particularly in the neigh-\n\n\u00b9 For complete constructional details see General Administration Report, 1875-76.\n\u00b2 This was the Victoria Hotel, which Mrs. Postans (1838) described as situated in the narrowest and dirtiest street in the Fort. Prior to 1837 there were no proper hotels in Bombay. Tents on the Esplanade were given on hire.\nbourhood of Sonapur, which were known by such names as \"Parsi George's,\" \"Portuguese George's,\" \"Rustomji's,\" \"Paddy Goose's,\" \"Goward's,\" \"Byramji's\" (a large house on the beach), and the \"Racquet Court tavern.\" These, however, gradually disappeared: Pallonji's Adelphi Hotel at Byculla was well patronized in 1859. In 1864 Mr. Watson purchased ground from Government at auction for Rs. 110 per square yard and built the Esplanade Hotel, which has recently been sold by auction. At the present date (1909) Bombay contains 13 hotels, 43 refreshment rooms, 1,839 eating-houses, 494 tea and coffee shops, 70 cold-drink shops, 114 boarding and lodging houses and 36 boarding-houses, which are controlled by the Police under section 21 of Act IV of 1902. The chief European hotels are the Taj Mahal on the Apollo bandar, the Great Western and the Apollo Hotels. The Taj Mahal Hotel accommodates about 400 guests.\n\nIce-House.\u2014The old ice-house of Bombay, which stands next to the Great Western Hotel and opposite the entrance of the Government Dockyard, was built by subscription in 1843. In September 1834 the first consignment of ice was received from America by the firm of Jehangir Nasarwanji Wadia, and the first Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy was the pioneer in introducing the use of ice at dinner-parties. This resulted in a movement for the regular supply of ice from America, in the collection of a fund of Rs. 10,000 for the construction of an ice-house, and finally in an arrangement with Mr. Tudor of Boston, U. S. A., for the despatch of regular consignments. Apparently Mr. Tudor did not find the business a paying one, and by 1857 great difficulty was experienced in finding ships to carry ice to Bombay. This led to the payment of very high freights, which, coupled with heavy landing-charges at Bombay, put an almost complete check upon\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Times, 25th May 1844.\n2 For further details see Douglas' Bombay and Western India, Vol I., pp. 68-72.\n3 A few days later the Bombay Samachar reported that both Sir Jamsetji and his guests had caught very bad colds as the result of the innovation. The retail price of ice at this date was 4 annas per lb.\nthe importation of ice. In July 1877, for example, a memorial was presented to H. E. the Governor by a deputation of leading citizens, begging that the Bombay Government would \"institute a searching enquiry into the cause of the ice-famine of 1876 and 1877, and would ensure a reliable and steady supply of that useful commodity.\" With the introduction of ice-manufacturing machines, the ice-house fell into disuse and is now used as a godown.\n\nMahim Shrine.\u2014The most noteworthy feature of Mahim in these days is the shrine of the Muhammadan Saint Makhtum Fakih Ali Paru. The saint was of Arab origin, an ancestor of his having fled to India about A.D. 860 (A.H. 252) from the clutches of Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, the tyrannical governor of Basra and surrounding districts. Some five hundred years later the saint was born, and after spending several years of his youth in travel and study is alleged to have been appointed law-officer to the Muhammadans of Mahim. He acquired a well-merited reputation for piety and learning, his chief work being a commentary on the Koran, which is still held in high esteem by the Sunni Musalmans of India. His death occurred in 1431 (A.H. 835); and a mosque and shrine were forthwith built to his memory, which, repaired and enlarged in 1674 (A.H. 1085) and improved by the addition of verandahs in 1748 (A.H. 1162), exist in Mahim to the present day.\n\nThe tomb, which is built of stone and mortar coated with white cement, stands amid trees about one hundred and fifty yards from the sea-shore. To the east of it is a two-storeyed nagarkhana or drum-house, with four arches on the ground-floor, the roof of which is surmounted by a green flag; and to the north of the tomb is the mosque. A very large bor-tree (Zizyphus jujuba), which stands between the shrine and the mosque, is stated to have grown from seed brought from Arabia and planted in this spot by the saint; while in the shady ground to\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Times, 25-6-1860, 26-7-45, 4-7-1877, and Mr. K.

One of these tombs, which is surmounted by a wooden canopy and is greatly venerated, is that of a certain Syed Amin, who came to Bombay about thirty years ago from Medina, where he acted as a muallim, and in response to an inspired message from the saint ended his life at Mahim. The main shrine or dargah stands on a masonry plinth about 60 feet square, and has two entrances, one on the east with a flight of marble-paved stone steps, and a smaller entrance on the west. The central chamber or shrine is surrounded by an open verandah of pointed arches, about 15 feet high, above which unornamented walls rise to the roof crowned with a large central and four smaller domes and at each corner with a small minaret. The tomb-stone of the saint is of white alabaster, covered with a rich green brocade and surrounded by a brass railing; and over it is spread a canopy of marbled wood, thickly hung with ostrich-eggs and coloured glass globes. Slabs of white marble pave the floor; and the walls to the height of 8 feet are adorned with the same material; while the inner side of the white dome is ornamented with an Arabic inscription in gilt of recent date, which records the name of the saint and the dates of his birth and death. The great eastern door of the shrine likewise bears on its architrave a Persian sentence, worked in gilt and meaning \"the generosity of Ali hath illuminated this (spot),\" which forms a chronogram showing that the shrine in its present condition was completed in 1748 (A.H. 1162).\u00b9\n\nTo the north of the shrine is a wooden mosque and near it a very ancient step-well,\u00b2 fed by an underground stream, which is used by visitors for their ablutions. From the position of certain old graves and other mural structures which are only visible at low-tide, it appears that the shrine was originally further distant from the sea than at present: and in all probability at the time of the\n\n\u00b9 The chronogram was composed by one Kazi Hyder Sahib, who devoted the greater part of his fortune to the construction of the shrine.\n\n\u00b2 This appears to be an old Hindu well, subsequently converted into the cistern of the Musalman mosque.\nsaints' life and death the island of Mahim included a considerable portion of land now lying below sea-level.\n\nThe shrine, particularly at the date of the annual fair, is visited by Muhammadans of every class, among whom may be mentioned Sidis, Musalmans from the Konkan, Deccan, Hyderabad and Northern India, Bohras from Gujarat, Memons, Persians, Arabs, Afghans and beggars from Bokhara.\n\nThe Mahim fair is held from the 13th to the 22nd of the Musalman month of Madar, as representing the death-day of Makhtum Fakih Ali Paru. The actual period of religious celebration lasts for two days and three nights. The whole attendance at the busiest time of the fair has been roughly estimated at 120,000 people. In a dull year or when the fair falls during the monsoon months not more than 70,000 persons are present; but this number increases to 200,000 in a prosperous season. The majority of the visitors are residents of Bombay, who come partly for amusement and partly to pray before the tomb, or to make vows on such subjects as health, offspring and success in life. The visitors from other parts usually hail from Surat, Broach and Baroda, Yeola, Pajthan and Aurangabad; and a certain number come from Ajmer, Delhi and Lucknow. They stay for a week or ten days in Mahim, paying a daily visit to the mosque and the saint's tomb. During the fair the road near the shrine is lined on either side with booths, in which toys, chiefly of European make, tinware and brassware, sweetmeats and all kinds of food are sold.\n\n---\n\n1 Edwardes' Rise of Bombay. The original site of the saint's dwelling is now indicated by a white flag which stands upon a small islet invisible at high tide. Another islet, to the south of it, marked by a red flag, is stated to contain the grave of another saint, Syed Abdur Rahman.\n\n2 As the day of the saint's death is reckoned in Musalman fashion, and the fair was originally fixed in the cold season, the date of the fair passes through the Musalman months of the year.\n\n3 One of the chief customs is the drinking of water that has been waved over the tomb and the eating of ashes of incense consumed there.\n\n4 The saint has a reputation for curing cases of spirit-possession. Their friends bring the hysterical, the melancholy and other jinn ridden souls to the shrine; and the latter stay from a week to a month, praying and partaking of the sacred water. Under the influence of the holy presence of the tomb the disease gradually disappears. Cures are rare in violent seizures, which are generally referred to a more famous shrine in Gujarat.\nrefreshment are to be seen in the palmgroves, side by side with temporary shelters in which the visitors pass the day and night. The chief features of the fair are the sandals or processions, which collect in some house at a little distance from the shrine and advance to the latter spot with offerings.\u00b9 The three chief processions are that of the Bombay Police which takes place about noon on the first day of the fair; that of the Nawab of Janjira, about 3 p.m. on the same day; and lastly the shrine-procession which takes place about 12 o'clock on the same night.\n\nMasonic Hall.\u2014For many years the Masons of Bombay had no building, worthy of the craft, in which to meet. Until the year 1859 the three craft lodges in Bombay were St. George, No. 549 under England, established in 1848, Lodge Perseverance, No. 351, established under the English constitution but transferred to Scotland in 1847, and Lodge Rising Star, No. 342, established under the Scottish constitution for Parsi brethren in 1844. Lodge St. George used to meet in the houses of various brethren on Malabar hill; Lodges Perseverance and Rising Star met in rooms at Colaba. In 1859 application was made to the United Grand Lodge of England for a warrant and, on its being obtained, Lodge Concord was established in 1866. A Muhammadan brother placed a bungalow on the eastern margin of the Babula tank at\n\n\u00b9 The chief offering, which give its name to the processions, is sandal-paste. This is plastered on the saint's tomb by the faithful. The Nawab of Janjira's procession is headed by a tumbler and gymnast: after them come two devotees of the Rafai school, one of whom holds a sword with the edge pressed against his chest. They are followed by some of the Nawab's sepoys from Janjira, who fire volleys, by eight drummers and musicians, and by five men in single file bearing trays of sandal-paste and other offerings covered by silk cloths. The tail of the procession consists of several gaudily-dressed Sidi women, who sing, dance, shake rattles and wave peacock's feathers as they advance. After those who bear the offering have passed within the shrine, the musicians and Sidis wait in the street, until a feu-de-joie announces that the sandal-paste has been applied to the tomb.\n\nIn the Police procession, which starts from the Mahim Police-chauki, the trays are carried by the Sunni Musalman officers of the corps, and a few sepoys at the head of the procession perform on the long sword and fence with one another, as they move along. In other respects the arrangements for all three processions are similar.\n\nOne of the chief amusements of visitors to the fair is kite-flying on the sea-face to the west of the shrine. During the fair the chief kite-seller is said to make a considerable profit.\nthe disposal of the brethren and allowed the lodge to occupy it rent-free for about two years. As the Masonic brotherhood increased in numbers, the need of proper accommodation was more acutely felt; and a general meeting, at which all the lodges except Lodge Concord were represented, was held to discuss the question. As a result a house at the back of the J. J. Hospital was secured and funds were raised by the issue of debentures for furnishing it. In 1877 an attempt was made to locate the various masonic bodies under one roof, and Nawab's bungalow in Nesbit road, Mazagon, was taken up for this purpose in joint partnership on equal terms: but the site was not wholly satisfactory, and it remained for Mr. N. N. Wadia, C.I.E., some years later to secure by purchase from Government the site upon which the present Masonic Hall stands, giving the Masonic Committee which dealt with the matter the option of taking over the land from him at cost price within the following twelve months. The cost of the building was defrayed by subscriptions and the foundation-stone was laid by Lord Sandhurst on the 5th June 1897.\n\nThe Masonic Hall is situated to the east of the building used till a recent date as the Government Mews and to the south of the Free Church of Scotland in Waudby road. It is built in the Italian style, having brickwalls faced on the west and north with Kurla stone and window-dressings of Porbandar stone. The main hall on the first floor is 60 feet long by 30 feet broad, the banqueting-hall below being of the same dimensions. Rooms are provided in the building for the holding of chapters. The building, including the furniture, cost nearly 1\u00bd lakhs, and was designed by the late Mr. John Campbell.\n\nMint.\u2014The first mint was established by Mr. Aungier for the coinage of \"rupees, pies and bujruks\" in 1670,\n\n---\n\n1 At this date the Hon. Mr. Gibbs was D.G.M. of English Freemasonry and Captain (afterwards Sir Henry) Morland was G.M. of all Scottish Freemasonry in India.\n\n2 Bujruk or Budgroom is supposed by Sir George Birdwood to be derived from badayarnuka (\"base coin\"), equivalent to 1/12th of an anna, and identical therefore with the present pui. Yule and Burnell (Hobson-Jobson) state the Portuguese form of the word was bazaruco, and that in Van Noort's Voyage (1648) its meaning was \"bazar-money\" (from ruia, a Kanarese word for copper coin). It may be a corruption of the Persian buring (big).\nauthority for its working being granted by letters patent dated the 5th October 1676, and a Mr. Smith was sent out as Assay Master on a yearly salary of \u00a360. Two years later Jean Baptiste Tavernier remarked that \"since the present King of England married the Princess of Portugal, who had in part of her portion the famous port of Bombeye, where the English are very hard at work to build a strong fort, they coin both silver, copper and tin. But that money will not go to Surat, nor in any part of the great Mogul's dominions or in any of the territories of the Indian Kings: only it passes among the English in their fort, and some two or three leagues up in the country, and in the villages along the coast; the country people that bring them their wares being glad to take that money.\" The earliest known coins of the Bombay Mint are four rupees in the British Museum, dated 1675, 1677 and 1678. The first has on the reverse the arms of the \"old\" India Company, and the other three the Royal Arms of England. In a Bombay rupee of 1687 the Company's arms reappear on the reverse. The first coins struck in 1676 bore the Inscription \"Deo Pax\". The precise position of the old Mint cannot be determined but it stood somewhere near the Town Barracks. In 1741 the Land Pay-master complained of the risk arising from portions of the mint being thatched with palms, and in 1775 Captain DeFunck reported that the mint interfered with the castle guns and should be moved. No further references to the old mint can be traced.\n\nThe erection of the present (1910) Mint was sanctioned by the East India Company in 1823; and an inscription on the building shows that it was designed and con-\n\n---\n\n1 Bruce's Annals, 1704-8.

The first coins struck in Bombay, which bore Persian characters, are said to have been stamped in a style which offended the Mughal Emperor, and for a time the practice was discontinued.

The cost as estimated in 1874 was about 36 lakhs, of which the ground cost 12\u00bd lakhs, the building 16 lakhs, and the machinery 7\u00bd lakhs.\u00b9 The site, which measures 49,000 square yards, was originally reclaimed from the sea under the Mody Bay Reclamation scheme and lies on the east side of the island close to the Town Hall and Arsenal. The original building is quadrangular, the western side having two storeys, of which the upper contains the offices of the Mint Master and Assay Master, and the ground-floor accommodates the Bullion Department. The northern side is occupied by the Standard Melting-room, and the eastern and southern sides by the various Coining Departments and the Engine-rooms. The melting of silver bars received from tenderers, prior to their registry in the Mint, having outgrown the capacity of the furnaces in the Standard Melting-room, a large shed was erected in 1869 on a site adjoining this room and called the Premelting Department. Here all silver tendered for coinage was melted in the presence of the tenderers or their agents and a granulated sample was taken for assay. At a later date an extension was made at the north-eastern end to accommodate the general workshop for the repair and upkeep of the machinery. The Die and Medal room is also situated here. Additional space has also been provided on the east side for annealing and stamping operations; and a block has been built at the southeast corner to contain the automatic weighing machines which were introduced in 1881 to supersede weighment of single coins by hand. About the year 1908 electric lights and fans were installed throughout the Mint, additional strongholds were built in the Mint Quadrangle, a new dross washing shed, silver ringing room, nickel packing room and chimney constructed, the Rolling Department re-roofed and extensions and alterations made to the Melting Department and General Workshop.\n\n\u00b9 Bombay Town and Island Materials, III, 611.\nThe original equipment of the Mint provided for a comparatively small outturn; but successive additions and improvements have largely increased the outturn capacity which now amounts to 7\u00bd lakhs a day. This outturn can be doubled by working extra hours. The first Indian one anna nickel coin was coined in the Bombay Mint in 1907, issues being made on the 1st August of that year. It consists of 25 parts of nickel and 75 parts of copper, the weight being 60 grains or 1/3rd that of a rupee. The coin has a waved edge with 12 scollops, its greatest diameter being 21 millimetres and its least diameter 19\u00b78 millimetres. On the obverse the coin bears the effigy of His Majesty King Edward VII and the inscription \"Edward VII King and Emperor\" and on the reverse a design with an \"anna\" in the centre of an ornamental square, the value in Urdu, Nagri, Bengali and Telugu on the four sides, with the word \"India\" and the year of coinage within the square. The rim is not milled. The nickel mint is capable of giving an outturn of about 2 lakhs of pieces a day. The only portion of the original machinery now in the Mint is the rolling-plant; for the original vacuum cutting presses, which were in use a few years ago, have been replaced by more modern machinery. The establishment of the mint, which is composed chiefly of native workmen under European supervision, is controlled by the Mint Master, who is always an officer of the Royal Engineers and is directly responsible to the Government of India. In the Mechanical Department are 9 Engineers and Assistant Engineers under a Head Engineer, while a European Head Melter with 2 Assistants supervises all the operations of the Melting Department. The bullion is in charge of a Bullion-keeper with a staff of native assistants all of whom furnish security to Government and work under the supervision of an European officer, styled the First Assistant to the Mint Master. The number of workmen employed varies with the coinage requirements of Government. A permanent nucleus of 150 workmen is maintained which is augmented to about 1000, whenever the Mint is producing its full daily output of 7\u00bd lakhs.\nThe following table shows the annual amount coined by the Bombay Mint since 1835-36:\n\n| Year | Gold Value in Rs. | Silver Value in Rs. | Copper Value in Rs. | Year | Gold Value in Rs. | Silver Value in Rs. | Copper Value in Rs. |\n|------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| 1835-36 | ... | 57.76 | 3.42 | 84-85 | ... | 4,55.71 | 3.55 |\n| 36-37 | ... | 89.07 | 2.84 | 85-86 | ... | 6,81.58 | ... |\n| 37-38 | ... | 1,28.21 | 3.03 | 86-87 | ... | 3,54.19 | 2.57 |\n| 38-39 | ... | 1,29.42 | 3.10 | 87-88 | ... | 6,08.31 | 4.52 |\n| 39-40 | ... | 90.72 | 2.79 | 88-89 | ... | 6,23.47 | 1.41 |\n| 1840-41 | ... | 1,28.34 | 1.15 | 89-90 | ... | 7,45.52 | 3.28 |\n| 41-42 | ... | 95.90 | 3.24 | 1890-91 | ... | 9,30.88 | ... |\n| 42-43 | ... | 1,06.95 | 1.17 | 91-92 | ... | 4,07.49 | ... |\n| 43-44 | ... | 2,07.33 | ... | 92-93 | ... | 9,69.35 | ... |\n| 44-45 | ... | 1,54.60 | 1.59 | 93-94 | ... | 3,99.14 | ... |\n| 45-46 | ... | 1,30.60 | ... | 94-95 | ... | ... | ... |\n| 46-47 | ... | 66.46 | 8.3 | 95-96 | ... | 3,31.61 | ... |\n| 47-48 | ... | 42.07 | 2.89 | 96-97 | ... | 6,135\u2020 | ... |\n| 48-49 | ... | 1,11.88 | ... | 97-98 | ... | 21,146\u2020 | ... |\n| 49-50 | ... | 96.50 | ... | 98-99 | ... | 21,286\u2020 | ... |\n| 1850-51 | ... | 1,20.78 | ... | 99-00 | ... | 20,084\u2020 | 10* |\n| 51-52 | ... | 2,68.97 | ... | 1000-01 | ... | 31,43\u2020 | ... |\n| 52-53 | ... | 2,37.99 | ... | ... | ... | 21,545\u2020 | ... |\n| 53-54 | ... | 2,26.00 | ... | ... | ... | 71,12\u2020 | 1,00* |\n| 54-55 | ... | 37.47 | 3.58 | ... | ... | 44.08 | ... |\n| 55-56 | ... | 2,55.21 | ... | ... | ... | 30,743\u2020 | ... |\n| 56-57 | ... | 3,22.04 | ... | ... | ... | 57,95\u2020 | 50* |\n| 57-58 | ... | 4,27.97 | ... | ... | ... | 9,106\u2020 | ... |\n| 58-59 | ... | 2,19.04 | ... | ... | ... | 8,56,05 | ... |\n| 59-60 | ... | 4,05.16 | ... | ... | ... | 2,04,05 | ... |\n| 1860-61 | ... | 1,98.02 | 2.44 | ... | ... | 25,68\u2020 | ... |\n| 61-62 | ... | 4,05.92 | ... | 01-02 | ... | 2,84,85 | ... |\n| 62-63 | ... | 6,06.67 | ... | ... | ... | 52,75\u2020 | ... |\n| 63-64 | ... | 7,60.17 | ... | ... | ... | 30,104\u2020 | ... |\n| 64-65 | ... | 5,59.99 | 5.5 | 02-03 | ... | 3,15,05 | ... |\n| 65-66 | ... | 7,39.09 | 6.12 | ... | ... | 2,98,86 | ... |\n| 66-67 | ... | 2,49.96 | ... | ... | ... | 3,955\u2020 | ... |\n| 67-68 | ... | 2,61.25 | ... | 03-04 | ... | 15,009\u2020 | ... |\n| 68-69 | ... | 2,65.05 | ... | ... | ... | 9,48,77 | ... |\n| 69-70 | ... | 4,30.27 | ... | ... | ... | 14,27 | ... |\n| 1870-71 | ... | 1,24.54 | ... | ... | ... | 6,48\u2020 | ... |\n| 71-72 | ... | 61.03 | ... | ... | ... | 20,304\u2020 | ... |\n| 72-73 | ... | 2,93.49 | ... | 04-05 | ... | 6,79,16 | ... |\n| 73-74 | ... | 1,57.91 | ... | ... | ... | 1,47 | ... |\n| 74-75 | ... | 3,12.54 | 5.2 | ... | ... | 24\u2020 | ... |\n| 75-76 | ... | 1,73.18 | 2.42 | 05-06 | ... | 12,10,84 | ... |\n| 76-77 | ... | 4,19.18 | 1.60 | ... | ... | 6,39 | ... |\n| 77-78 | ... | 11,02.85 | 1.53 | 06-07 | ... | 16,07,31 | ... |\n| 78-79 | ... | 4,88.62 | ... | 07-08 | ... | 10,88,56 | 23,28\u2020 |\n| 79-80 | ... | 8,12.15 | ... | ... | ... | 1,946\u2020 | ... |\n| 1880-81 | ... | 3,19.86 | ... | ... | ... | 1,03,31\u2020 | 14,08\u2020 |\n| 81-82 | ... | 1,33.85 | 5.0 | 08-09 | ... | 6,87\u2020 | ... |\n| 82-83 | ... | 5,07.85 | 2.09 | ... | ... | 97,71 | 15,50\u2020 |\n| 83-84 | ... | 2,38.87 | 2.19 | ... | ... | 5,954\u2020 | ... |\n\n\u2020 British dollars for local Bank.\n\u2021 Half Rupees and small coin on Government account.\n* Piece for British East Africa Protectorate.\n\u2020 Straits dollars for Singapore Government.\n\u2021 Nickel annas.\nThe following short account of the procedure followed in the Bombay Mint in the coinage of rupees may be of interest:\n\n(i) Silver imported for coinage is received either in the shape of refined bars or of coins, such as Mexican Dollars, Maria Theresa Thalers, etc. The bullion is premelted on receipt, a granulated sample being sent to the Assay Office; it is then weighed and registered, the value being calculated on the basis of the fineness reported by the Assay Master. The first step in the process of coinage is to group the silver into parcels with the standard proportion of copper, silver \"scissel\" being used to make up the weight required for a melting, i.e., 22,000 tolas. When melted, a sample is taken for assay and the mass poured into ingot moulds which produce bars about 27\" long by 2\u00bd\" wide and \u00bc\" thick. These are numbered for identification, trimmed on a circular file and if the above mentioned sample is found on assay to be within the correct limits for fineness, they are sent on to the Rolling Department. Here they are passed some fourteen times between heavy or breaking down rolls and then again some eight times between fine or adjusting rolls and are thus reduced to straps of the thickness of a rupee. To ascertain that the correct thickness is reached, trial bits of the exact size of a rupee cut from the straps are carefully weighed. If these trial bits are found correct, the straps are sent to the cutting presses, where double punches cut out two blank bits or \"blanks\" of the size of a rupee at one blow, the strap being automatically pushed forward at the conclusion of each stroke in readiness for the next. The residue of the straps, which is termed \"scissel\" is tied up in bundles and taken away for melting. Each blank is now passed through the edging machine at the rate of about 800 a minute to give the raised rim seen on the finished rupee.\n\n(ii) The blank is then carefully weighed to see that it is neither too heavy nor too light, the correct weight of a rupee being 180 grains. They are placed in hoppers above automatic weighing machines and fall by their own weight on to the outer scale pan of a delicate balance inside the machine which by ingenious mechanism sorts the\nblanks into three receptacles for \"Heavy,\" \"Standard\" and \"Light\" according to the weight of each piece. Heavy pieces are reduced to the proper weight in a filing machine, light pieces go back to be remelted and standard pieces are passed on to the annealing ovens heated to a temperature of 900\u00b0 F. and are kept there for a quarter of an hour to soften them. They are then immersed in troughs of dilute sulphuric acid until the surface is quite white and after washing in clean water they are finally passed on to the Coining Presses, a single blow of which converts the blank into a finished rupee. The impressions on the two faces of the coins are made by steel dies between which the blank is struck and the milling on the edge is produced by means of a toothed collar which surrounds the coin at the moment of striking.\n\nMosques.\u2014The Muhammadan community of Bombay possesses 89 masjids, of which 8 belong to the Bohras, 2 to the Khojas, one to the Mughals and the remainder to the Sunni Muhammadans. The most noteworthy are the Jama Masjid in Sheikh Memon street, the old mosque near the tomb of Sheikh Makhtum Fakih Ali at Mahim, the Jakaria Masjid in Mandvi, Sattad Masjid near Masjid Bandar station, Ismail Habib Masjid in Memonwada, the Khoja Ashna Ashari Masjid, opened in 1903, the Mughal Masjid on Jail road, which was built by Haji Mahomed Hussein Shirazi and the Bohra Masjid to the west of the Jama Masjid.\n\nAccording to an Urdu account of 1836, the original Jama Mosque of Bombay was situated near Dongri fort and was built by Konkani Muhammadans. It was removed during the administration of Mr. Bourchier (1750-60), and a new Jama Mosque was erected on the Esplanade in front of the spot occupied by the shrine of Pedro Shah, who according to one account was a Portuguese convert to Islam. This mosque was likewise dismantled in 1770 by an order of the Governor, Mr. William Hornby, which forbade the existence of any buildings within six hundred yards of the\n\n---\n\n1 This account was contributed by Mr. Abdul Kadir Khatkhatay, B.A., LL.B., Nazir of the Jama Mosque.\n\n2 See Edwardes' Rise of Bombay, 62, foot-note. The shrine of Pedro Shah lies near the Great Indian Peninsula Railway line.\nwalls of the Fort. For devotional purposes the Sattad Mosque in Mandvi was therefore utilized until the present Jama Mosque, which lies about half way up Sheik Memon street, was built. Although its erection was commenced in 1775, it was not ready for use until 1802, owing to disputes about the ownership of the land, which was eventually handed over to the Konkani Muhammadan community during the governorship of Sir William Medows (1788-90). The date of its completion (A.D. 1802 = A.H. 1217) is derivable from the chronogram Jahasi-Akhira, \"the ship of the world to come,\" which contains an allusion to the fact that it was constructed over a tank. In the eighteenth century this tank was situated in the midst of gardens and open land, and belonged to a Konkani Muhammadan merchant, trading in Goa and Calicut, who, about 1778, agreed to the erection of a mosque on the spot, provided that the tank was preserved intact. A one-storeyed building was therefore erected over the tank and formed the original nucleus of the present Jama Mosque. The persons chiefly concerned in the completion of the mosque were Nathu Patel, headman of the Musalman butchers of Bombay, and his brother Ibrahim Patel, who in 1789 obtained the permission of the Kazi to complete the mosque, and who, together with their nephew, acted as managers of the mosque until 1834, when, in accordance with a decree of the High Court, all the affairs of the Jama Mosque were handed over to the Konkani Musalman jamat. In 1837 the building was repaired and enlarged by the addition of an upper storey at the expense of Mr. Muhammad Ali Rogay, and shops were added to serve as the demesne of the mosque.\n\nThe Jama Mosque is a quadrangular pile of brick and stone, encircled by a ring of terrace-roofed and double-storeyed buildings, the ground-floors of which are let out as shops at an aggregate monthly rental of about Rs. 6,000. The chief or eastern gate of the mosque leads directly across an open courtyard to the ancient tank, which is now furnished with masonry steps and embankments, built in 1893, and contains about ten feet of stagnant water filled with gold and silver\nfish. From the depth of the tank rise sixteen blackstone-arches, constructed in 1874, which support the whole fabric of the mosque, the upper storey being upheld by five rows of wooden pillars, each of which contains a receptacle for sacred books. The arches in the tank were built in 1874 at a cost of Rs. 75,000; while other noteworthy additions to the premises are the large windows in the north, east and south sides, constructed in 1898, and the school building erected at a cost of Rs. 20,000 in 1902.\n\nThe annual income of the Jama Mosque amounts to about Rs. 75,000, and the expenditure to Rs. 24,000. In accordance with a scheme framed by the High Court in 1897, the management of its properties and affairs vests in a board of eleven directors, triennially elected by the Konkani Musalman jamat, while the executive functions are delegated to a Nazir, appointed by the board. The staff of the mosque includes an Imam or prayer-leader, an assistant Imam, a Bangi and assistant Bangi whose duty it is to summon the devotees to prayer, and several subordinates. Attached to the mosque is a school, the Madressa Muhammadiah, in which gratuitous secular and religious education is imparted to Muhammadan youths. The Madressa has a hostel attached to it.\n\nThe tomb of Sheikh Misri or the Egyptian father lies amid the salt-lands and rice-fields of the north-eastern portion of the island, within a square brickwalled enclosure to the east of the Sheikh Misri road. The wall surrounds an unpaved court about 80 feet square, pleasantly shaded by a tamarind, a soapnut and a gold mohur tree, whence a small flight of steps leads to a terrace upon which stands the dargah of the saint. The shrine, which has a tiled roof, is entered by a heavy wooden door, painted green; and the interior walls are adorned with framed pictures.\n\n---\n\n1 Mrs. Graham (Journal of a Residence in India, 16) described the tank in 1813 as containing excellent water. The mosque was capable of containing about 600 people, and its only interior ornament was a plain stone pulpit for the Imam. Attached to the mosque was an Arabic school. The younger pupils had no books, but were taught by means of letters and sentences painted on wood.\n\n2 The shrine is marked in Murphy's map of Bombay, 1843.\nof the Ka'aba and the Prophet's tomb and with monograms formed of verses from the Koran. The tomb in the centre of the chamber lies beneath an ornate wooden canopy, from which depend a chandelier and lamps of various sizes, presented by those whose vows have borne fruit. A balustrade of lacquered wood guards the tomb, which is covered with a green cotton cloth. To the south-west is an open paved court containing a large earthen water jar for ablutions, and a mosque which was built at a cost of Rs. 5,000 by a Memon in gratitude for the birth of a son. The tomb, which is in charge of a Konkani Muhammadan, is little frequented owing to its distance from the city: and nothing is known of the saint, save that he came to India about five hundred years ago.\n\nMotor Union of Western India.\u2014The Motor Union of Western India was established in the year 1904 with the object of encouraging and developing motoring in the Bombay Presidency and of supplying to members information and advice on all matters pertaining to motor vehicles. The number of members of the union in 1908 was 201, including 150 ordinary members, 41 life members and ten members resident outside Bombay. Since its establishment, the Union has held three motor trials, one in 1904 from Delhi to Bombay, another in 1906 from Bombay to Mahableshwar and back through Satara, and the third in 1908 from Bombay to Kolhapur and back via Mahableshwar. Automobile Shows and a Motor Gymkhana were also held under the auspices of the Union in 1907 and 1908.\n\nMunicipal Offices.\u2014In 1866 the Municipality was housed in an unpretentious building at the end of Girgaum road, whence it removed in 1870 to a building on the Esplanade, situated between Watson's Hotel and the Sassoon Mechanics' Institute. On the 19th December 1884, Lord Ripon, the Viceroy of India, laid the foundation stone of the present Municipal Offices, opposite the Victoria Terminus of the G. I. P. Railway, which were completed in 1893. In the main entrance hall is a tablet containing the subjoined inscription:\n\n\"These buildings were designed and their execution superintended by F. W. Stevens, C.I.E., F.R.I.\"\nB.A., A.M.I.C.E., Rao Saheb Sitaram Khande-rao, M.S.A., being the Resident Engineer in charge. The work was commenced on the 25th July 1889, Grattan Geary being the President of the Corporation and E. C. K. Ollivant, I.C.S., being the Municipal Commissioner, and was completed on the 31st July 1893, Thomas Blaney being the President of the Corporation and H. A. Acworth, I.C.S., being the Municipal Commissioner.\"\n\nThe building belongs to the early Gothic style of architecture, while the many domes which rise above the gabled roofs impart an oriental flavour to the design. The imposing facade with its magnificent tower is flanked by two wings which abut on Hornby and Cruickshank roads. The tower rises to a height of 235 feet from the ground, and over the fa\u00e7ade is placed a colossal allegorical figure representing Urbs Prima in Indis. On the Hornby road side the ground floor is occupied by the Town Duties office and the office of the Assessor and Collector, while on the Cruickshank road side are the offices of the Health Department, the Municipal Laboratory and a staircase for the use of the Commissioner and the members of the Corporation. On the first floor are the offices of the Commissioner, Municipal Secretary, School Committee, and Chief Accountant, a record room, and the Corporation Hall. The hall is 65 feet long by 32 feet broad and is 38 feet in height. Its northern end is ornamented with a large bay window, filled with stained glass bearing the arms of the Corporation and flanked by canopied recesses of stone. The southern end opens into a lounge for the use of Councillors, which leads through glass doors on to a broad terrace above the southern entrance of the building. The hall contains busts of Queen Victoria, Rao Saheb Vishvanath N. Mandlik (President of the Corporation, 1879-80), Mr. W. L. Harvey C.S.I., I.C.S. (Municipal Commissioner, 1898-1905), Sir Frank Souter (President of the Corporation, 1882-1884), Sir Charles Ollivant, K.C.S.I., I.C.S. (Municipal Commissioner, 1882-1890), Mr. H. A. Acworth (Municipal Commissioner, 1890-1895), Dr. Blaney and Captain Henry. The hall contains two galleries for the public.\nThe offices of the Executive Engineer and his deputies and the license department are on the second floor. In the tower above the record-room are two floors containing large water storage tanks of wrought iron, which together have a capacity of 40,000 gallons. Six other tanks, containing, when full, 15,000 gallons, are distributed over the building for the use of the fire service. An electrically-driven pump insures the tanks being always filled. The building is lighted throughout by electricity, the Corporation Hall being illuminated by three overhead brass electroliers of exquisite design, each containing thirteen lights aggregating 1,500 candle power. The supply mains of the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramway Co. also furnish power for an electric lift and a complete installation of electric fans throughout the building. The cost of the whole building amounted to about 13 lakhs.\n\nOrient Club.\u2014The Orient Club owes its origin to a desire to provide a club managed on European lines to which both European and Native gentlemen might be admitted, and was opened in May 1900. The main object of the club is to encourage more intimate relations between Indian and European gentlemen; and so far that object has been successfully achieved. The Club was at first housed in a hired bungalow at Chaupati, belonging to the Rogay family; but has recently moved into a building of its own, designed by Messrs. C. F. Stevens & Co., and erected upon one of the Improvement Trust plots at Chaupati. The new building was formally opened by H. E. Sir George Clarke at the beginning of 1910.\n\nPanjrapol.\u2014The Bombay Panjrapol or asylum for aged and diseased animals was founded by a Jain merchant on the 18th October, 1834,\u00b9 and is situated near the Cowasji Patel tank, in close proximity to the Madhav Baug. The original trust deeds (1834 to 1877)\n\n\u00b9 In the Mumbaicha Vrittant and in the Hongkong Gazette (quoted by the Bombay Courier of 27-12-1845) his name is given as Motichand Amichand. The first Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy is said to have assisted him. Mrs. Postans, however, states that the Panjrapol was built by a Purvoe (Prabhu) in the office of Messrs. Forbes & Co., who had amassed considerable wealth. Probably the former account is correct.\nof the institution give the following history of its foundation. The East India Company issued a regulation for the annual destruction of dogs in Bombay island, and a considerable number were from time to time destroyed, in spite of frequent petitions from the public. In 1832 a further petition was submitted to the effect that, if Government would prohibit the practice of dog-killing, the petitioners would have them caught alive and despatched to other ports and places. This request was complied with, but, owing to lack of funds the petitioners could not carry out their part of the contract. The Hindu and Parsi communities therefore resolved to establish a Panjrapol, similar to those existing in other places in India, for the keeping of stray cattle and other animals. The management of the institution is in the hands of a secretary under the supervision of a managing committee composed of 3 trustees and any 3 members of the institution not being trustees.\n\nThe Panjrapol is maintained at an annual cost of 1\u00bd lakhs, and possesses a standing fund of 12\u00bd lakhs. Its chief sources of income are charitable contributions, interest and dividends on invested funds, rents of houses and lands, produce of trees and the sale proceeds of manure and sweepings. The institution contains about 125 horses and ponies, 3,500 cattle, 150 dogs and a large number of goats, buffaloes and other animals. Medical treatment is provided for diseased animals. The managing committee has power to increase and limit the number of animals maintained and can also present an animal to any applicant who undertakes to feed it and generally look after it in a proper manner. The Panjrapol has opened branches at Chembur, Bhiwandi and Raita near Kalyan, which contain about 4,000 animals, chiefly cattle. The fees for admission of animals into the Panjrapol vary according to the pecuniary status of the persons sending them thither. The fee for the admission of horses varies from Rs. 10 to Rs. 25, and for cows and oxen from one rupee to Rs. 2 a-piece.\n\nPaper Currency Office.\u2014By Act III of 1840 the Presidency Bank at Bombay was empowered to issue promissory notes, payable on demand, and of not less value than\nRs. 10, up to a limit of 2 crores: but after the 1st March 1862 this power was withdrawn by Act XIX of 1861, and a Department of Issue was established instead, for the issue of promissory notes of the Government of India. Under the latter Act, circles of issue were established, one city or town in each circle being appointed the place of issue: and the Master of the Mint was nominated Commissioner of Issue for the Bombay Circle. The notes were to be issued in exchange for the current silver coin of the Government of India, or for silver bullion computed at the rate of Rs. 979 per 1000 tolas, or for other notes of the same circle or for gold, and were legal tender within the circle of issue (except by Government at the office of issue) for the amount expressed in the note. The Bombay Circle of issue comprises the Districts of the Bombay Presidency proper, the Central Provinces and Berar, Karachi, comprising the province of Sind, has been constituted a head circle by Act II of 1910. In accordance with the terms of Act XIX of 1861, therefore, the Currency Office was opened in Bombay on the 1st March 1862, Colonel Ballard, Master of the Mint, being appointed Commissioner of Issue, and the Bank of Bombay being constituted the office of agency for the transaction of note exchange business. The agreement with the Bank, which was legalised by Act XXIV of 1861, was to continue for a period of five years from the 1st March, 1862, and as remuneration the Bank received a commission of 3 per cent. per annum on the daily average of Government Currency notes outstanding and in circulation through their agency. This agreement was not approved by the Secretary of State, and the agency was accordingly withdrawn from the Bank of Bombay on the 28th February 1867, and on the following day the Paper Currency Department commenced working as a regular branch of the public service under the direct supervision of the Mint Master. Finally, in accordance with the suggestions of a Commission appointed in 1866 to report upon the working of the Paper Currency Act, the Office of Currency Commissioner was\n\n---\n\n1 Act XIX of 1861 was repealed by Act III of 1871 and Act XX of 1882. The Act of 1882 was amended by Act XV of 1890, VIII of 1893, XXI of 1896, II of 1898, VIII of 1900, IX of 1902, and VI of 1903. All these Acts were finally superseded by Act III of 1905.\nwithdrawn from the Master of the Mint and vested in the Accountant-General of Bombay subject to the general control of the Comptroller-General of Accounts at Calcutta. The transfer took place on the 13th September 1870.\n\nThe notes of the Bank of Bombay, issued prior to the 1st March 1862, were of the denomination of Rs. 10, Rs. 25, Rs. 100, and Rs. 1000, whereas the Government promissory notes were of the denomination of Rs. 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000, and no limit was fixed to the extent of issue of these notes. Notes of the denomination of Rs. 5 were made legal tender under Act III of 1871 and were first issued on the 10th July 1872. They have become most popular in the Bombay Circle and now form about 30 per cent. of the total number of notes circulating in the Presidency. Notes of Rs. 10,000 were first issued in December, 1872, and are chiefly used by Government and the Banks as a convenient form for holding their reserve balances. The earliest notes issued were of simple design and had their value printed in English, Hindi and Persian; but during 1867-68 notes of new pattern, designed to render forgery more difficult, were issued with their several denominations printed in the four vernacular languages of the Presidency. The first issues of the 5 rupee note did not differ from those of higher value except in size; but on the passing of Act VI of 1903, a new and slightly larger form of 5 rupee note was adopted for universal use throughout India. The form was again altered in 1906, being increased to $7\" \\times 4\\frac{1}{2}\"$ and printed in a distinctive colour. By Act II of 1909 this note was extended to Burma, in a slightly altered form admitting of the value being printed in eight Vernacular languages as well as in English. The principal of a universal note was extended by Act II of 1910 to 10 rupee and 50 rupee notes, which are now legal tender throughout British India and Burma. New designs for those notes will shortly be issued. The 20 rupee note will no longer be issued. All currency note forms are supplied to offices of issue by the India office through the Bank of England.\n\nOwing to the short notice given to the Commissioner, he was unable to supply notes to the value of more than one crore to the Bank of Bombay by the 1st March 1862: but\nby the close of that month the value of the notes supplied to the Bank amounted to 114 lakhs, and the Bank had put notes in circulation to the value of 62 lakhs. The circulation of currency notes increased steadily during the first six years, rising in the Bombay circle to more than 506 lakhs in 1867-68. This marked increase was largely due to the unsatisfactory position at that date of local banks and mercantile companies, leading the public to withdraw deposits from them and invest them instead in notes. During the next twenty years, the circulation of notes in the Bombay circle was practically stationary and varied between 3 and 5 crores; but in 1890, it rose suddenly to 8 crores in consequence of American legislation regarding silver, which produced large speculative importations of that metal, and thereby inordinately swelled the cash (or note) balances of the Presidency and other banks. As large importations of silver continued, the note circulation increased to 10 crores, but began to contract after the closure of the Mint to the free coinage of silver in June 1893. The decrease, however, was only temporary, and would have lasted a shorter time than it did, but for the presence of plague and famine in 1896-97 and 1897-98, which greatly disorganized native banking operations. In the following year the tide turned, and in spite of the prevalence of plague, the note-circulation has steadily increased throughout the Presidency from 7\u00bd to 14 crores, this result being largely due to the change in the Indian currency introduced by Act VIII of 1893.\n\nCurrency Reserve. The reserve in March 1862 consisted only of silver coin, but in the following month bullion was accepted in accordance with Section IX, clause 2 of the Currency Act. The bullion was delivered at the Mint, which before manufacturing it into coin (a process lasting twenty days) furnished the tenderer with an assay certificate of value payable at sight. During the period of the free coinage of silver by the Mints, large and rapid deposits of bullion in the Mint and heavy withdrawals of coin from the Currency Office frequently caused great anxiety to the Department of Issue. As early as 1865 the Bombay coin reserve stood on one occasion at Rs. 5,33,717 only against a note circulation of 260 lakhs. But the most damaging\nrun on the reserve occurred towards the end of 1905, when, in spite of a greatly increased circulation, the rupee coin reserve in Bombay was reduced to almost nothing, and Government, in order to meet all possible contingencies, were forced to borrow 70 lakhs of rupees from the Gwalior State in January 1906. This fall in the rupee reserve was chiefly due to the large amount of coin required to move the bumper crops of jute and cotton, which, with a smaller demand for bullion than usual on the part of the public, effected a very large net balance of trade in favour of India, and also to the very large stock of gold in the currency reserve at the beginning of the export season.\n\nNotes were first issued in Bombay in exchange for sovereigns and half-sovereigns at Rs. 10 per sovereign in 1864, the total amount receivable being limited by the Commissioner to 30 lakhs. In 1865, all the sovereigns and half-sovereigns were taken up by the public at the same rate, and there was practically no gold in the reserve up to the year 1898. The rate was raised to Rs. 10\u00bd in 1869, but the receipt of sovereigns was very limited as the market-price was generally above the rate fixed by Government. In 1893 the Currency Act was amended by Act VIII of that year, which provided for the issue of currency notes to any amount in exchange for gold coin or bullion. The rate of exchange was fixed at Rs. 15 per sovereign and gold bullion at one Government rupee for 7'53344 grains troy of fine gold. For a short period the market price ruled slightly above this rate; but by 1898 the balance of trade in India's favour began to tell and sovereigns were imported (and exchanged for notes and rupees) for the payment of goods exported from the country. On the last day of 1898, the gold reserve in Bombay amounted to Rs. 7,86,210; but in the next two years the quantity increased so rapidly that by the end of 1900 it stood at Rs. 8,44,81,867 whereupon Government remitted the gold to England to be expended in the purchase of silver to be remitted to India for coinage. By Act II of 1898, passed as a temporary measure of relief to a stringent money market in India, the Governor-General in Council was empowered to issue currency notes on the security of gold deposited in England; and this authority,\nextended for two years longer by Act VIII of 1900, was finally made permanent by Act IX of 1902.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Currency Act for the investment in Government securities of not more than four crores of rupees worth of the bullion and coin received in exchange for notes, the first purchase of Government securities amounting to Rs. 40,00,779 was made in April 1862. The investments were from time to time increased until by May 1865 they nearly reached the legal maximum of 4 crores. The coin reserve at the time bore a proportion of only 32.5 per cent. on the note circulation; but the maximum investment continued to be held until the coin reserve in Bombay fell, as previously mentioned, to a dangerously low level in December 1865. Government thereupon increased the coin reserve by selling off a portion of the securities, which were reduced by March 1867 to Rs. 3,25,20,547. But during this period the note circulation increased, and consequently the coin reserve became larger, and the proportion on notes in circulation rose to a higher percentage. With the increase in the note circulation Government considered it safe in 1870 to raise the maximum limit of the currency reserve invested in securities from 4 to 6 crores, and proceeded to legalise this step by the passing of Act XV of 1870. The limit was subsequently increased to 8 crores by Act XV of 1890, to 10 crores by Act XXI of 1896, and to 12 crores by Act III of 1905. The last Act also empowered Government to hold in sterling securities of the United Kingdom 2 crores of the invested reserve which had hitherto been held only in rupee securities of the Government of India. Effect was given to this provision by the Secretary of State in August 1905, when \u00a31,333,333 were invested in consols and exchequer bonds.\n\nForgeries. The Bombay circle has the unenviable reputation of being foremost in the matter of forgeries of currency notes. Within four months after the first issue several attempts at forgery were made by the process of altering 10 rupee notes into notes of higher value, lithographing notes, counterfeiting the water-mark on the paper by\n\n---\n\n1 This Act was modified by Act II of 1909 and was subsequently repealed by Act II of 1910, which is the Act now in force.\npassing a brush full of acid across the paper, and finally by obtaining water-marked paper (manufactured for judicial purposes) and forging the notes thereon. During the third year of the Department of Issue in Bombay no less than 52 forged and altered notes were sent to the Commissioner's office for inspection. The simplicity of the earliest design of the currency note paved the way for this form of crime; but, although the new pattern introduced in 1867-68 to some extent arrested the practice, and in spite of the severe sentences invariably passed upon forgers, forged notes have been discovered nearly every year within the limits of the Bombay Presidency.\n\nSo long as the exchange and encashment of notes for the public was conducted by the Bank of Bombay, the exchange branch of the Currency Office was located in the Bank building, while the rest of the office worked in the Mint and the coin and stock of notes were stored in the old treasury vaults of the Castle, about 300 yards distant from the mint. Shortly before the expiry of the agreement with Government, the Bank of Bombay moved into its new quarters in Elphinstone Circle, and the old building, known as No. 1 Rampart Row, was rented to Government for Rs. 2,000 per mensem on a six-months' lease from the 1st March 1867, for the accommodation of the whole of the Paper Currency Department. After the failure of the Bank, Government purchased the building from the liquidators on the 1st April 1868 for a sum of 3\u00bd lakhs. The building was extended in 1906 at a cost of 2\u00bd lakhs; and a further extension northwards is now contemplated.\n\nParsi Panchayat.\u2014The Parsi Panchayat of Bombay appears to have been founded some time prior to 1732, as one Naoroji R. Sethna, who died in that year, is described\n\n---\n\n1 The Indian word *Panchayat* means a body of five, that being the least number that could form a quorum for the discussion and settlement of caste disputes. This is corroborated by the proverb:\u2014*Panch kehe so kijye*, i.e., we must do what five people say. As a matter of fact, the number was not limited to five in practice, and the Gujarathi word *panchati*, meaning dispute, quarrel, trouble, etc., gives grounds for supposing that these caste-gatherings were not always peaceful. In the older Parsi settlements like Navsari the word *anjuman* is used instead of *panchayat*. (Shams-ul-ulama J. J. Modi).\nas a member of the first Parsi Panchayat\\(^1\\). Its principal function was the regulation of the social and religious affairs of the Parsis, or, in the words of a Government Resolution of the 1st January, 1787, \"to settle private disputes and to carry on the internal management of the community.\" When very important questions were involved, the Panchayat called a meeting of the whole body of Parsis; the first occasion on which such a general meeting was held being in 1749, to discuss the method of laying out corpses for burial.\\(^2\\) A second meeting of this kind was held in 1777 to decide the vexed question of marriage between the priesthood and laity, it being finally resolved that there should be no intermarriage at all.\\(^3\\) In the year following, the Panchayat first sought to obtain the seal of Government upon its actions, and petitioned the Governor, Mr. William Hornby, to permit them to punish by chastisement with shoes any Parsi who infringed religious rules. The required permission was obtained.\\(^4\\) Meanwhile the question of marriage between the priesthood and laity had by no means died out and was again brought forward in 1785 by the betrothal of the infant daughter of a layman to the infant son of a priest. After considerable dispute the matter was referred to the Governor,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Khan Bahadur B. B. Patel's Parsi Prakash I, 29. Other members of the first Panchayat were Messrs. B. L. Banaji, founder of the Banaji Agiari; J. J. Modi, grandson of Hirji Vacha Modi, who built the first Tower of Silence; R. D. Patel, son of the first Parsi who settled in Bombay; Cowasji Bachaji and B. K. Sethna.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cama Memorial Volume, p. 175.\n\n\\(^3\\) Kholaseh-i-Panchayat, 43-44.\n\n\\(^4\\) The petition ran as follows:\u2014\"Your Honour's petitioners with the greatest respect and submission take the liberty to represent to your Honour that some low Parsis, who are ignorant of the rules of our religion, are about to infringe the same, which your petitioners must prevent, but are unwilling to trouble Justice every time. Therefore we most humbly pray that your Honour will permit of your petitioners shaming them in the Panchayat by beating them with a few shoes, agreeable to their crime, which will certainly amend them.\" Mr. Hornby's answer was addressed to \"the Parsis not of the Priest class\" and ran as follows:\u2014\n\n\"You are hereby empowered to meet and inquire into all matters that are committed by your caste, contrary to what has been agreed to by the majority of the caste, and to punish the offender agreeably to the rules of your caste, so far as not permitting them to come to your feasts, or beat them with shoes, but no other corporal punishment.\" Kholaseh-i-Panchayat, 235-237.\nMr. R. H. Boddam, who appointed a committee, composed of three Englishmen, to report upon the whole matter. The Committee in 1786 submitted a report justifying the action of the laity, who had excommunicated the parties, and recommending that \"in order to prevent future disputes and preserve peace and good order amongst the Parsis, it is proper to form the Panchayat upon a more equitable constitution, the authority of the present Panchayat seeming to be rather assumed than conferred, and liable to be extended too far.\" They further recommended that \"the powers they may be permitted to exercise should be defined and ascertained, and derived immediately from Government by some formal instrument,\" and that the new members of the Panchayat should be appointed by Government. In the following year, therefore, the Panchayat submitted twenty-four names of persons, eligible to serve, to the Governor, who appointed twelve out of the whole number to serve on the new Panchayat, six of them being laymen and six belonging to the priestly class. Of the former class two members, Nanabhoy Byramji Banaji and Dadabhoy Nasarwanji Dadysett, were empowered to convene the Panchayat whenever occasion arose.\n\nSo matters remained for a quarter of a century, the vacancies occurring from time to time in the original council of twelve being filled up by the Panchayat itself. But by 1818 this practice had been to some extent discontinued; and the remnants of the original Panchayat were inadequate to deal with the affairs of the community which had very largely increased in numbers. Consequently a meeting of the whole community was called in that year and it elected 18 members, twelve of whom were laymen and the remainder priests. Once again Government was\n\n1 Khulasah-i-Panchayat, 52-56.\n2 Khulasah-i-Panchayat, 67-68.\n3 Mr. Nanabhoy Byramji (Banaji) was known as \"the Davar\" or head of the Panchayat. Davar is an old Persian word, meaning \"judge,\" and is derived from the Pahlavi \"Datobar,\" meaning \"the carrier of law.\"\n4 The following are the names of the 18 members elected in 1818:\u2014Laymen\u2014Davar Framji Nanabhoy, Wadia Jamsetji Bomanji, Wadia Hormasji Bomanji, Cursetjee Ardashir Dadysett, Framji Cowasji Banaji, Dhanjibhoy Sorabji Readymoney, Mody Sorabji\nasked to invest the actions of the Panchayat with official sanction; the Honorable Mountstuart Elphinstone, who assumed office in 1819, was averse to granting the request by reason of the large increase in the number of Parsis in Bombay, their independent turn of mind, and the want of a good understanding among the leading families. The fact was that forces tending to the overthrow of the Panchayat's authority were already at work, albeit they had not at that date reached their full vigour. One of the most notable actions of the Panchayat was their attempt to codify the Parsi Civil Law in 1832. At the suggestion of Sir Herbert Compton, then Chief Justice, they prepared a draft, based upon Parsi scripture and custom, and circulated it for opinion among the people. No definite steps, however, were taken until 1835, when a petition was forwarded to the Governor-General asking that the Parsi community should not be held amenable to the English Law in the matter of inheritance and similar subjects. As a result, a draft Act (The Parsi Chattels Real Act, IX of 1837) was, with the approval of the whole community, passed on the 15th May 1837.\n\nAbout this date the authority of the Panchayat was rapidly waning, and two of the leading members resigned their posts on the ground that, in spite of the Panchayat, adequate measures were not taken to check cases of impropriety in the community. Conscious of this decline of power, the Panchayat made one more attempt to obtain Government authority for their actions and begged the Governor-General, Lord Auckland, to invest it \"with an efficient authority to control the vicious and encourage the virtuous.\" The request, however, was declined by the Government of India; and it, therefore, remained for Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy, the first Baronet, to appeal to both the Panchayat and the people in 1843 to take more interest in the affairs of the\n\nVachaghandy, Burjorji Dorabji Dadyburjor, Dadabhoy Cowasji Saber, Cursetji Maneckji Shroff, Pestonji Bhicaji Panday, Naoroji Meherji, Mobeds\u2014Dastur Cursetji Jamsetji Jamaspasana, Dastur Mulla Firozji, Merwanji N.

Parsi Benevolent Institution, with a sum of 3 lakhs of rupees, for the relief of the Parsi poor, thereby directing into a new channel the activities of the Panchayat, which straightway added a further sum of more than 2\u00bd lakhs from its own funds. A deed of settlement was drawn up between Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy, the members of the Parsi Panchayat, several individuals who were expected to become members of the society constituted by the deed, and the East India Company. The first three parties to the deed formed themselves into a society, and a Panchayat or governing body, consisting of twelve members, was constituted, four of the members retiring by rotation once every three years. Every third year, the members of the society were to elect three members and Government was to elect the fourth.\n\nFrom this date the Parsi Panchayat was identical for a few years with the Panchayat of Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy's institution; but side by side with it there existed another body, known as the Trustees of the funds and properties of the Parsi Panchayat, which was originally created in 1823. In 1851, a regular trust deed was drawn up whereby all the funds of the community were vested in five trustees, instead of four as in 1823, and the five were members of the larger Panchayat of twelve founded in 1843. The present Trustees of the funds and properties of the Parsi Panchayat are the successors of this body. The new Panchayat of twelve continued to perform a certain amount of the work formerly devolving on the defunct governing-body, for we find from their published record in 1860 that between 1854 and 1860 they adjudicated upon 287 matrimonial and other cases in the community; but in 1865 even these functions fell into abeyance in consequence of the promulgation by the Government of India of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce\n\n---\n\n1 He published the Kholaesh-i-Panchayat in 1843 with the above object. At the date of publication the Panchayat contained 13 members, only 3 of whom regularly attended the meetings.\n\n2 The first Panchayat thus constituted was composed of Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy, Naoroji J. Wadia, Bomanji H. Wadia, Dadabhoy P. Wadia, Cursetji R. Wadia, Hormasji B. Sethna, Jeejeebhoy Dadabhoy, Cursetji J. Jeejeebhoy, Cursetji F. Parekh, Maneckji L. Banaji, Maneckji N. Petit, Dosabhoy S. Munshi.\nAct (XV of 1865) and the Parsi Intestate Succession Act (XXI of 1865), and of the establishment of a Parsi Matrimonial Court. Shorn of its functions in this manner, the Parsi Panchayat ceased to exist except in the form of the Panchayat of the Benevolent Institution; and although two representations were made to the Trustees of the Panchayat funds in 1887 and 1894 to revive it, it has never been reconstituted since 1865.\n\nThe Trustees of the funds and properties of the Panchayat came into existence, as above stated, in 1823 to administer the income derived from marriage fees, charges for public feasts, charitable donations, and the revenue of the land surrounding the Towers of Silence. The expenditure usually consisted of monthly stipends to the poor and helpless, of hospital charges for poor Parsis, donations towards the marriage expenses of poor Parsi girls, funeral expenses, and similar items. Prior to their appointment, the funds of the Panchayat had been managed by Mr. Hormasji Bomanji Wadia, the amount deposited with him when he took over charge being a little more than Rs. 500. When he handed over control of the fund to the Trustees in 1823, the total amount to credit was nearly Rs. 16,000, while at the present date (1910) it is nearly 61 lakhs. The property managed by the Trustees consists of the Towers of Silence and the land surrounding them, the nasakhanas or houses where the corpse-bearers stay and where biers and other property are stored, and a few religious edifices, which are all embodied in the general trust deed of 1884. The offices of the Trustees are situated in Hornby road.\n\nPublic Fountains.\u2014Bombay contains several ornamental memorial fountains.

Priests and the poorer class were exempt from these fees.\n\n2 A fee of Rs. 5 was charged for public feasts given to the whole community, such feasts were given on the occasion of marriages and sometimes also of funerals, but now-a-days the only general feasts given are those of the Ghambars or religious festivals of seasons.\n\n3 Charitable donations were generally made at Oothamma ceremonies, i.e., the ceremony of the third day after death.\nEsplanade and Apollo Bandar roads, was erected in its present form about the year 1865 by public subscription in memory of the Duke of Wellington, who was once resident in the island. The Floral Fountain, which stands in the centre of the Esplanade opposite Church Gate street, was erected some little time later in honour of Sir Bartle Frere, to whose progressive policy Bombay owes many of her great public buildings. It was originally intended to erect this fountain in the Victoria Gardens at Byculla. During 1908 the grass plot and the palm trees, which originally surrounded the fountain, were removed in order to provide more room for pedestrians and horse-traffic between the tram lines and the kerb of the fountain. Another landmark is the Ratansi Mulji Memorial Fountain at the junction of the Mint and Frere roads, which was erected in 1894 by a well-known Bhattia freight broker in memory of his deceased son; while the Kesavji Naik Fountain, situated at the junction of Dongri-Koli street and Chinchbandar road, was erected by the gentleman whose name it bears in 1876. The Henry Memorial Fountain in Mazagon was erected by the officials of the Peninsular and Oriental S. N. Company, in memory of a former Superintendent of the Company, Captain Henry, and was handed over to the civic authorities in June 1878. Other notable fountains are one in Crawford Market designed by J. L. Kipling; the Bomanji Hormasji Wadia Fountain at\n\n---\n\n1 Surrey Cottage, which is no longer in existence, was the residence of Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke of Wellington) in March and April, 1801. The house stood about half-way up the now non-existent brow of Malabar hill, on the right hand as one ascended the Siri road, and was described by a writer in 1856 as \"situated between the road and the sea at the curve of the bay towards Malabar Hill, close to where the road from Byculla turns into the Breach Road from the Fort.\" At the time this was written, a wood-yard had grown up around the house, which was almost concealed from view by wood-stacks. In 1865 the brow of the hill was cut away to provide filling for the Chaupati reclamation and the sea-face road which now runs direct to Malabar hill, and the house disappeared with the ground upon which it stood. At the time that Sir Arthur Wellesley occupied it, the house was a neat single-storeyed bungalow, comprising a fairly spacious hall, with wings and long verandahs at the sides and back. In front was a porch to which led two carriage-drives from different points of a large compound. The hall commanded a view of Back Bay, a portion of Girgaum, the Esplanade and the Fort. When General Wellesley again arrived in Bombay in 1804, he appears to have occupied tents on the Esplanade.\nthe end of Bazaar Gate street, erected by public subscription in 1880; the Fitzgerald Fountain and lamp, facing the end of Cruickshank road, which was erected in honour of Sir S. Fitzgerald in 1867; fountains in Bhattia Bagh (1865), at Mumbadevi (1898), Cowasji Patel Tank road (1903) and at the junction of Grant and Duncan roads, the latter having been erected in 1901 by the Municipal Corporation to mark the site of an old tank. Finally there is the fountain in Jacob Circle, erected to the memory of General G. Legrand Jacob (1805-1881) by his niece and adopted daughter.\n\nRoyal Asiatic Society\u2014Bombay Branch.\u2014The Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society arose out of the Literary Society of Bombay, which was founded by Sir James Mackintosh, Recorder of Bombay, in 1804. The objects of the Society were the promotion of literary and scientific investigations connected with India, and the study of the literature, antiquities, arts and sciences of the East. In 1827 the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland sent a proposal for the union of the two institutions; and in 1829, after the receipt of a report from Sir John Malcolm, it formally resolved that the Literary Society of Bombay should thenceforward be considered an integral portion of the Royal Asiatic Society, under the appellation of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, though the latter was to be considered quite independent of the Royal Asiatic Society, so far as regards its local administration and the control of its funds.\n\n1 Memoirs of the Life of Sir James Mackintosh (1836). Historical Sketch of the Society by G. K. Tiwarekar, Librarian. Among those present at the preliminary meeting convened by Sir James Mackintosh were The Hon'ble Jonathan Duncan, Governor of Bombay; the Rt. Hon'ble Viscount Valentia; General Oliver Nicolls, Commander-in-Chief at Bombay; Helenus Scott, M.D.; George Keir, M.D.; Robert Drummond, M.D.; Stuart Moncrieff Thriepland, Advocate-General; William Dowdeswell; Henry Salt, Consul-General in Egypt; Lt.-Col. Brooks; Lt.-Col. Joseph Boden, Quarter-Master General at Bombay (Founder of the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit at Oxford); Lt.-Col. I. Charlton Harris; Colonel Jasper Nicolls; Major Edward Moor (author of the Hindu Pantheon); Charles (afterwards Sir Charles) Forbes; W. Erskine, Master in Equity.\n\n* Members of the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society, while residing in Asia, are considered non-resident members of the Royal Asiatic Society, and when in Europe are elected resident members in the same way that honorary members are elected.\nIn 1873 the Bombay Geographical Society, which was originally established in 1831 and subsequently became a branch of the Royal Geographical Society of London, was amalgamated with the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; and in 1896 the Anthropological Society of Bombay was permitted to hold meetings in the rooms of the Asiatic Society and have access to its library and records, in return for the presentation to the Society of the Anthropological Society's library and museum. Another society merged in the B. B. R. A. Society was the Medical and Literary Society, founded in 1789. Of early societies the chief were the Agri-Horticultural, founded in 1830; the Medical and Physical, founded in 1835; and the Literary and Scientific, founded in 1848.\n\nUp to 1831 the Society rented a building in the Fort for its library and reading-room; but the need for accommodation of its museum and the gradual growth of the library resulted in its removal in that year to the upper portion of the north wing of the Town Hall, which had been reserved for it and fitted up by Government, in return for the Society's contribution of Rs. 10,000 to the building of the Town Hall. The library dates from the foundation of the Society itself, and received its first\n\n---\n\n1 The original list of office-bearers of the Geographical Society was as follows:\u2014Patron, the Rt. Hon'ble the Earl of Clare. Vice-Patrons, The Hon'ble Sir J. W. Awdry, Kt.; Newnham, Esq., J. Romer, Esq., J. Sutherland, Esq. and Maj.-Genl. J. S. Barnes; President, Capt. Sir C. Malcolm, Kt., R.N.; Vice-President, Lt.-Col. E. Hardy; Honorary Secretary, J. F. Heddle, Esq.; Treasurers, Messrs. Remington & Co. The Society was at first accommodated in the Colaba Observatory; but in 1835 Government assigned to it a room on the ground-floor of the Court-House, which was subsequently exchanged for an apartment on the ground-floor of the Town Hall. In 1833 the Society commenced the formation of a library, which received from the Admiralty in 1851 a complete set of charts and maps, as also all the survey charts of the Indian Navy. In March 1835 the Society was admitted a branch of the Royal Geographical Society of London; and in 1836 its finances were aided by a donation of Rs. 500 and a monthly grant of Rs. 50 from the Bombay Government. In the same year it commenced to publish its transactions, which were regularly issued till 1872, and number in all 19 volumes. It also had portraits painted of four of the Presidents of the Society, in recognition of valuable services. The portraits which now hang in the committee-room of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society are those of (a) Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm, first President, (b) Capt. D. Ross,\ntangible nucleus in the Medical and Literary Library, which had been established in 1789 by certain medical men of Bombay. Since that date many special additions have been made to the library, chief among them being a collection of books in foreign languages presented by the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone in 1820, some valuable Sanskrit and Prakrit manuscripts and Gujarati manuscripts presented by the Bombay Government in 1826; a collection of Parliamentary reports and other public records presented by the Court of Directors in 1837, a body of valuable works on natural history, geology, etc., by the Malcolmson Testimonial Fund in 1844, several works on natural history presented by Jagannath Shankarsett in 1863, and a collection of Oriental works by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Cowasji Jehangir in the same year. These and other donations, coupled with the systematic purchase of books, have raised the total number of volumes in the library to nearly 88,000. The museum attached to the library was opened in 1816 for the collection and preservation of antiquities and of specimens of the natural history, arts and mythology of the East. It contains a fine collection of geological specimens, and many archaeological relics, inscriptions, copper-plates, carvings and the like, of great interest and value. A coin-cabinet also forms part of the museum, the nucleus of the collection consisting of donations from Government and a collection, which formerly belonged to the Honour-\n\nPresident 1833\u20141848, (c) Sir Alexander Barnes, massacred at Kabul, (d) The Hon'ble Mr. W. E. Frere, F.R.G.S., President 1862\u201465.\n\n1 Among these is a fine illuminated manuscript of Dante's Divina Comedia, which bears the signature of Mountstuart Elphinstone. The work is dated 1321.\n\n2 The Sanskrit and Prakrit MSS. were originally bequeathed to the Court of Directors by Dr. Taylor. The Gujarathi MSS. were procured by Colonel Miles, Political Agent at Palanpur, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Several Oriental MSS. were presented by Mr. Borrodaile in 1834. In 1865 Mr. Premchand Raichand contributed Rs. 10,000 to fit up a special room for Oriental literature and antiquities; and in 1882 a fine collection of Sanskrit MSS. was presented as a memorial of Dr. Bhau Daji.\n\n3 In 1905 the Committee decided to hand over the whole of its Museum to the Prince of Wales' Museum of Western India, as soon as the latter is completed. The collection of coins will however remain in the custody of the Society.\nble William Frere, presented by Sir Cowasji Jehangir in 1864.\n\nFor many years membership of the Society was confined to Europeans, the first Native of India to be admitted being Mr. Maneckji Cursetji elected in 1840. After him Mr. Jagannath Shankarsett, Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy, and others in increasing numbers were elected, so that at present nearly one-third of the members are Natives of India. Apart from the establishment of the library and museum, the operations of the Society have consisted of the reading and discussion of papers on Oriental subjects, and the publication of a journal, embodying those papers. The first journal was published in 1841, and the series has now reached No. 64 of Volume XXIII. Apart from this the activities of the Society, both before and after its union with the Royal Asiatic Society, have been manifested in various ways, such as a scheme for a statistical account of Bombay (1805), for the translation of Sanskrit works (1806), the erection of an observatory in 1813, the collection of specimens of Indian products for the Royal Asiatic Society in 1836, the preparation of a list of subjects for investigation by the Chinese-Tartary Frontier Mission in 1847, the formation in 1848 of a commission to investigate and report upon the cave-temples of Western India, and the collection in 1855 of a sum of money in aid of Dr. Livingstone's explorations in Africa.\n\nThe affairs of the Society are managed by a President,\n\n---\n\n1 Of the original collection most of the valuable specimens were stolen in 1862 from the house of a member to whom they had been entrusted for examination. Of late years, there have been frequent additions of gold, silver and copper coins found in different parts of India.\n\n2 The Society in 1815 received a valuable transit instrument and at once brought to the notice of Government the want of a suitable observatory in Bombay. An estimate for Rs. 2,000 was submitted, and the Society undertook to superintend the erection of an observatory and defray all excess charges, provided Government granted the sum specified. The project was approved and the sum of Rs. 2,000 was sanctioned by the Court of Directors. The observatory was erected in the south-west ravelin of the old fortifications, and was provided with instruments. About 1823 the Society decided to hand over the observatory and apparatus to Government.\n\n3 Dr. Livingstone, on his way to Africa for a third visit of exploration in 1865, halted in Bombay, and delivered a lecture before the Society on his travels and discoveries in that region. The sum collected by the Society and placed at his disposal was Rs. 6,450.\nfour Vice-Presidents, a Secretary and at least twelve members, annually elected; while the income is derived from members' subscriptions and monthly Government grants of Rs. 300 and Rs. 50, the latter representing the grant assigned to the old Geographical Society. The income of the Society for 1909 was Rs. 19,461.\n\nRoyal Bombay Yacht Club.\u2014The existence of the Yacht Club as a properly established institution dates from the year 1880, when a proposal to build a club-house was first made. Prior to that date the absence of premises obliged the committee to meet sometimes in the old Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's office (where the French Bank is now located), sometimes in the Apollo Bandar refreshment-rooms (then Kerner's rooms), and sometimes in the Sailors' Home. The Club funds were expended on one or two annual entertainments, such as two days' regatta and a water-picnic, which did not invariably prove successful. In 1880, when Captain Henry Morland was Commodore of the Club, the present site on the Wellington reclamation, adjoining what was then called Marine Parade, was obtained on lease for fifty years; and to this a further strip, used at that date as a road and lying between the club-site and the harbour was added on the same terms and laid out as a garden and promenade. The building was designed by Mr. Adams,\u00b9 the Government Architect, and was formally opened on the 1st November, 1881. Permission had been obtained from the Lords of the Admiralty in 1880 to fly the Blue Ensign of the Fleet over the Club premises, and in the following year a similar concession was granted to yachts belonging to the Club. Since that date the Club has greatly expanded, the most noteworthy addition being the fine block of residential chambers on the south side of the Apollo Bandar road, which were designed by Mr. J. Adams and supervised by the late Mr. F. W. Stevens and opened in 1898. At the present day the Club is the favourite resort of European society in Bombay.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Preliminary plans for a single building costing Rs. 30,000 were prepared in 1880 by Mr. Rienzi Walton.\n\u00b2 Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales visited the Club on the occasion of their tour in India in November 1905, a circumstance to which the signed portraits of Their Royal Highnesses over the main staircase now bear witness.\nAs early as 1839 yacht-racing and boat-racing were in vogue; but at that date vessels of English rig were unknown; and even as late as 1871 the few English-rigged boats in Bombay were of little use for racing purposes and the indigenous lateen-sail was in general favour. The latter has, however, gradually disappeared, and of the yachts now owned by the Club none are lateen-rigged. Racing takes place once a week from the beginning of December to the end of April, and an annual regatta, lasting for four or five days, is held in February.\n\nSailors' Home.\u2014A Sailors' Home was first opened on the 15th June 1837, on which date the monsoon raged with unbridled force and caused great destruction to the shipping. It was situated at Babula tank and was superintended by Mr. George Candy under the direction of Government and the local magistrates, and hither were brought nearly 1,000 seamen, who had sustained injuries in the storm of the 15th June. Not long afterwards the home was removed to a building in Dhobi Talao, where it was supported by the mercantile com-\n\n---\n\n1 The Bombay Times of 6th April 1839 contains the programme of a regatta held on that date for a silver cup worth \u00a350.\n\n2 The following yachts were owned by members of the Club in 1871:\n\n| Name       | Type          | Owner                  |\n|------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| May Frere  | Steam yacht   | Sir Seymour Fitzgerald |\n| Augusta    | Schooner      | Do                     |\n| Aurora     | Lateen        | Captain Henry          |\n| Water Queen| Lateen        | Mr. H.

It was described as the first house in the Native Town from the Esplanade. Mr. K. N. Kabraji (Reminiscences) states that \"The Volunteer Headquarters at Picket road are in a building originally used as a Sailors' Home, which was subsequently transferred to the fine edifice at the Apollo Bandar. On the site of the old Sailors' Home was a thatched structure accommodating the Native General Charitable Dispensary, known to the natives...\"\nmunity and aided by Government. At this date seamen were registered at the Police Office, which led to various abuses; and in consequence the Chamber of Commerce proposed that the registry of seamen should be entrusted to the Bombay Seamen's Friend Association, which had its head-quarters in the Sailors' Home. The proposal was approved and resulted in sailors' resorting more freely to the Home than before, and in the discomfiture of the Bombay tavern-keepers, who used to detain the men until their wages were exhausted. Men in the latter predicament had to obtain employment in a fresh ship through the instrumentality of the Police, who actually subserved the interests of the tavern-keepers. The second storey of a building contiguous to the Sailors' Home was reserved for destitute seamen, who were given a straw bed and fed like paupers at a separate table in the presence of their more fortunate mess-mates. Several men, who disliked this parade of their poverty, used to go without food for days and sleep out on the Esplanade round the tank facing the Home. At this date, the Home could accommodate only 50 men.\n\nIn 1870 a suggestion was made to construct a new Home on the Esplanade at the corner of Cruickshank road and Hornby road, and the first stone of the building was laid by H. R. H. the Duke of Edinburgh on the 17th March 1870. Several Native Chiefs offered dona-\n\nas \"Mackay's Hospital\"; while the dispensary was there the Sailors' Home was in Dhobi Talao.\" The Times of India of August 17th, 1874, speaks of the Dhobi Talao Sailors' Home as \"though small, yet generally too large for a Sailors' Home; especially during the monsoon, when not a single Jack was in it.\"\n\n1 Government allowed the Home the use of the Barrack furniture and granted a monthly allowance of Rs. 80 for house-rent. (Times of India, 26th September, 1846).\n\n2 Report of Chamber of Commerce, 1843-44.\n\n3 Times of India, 10th February 1865.\n\n4 On a tablet in the entrance hall is inscribed \"The first stone of this building erected as a home for the seamen of the Port and dedicated by H. H. Khanderao Gaickwar, G. C. S. I., as a perpetual token of his loyal attachment to H. M. Queen Victoria, and in commemoration of the auspicious arrival in Bombay of H. R. H. the Duke of Edinburgh, K.C., K. T., G. C. M.G., G.C.S.I. R.N., Master of the Corporation of Trinity House, was laid by His Royal Highness this 17th day of March 1870, the Right Honourable W. R. Seymour V. FitzGerald being Governor of Bombay.\"\ntions towards the cost of the building, chief among them being Khanderao Gaekwar of Baroda, who subscribed 2 lakhs. The site, however, was afterwards objected to by property-owners in the neighbourhood, and was in somewhat \"close proximity to liquor-shops and houses of ill-fame.\" In consequence the present site at the top of the Apollo Bandar road was chosen, and the present building was erected at a cost of nearly 4 lakhs, from designs prepared by the late Mr. F. W. Stevens. Work was commenced on the 28th February 1872, and completed on the 29th February 1876.\n\nThe Sailors' Home, or more properly the Royal Alfred Sailors' Home, can accommodate 350 men. The dormitories are large and well-ventilated, a reading-room and library are provided, and also a bar, where wholesome liquor at a moderate cost is provided. The style of the building is Gothic, the pediment on which is a sculptured figure of Neptune being surmounted by a tower and flag staff. From the wings and tower a fine view of the harbour is obtainable. The objects of the institution are to provide for seamen board and lodging at a moderate charge; to protect them from imposition and extortion; to encourage them to husband their wages; to provide them, through the Superintendent of the Home, with a safe depository for their savings and a medium of remitting the same safely to friends in England; and to promote their moral, intellectual and professional welfare. Since 1876, the Home has given shelter to 4,867 officers and 40,032 men. It is managed by a Board of Directors, with a Superintendent in direct charge. The funds to the credit of the Home aggregate about 14 lakhs.\n\nSanitaria and Dharmashalas.\u2014Bombay contains 11 Sanitaria and 120 Dharmashalas built by philanthropists, which are maintained either from caste funds or from endowments provided by the founders. The Merwanji Framji Panday Sanitarium at Colaba was established in 1865 for the benefit of poor and invalid Parsis, and charges the inmates a fee of Rs. 2 per fortnight for each room. The Framji Dinsha Petit Sanitarium on Gowalia Tank road, com-\n\n---\n\n1 Times of India, March 19th, 1870.\n2 See Times of India, January 4th, 1902.\nmenced in 1902, is reserved likewise for Parsis only, and charges a fee of Rs. 4 for each compartment or room. Gujarat Brahmins, Vanis and Lohanas are received at the Ranchoddas Varjivandas Sanitarium at Sion, where a fee of Rs. 2 per compartment is charged, while the Memon community owns a sanitarium at Mahim, established in 1906 by Mr. Abdulla Haji Dawood, where fees are likewise charged ranging from Rs. 6 to Rs. 10 per month. Close to the latter in Mahim Customs road is a sanitarium for all classes of Hindus, in which a fee of Rs. 3 per month is charged. No fees are charged in any of the other sanitaria or the dharmashalas, but some of them are rigidly restricted to the use of certain castes or classes. The Adamji Peerbhai sanitarium (1885), for example, in Charni road is intended for the use of Bohras only; the Prabhus have their own Sanitarium; and three are utilized by Vanis and Bhattias only. Each important caste in Bombay possesses a dharmashala of its own, as, for example, the Kamathis who own three, the Vanis and Bhattias who own 10, and the Sadhus (Ascetics) and Maharajas (Bhattia priests), for whom about 16 are reserved. More than 60 are utilized by all classes of Hindus jointly. The sanitaria are of comparatively recent date, but some of the dharmashalas are very old. In 1853 Mr. Dadabhoy C. Dadysett established a dharmashala at Gamdevi road for Iranians; Mr. R. J. Battliwalla erected the Foras road dharmashala in 1867, which was placed in charge of the Municipal Health Department in 1890; while the Madhav Bagh in Cowasji Patel Tank road was originally established as a dharmashala by Mr. Muljibhai Madhavdas in 1879.\n\nMuhammadan pilgrims make use of a Musafirkhana in Pakmodia street, built by Mr. Ismail Habib in 1871, and another in Frere road, established by Mr. Jafar-Suleman in 1884. Early in 1910, Sir George Clarke, Governor of Bombay, laid the foundation of a new Musafirkhana for Musalman pilgrims in Carnac road, the funds for which were provided by the late Mr. Mahomed Sabbu Sidik.\n\n---\n\n1 See Times of India, November 13th, 1891.\n2 The Brahman Dharmashala in Ganeshvadi dates from 1806. The General Dharmashala stands on Bellasis road and was erected about 1847 by Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy. It provides accommodation for about 300 persons.\nSassoon Mechanics' Institute.\u2014The institute stands nearly opposite the equestrian statue of the King-Emperor in the Fort, and was originally founded in 1847 by the foremen mechanics of the Mint and Government Dockyard with the object of acquiring a library, of providing a collection of mechanical models and constructive materials, and of instituting a yearly course of lectures on scientific and literary subjects. The first few meetings of the Society were held under the presidency of Sir Erskine Perry, Chief Justice, in the rooms above the clock-tower entrance to the Dockyard; but in 1848, on the death of Sir Robert Oliver, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, the Institute was removed to hired rooms in the Fort, where it remained until 1862, when it was once more removed to its old premises in the Dockyard. In 1863 Mr. David Sassoon presented Rs. 60,000 to the Society for the construction of a permanent building; while the Bombay Government gave the Society a plot of 1,485 square yards on the Esplanade at a nominal rent of one rupee a year, and promised a grant of Rs. 22,900 towards the cost of the building, provided that the expenditure on it was controlled by the Government architectural engineer. This amount was subsequently increased by the balance (Rs. 20,000) of the sum subscribed for a marble statue of Mr. David Sassoon and by an equivalent grant from Government in cash. The foundation-stone of the new building, which was then styled the David Sassoon Mechanics' Institute, was laid by Sir Bartle Frere on the 21st February 1867; and formal possession of the building was taken on the 24th March 1870. In the latter year also Sir Albert Sassoon presented a sum of Rs. 4,500 for the provision of book-shelves and furniture, and in 1873 presented a clock, which forms the chief feature of the front gable. The building, which was erected by the Public Works Department from the designs of Messrs. Scott, McClelland & Co., comprises a hall, containing a marble statue of David Sassoon completed in 1868, a spacious reading-room and library, and other smaller rooms. On the upper landing will be seen a marble tablet, which commemorates the foundation and reconstruction of the Institute, and also a marble bust of the late\nMr. James Berkley, Chief Resident Engineer of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, who up to the date of his death in 1862 was an active member of the Institute and did much to further its objects and interests. Donations were granted by two Parsi gentlemen for the purchase of books in 1877 and 1888, while in 1885 Mr. S. E. Sassoon placed a sum of Rs. 5,000 at the disposal of the institute. The library, which contains a fine collection of works of reference and of works on applied science, is utilized for the delivery of lectures at stated periods between November and March, the expenses connected with such lectures being partly defrayed by the Bombay Government, who have since 1856 contributed an annual grant of Rs. 300 for this purpose. Visitors to Bombay are permitted to use the library on payment of a sum of eight annas per week or two rupees per month. The invested funds of the institute amount to Rs. 23,500.\n\nSecretariat.\u2014So far as can be gathered the Secretaries to Government occupied certain rooms in Bombay Castle during the 17th century and up to the year 1758, when the demolition of the Fort House forced them to vacate their old quarters and find temporary accommodation in certain warehouses adjoining the Marine Yard. In 1760, as there was no immediate chance of securing permanent quarters, the Collector and the Fortification Paymaster were allowed to hire houses for their offices, but for some reason this permission was either not obtained or not acted upon in the case of the Secretary's and Accountant's offices. For in a joint letter to Government of the 22nd May 1754, they both animadverted upon the excessive inconvenience they were experiencing owing to the lack of proper office accommodation. Consequently, before the end of May 1764, in the absence of the Admiral, they were both permitted to remove their offices temporarily\n\n---\n\n1 In 1755 Captain de Funck wrote:\u2014Round the polygon interior of the Castle are some buildings for lodging a small part of the civil and military, besides the houses for the Governor's Council Room and public offices of the Accountant, Secretary, stores and treasury. (For further details see Bombay Gazetteer Materials, III, pp. 611-614)\n\n2 Pub. Diary 42 of 1764, pp. 327-28.\nto Mr. Whitehill's house, which formed part of a large block of buildings to the north of the Cathedral, the site of which is now occupied by the premises of Messrs. Kemp and Co. and the adjoining building. At the close of October 1764, Mr. Whitehill's house was purchased outright by Government for the use of the Secretary's office at a cost of Rs. 45,000 and the neighbouring house, belonging to Mr. John Hunter, was bought for Rs. 60,000 for the use of the other public offices, excluding the Marine.\n\nIn 1798 the Accountant's and other offices were ousted from Mr. Hunter's house to make room for the Sadr Adalat; but the Secretary's office continued undisturbed until 1829, when it was removed to the Old Secretariat buildings\u2014a large house on the west side of Apollo street, which is now chiefly occupied by the offices of the Government Solicitor. Here the Government offices were housed until 1874, the list of such offices in 1873 including not only the Secretariat offices proper, but those of the Sanitary Commissioner, the Collector of Salt Revenue, the Collector of Bombay and Superintendent of Stamps and Stationery.\n\nIn 1874 the Secretariat was transferred to the present building at the southern end of the great line of public offices facing Back Bay. The building was planned by Colonel Wilkins, R. E., in 1865; was commenced in April 1867 and completed in March 1874. It is in the Venetian-Gothic style; is 443 feet in length, and has two wings, each 81 feet in breadth. The Council Hall, Library and Committee Rooms occupy a portion of the first floor.\n\n---\n\n1 Maclean says that the site of this building was previously a tank, which Mr. Whitehill himself filled up.\n\n2 These two houses did not include quarters for the Secretary who resided in a house close by, which Government purchased from Mr. Ravenscroft in 1780 for Rs. 20,000 (vide Bombay Gazetteer Materials, III, p. 613).\n\n3 In 1814 Warden described the house as appropriated partly as a Council Chamber and partly for the Sadr Adalat.\n\n4 The Government Central Press was accommodated in the Old Secretariat until it was vacated in 1868.\n\n5 General Administration Report, 1873-74.\n\n6 The location of the various offices is shown upon a board in the entrance hall. The seating accommodation in the Council Hall has lately (1910) been increased for the benefit of the newly-constituted Legislative Council.\nThe cost of the building was Rs. 12,60,844. Owing to pressure of space the Stamp Office was removed from the Secretariat to the Town Hall in 1907. A portion of the top-floor is reserved as a residence for the Senior Under-Secretary to Government. Electric lights and fans have recently been installed throughout the building.\n\nSir J. J. School of Art.\u2014The idea of establishing Schools of Art in India followed a similar movement in England, inspired by the Exhibition of 1851.\n\nIn 1853 Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy offered a lakh of rupees towards the foundation of an Art School in Bombay which was accepted by the Court of Directors in the following year. A Committee, with Sir W. Yardley as President, was appointed to frame a scheme, and in 1857 Drawing Classes were opened under Mr. Peyton in the Elphinstone Institution. In July of the same year, Mr. Terry was despatched by the Court of Directors to Bombay as master of Drawing and Wood-engraving. In 1860 it was proposed to conduct classes throughout the whole working day, and accommodation was found for them in a house belonging to Sir J. Jeejeebhoy in Abdul Rehman street. By 1866 three new workshops or studios had been added, one for metal-work under Mr. Higgins, one for sculpture under Mr. Lockwood Kipling, and one for decorative painting under Mr. John Griffiths. Temporary buildings were erected by Government on the Esplanade for work in the applied arts. In 1871 the various studios were amalgamated under the superintendence of Mr. Terry; and in 1878 the present School of Art building was completed at a cost of nearly 2 lakhs. After Mr. Kipling's appointment to the School of Art at Lahore in 1880, sculpture ceased to be taught for some time until Mr. Griffiths recommenced it, with the object of meeting the demand for modelled ornament on public buildings. Mr. Terry retired, in the same year, but remaining in India he started the making of artistic pottery in the compound of the school, and the products of his kilns commanded for some years a very considerable sale.\n\nIn 1887 a class for the training of Drawing Masters was opened in connection with the establishment of Drawing\nclasses and examinations in the schools of the Presidency. In 1891 the Lord Reay Art Workshops were opened for cabinet-making and carving, carpet-weaving, iron-working, jewellery and metal work. In 1896 Mr. John Griffiths, who had succeeded Mr. Terry, retired and was succeeded by Mr. Greenwood, who in turn vacated the post of Principal in favour of Mr. C. L. Burns.\n\nThe School of Art, the Lord Reay Art Workshops and the Sir George Clarke Technical Laboratory and Studios are wholly maintained by Government and are under the Education Department. The staff comprises a Principal, a Vice-Principal, two European Professors and 29 Native teachers and clerks. Instruction in the School of Art is adapted to meet the needs of those who are studying to become painters and modellers, drawing masters in Government schools, and architectural draughtsmen. School of Art scholarships of a total value of Rs. 1,800 per annum tenable for two years, and ranging from Rs. 5 to Rs. 25 a month, are open to competition, while other scholarships of a total annual value of Rs. 1,068 are restricted to natives of certain parts of the Presidency or to members of a particular community. Prizes to the value of Rs. 400 are awarded each year to successful students. The number of students attending the classes in 1908-09 was 536.\n\nThe Lord Reay Art Workshops are intended to provide a higher training for young craftsmen than can be obtained by the daily practice of their craft or in mofussil craft-schools. Students are trained as teachers for local craft schools and the object of this branch is generally to foster the artistic industries of the Presidency. Each workshop is in charge of a native mistri, and the whole are under a Superintendent. Students are admitted free, and scholarships ranging in value from Rs. 2 to Rs. 15 per month are awarded to those who show special industry and proficiency. The number of students in 1908-09 was 265.\n\nThe Sir George Clarke Technical Laboratories and Studios occupy a new building in the School of Art compound, recently erected by Government at a cost of Rs. 98,000. Four European specialists will be engaged\nto work out improvements in the materials and technical processes employed in pottery and porcelain manufacture, weaving, ornamental metal and wood work. Selected students will receive instruction under these experts and will be trained to take charge of local craft schools. The first of these experts, a Pottery Instructor, was engaged in 1908. The building was opened by Sir George Clarke, Governor of Bombay, in 1909. When the four sections are at work, there will be few institutions of this character in the Empire better equipped than this.\n\nStatuary of Bombay.\u2014The Municipal Commissioner and the Executive Engineer, Presidency, are severally responsible for safeguarding the statues and \"monuments of the mighty dead,\" which now adorn the city. Among those in charge of the Executive Engineer, two of the most noteworthy are the marble statues of the Marquis Cornwallis and the Marquis Wellesley, which stand in the Elphinstone Circle garden. The former, which was executed by Bacon, was erected by public subscription after the death of the Marquis Cornwallis at Ghazipur in 1805, and bears a lengthy inscription to this effect. The work was to have been entrusted to Flaxman; and Sir James Mackintosh, the Recorder, who was one of the members of the committee appointed to carry the wishes of the public into effect, actually wrote a letter to the sculptor asking him to undertake the work; but, for some reason, now unknown, the task was eventually allotted to Bacon. The statue depicts the Marquis standing erect, is 6'-3\" in height, and rests upon a circular pedestal flanked by two female figures. Bacon was also the sculptor of the statue of the Marquis Wellesley, Governor-General of India (1798-1805), which was erected in 1814 by the merchants of Bombay as a memorial of his \"wisdom, energy and integrity.\" The statue originally stood on the site now occupied by the Queen's statue. The Marquis is repre-\n\n---\n\n1 Sir James Mackintosh's letter to John Flaxman is included in the memoirs of his Life, Vol. I, 265. Among Hindu constables of the Bombay City Police who have been ordered to the Head Police Office for reprimand or punishment it is customary to do \"puja\" to this statue, in the hope of receiving light punishment.\n\n2 Mr. K. N. Kabraji's Reminiscences, reprinted in the Times of India, 1901.\nsented in a sitting posture, holding a book in his left hand and presenting a wreath to a native soldier, while a female figure and a lion and lioness respectively decorate the left side and the rear of the pedestal. The Town Hall contains several fine specimens of the sculptor's art, as for example the standing marble figure of the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone, which was executed by Sir F. Chantrey and erected in the main hall in 1833. Behind it, facing northwards, in the portion of the building occupied by the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, is a marble statue of Major-General Sir John Malcolm (1739-1833), also the work of Sir F. Chantrey; and close at hand are a standing statue of Lord Elphinstone, subscribed for by the inhabitants of Bombay in 1860 and executed by J. H. Foley, and a seated figure of Stephen Babington (1790-1822), erstwhile Judge of the Sadr Diwani Adalat of Bombay and President of a committee for the revision of the revenue and judicial codes. This statue is also the work of Sir F. Chantrey. Opposite these, on the west side of the staircase, are marble statues of Charles Norris (1791-1842) and Sir Bartle Frere, the former\u2014a seated figure clad in a Roman toga, being the work of W. Theed, and the latter the work of F. Woolner. Sir Bartle Frere's connection with the city and Presidency needs no remark, and of Charles Norris it will suffice to say that he had a long and distinguished career in the service of the East India Company. Facing the statue of Sir John Malcolm is the seated marble figure of the first Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, whom the sculptor, C. Marochetti, has represented full in Parsi dress. This statue dates from 1858, while the great figure of Mr. Jagannath Shankarsett, which ornaments the open space below the staircase, dates from 1864, when it was erected by the inhabitants of Bombay as a tribute to one of their most illustrious fellow-citizens. Finally, on the north side of the custodian's room, is Chantrey's statue of Sir Charles Forbes, Bart., the author of \"Oriental Memoirs,\" which was erected by the native inhabitants of Bombay in 1841 to one whom they regarded as their \"disinterested benefactor and the tried and trusted friend of the people of India.\" Against the wall on the west side of the organ stands a marble bust,\nexecuted by Brock, of the late Mr. John Nugent, C.S.I., Member of Council, who died of cholera in Poona in 1900.\n\nIn the University gardens are two remarkable statues, one to the north of the Convocation Hall being Woolner's representation of the philanthropist Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney, K.C.S.I., which was erected by public subscription in 1873, and the other on the east of the Convocation Hall being Mosewan's statue of Thomas Ormiston, M.I.C.E., C.I.E., formerly Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, \"who, when Chief Engineer to the Bombay Port Trust, planned and constructed the Prince's Dock, the Prong's light-house, the Sunk Rock light-house, and other works in the city and harbour, to the lasting benefit of the people.\" This statue was erected in 1888 by his friends on a site granted by the Bombay University.\n\nClose at hand is the Sassoon Mechanics Institute, which contains a marble statue by Woolner of David Sassoon (1792-1864), erected in 1868. The south-east corner of the Oval is adorned with a statue of Sorabji Shapurji Bengali, C.I.E. (1831-1893), executed by Brock in 1897 at the public cost, while the north end of the Oval is occupied by a marble statue by Brock of Sir Richard Temple, Bart., Governor of Bombay (1877-1880), a seated bronze statue by Messrs. Broad & Sons of Lord Reay, Governor of Bombay (1885-1890), and by a marble statue of Lord Sandhurst, Governor of Bombay (1895-1900). These three statues were all erected by public subscription.\n\nThe chief statues of Royalty are the bronze equestrian statue by Boehm of His Majesty King Edward VII, which Sir Albert Sassoon presented to the city in 1876 in commemoration of His Majesty's visit as Prince of Wales, and the marble statue of the late Queen-Empress Victoria, which was presented to Bombay in 1872 by H. H. Khanderao, Gaekwar of Baroda. The King-Emperor's statue was unveiled by Sir Richard Temple on the 26th June 1879. At the sides of the granite base are panels representing His Majesty's landing at the dockyard and the presentation to him by Lord Northbrook of the Native Chiefs, and on the east side the presentation of flowers by Parsi girls at the children's\nf\u00eate on the Esplanade. The total cost of the statue was \u00a312,500. The Queen's statue, by Noble, which stands at the junction of Esplanade and Mayo roads, was unveiled by Lord Northbrook in 1872, and was originally intended to be a companion to the statue of the Prince Consort in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The statue, which is very finely chiselled, is 8 feet high, and is overhung by a canopy and Gothic gable rising to a height of 42 feet, while around the base are panels containing inscriptions in four languages, which commemorate the Gaekwar's gift. During the unrest following upon the plague policy of Government in 1897, some miscreant seriously damaged the statue by pouring a bucket of tar and chunam over it, which left almost indelible stains upon the marble; and in consequence the statue had for a considerable period to be screened from the public gaze. It was at first proposed to affix a new head to the statue; but in the meantime Professor T. K. Gujjar experimented with chemicals and successfully cleansed the marble of all stains; and the statue was again unveiled in November 1898. The total cost of the statue was \u00a318,000, exclusive of the cost of the surrounding railing, which amounted to Rs. 7,000. Noble was likewise the sculptor of the marble statue of Albert Prince Consort, which was erected by Sir David Sassoon in 1864, in the Victoria and Albert Museum at Bycula, but the group of royal statues will not be complete until the statue of H. R. H. the Prince of Wales, presented by Sir Sassoon J. David, Kt., has been erected in the grounds of the proposed Prince of Wales' Museum of Western India, to commemorate the visit of His Royal Highness to Bombay in November, 1905.\n\nOpposite the Municipal Offices, at the junction of Hornby road and Fort street, stands a marble statue of Dr. Thomas Blaney, C.I.E., (1823-1903) by Valla, which was erected by public subscription in 1893 as a memorial of the services which he rendered to Bombay during a period of half a century; while at the junction of Frere and Mint roads is a public fountain erected in 1894 and crowned by a statue of Dharamsi Ratanji Mulji, to whose memory the fountain was erected by his father. Another\nland-mark is the metal statue of Cursetjee Manekji (1763-1845) which crowns the public fountain in Bellasis road, Byculla; and the bronze statue of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy in full Parsi dress, which stands in the hall of the J. J. Hospital, is a fitting memorial to one without whose munificent aid the hospital could never have been built. The only other statue of note is that of the Honorable Mounstuart Elphinstone (1779-1859) by Noble, which was erected in 1860 in the Victoria and Albert Museum by members of the Elphinstone College.\n\nBombay can also boast of several well-executed busts. Over the north-west porch of the Telegraph Office is a marble bust of the late Queen-Empress, while the southwest porch is similarly adorned with a marble bust of the late King-Emperor. The University building contains busts of Sir Bartle Frere by Woolner, of Dr. John Wilson by Adams, of James Gibbs, Vice-Chancellor (1870-79) by Belt, of Henry Fawcett, and of Sir George Birdwood in bronze. The Sassoon Mechanics' Institute preserves a marble bust of James Berkley (1819-1862) and above the front porch of the Elphinstone College is a bust of Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney, executed at the School of Art in 1892. In Dockyard road stands a public fountain surmounted by a terra-cotta medallion of Captain G. Henry (1822-77), for many years Superintendent at Bombay of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, who died from injuries received in a carriage-accident near that spot; while a marble bust by Westmacott of Mr. Bomanji Hormasji Wadia stands above the public fountain in Bazaar Gate street, and a bronze of Mr. Devidas Pranjivandas Mehta is placed over a public fountain in Gowalia Tank road. Moving along Hornby road one arrives at the Municipal Offices, in the Council Hall of which are busts of Sir Charles Ollivant, Municipal Commissioner (1881-1890), by Roscoe Mullins, of Sir Frank Souter, Commissioner of Police (1864-1888) by the same sculptor, of Mr. H. A. Acworth, Municipal Commissioner (1890-95) by Wade, of Rao Saheb V. N. Mandlik (1833-1889), of Dr. Thomas Blaney, of H. M. the late Queen-Empress Victoria, executed at the Bombay School of Art, and of Mr. W. L. Harvey, Municipal Commis-\nsioner (1898-1905). The hall also contains a bust of Captain G. Henry, who was Chairman of the Corporation from 1873 to 1875. In front of the main entrance to the Head Police Office is a bust of Sir Frank Souter by Mullins, which was erected by his European and Indian subordinates in 1889; while under the main stair-case of the Cama Hospital on the Esplanade is a bust of Mr. Pestonji Hormasji Cama, C.I.E., the founder of the institution, and in the Allbless Hospital is a white marble bust of Lady Reay.\n\nKeshavji Naik's Fountain at Dongri, which was opened by Sir Philip Wodehouse in 1876, bears a medallion of the generous donor; and a somewhat similar medallion adorns the Jadhavji Raghavji cattle-trough opened in Falkland road in 1873. The Municipal Commissioner has charge of a fine bust of Lord Northbrook by Messrs. Bigongiari Muraglia, which was erected on the central path of the Northbrook Gardens in 1874, and also of busts of Lady Frere (1862), of Earl Canning by Noble (1864), of David Sassoon by Woolner (1865), and of H. M. King Edward VII by Marshal Wood (1876), all of which are in the Victoria and Albert Museum at Byculla. The busts of Lady Frere and of H. M. the King-Emperor are of plaster of Paris; the other two are of marble. Nor must one omit mention of the Grant Medical College with its marble busts of Dr. G. Ballingall, Dr. C. Morehead, Dr. R. Haines, Dr. J. Pett, and Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy. A plaster of Paris bust of the last-named philanthropist stands in the hospital, which bears his name; a marble bust of Sir Dinsha M. Petit is preserved likewise in the hospital which he founded, while a bust of Bai Motibai M. Wadia adorns the porch of the Obstetric Hospital which owed its foundation to her benevolence. In the passage between the Bhownaggree Home and the quarters of the nursing sisters is a marble bust of Bai Avabai Merwanji Bhownaggree (1869-1888), which was erected by her friends in 1892.\n\nStrangers' Friend Society Home.\u2014The Strangers' Friend Society was founded in 1863 for the purpose of relieving European Vagrancy in Bombay, and commenced by arranging for the boarding out of distressed Europeans.\nAs this system proved unsatisfactory, the society secured a bungalow at Colaba, which was relinquished in 1871 in favour of a building opposite the Hope Hall Hotel in Mazagon. In 1879 the present building and land in Love Lane were granted to the Society by Government. The average daily number of inmates of the home is about 15; and the period within which an inmate is expected to find employment is one month. The income of the home is derived from an invested capital of Rs. 1,35,000 and an annual Government grant of Rs. 3000. A paid Superintendent resides in the home, the affairs of which are managed by a committee of six and an honorary secretary.\n\nSynagogues:\u2014The Bene Israel of Bombay possess two synagogues and two prayer halls. The newer synagogue is in Donad street and was founded in 1843. The old synagogue in Samuel street, Mandvi was built in 1796 by Samaji Hasaji (i.e., Samuel Ezekiel), who enlisted about 1750 in the British Indian army. He eventually rose to be native commandant of the 6th Battalion, served in the 2nd Mysore war, and was taken prisoner by Tipu Sultan. His life was spared through the intervention of Tipu's mother and her chief maulawi; and escaping a few years later he made his way to Bombay and there in gratitude for his deliverance built the synagogue, which is now known as Shaar Harahmeno, i.e., the Gate of Mercy. Ezekiel died at Cochin in 1797. The synagogue was rebuilt in 1860.\n\nTechno-Chemical Laboratory\u2014For the encouragement of chemical research, Professor T. K. Gajjar established in 1899 a Techno-Chemical Laboratory near the tram terminus on Girgaum road, and laid down a three years' course of study in higher chemistry and a one year's course for technological study. The higher chemistry course was adopted with some modifications by the Bombay University for its M. A. Degree, and since 1907 the laboratory has been recognized by the University for post-graduate studies in chemistry. Arrangements were first made with one of the Professors of St Xavier's College to lecture to the students of the laboratory three days a week. Later a permanent staff of qualified teachers was\nengaged. The number of candidates who successfully passed the M.A. Examination in 1909 was 11. Several of Professor Gajjar's students have obtained professorial appointments in various colleges in India, while others have opened factories. Students of the Grant Medical College attend the laboratory for the study of practical chemistry for the purpose of their examinations; and a certain number of medical men make use of the clinical laboratory of the institution. Among the technological subjects studied in the laboratory are soap-manufacture, dyeing, bleaching, yarn-testing, electro-gilding, perfumery, photography, dairy, chemistry, distillation and rectification of spirit, the manufacture of matches, glass pottery, lac and oils. The analyses of minerals and prospecting work have also been carried out on occasions by the experts of the laboratory, while a very large number of samples of manufactures, etc., are tested and analysed for private firms and individuals. Attached to the laboratory is a pharmaceutical institute where a germicide is prepared. The staff of the laboratory comprises a Director, Assistant Director, Professors of Chemistry, Mineralogist, and Demonstrators and Analysts, aided by the necessary clerical and menial establishment. The annual expenditure of the laboratory amounts to about Rs. 15,000 which is chiefly defrayed by Professor Gajjar. A scale of fees payable by students for a three years' course has been drawn up, namely Rs. 200 for the first year, Rs. 400 for the second and Rs. 600 for the third, or, when compounded, a lump-sum of Rs. 1,000; but in the majority of cases the fees have either not been collected or have been set off against scholarships granted by the Director.\n\nTelegraph Office.\u2014In 1867 the Telegraph Office was removed from Tamarind lane to No. 9, Church Gate street, where it remained until 1874. Meanwhile, the question of erecting a proper Telegraph Office had been since 1867 under discussion by Government who originally intended to erect a single edifice for both the Post and Telegraph Offices. This idea was, however, abandoned;\n\n---\n\n1 This building is the second house immediately behind the premises now known as Watson house.\n2 General Administration Report, 1868-69.\nand in 1869 a plan and estimate for a separate office, to be built on a site immediately north of the present Post Office, were submitted for sanction to the Government of India. In 1870 the foundations were laid, and in April 1874 the building, designed and executed by Mr. Paris, the Government architect, was handed over for occupation. The building, which is in the modern Gothic style, with its principal fa\u00e7ade towards the west, has three floors, and as originally designed was 182 ft. in length and 56 in breadth; but within the space of 15 years, the growth of traffic and increase of lines necessitated the addition of a southern wing, completed about 1887. Recently a further extension has been made towards the Post Office, which has increased the total length of the building to 374 ft.\n\nThe building provides accommodation for the Superintendent in charge of the central office, his staff and establishment, for the offices of the Divisional Superintendent, the Assistant Superintendent and the Meteorological Reporter, and for the residential quarters of the officers in charge of the signal office, the Bombay sub-division and the cable office. On the ground floor are the receiving hall, delivery office and battery rooms; and on the first floor are the signal office and all electrical apparatus, the north wing being assigned to the Eastern Telegraph Company which despatches via Suez all messages for Europe and America. There is no cessation of work by night or by day. About 270 signallers grouped in three batches with their complement of clerks, punchers, checkers, sorters and peons attend in rotation. The duties from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. are divided into two groups while the night-watch lasts from 9-30 p.m. to 9-30 a.m. The traffic is at its lowest ebb between 3 and 4 a.m. and at its highest between 3 and 7 p.m.\n\nThe signallers' quarters in Waudby road, which were designed by Paris and completed in 1876, provide accommodation for 30 signallers and 4 telegraph masters as well as a reading-room and recreation-rooms.\n\n---\n\n1 P.W.D. Administration Reports, 1867-68, 1868-69 and 1869-70.\nTemples\u2014The Hindu temples of Bombay number approximately four hundred, one of the most interesting groups being that at Bhuleshwar, which comprises more than 40 separate shrines. At Walkeshwar there are 33 separate temples, while a third group of about 26 temples is situated in the environs of Byculla. A fourth important group is situated at Mumbadevi and a fifth at Sion. The temples which attract the largest number of worshippers and visitors are those of Walkeshwar, Mumbadevi, Mahalakshmi, Babulnath, Mankeshwar, Durgadevi and Lakshmi Narayan in Madhav Bagh. The Thakurdwar temple in Girgaum, which was built before 1836, and the old Wageshwari temples in Parel are also well patronised, the latter in particular by the older castes of Bombay. Among Jain temples, the most noteworthy are one at the corner of Parel road, facing Paidhoni, and another built for the use of Swetambar Jains on Malabar hill in 1903. The latter contains two chief images, one of Rishabhadev, to whom the temple is dedicated, and the other of Parasnath, and in addition to these several images of very great age, four of which were brought from Cambay and the remainder from a village near Jodhpur. A largely attended festival is held at this temple on the anniversary of its foundation. The temple at Paidhoni is one of several so-called Deras maintained by Jains of the Shravak division. Other sects of Hindus have their own special temples, as, for example, the Vallabhbacharyas, who possess about six, the Swami Narayan sect which has temples in Bhoiwada and Kandewadi, the Radhavallabhis, and the Ramanujas. The Prarthana Samajists, the Arya Samajists and the Brahmo Samajists have their own places of prayer in Girgaum. To most temples a dharmashala is attached, which is usually occupied by Sadhus of various denominations. Among certain classes, particularly the Kamathis, temples dedicated to manifestations of Shiva in his terrific aspect are known as Rawule and Dewule. The Indian name for the temple is Dewul,\u2014a corruption of Dewalaya. Amongst Gujaratis it is usually called Mandir.\n\nFor a detailed description of every temple, see the Hindu Temples of Bombay by K. Raghunathji, 1900.\nBrief descriptions of the principal places of worship in the city are subjoined.\n\nThe Babulnath temple, which is said to have taken its name from the individual, who built the original shrine about 1780,\\(^1\\) stands about half-way down the south-east portion of Malabar hill, a little to the south of the steps leading to the Parsi towers of silence. The chief object of worship is a black stone lingam of Mahadev, which is supposed to have been discovered near Varli. From the outset the pleasant surroundings of the shrine and its proximity to the city rendered it popular. A new and larger temple was commenced in 1836 and completed about 1840 by subscription among the Gujarat Banias and Bhattias of the city. Subsequently a claim of the Parsi community to the land around the temple was successfully contested in the High Court, whereupon the same communities combined to rebuild the temple in its present form. The present temple with its high spire and pillared hall and terrace was completed about 1900. The warden of the shrine is a Gujarat Brahman, who keeps the nandadip burning, and presides at the daily services, which are attended by about twenty persons. On Mondays, the visitors, who are mostly Gujarat traders, number more than two hundred; while on Mondays in the month of Shravan, the concourse of devotees numbers more than one thousand. A special feature of the worship in Shravan is the ghipuja or worship in clarified butter. Over the lingam is erected a lotus, a representation of the Ganges or a five-hooded serpent, decorated with patches of gold, silver or mica. Another of the chief occasions of worship is the Pithori Amavasya which falls on the last day of the month of Bhadrapad (Aug.-Sept).\n\nThe Bhuleshwar, or more properly Bholeshwar (Bhola, pure-minded and Ishwar, god) temple is situated in the heart of the busiest portion of the city.\\(^2\\) The accounts of its origin are various. Some say that a Pardesi named Bholanath founded it, calling the god Shiva, to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The name may equally well have been derived from the Babul tree and represent a legacy of aboriginal tree worship (Mumbaicha Vrittant).\n\n\\(^2\\) See Indian Antiquary, IV. 1875.\nwhom it was dedicated, after his own name; others say that it was built by a Bania widow, to enshrine a lingam discovered by some labourers engaged in digging the foundations of a house on the site; while others again believe that a woman of the Koli or fishing caste was responsible for its erection. A fourth account relates that the temple was built by a Shenvi, named Mangesh Anandrao Donde, who purchased the site from the widow of a Sutar (carpenter), to whom the ground, forming part of Pophalwadi belonged and who sold it in lots after her husband's demise. The temple is built of black stone. The dome is octangular and otherwise ornamental, and is a notable example of native architectural skill and ingenuity. The copula is covered with a brass-plate and has attached to it a red ochre-coloured pataka or flag adorned with representations of the sun and the moon. The original Bhuleshwar temple was built about 200 years ago; and the present temple, which supplanted it, was erected at a cost of Rs. 40,000 by subscription about the year 1830. The sabha mandap and pavement were added in 1889 by a Shenvi; while a second sabha mandap for the singing of kirtans and the recitation of purans was built at a later date by a member of the Sutar caste. In front of the latter is a well-built stone tank.\n\nThe lingam within the inner sanctuary is swayambhu or self-generated, and is said to have miraculously risen out of the ground in its present position. The inner shrine also contains images of Parvati and Ganesh. At the edge of the pavement, which leads to the stereotyped figure of Nandi, is a stone enclosure containing images of Sitaladevi, which are supposed to exercise a healing effect upon children suffering from small-pox. The lingam is worshipped thrice daily, the evening worship usually concluding with the arti ceremony. The visitors and worshippers at the temple are drawn from all castes and classes, particularly on Mondays during the month of Shravan and at the festival of Mahashivaratra, when\n\n1 Some say it was built by a Koli named Bholya.\n2 The belief in the efficacy of these figures is not confined to Hindus. Muhammadans have occasionally taken their sick children there also. Fifty years ago Parsis were occasionally known to make vows to the goddess. (Times of India, 6.6.1861).\nthe attendance numbers several thousand. Fairs are held at the temple on the Kojagri Purnima day in the month of Ashwin and the Tripuri Purnima day in Kartik, and palkhi processions take place on both occasions. The Tripuri Purnima procession visits all localities inhabited by Shenvi families.\n\nThe Mahalakshmi temple at Breach Candy is a simple structure containing images of the goddesses Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Mahasaraswati, who are themselves representations of the goddess Durga. The image of Mahalakshmi is represented as riding partly on the back of the demon Mahishasur and partly on a tiger. All three images are adorned with nose-rings, gold bangles and pearl necklaces, presented by devotees whose prayers have been answered. The dipmals outside the temple, the stone pavement round it and the steps leading up to it were similarly built in pursuance of vows. Not far from the temple is a small tank built by one Tulsidas Gopaldas in 1824 and on the western side of the tank are shrines of Shankar and Ranchhodji. Other temples in the enclosure are dedicated to Mayureshwari, Rameshwari, Dhakleshwar, Hari Narayan and Vinayakaditya, of which the Dhakleshwar temple, which cost Rs. 80,000, and is named after the builder, Dhakji Dadaji, is marked by excellent workmanship and is visible twenty-five miles out at sea. The pratishtha or installation ceremony of Mahalakshmi was performed by a Yajurvedi Brahman of Bombay, named Shama-charya.\n\nA legend connected with the Mahalakshmi temple relates that during the era of Muhammadan domination the goddess was so persecuted that she leapt from the shore into the Varli creek and remained in hiding there until after the Portuguese had ceded the island to the English. When the first attempts were made to shut out the sea from the central portion of the island by building a dam between Mahalakshmi and Varli, the work was continually interrupted by the force of the incoming tide, and much money was wasted in apparently fruitless endeavours to check the force of the waves. At this\n\n---\n\n1 His descendants have a patent granted by the British Government corroborating this fact and showing also that one Malhar Nayak performed the pratishtha of Bhuleshwar.\njuncture the goddess appeared in a vision to one Ramji Shivji, a Prabhu contractor, and promised that, if he tendered his services to Government for the construction of a causeway, she would remove all obstacles, provided that he first removed the images of herself and her two sister goddesses from their watery resting place and established them in a proper shrine on land. Ramji acted according to these divine instructions and eventually, after the Hornby Vellard had been successfully built, obtained from the Bombay Government a grant of the site upon which the temples still stand. The proximity of the shrine of Mama Hajiyani (Mother Pilgrim) has given rise to a saying that under British rule Mama and Mahalakshmi have joined hands, or in other words that the old animosity between Musalman saints and Hindu gods has disappeared. In all probability the Mahalakshmi temple was originally patronised by the aboriginal Kolis and Agris only, and as time went on gradually attracted the attention of the higher classes of Hindus, such as the Prabhus and the Banias, who now subscribe considerable sums towards the cost of the annual fair in the month of Chaitra and of the Navaratra festival.\n\nThe original temple of Mumbadevi or Mumbai is supposed to have been constructed and attended by the Koli fishermen of Bombay, and was situated near the old Phansi Talao (Gibbet Tank) on a spot now included within the limits of the Victoria Terminus of the G. I. P. Railway. The goddess Mumbai, or Mombai, from whose name the English word Bombay has been derived, was unquestionably an aboriginal personification of the earth-mother, who is still worshipped under various appellations by the Dravidian population of Western and Southern India. About 1737, when the Bombay Government set to enlarging the fortifications of the old Town, the original temple was demolished, and a new temple was erected on the present site under the orders of Government by one Pandu Sonar, who was at that date a merchant of considerable influence in Bombay.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 It is said to have been completed in 1753. For past references to this temple, see Mrs. Graham's Journal, 1813, and Mrs. Elwood's Narrative, 1830.\nThe modern shrine of Mumbadevi contains an image of the goddess dressed in a robe and bodice with a silver crown, a nose-stud and golden necklaces, and seated under a domed mukhar of wood, covered with silver plates. On the left is a stone figure of Annapurna, who is worshipped with Mumbadevi and on special days is seated on a stone peacock. In front of the shrine is a brass tiger, the vahan or carrier of the goddess, which was presented by a pearl merchant in 1890, and is washed and worshipped daily with the goddess. Tuesday is the chief day of worship in ordinary seasons, when the devotees of the goddess break cocoanuts in front of the shrine, pour the contents over the tiger, and then hand the halves to the pujari, an Audich Brahman, who places one-half at the feet of the goddess and returns the other half to the worshipper, together with a flower or sweetmeat that has touched the goddess as prasad. One proof of the local importance of Mumbadevi is that among the Kolis, Panchkalshis and other local Marathi-speaking castes, the bride and bridegroom are taken on or after the marriage-day to the shrine, and present the goddess with a cocoanut, a bodice or a jewel, according to their means, in the hope that she will render their future free from ill-luck. The two great annual festivals occur during the nine days of the month of Ashwin which precede the Dasara festival and the five days of the month Margashirsha. On the former occasion mixed millet and rice are sown on the first day in front of the shrine; on the seventh day a square sacrificial pit is dug and consecrated by a Brahman, in which on the following day a fire (hom) is kindled and fed with grain, ghi and cocoanuts, while on the tenth day or Dasara the seedlings, which have been carefully nurtured since they were first sown, are plucked up, washed and presented to the goddess, and are also distributed among the worshippers, who place them in their hair, or in the front of their turbans. On the occasion of the shorter festival in Margashirsha no seed is sown; but a sacrificial fire is prepared, into the ashes of which the devotees dip the third finger of the right-hand and then mark the forehead between the eyebrows. Other shrines\nwithin the Mumbadevi temple enclosure are dedicated to Ganesh, Maruti, Mahadev, Indrayani, Murlidhar, Jagan-nath, Narsova and Balaji. The big tank in front of the Mumbadevi temple was built by a Kapol Bania named Nagardas Navlakhya, and all the temples and properties round the tank now belong to his great-grandson.\n\nThe Walkeshwar locality at the southern extremity of Malabar hill has been dowered with sanctity from the earliest times. Its name, which is compounded of Valuka (sand) and Ishwar (God), and signifies the God of the Sand, owes its origin to the legend that Rama, when on his way to Lanka (Ceylon), in quest of Sita, halted on the very spot where the Walkeshwar temple now stands. There he took advice of certain Brahman ascetics as to what he should do in order to regain his wife from the clutches of Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka; and they advised him to raise a lingam on the spot and worship Shiva or Mahadev. Rama accordingly despatched his brother Lakshman to Benares to bring thence a lingam of supreme potency, and he himself in the meantime fashioned a lingam of the sand of the seashore and performed over it the pranpratishta or life-creating ceremony. This sand lingam is supposed to have leaped into the sea on the advent of the Portuguese to Bombay, in order to avoid pollution, while the other lingam which Lakshman eventually brought from Benares is said to be the identical one now worshipped in the Walkeshwar temple.\n\nSo far as can be gathered from the few relics of it still in existence, the original temple of Walkeshwar was built by the Silaharas of the north Konkan (A.D. 810-1240) and was eventually destroyed either by the Muhammadans or by the Portuguese, after the cession of the island to them by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. The remains at the\n\n---\n\n1 The spot whence it disappeared into the sea is close to Government House, Malabar Point; and certain of the fishermen of Bombay are accustomed to worship the spot at the Maha Shivaratra festival.\n\n2 Moore, the author of the Hindu Pantheon, (1800-1810) speaks of the remains of a rather elegant temple near the Shrigundi or Lucky Rock at Malabar Point. Fragments of well-hewn stone were still to be seen over and around its site, having a variety of images sculptured on their surface. Many of the most useful\npresent day consist of several richly-carved stones and other fragments, dating apparently from the 10th century A.D. and lying close to the existing temple, and of a finely carved slab depicting Narayan in a recumbent attitude guarded by the hooded snake, which has been built into the wall of a small temple immediately opposite the entrance of the highest passage leading down to Walkeshwar village. The original temple doubtless derived a large measure of its sanctity from the proximity of the Shri-Gundi (Lucky Hollow or Lucky Stone), which since the early years of British rule has been styled Malabar Point after the pirates of Dharmapatan, Kotta and Porka on the Malabar Coast, who used to lie in wait for the northern fleet under the lee of the north end of Back Bay. According to Moore (1800-10) the Shri-Gundi was a cleft rock at the very end of Malabar Point\u2014a fancied yoni, of no easy access by reason of its elevation and in the stormy season incessantly surf-buffeted. Hither resorted numerous pilgrims, intent upon self-regeneration by the perilous passage of the yoni, which was considered capable of driving out all sin. Men and women, high caste and low caste, used to make their way down the rugged rocks to the opening, and then crawl head first up the sacred cleft, not a few of them finding the passage impassable and having to be helped down again, baffled and still burdened with the sense of guilt. Among the greater actors in the history of Bombay, who are said to have passed through the rock, were Shivaji, who desired perhaps to be free of the haunting presence of the murdered Afzal Khan, Kanhoji Angria (1690-1730), who visited\n\nstones had been taken to help the erection in the neighbouring Brahman villages of a fine tank and temples. Moore had the site cleared. Some feet underground he found in a state of mutilation the same triform head which forms the central sculpture in Elephanta. This sculpture, which is pictured at plate 81 of Moore's Pantheon, was carried to the India House Museum and is now believed to be in the South Kensington Museum.\n\n1 The slab has now been daubed all over with paint of various colours and it is almost impossible for a stranger to recognize its antiquity.\n\n2 Dharmapatan is 4 miles north of Tellicherry; Kotta or Kottakul is 15 miles south of it; and Porka or Purakkat is 10 miles south of Alepiti. In 1668 the trade of Bombay was so exposed to the attacks of Malabar pirates and of Shivaji's fleet that three small armed ships had to be built as convoys. Bruce's Annals, II. (344.)\nBombay by stealth, and lastly Raghunath Rao Peshwa who, during his sojourn as an exile on Malabar hill (1774-1780), sought to rid his soul of the guilt of Narayan Rao's death by passing through the sacred orifice.\n\nThe modern temple of Walkeshwar was built in or about the year 1715 by Rama Kamat, a member of the Gaud Sarasvat or Shenvi community and a person of considerable importance in Bombay at the opening of the eighteenth century. The whole village of Walkeshwar lying between the sea and the area now occupied by Government House grounds and the road leading thereto, is said by the Shenvis to have been set aside as the property of the temple; and as the population of the village at that date (1715) was only 40 and the whole of Malabar hill was a refuge for robbers and bad characters, the Gaud Saraswat community, as owners of the village, gave permission to Hindus of other sects to build temples and dharmashalas there, charging them no ground-rent for the land so occupied. A recent decision of the High Court lays down that the Shenvis' claim is not founded on any solid basis, and Government now claim most of the village and hill as their property. Walkeshwar at the present day contains fully twenty-three temples, dedicated to Mahadev, Maruti, Rama, Ganesh, Laksmi Narayan, Balaji, Krishna and Shri Dattatraya, as well as two large maths or hermitages of the Smart and Vaishnava sects and several samadhis or burial-grounds of dead ascetics.\n\nThe temple of Walkeshwar, built of stone and surmounted by a tall dome, comprises a sanctuary and sabhamandap, of which the former is paved with slabs of marble\u2014the gift of a Bhattia, Mr. Vasanji Devji and\n\n---\n\n1 Moore's Hindu Pantheon, 395-397; and Grose's Voyage to the East Indies, I, 56-57. Moore himself tried several times to pass through the yoni, but never succeeded, though others of greater bulk slipped through with apparent ease.\n\n2 Rama Kamat was the Rama Kamati whom Governor Boone imprisoned for supposed treasonable dealings with Angria, see Vol. II. pp. 92, 93. He seems to have been a man of catholic sympathies; he built several temples for those of his own faith and also attended with his castemen the opening service of St. Thomas' Church (Cathedral) on Xmas Day, 1715.\n\n3 Two of these temples, one of Mahadev and the other of Ganesh, were founded by Sir Mangaldas Nathubhai.\ncontains the *swayambhu* or self-created *lingam* of Shiva. Near it are images of Ganesh and Parvati. The daily worship of the images is performed by a Gujarati Brahman and a Shenvi Brahman, who together with a Gurav or Bhopi constitute the temple staff. Large fairs are held at Walkeshwar on the full-moon day of *Kartik* (October-November) and on Mahashivaratri, on both of which days *palkhi* processions take place, which are attended by more than 5,000 persons. In front of the temple is a fine masonry tank, called the Banganga or sacred stream of the arrow, the origin of which is variously ascribed to Rama and Parashurama, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu, and which is credited with the possession of marvelous spiritual properties. On this account both sexes are accustomed to bathe in the tank on the occasion of the great Hindu festivals. Beyond the temple on the western foreshore is another square pool, called the Ramkund, which is regarded with almost equal veneration.\n\nAt the present day (1909), Walkeshwar has expanded into a considerable residential quarter; for, apart from its tank and temples, it contains several dwelling houses,\n\n---\n\n1 Rama, while sojourning at Walkeshwar, is said to have felt thirsty, and finding no water, he launched an arrow which sped deep into *Patal* or the nether regions and released the river Bhagavati, which straightway welled up and formed the tank. The alternative story is that the water was created by one of the arrows fired by Parashurama from the summit of the Sahyadris. The Banganga is mentioned in the Sahyadri Khand, II, I, as one of the *tirthas* or sacred spots of pilgrimage in Western India.\n\nGrose (Voyage to the East Indies) mentions Walkeshwar in 1750 in the following terms:\u2014\"On this hill (Malabar) which is far from a high one, and of easy ascent, about a mile from that ascent, after passing a plain a-top of it, on a gentle declivity to the sea side, stands the Gentoo Pagoda, with a large tank or pond a few feet from it, and is of fresh water, formed by the draining of the rains, though not many yards from the sea, with which it is near on a level, on the side that is open to it, all but where the Pagoda stands between a part of it and the shore. The other three sides are furnished with trees that form an amphitheatre on the slopes of the hill towards it, than which no prospect that I ever saw or can conceive forms a more agreeably wild landscape. The trees, open to all the force of the winds, follow the general law, and take a strong bent to the opposite point from them, but with such regularity that one would think they had been trimmed or pruned to the figure they exhibit.\"\n\nFryer in his New Account of East India and Persia (1672) speaks of the \"remains of a stupendous Pagoda near the tank of fresh water, which the Malabars visited it mostly for.\"\nrest-houses and a charitable school and dispensary, while in the immediate neighbourhood of Banganga and amid the cenotaphs of ascetics on the sea-shore dwells an ever-changing colony of Bairagis or Gosavis, who spend their lives in ceaseless peregrinations to all the great shrines that lie between Cape Comorin and the Himalayas. There is perhaps no more curious contrast in the whole of Bombay than the juxtaposition of the residence of the Governor and the fashionable European dwelling quarter with the ancient temple, the famous tank, and the old-world hermitages of Shri Walkeshwar.\n\nAlthough the sun is one of the principal Vedic deities, very few temples are dedicated to the worship of the Sun God in India. One of the chief reasons assigned for this is that the consecration rites of a Surya Narayan temple are very elaborate, and for their proper performance learned Brahmans of the Saura or Maga division are required. As such Brahmans are not available, and as any flaw or defect in the due performance of the rites is believed to bring misfortune, few people venture to build temples for this deity, preferring to worship the great luminary in the morning and at noon at home. Through the munificence of a Kapol merchant of Bombay, Harjiwan VasANJI Maniyar, the city has recently obtained a beautiful temple dedicated to the worship of the Sun God. This temple of Shri Surya Narayana is situated in Surajwadi, Panjrapol lane, Bhuleshwar. The foundation stone was laid by the owner Harjiwan in 1895. Unfortunately a few months later Harjiwan VasANJI died. The work of building the temple was, however, continued by his wife Radhabai, and it was completed in 1899. Great care was taken to obtain Brahmans well versed in the Hindu scriptures to perform the consecration ceremony, and these difficult rites were performed jointly by the Audich Brahmans of Gujarat and the Yajurvedi Brahmans of Bombay. Prominent among those who assisted at the Pratishtha ceremony were Narottam Shastri Shukla, Nilkanth Shastri Padhye and Baba Pathak, author of the Sanskrit work on Rituals called Sanskar Bhaskar.\n\nThe temple is built of white stone, and at the main entrance there are carved figures of the celestial gate-\nkeepers (dvara-pals) called Jay and Vijay. There is a spacious hall for the reading of Purans and galleries for the use of Sadhus and visitors. In the quadrangle on stone pillars are sculptured the Sapta Rishis or the seven sages, viz., 1 Marichi, 2 Angiras, 3 Atri, 4 Pulastya, 5 Pulaha, 6 Kratu, and 7 Vashishtha. At the entrance of the inner sanctuary, which is paved with marble, stand the figures of Maruti and Ganesh, and of the Apsaras or celestial damsels. In the inner sanctuary seated in a one-wheeled chariot is the Sun-God wearing a crown; on his right and left stand his two wives, Prabha and Chhaya. The chariot is drawn by a horse with seven faces and the driver is the Sun God's lame charioteer Aruna. The temple was built at a cost of about Rs. 10,000; and at the back of the temple are an oart and dharmashala which are used for the performance of religious ceremonies.\n\nTheatres.\u2014The original Bombay Theatre, which stood on the old Bombay Green (Elphinstone Circle) was built by subscription in 1770, and for a few years only managed to pay its way. The ground upon which it stood was granted by Government unconditionally and the building was vested in trustees. Unfortunately the proceeds of the performances did not suffice to keep the building in proper repair, and in 1818 it had become so dilapidated that Government were obliged to make a fresh grant for its renovation, on condition that it was used solely for public theatrical entertainments. The renovated building was finally opened in 1819 with a debt of Rs. 17,000, which gradually increased to Rs. 23,000 about 1836. The chief creditors were Messrs. Forbes and Company. Government thereupon discharged the debt, took possession of the theatre and sold it for Rs. 14,870, the remainder of the debt being defrayed\n\n---\n\n1 The Bombay Courier of 1811 contains an advertisement showing that the price of a box or of a seat in the pit was Rs. 8 and \"no gentleman was allowed behind the scenes\". See also Bombay Courier, September and, 1820. \"On Tuesday evening, the 12th instant, will be performed the Favourite Farce of the apprentice after which the interlude of the Manager's Ante-Room, to conclude with the Village Lawyer.

This left a balance in the hands of Government, which it was decided, at a public meeting in the Town Hall in 1836, should be devoted to building a market and subsidising a central library and dispensary.\n\nNothing more is heard of a theatre till 1842, when Mr. Jagannath Shankarsett offered a site on the north side of Grant road, midway between Bhendy Bazaar and Girgaum, for the construction of a new theatre. By 1843 the structure had been partially erected and a public meeting was held in May of that year to consider the best method of raising fresh funds to complete it. Apparently the money was forthcoming, for Mr. K. N. Kabraji described it as \"standing alone in 1850 like an oasis in the desert.\" Some years later the building disappeared.\n\nAnother well-known theatre during the early years of the 19th century was the Artillery theatre at Matunga, which was described in the contemporary press as a \"small building converted into a theatre whose few decorations exhibit neatness and taste. The scenery was very good and the music excellent.\" A great entertainment was held here at the beginning of November 1820, when all Bombay society, including the Governor, witnessed a performance of \"Miss in her Teens and the Padlock,\" and thereafter proceeded to a supper and ball in Naigaum House.\n\nAt the present date the chief European theatres are the Novelty and the Empire. The Tivoli was in use in 1900, but has since had to yield place to the renovated and improved Gaiety, which has now been purchased by a native dramatic company. The up-to-date Empire theatre was opened at the close of 1907.

But during the last five or six years, touring companies of professionals have included Bombay within their itinerary.\n\nNative drama commenced to appear in Bombay about the middle of the 19th century,\u00b9 the pioneer being a certain Rambhau, who borrowed the plots of his plays from the Sanskrit Purans. The language at first employed was Hindi, which subsequently yielded place to Urdu and Marathi. In 1865 a Gujarat Hindu put a Gujarathi play upon the boards, and between that date and 1875 a large number of plays in this language were performed. The native companies utilised the theatre at Grant road mentioned above, and also a theatre which was erected a few years later on the site now occupied by the Head Police Office, opposite the Crawford Market. Subsequently four or five other theatres sprang into existence in the Grant road neighbourhood, namely, the Elphinstone, the Original, the Victoria, the Ripon and the Bombay theatres. Between 1875 and 1885 several new native dramatic companies were formed, the most popular of which were the Niti Darshak and the Hindustani, the former being under the management of a Gujarat Hindu and the latter of a Parsi. The closing years of this decade also witnessed the foundation by Dadabhai Ratanji Thudhi of the Parsi Natak Mandali. Dadabhai introduced a higher standard both of acting, scenic effect and music, substituting the Western harmonium for the Indian string instruments (sarangis), which had up to that date formed the only orchestra. In 1888 a permanent Gujarathi company was formed, which has been enabled to purchase the Gaiety Theatre and the site on which it stands out of the proceeds of a series of successful performances. The native theatres of Bombay present performances in Urdu, Gujarathi and Marathi; but whereas there are permanent companies for the\n\n\u00b9 A new theatre was opened in October 1853 for a performance in Gujarathi by Parsi amateurs.

Marathi dramas are performed only by travelling companies, the chief of which are the Kirloskar and the Shahu Nagarvasi companies. The actors of Gujarathi plays are usually drawn from a special caste, the Targalas, whose headquarters are in the Ahmadabad District, and, except in one Urdu company, all the female characters are portrayed by boys. The salaries drawn by native actors are Rs. 5 per month with board and lodging in the case of boys, and from Rs. 30 to Rs. 50 per month in the case of adults, while the leading actors may draw anything from Rs. 50 to Rs. 300 per month. The minimum pay of an actress is Rs. 100 per month.\n\nThere are six theatres for native performances at the junction of Falkland road and Grant road, in addition to the re-built Gaiety Theatre opposite Victoria Terminus, and two theatres in Kalbadevi road. Some of the Grant road theatres are very indifferent structures, being merely iron-frame buildings lacking in the principles of sanitation and acoustics. The maximum nightly income of a theatre is Rs. 1,000 and the rent paid for the use of it is Rs. 100 a night and sometimes Rs. 1,200 per month. Performances take place on Wednesday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons, and last in the former case from 9-30 p.m. to 2 a.m., and in the latter case from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. The most up-to-date theatres in the Grant road neighbourhood are the Grand Theatre, which was built and opened by a well-known Parsi actor-manager in 1907 and Appu's Theatre, which was opened a little later.\n\nTidal Observatories.\u2014Bombay contains two tidal observatories, one at Apollo bandar and the other at the Prince's dock, the former ranking as the best of Indian\n\n---\n\n1 A Parsi company tried the experiment of introducing a Parsi female on the stage; but this evoked such a protest from the community that the experiment was relinquished.\n\n2 The notes for this article were supplied by the Surveyor-General of India.

The Apollo bandar observatory is situated in the kiosk near the Royal Bombay Yacht Club, its tide-gauge being one of Newman's horizontal drum-pattern gauges, such as are used everywhere in India excepting at Prince's dock. The bench-mark of reference is the standard bench-mark situated at the Public Works Secretariat, and consists of a 3-foot cube of polished granite, the upper surface of which is the plane of reference. It is 30 feet above the zero of the gauge or 19.8 feet above mean sea-level. For convenience a bench-mark has been placed close to the observatory which can at any time be referred to the bed-plate of the tide-gauge. Tidal registration commenced at Apollo bandar in 1878 and at Prince's dock in 1888.\n\nAt Prince's dock the gauge is placed in the lighthouse tower, a solid masonry structure situated on the pier between the entrances to the dock. It is a small gauge, with an upright recording drum, of less practical design than those of Newman's pattern, and is the property of the Port Trustees. Observations are taken under the direction of the Officer in charge of Tidal and Levelling Operations, Survey of India. The bench-mark of reference is the same as that to which the Apollo bandar gauge is referred, and an extra bench-mark is also situated near the observatory for immediate reference.\n\nThe values of the tidal constants on which the predictions depend are computed in the office of No. 25 Party (Tidal and Levelling) Survey of India, and are transmitted to the Director of the National Physical Laboratory, Bushey House, Teddington, England, who utilizes them for prediction in the tide-predicting machine of the India Office, designed by Lord Kelvin and Mr. Roberts. This machine gives the true time and height of every tide for the whole year under prediction. Levelling of precision was first commenced from Bombay to Madras in 1877-78 and was subsequently extended to other ports. During 1906-07 a revision of the old spirit-levelled heights between Bombay and Madras was commenced and carried as far as Kosgi railway station. Yearly tide-tables are published for the Apollo bandar and Prince's dock.\nTowers of Silence.\u2014Bombay contains seven Towers of Silence or *dakhmas*, all of which are situated on Malabar hill. Five of them are in charge of the Trustees of the Parsi Panchayat funds and properties, and are reserved for the use of the Parsi public. The other two are private Towers in the gardens of private houses on Walkeshwar road. The oldest of them all is Modi's Tower, which bears no inscription or date, but is referred to by Dr. Fryer in the words:\u2014\"On the other side of the great inlet to the sea is a great point abutting against Old Woman's Island, and is called Malabar Hill; a rocky, woody mountain, yet sends forth long grass. Atop of all is a Parsi tomb lately reared\". The letter in which these words occur is dated from Surat, the 16th January 1675; and by comparing it with a letter of the 18th January 1672, written by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Streynsham Master, it seems clear that the first Tower of Silence was built some time between 1672 and 1675. For, says Master, \"Here are also some Parsees; but they are lately come since the English had the island, and are most of them weavers, and have not yet any place to do their devotion in or to bury their dead.\" And remembering that Fryer's observations refer to the early months of 1674, after which he left Bombay for the coast-towns, Bassein and Surat, it is a plausible conjecture that Modi Hirji Wachha built the Tower either in the later months of 1672 or in 1673.\n\nThe second Tower, which also bears no inscription, is known as Maneckji Sett's Tower and was in all probability constructed in 1750 or 1751. For one learns from Maneckji Sett's will that some time before his death in 1748, he subscribed Rs. 2,000 towards a fund for building a second Tower in Bombay. This amount he increased in\n\n---\n\n1 For a complete modern account of the Towers of Silence and their surroundings, see Times of India, 23rd July 1873, and an article by Sir Monier Williams in the Times of India, 18th February 1876.\n\n2 \"A letter from Surat in India giving an account of ye manners of ye English Factors and their way of Civil converse and pious comportment and Behaviour in these Parties.\" (Diary of William Hedges by Colonel Henry Yule, Vol. II, Printed for the Hakluyt Society in 1888, p. cccv.)\n\n3 A copy of this will is published in the Genealogy of the Sett Family by Mr. Jalbhoj Ardeshir Sett.\nthe will to Rs. 2,500; and as the subscriptions from the Parsi public did not suffice, even with this sum, for the erection of the Tower, the balance was subscribed by his heirs. Dr. Ives, who visited Bombay in 1754, refers to two Towers of Silence, while a letter of February 1750 from the Parsis of Bombay to their co-religionists at Nawsari deals with the ceremony of laying the foundation stone of a new Tower in Bombay. The preliminaries to building had, as the letter shows, been fully completed; and one may therefore reasonably conclude that Maneckji Sett's Tower was built in 1750 or early in the following year.\n\nThe third Tower was built by public subscription in 1779, and is known as the Anjuman's Tower of Silence. It is recognizable by a tablet bearing the following Persian inscription:\n\n\"In the Name of God the Bountiful, the Merciful, the Kindly. This fitting place hath been built by the Anjuman of the Mobeds (Priesthood) and Behdins (Laity) of India. Roz Astad. Mah Meher Yazad, 1148, Yazdazardi.\"\n\nThe fourth Tower, known as Framji Cowasji Banaji's Tower, was consecrated on the 3rd May 1832, and bears the following inscription in Gujarathi:\n\n\"In the name of God the Just.\n\n\"By the help of the Holy God and by the guidance of the Holy Prophet, the immortal-souled Zoroaster Aspantman, this Tower for the dead of the Mazdayasan religion has been built by the humble follower of the good Mazdayasan religion, sunk in the dust, Behdin Framji, son of Cowasji, son of Behramji Banaji, in religious remembrance of the immortal soul of his daughter, the late Bai Dinbai, from her own money and from that of her mother Bai Bachubai and her sisters.

This tower has now been built upon the land granted by her. Our daughter Bai Dinbai on a sudden took her journey to the everlasting world on Roz 5, Mah 9, Kadmi, 1200 Yazdazardi, after an illness of five hours. The announcement of building this Tower was made on the occasion of her Oothamna ceremony. The Tana ceremony (i.e., the foundation) of this Tower was performed according to the tenets of the old Mazdayasnan religion on Roz 5, Mah 10, Kadmi, Mah 9, Rasmi, 1200 Yazdazardi, 3rd June, 1831, the day of the first month after her death. This Tower, completed and consecrated according to the tenets of the goodly and ancient Mazdayasnan religion, has been laid open for use on Roz 5, Mah 9, Kadmi, Mah 8, Rasmi, 1201 Rasmi Yazdazardi, 3rd May 1832 A.D., Samvat 1888 Vaishakh Sud 3rd, Thursday, 1st Jihaz 1247 Hijri, the day of the first anniversary of her death.\"\n\nAbout 1840 the increase of the Parsi population necessitated the building of a new dakhma, and at a meeting of the Parsi community held in November of that year, Mr. Cowasji Edalji Bisni added a sum of one lakh for this purpose to the Rs. 85,000 which had already been collected by public subscription. Hence the fifth tower, which was consecrated on the 7th May 1844, is known as Cowasji Bisni's Tower and bears the following inscription in Gujarathi:\n\n\"In the name of God the Bountiful, the Good, the Kind, the Just.\n\nBy the help and assistance of God, who is the Lord of Purity, who is the Lord of Splendour, wondrous and mighty power, and by the guidance of the Prophet of Prophets, the great Zoroaster Aspantman of immortal soul, the Tana ceremony of this Tower of Silence for the (final) rest of the dead of them that follow the pure and righteous Mazdayasnan religion, was performed and the foundation was laid and the great Jashan performed, according to the precepts of the righteous religion by (the direc-\n\n---\n\n1 The Bombay Times, 21st November 1840.\ntion of) Behdin, the humble and right-minded Behdin Cowasji bin Edalji Bisni for the benefit of the holy and pious soul of his revered father, heavenly (i.e., destined for heaven) Behdin Edalji bin Behramji bin Ratanji Bisni, on Roz 5 Aspandarmad Ameshaspand, Mah 7 Meher the Just 1210 Yazdazerdi Shehenshahi, 1st April 1841 A.D., Samvat 1897 Chaitar Sud 10 Thursday.

A great Jashan was performed with Myazd and Afringan ceremonies in the presence of the Anjuman\u2014large and small\u2014of the Mazdayasan religion. In this work of righteousness all acquired a share.\"\n\nOf the two private Towers of Silenze one was built by Mr. Muncherji Jivanji Readymoney in 1786, and has not been used since his death. It stands in the compound of a bungalow on the left hand side of Walkeshwar road, leading to Government House. The other Tower, situated on the right hand side of the same road, belongs to the Dadysett family and was consecrated on the 22nd April 1798, with the permission of the Governor, Jonathan Duncan, to whom Dady Nasarwanji Dadysett addressed the following petition in January 1797:\u2014\"The advanced age and infirmity of your petitioner causes him to contemplate with a considerable degree of resignation the close of his arduous worldly labours. Hence your petitioner is desirous in conformity with the principles of his religion to provide a suitable receptacle for his remains when that awful period shall arrive. With this view your petitioner has obtained at considerable expense a sufficient spot of ground at the foot of Malabar Hill in the vicinity of\nthe tomb of one of his caste (Muncher Jevan) for the purpose of erecting under his own immediate inspection a similar tomb for his reception, after his dissolution shall have taken place. Your petitioner, however, anxious to avoid censure or the infraction of the orders of Government conceives it incumbent upon him prior to his commencing the abovementioned erection to obtain from your Honour permission for that purpose.\" This tower is only used on very rare occasions by some of the direct descendants of Dady Nasarwanji Dadysett.\n\nTown Hall.\u2014No Town Hall existed in Bombay during the early years of British rule. In 1675 the hired house, in which the judicial courts were located, served as a Town Hall, and in 1677 the chief room in Aungier's Court of Judicature (Mapla Por) was styled the Town Hall. Similarly in 1720 Rama Kamati's house contained a room used for this purpose, which by 1771 had fallen into very great disrepair. It continued however to be utilized until 1786 when accommodation was provided in Hornby House (now the Great Western Hotel) and the main room of this building served for the next few years as a Town Hall. The idea of erecting a separate building was first mooted by a Government servant named Henshaw in 1793; was again brought forward by Sir James Mackintosh in a letter to the Bombay Government of the 10th October 1811; and was finally adopted in 1812 by Government, who, on the representation of Messrs. Forbes & Co. and Messrs. Bruce, Fawcett & Co., sanctioned the holding of a lottery for raising the necessary funds. The lottery proved so successful, the amount realized being $1\\frac{1}{10}$ lakhs, that in October 1812 Government sanctioned the raising of a second lottery, on condition that the total sum to be raised for the erection of the building should not exceed 2 lakhs. This lottery however met with poor success, and no further step was taken until 1820 when a third lottery was instituted. The amount so raised sufficed to commence but not to\n\n---\n\n1 For detailed account of the Towers of Silence see Lady Falkland's Chow-Chow (1857); Mrs. Postan's Western India (1838); Bombay Gazetter.

The building, as it now stands, was designed by Colonel Cowper, R.E., and was finally completed in 1833 at a cost of a little more than 6 lakhs.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe building consists of a basement occupied by the Government Stamp, Stationery and Income-Tax offices, and an upper storey which is about 260 feet long by 100 feet wide. The large hall contains a fine organ given by Sir Albert Sassoon to commemorate the visit of H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh in 1872. The hall which is frequently used for public meetings, concerts and balls, also contains a statue of Mountstuart Elphinstone (Governor of Bombay, 1819-1827). A statue of Sir Charles Forbes is placed in the south vestibule; and in the north vestibule are statues of Mr. Stephen Babington, Sir John Malcolm, Mr. Norris, Lord Elphinstone, Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy, Sir Bartle Frere and the Hon. Mr. Jagannath Shankarsett. The library and museum of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society occupy the north end of the central hall, the Darbar room, so called on account of its being used for State purposes prior to the completion of the Secretariat, being situated at the south-east corner of the hall. The Darbar room is now used as the personal office of the Collector of Bombay. Rooms are also allowed for the personal offices of the Income Tax Collector and his deputy, and the Presidency Surgeon, first district. On the west side of the hall is a handsome portico approached by a massive flight of stone steps from the Elphinstone Circle.\n\nUniversity Buildings.\\(^2\\)\u2014The University Buildings, which lie between the Secretariat and the High Court,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For further details see Bombay Gazetteer Materials III, pp. 614-643. In 1835 Mrs. Postans mentions the building in terms of praise; Captain Von Orlich writes of it in 1842 as the only remarkable building in Bombay; while in 1844 Fontanier wrote:\u2014\"On y remarque la maison de ville, si\u00e8ge du gouvernement, mais que personne n'habite. Ses vastes salles s'ouvrent parfois pour des f\u00eates publiques et renferment la belle biblioth\u00e8que de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, ainsi que les collections pr\u00e9cieuses rapport\u00e9es de toutes les parties de l'Asie.\" Lady Falkland (Chow-Chow) remarked in 1857 that \"few cities can boast of a finer town-hall.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) For a detailed account of these buildings see Times of India of January 26th and 28th, 1874.\nwere designed by Sir Gilbert Scott and completed in 1874 at a cost of about 9\u00bd lakhs. They are of a florid and decorative French-Gothic type, and consist of two detached buildings, namely the Senate-house or the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Hall and the University Library and Clock Tower. The Sir Cowasji Jehangir Hall, the earlier structure of the two, measures 150 feet long by 65 feet wide and has a high-pitched gable roof about 90 feet in height, with four square turrets at the angles. The chief apartment is 104 feet long by 44 feet broad and 63 feet high, furnished at one end with a semi-circular apse containing raised seats and surrounded by a gallery supported by ornamental iron brackets and approached by staircases in the angle-turrets. The gable is embellished with a circular window, 20 feet in diameter, having its outer ring of twelve lights filled with stained glass representations of the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Over the windows in the western wall are stained glass reproductions of Sir Cowasji Jehangir's escutcheon and of the arms of England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Bombay. The eastern windows bear the arms of former Chancellors of the University, viz., Lord Elphinstone, Sir George Clerk, Sir Bartle Frere, Sir Seymour Fitzgerald and Sir Philip Wodehouse.\n\nThe Library building comprises two floors, the upper of which is devoted to one large room 146 feet long by 30 feet in breadth with a panelled teak-wood ceiling. Above the porch of the building rises the Rajabai Clock Tower to a height of 280 feet, with five richly decorated storeys. The top of the cupola is ornamented with 16 statues, and about thirty feet from the ground are 8 other statues representing various Indian castes. The fifth storey contains the clock-dials. The carillon machinery plays sixteen tunes which change automatically four times a day, the chief of them being Handel's symphony, the National Anthem.\n\n---\n\n1 Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney contributed one lakh, and the balance was defrayed by Government from the Bombay Land Sales Fund. The cost of the Library and Tower (Rs. 5\u00b748 lakhs) was defrayed from a donation of 4 lakhs by Mr. Premchand Raichand, who gave the amount in memory of his mother Rajabai, and from the interest thereon. The Sir Cowasji Jehangir Hall was commenced in March 1869 and was completed in 1874.\nBlue Bells of Scotland, Rule Britannia, Home Sweet Home and Auld Lang Syne. The bells number sixteen and are tuned to the key of C., the largest of them weighing 3 tons and the whole peal about 12 tons. The Library and Clock Tower were formally opened in February 1880, the clock and bells being received and fixed in the tower two years later. The peal of bells and the clock together cost Rs. 30,000. The Library contains a bust of Sir George Birdwood which was unveiled by Lord Harris in 1894, and busts of the Revd. Dr. John Wilson, James Gibbs, Sir Bartle Frere and Henry Fawcett.\u00b9 Around the buildings is a garden graced by the statues of Sir Cowasji Jehangir and Thomas Ormiston.\n\nVictoria Gardens and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\u2014The early history of the Victoria Gardens, which stand on the east side of Parel road, a few yards north of Byculla Station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, is intimately bound up with the history of the now extinct Agri-Horticultural Society of Western India.\u00b2 This society was founded at a public meeting, held on the 11th February, 1830, and presided over by Sir Sydney Beckwith, then Commander-in-Chief and acting Governor of Bombay, and was supported by subscriptions, donations and an annual grant from Government. In 1835 Government granted a large plot of land at Sewri to the society for the purpose of a botanical garden, the area of which was enlarged by subsequent grants in 1837 and 1840; and considerable activity was displayed by the society between that date and 1865 under the auspices successively of Dr. Buist, Editor of the Bombay Times (now The Times of India), Dr. Giraud and Mr. (now Sir George) Birdwood. The chief feature of the ad-\n\n\u00b9 For further details, see Maclean's Guide to Bombay (1900), pp. 214-219. For an account of the Rajabai Tower Tragedy, see History Chapter.\n\n\u00b2 Prior to 1750 there were three gardens in Bombay, in addition to the garden round the Castle. One was a coffee garden near the compound of the Parsonage, which lay South of the Cathedral close; a second was a little way outside the Fort gates and was cultivated in the European fashion; and a third was at Government House, Parel. The garden of the old Secretariat was in 1845 planted with mulberry trees, the leaves of which were given to the Assistant Superintendent of Sericulture in the Konkan.\nministration of Mr. Birdwood was the conversion into a garden and pleasure-ground of certain useless and low-lying land known as the Mount Estate in Mazagon, now regarded as forming part of Byculla. This garden, comprising about 33 acres, was subsequently formally vested in the society by Government, under the title of the Victoria Garden of the Agri-Horticultural Society, and the Society's ground at Sewri being required for an European burial-ground, the transference of plants from the Sewri gardens to the new Victoria Garden and the artistic laying out of the latter commenced in July 1862. Meanwhile, however, the vitality of the society had become seriously impaired; and the general bankruptcy, which afflicted Bombay at the close of the share mania in 1867, re-acted so unfavourably upon its finances that aid had to be obtained from the Municipal Commissioners for the up-keep of the garden. By 1873 the society had ceased to exist; and Government therefore handed over the garden to the Municipal Corporation, which from that date undertook the whole responsibility and expense of maintaining it as a public garden. The gardens, under the title of the Victoria Gardens, had been formally thrown open to the public on the 19th November 1862 by Lady Frere; and since that date an additional 15 acres have been added to the original area of 33 acres.\n\nThe most noteworthy features of the gardens, apart from their collection of fauna and flora, are the ornamental gateway and railing on Parel road, the cost of which was chiefly defrayed by Mr. Jagannath Shankarsett and Mr. Premabhai Hemabhai; the triple-arched architectural screen over the garden-turnstiles, to the expense of which another Bombay citizen, Mr. Rustomji Jeejeebhoy, largely contributed; the small building in mixed Graeco-Roman style, which was erected as a memorial of Lady Frere;\u00b9 the David Sassoon clock-tower and fountain; and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n\u00b9 This building was originally erected to enshrine a bust of Lady Frere by Noble, which was purchased by Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy for Rs. 9,950. Several years ago the bust was wantonly defaced by some unknown persons, and was sent to England for restoration and repair. As, however, the mutilation defied suitable repair, Lady Frere's son despatched in its place a replica of the bust, which is now located in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThe clock-tower, which is built in the Palladian style and is 67 feet in height, cost Rs. 51,653, out of which Mr. David Sassoon contributed Rs. 30,000. The plinth of the tower is of blue stone, the remainder of Porbandar stone, and the four faces of the clock, situated 42 feet from ground-level, are each 4 feet in diameter. Lying beneath a gold-mohur tree, not far from the main entrance, are the remains of the massive stone elephant, which originally stood on the western shore of Elephanta island.\n\nThe gardens, which are in charge of a Superintendent, appointed by the Municipal Corporation, are well laid out with broad paths, raised terraces and miniature ornamental lakes, and, being well stocked with many choice and rare species of tropical trees and plants, present at all seasons a refreshing aspect. But the chief attraction to the poorer classes of the city is the zoological collection, comprising lions, tigers, panthers, including the rare black panther, puma, and binturong or bear-cat, bears, comprising the Himalayan black bear, the brown bear and the sloth-bear, monkeys of various species, and many kinds of deer, including the *ooriyal*, *sambar*, *nilgai*, gazelle, spotted-deer, hog-deer, and a specimen of the oryx or African antelope, presented by the Officers of the 3rd King's African Rifles. Llamas and kangaroos, giant-tortoises and crocodiles, a camel, and an elephant, presented in 1900 by H. H. the Gaekwar of Baroda, are also included in the collection. Birds include specimens of the ostrich, emu, rhea, cassowary, and game-birds and water birds of many species. There are altogether some 28 cages, enclosures and aviaries, several of which have been presented by private residents. Among the latter are the water birds' enclosure given by Sir D. M Petit, and cages given by H. H. the Thakor of Bhavnagar, H. H. the Nawab of Junagadh, Mr. Jalbhoy A. Sett, and the Bombay Tramway Company. The average annual receipts and expenditure of the gardens during the last ten years have been respectively Rs. 9,219 and Rs. 58,569. The number of visitors to the gardens has greatly increased of late years, since band performances have been given there, and totalled more than 2 millions in 1908-09.\nOn the left of the main entrance to the gardens stands the Victoria and Albert Museum, a handsome structure in the Italian Renaissance style, with considerable internal decoration, designed in the first instance by Mr. Tracey, the Municipal Engineer, and altered by Messrs. Scott, McClelland & Co. It was founded in 1853, partly by public subscription and partly by a donation from Government, to commemorate the assumption of the title of Empress of India by Her Majesty Queen Victoria. The foundation-stone of the building, which cost roughly 4.3 lakhs, of which 1.1 lakhs were publicly subscribed, was laid by Sir Bartle Frere on the 19th November, 1862, and the museum was thrown open to the public by Sir Seymour Fitzgerald in May 1872. Though originally intended to illustrate the economic products and natural history of Western India and containing many good specimens under both heads, little has been done of late years to add to the collection, which comprises the following classes of exhibits:\u2014Raw products, minerals, manufactured articles and natural history specimens.\u00b9 The museum contains a library of works of reference which number more than 700 volumes. Among the most interesting contents of the Museum are a fine statue by Noble of the Prince Consort presented by Mr. David Sassoon, busts of Lord Canning and the Hon'ble Mountstuart Elphinstone, and the remnants of the collections of the old Government Central Museum. The Government Central Museum was originally founded by Lord Elphinstone in September 1855, for the illustration of general economic processes, and the development of the commercial and industrial resources of Western India.\u00b2 Its collection was at first housed in the mess-room and adjoining rooms of the Town Barracks; but, save for the short period of Lord Canning's visit to Bombay in 1856 on his way to assume the office of\n\n\u00b9 Among the exhibits are models of agricultural implements, specimens of woods and gums and a complete collection of cereals, presented by the Prussian Governor, (A. D., 1872-73). A collection of bird-skins was purchased with funds presented by H. H. the Maharaja of Travancore and the Chief of Savantvadi. The collection of specimens of fish was awarded a gold medal at the London Fisheries Exhibition of 1883.\n\n\u00b2 The first Committee of this Museum was composed of Dr. Impey as President, Dr. Fraser, Dr. Sinclair, Mr. W. F. Hunter, with Dr. Buist as Secretary and Curator.\nGovernor-General, it was not on public view until March 1857. It did not remain open for long. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in Bengal, the Military authorities demanded the use of all the rooms in the Town Barracks for the officers of the various European regiments then arriving in Bombay on their way to Bengal; and after some slight delay the Brigadier-General issued a peremptory order to the Museum Committee to vacate the rooms within twenty-four hours. So urgent was the matter that the coolies employed to remove the collections threw most of them out of the windows into the street, thereby destroying a large proportion of the exhibits. The office records similarly suffered. The collection, or such as remained of it, was then housed in the Town Hall, until its final transfer to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1872. It is estimated that about 3,000 people daily visit the Museum, most of whom belong to the uneducated classes.\n\nVictoria Jubilee Technical Institute.\u2014This institute was the outcome of a movement by the Bombay Municipal Corporation to commemorate the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The Corporation voted a lump sum of Rs. 80,000 and an annual grant of Rs. 5,000 towards a scheme for promoting the efficiency and skill of the native artizan, while Government also promised an annual grant of Rs. 25,000. The capital was further augmented by the balance of two public memorial funds; and Sir D. M. Petit offered to convey to Government a property known as the Hydraulic Press in exchange for the Elphinstone College building, which he then undertook to present to Government for the purposes of the Technical Institute. At the end of 1888 a committee was appointed to manage the affairs of the proposed institute and was registered under Act XXI of 1860, their object being declared to be the establishment of an institution for the training of workmen, foremen, managers and technical teachers, the establishment of technical schools in places outside Bombay, and the holding of examinations in Technology. The management of the institute was vested in a board of trustees, comprising a chairman and 5 members appointed by Government, 3 elected by the Municipal Corporation, 1 by the Bombay Millowners' Association, 5 by the Ripon Memorial\nCommittee, and by the Sir Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy Memorial Fund.\n\nThe staff of the Institute comprises a Principal and teachers of mechanical engineering, physics and electrical engineering, textile manufacture, technical chemistry, enamelling, sheet-metal working, and mechanical drawing. There is also a section for the training of motor-mechanics. The number of students in 1909 was 338. A small number of fellowships, each of the value of Rs. 50 a month and to be awarded annually, were created in 1906, while a gold medal of the value of Rs. 70 is awarded every year to the student who passes the final examination in any of the prescribed courses of technology with the complementary science subjects, and gains the highest aggregate number of marks. About 31 scholarships and prizes are also open to competition by students. The Institute conducts annual examinations on behalf of the City and Guilds of London Institute.\n\nThe Institute is situated on Parel road, and is built in the pointed Gothic style. Attached to it is a block of students' quarters built in the Classic style of reinforced concrete. In addition to the latter, the institute comprises the college or main building, with a library and reading-room, a mechanical engineering workshop, the Ripon textile school, a central power station, an electrical engineering building, an enamelling and metal working school, a chemical laboratory, a motor-car shed, and the residential quarters of the Principal.\n\nVictoria Terminus.\u2014The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway has taken the place of \"a miserable wooden structure\" which prior to 1878 did duty as the terminal station. The area in front of this building was occupied by a Dhobi's ghat where the town's washing was performed until the new ghat at Mahalakshmi was provided, while a portion of the site of the present booking-office and the open space leading to Frere road were occupied by the famous Phansi talao or Gibbet pond. The pond derived its name from the fact that murderers used to be hanged there and the gallows\n\n1 The old Elphinstone College.\nstood there in full view of the public until roughly fifty years ago when the tank was filled in and the melancholy structure was removed. Close by in olden times stood also the public pillory, where offenders were subjected to the raillery of the populace and had to submit to being pelted with rotten eggs, old shoes, mud and brick-bats. The abolition of this mode of punishment was one of the first acts of Queen Victoria after her assumption of the Crown.\n\nThe terminal station of the G. I. P. Railway is one of the handsomest and most prominent buildings in Bombay and is generally supposed to be, from the architectural point of view, one of the finest stations in the world. It was designed by the late Mr. F. W. Stevens, who subsequently joined the Company's staff to superintend its erection. Work was commenced in May, 1878, and completed in May, 1888, at a cost, for the offices alone, of Rs. 16,35,562. The station proper was erected under the supervision of Mr. T. W. Pearson, District Engineer, and was opened for traffic on the 1st January, 1882. Its cost, excluding the permanent-way, amounted to Rs. 10,40,248. On Jubilee Day, 1887, the buildings were named in honour of H. M. the Queen-Empress \"Victoria Terminus,\" the announcement being made by means of huge letters of light incorporated in the illuminations which adorned the building that night. The building is in the Italian-Gothic style with a frontage on Hornby road of more than 1,500 feet. The administrative offices form three sides of a rectangle enclosing an ornamental garden, the entrance gates to which are guarded by a massive lion and tiger carved in stone. They comprise a ground and two upper floors, the most prominent feature in the elevation being the high dome rising over the centre portion, adorned with a large figure representing \"Progress.\" A statue of the late Queen-Empress occupies a niche below the clock in the centre of the building. The main entrance for passengers is on the Hornby road side through four great doorways, which open into the booking-office and a little further down is another entrance leading direct on to the platforms. Marble columns support the lofty roof.\n\n1 Times of India, 1901; Reminiscences of Mr. D. E. Wacha.\nand entrance facade of the booking-office, the walls of which are decorated in blue and gold. The internal arrangements of the station are designed to afford the maximum of convenience to the travelling public.\n\n**Widows' and Pensioners' Home (European).**\u2014This institution was established by public subscription in 1849 for the reception and shelter of all European pensioners and their widows and the families of both the Queen's and the Company's Armies. At first the inmates were accommodated in a bungalow at Mazagon, which is now used for the Strangers' Home; but in 1854 a Home was built for the pensioners and their widows on a site in Tardeo, close to the Grant Road Station. The present building is becoming dilapidated and difficult of repair. It is under consideration to build a new Home. The Committee have in the meantime applied to Government for temporary accommodation for the Home in the building formerly occupied by St. Peter's School, Mazagon.\n\nSince 1909 the management of the Home has been taken over by the European Relief Association, and the Bombay Home is managed by a representative Committee. The Home is supported by Government and by public subscription. The total receipts for 1909 were Rs. 8,581 and expenditure Rs. 7,849. The total number of inmates at the end of 1909 was 31.\n\n**Young Men's Christian Association.**\u2014This Association was founded in 1875 and originally occupied the top floor of the Tract Society building. In 1881 Government granted the lease of a corner site near the Apollo bandar, on which the Association erected a building of its own costing Rs. 25,000. In 1898 this site passed into the hand of the Bombay City Improvement Trust, and the Association thereupon leased a cheaper plot on Wodehouse road, upon which the present building was erected in 1906 at a cost of Rs. 1,60,000. The building contains a hall, reading-room, library, gymnasium, restaurant and accommodation for 50 resident members. Cricket and tennis grounds have been secured at a little\n\n---\n\n1At first it was intended for the benefit of pensioners of the Indian Army. As the number of pensioners diminished, the benefits of the Home were extended to soldiers' widows.\ndistance. The Association maintains a branch in Girgaum for the benefit of students and educated Indian youths, in which lectures are given, and a branch at Byculla with a lecture-room and reading-room for Native Christians. The income of the Association is derived from members' subscriptions and public donations; while the English National Council of these Associations makes liberal grants towards the salaries of the Secretaries of the various branches. The Association is registered under Act XXI of 1860.\n\nYoung Women's Christian Association.\u2014The Young Women's Christian Association in Bombay was organized in 1875. In 1896 a small Home was opened in Mazagon; two years later this was closed, and a flat was taken in the Fort, which was the headquarters until July 1901 when the present building on Wellington Lines was opened. This Society is founded upon the basis of the common bond of womanhood for mutual helpfulness. Each member joins at her own request, and pays an annual fee of at least one rupee. The Bombay Association has 850 such members.\n\nThe Association consists of an Institute and Boarding Home. The Institute partakes of the nature of a Club with a reading-room, library, hall for lectures, educational classes such as cookery, dressmaking and millinery, French and Hindustani, botany, lectures, concerts, and classes in physical culture. A School for shorthand and typewriting was opened in 1909.\n\nAn Employment Registry is maintained. Travellers aid work is conducted; young women being met at boats and trains, and assisted when leaving the city.\n\nThe Home is an important feature of the work in Bombay. The three upper floors of the building on Wellington Lines accommodate about fifty young women. A few rooms are reserved for the use of visitors, coming to, or passing through the city.\n\nThe administration is in the hands of a President, General Committee, and Board of Trustees, with a General Secretary.\nINDEX\n\nA\n\nAbdul Rahman Street, i, 35; iii, 54, 342.\nAbdulla Haji Dawood, Mr., iii, 338.\nAbkari, System, Working of (1870) ii, 473; Administration, 476; 491.\nAccountant-General, Office of, created in 1747, ii, 214 (note 5); 216.\nAccounts, native method of, i, 329-331.\nAcworth Leper Asylum, i, 48; ii, 186; iii, 27, 185; account of, 196-198; 206.\nAcworth, Mr. H.
