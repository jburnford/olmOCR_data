On March 22 Mrs. Kent sent out her little girl with 9s. wrapped up in paper on an errand. The prisoner met the child, and said if she would go and take two sovereigns to a servant at an address in an adjoining street she would give her, on her return, 4d. The child assented, and the prisoner, giving her two \"Hanoverian medals,\" promised to take care of the money the child was carrying in her hand. The child went, and being unable to find out the address mentioned, returned, but failed to see the prisoner. This was only one out of a number of cases in which children in all parts of London had been victimised by the prisoner. \u2014 The Assistant-judge ordered her to be kept in penal servitude for five years.\n\nJuvenile Housebreakers.\u2014John Barnes, 15, and Edwin Felstead, 16, were indicted for breaking into the shop of James Robert Cox, and stealing the sum of 2l. 5s.\u2014They both pleaded \"Guilty,\" and the Assistant-judge sentenced each of them to be imprisoned for three weeks, and then to be sent to a reformatory for three years.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206244259.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2028, "total-output-tokens": 329, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1212, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
