The burglars commenced their operations between eight and nine o'clock, while a dinner party was being held, and during the prevalence of a thick fog. A constable while on his round stumbled across a rope attached to some stone pillars, and, his suspicions being aroused, he entered the ground and went to the front of the house, where he discovered a ladder reared against the chief bedroom window. This he immediately seized, but his action aroused the burglars, who were already in the room. One of the thieves caught hold of the ladder, whilst a companion hurled a chair at the constable from the window, which, however, missed its mark. The constable succeeded in getting possession of the ladder, but the burglars got on to the roof, and from there threw coping stones, some of which weighed fifty pounds, at the officer. One of the stones struck the constable's helmet but he was fortunately only slightly hurt. The noise of the scuffle and the shouts of the policeman alarmed the inmates of the mansion, who speedily joined the constable, and by their help two of the men were captured. The two men arrested are named Wilson and Gatton, but their companion was by the aid of the fog enabled to escape. The burglars, who were equipped with tools and had skilfully fastened the bedroom doors with cords, had possessed themselves of jewellery and notes to the value of one hundred pounds. The men, who are middle-aged, refuse to give any account of themselves, but the police have little doubt but that they belong to a gang of London burglars.\n\nMR. ALBERT CHEVALIER, the music-hall singer, was summoned at the instance of the Board of Inland Revenue for keeping a carriage without a licence. The defendant was called, but did not answer. Mr. Squire, who represented the Board, suggested that he preferred \"another audience.\" (Laughter.) An officer of Excise said on June 9th he saw the defendant, who had a friend with him, driving a fancy pony cart in Goldhawk-road. In the previous month he spoke to Mr. Chevalier about the matter and the latter said he would attend to it. Defendant had not taken out a licence. Mr. Squire, in reply to the magistrate, said the cost of the licence was \u00a35s. Mr. Curtis-Bennett then imposed a penalty of 20s.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200811024.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 565, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2421, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
