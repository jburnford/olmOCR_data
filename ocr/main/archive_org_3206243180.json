On the afternoon of Oct. 20, the prosecutrix, while she was in her shop heard cries of \"Mercy!\" and \"Police!\" and on going out saw her brother, John Murphy, on the ground, and the prisoner and five or six others kicking him. She begged of them not to kill him, and while she was assisting him to get up, the prisoner, who had an open knife in his hand, aimed with it a blow at her head, but she received it on her finger, and afterwards she was thrown down and kicked about the body in the most brutal manner. The prisoner afterwards struck her husband, who went to her assistance.\u2014Mr. Montagu Williams said the prisoner was prepared to make the prosecutrix some compensation\u2014to the amount of \u00a32.\u2014This being considered satisfactory on the part of the prosecution, Mr. Serjeant Cox ordered him to pay the prosecutrix the sum of \u00a31., and to enter into his own recognisances in the sum of \u00a32l., to come up for judgment if called upon.\u2014The prisoner had not been many minutes discharged, when the prosecutrix entered the court and said that she had never been consulted or ever given her sanction to taking money for the injury that had been done to her, for the prisoner had repeatedly threatened her since he had been out on bail, and every moment she went in danger of her life.\u2014Mr. Serjeant Cox: If he does anything to you I will have him brought up next sessions and severely punished.\u2014The prosecutrix: That is poor compensation for the injury that has been done, with my family of 11 children. I am so bruised about my body that I am still suffering from the kicks I received. I was nearly murdered. I don't want his money. I will not take a penny of it, and all I want is justice.\u2014Mr. Serjeant Cox said it was then too late to do anything.\u2014In the latter part of the day Mrs. Piatt again came to the court, and stated that the man Sewell had never paid or offered the \u00a32l., which the court had adjudged him to pay her.\n\nSTEALING AND RECEIVING.\u2014George Dowman, carman, and Joseph Love, marine-store dealer, were indicted, Dowman for stealing 24lbs. of soap, the property of Henry John Cook and others, his masters, who are soap manufacturers at Bow, and the said Joseph Love for feloniously receiving the same, well knowing it to have been stolen.\u2014The jury found the prisoners \"Guilty,\" and Mr. Lewis stated that since 1877 the prosecutors had missed property to the value of about \u00a3500l.\u2014Mr. Serjeant Cox said there was nothing in this case which would lead him to depart from his invariable rule of meting out to the receiver double the punishment he gave the thief. He sentenced Dowman to nine and Love to 18 months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206243180.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 970, "total-output-tokens": 734, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2976, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
