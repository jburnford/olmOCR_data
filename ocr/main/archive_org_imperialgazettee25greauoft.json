XXV\n\nINDEX\n\nNEW EDITION\n\nPUBLISHED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF HIS MAJESTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA IN COUNCIL\n\nOXFORD\n\nAT THE CLARENDON PRESS\n\n1909\nPREFACE\n\nThis Index to the twenty-four volumes of the Gazetteer has been compiled, under the supervision of the English editor, by Miss Petherbridge and her staff of assistants, among whom special mention may be made of the services of Miss D. K. Bloxam.\n\nIn the main, the plan adopted in the last edition has been followed; but, while local references to headings of almost universal occurrence\u2014such as Christians, Districts, History, &c.\u2014are now omitted, space has been found for the insertion of many more personal names and words of only occasional mention. Thus, though the body of the work is increased from thirteen to twenty-four volumes, the number of pages of the Index has only risen proportionately from 350 to 631.\n\nThe general rule has been to place first under each heading any references in the four volumes of 'The Indian Empire,' and then to follow with the references in the other volumes in alphabetical sequence, thus occasionally producing chronological disorder. In the arrangement of names common to more than one person, chronology has been the chief consideration, though rulers of the same dynasty have been kept together, and Englishmen come in the order of their Christian names. Some inconsistency may be detected in the order of composite words, as to which there seems to be no absolute agreement among index-makers, especially when dealing with Oriental compounds. So far as possible, the principle adopted has been, not to follow all the letters alphabetically through such a word, but to place first any word appended but not joined to the leading word, and then the compounds: e.g. Muhammad, Muhammad Sh\u0101h, Muhammad\u0101b\u0101d.\nThe Glossary prefixed to the Index has been compiled by Mr. R. Burn, the Indian editor.\n\nIts object and its plan differ from those of more elaborate Indian Glossaries, of which a list\\(^1\\) may be found in the second edition of Yule and Burnell's *Hobson-Jobson* (pp. xxiii, xxiv). Throughout the *Gazetteer* the use of vernacular terms has been generally avoided, except where they could not be translated concisely, or where they were intentionally introduced for the benefit of readers in India. Such vernacular terms are explained in the Glossary, which also includes English expressions that have acquired technical meanings in official use. Where it seemed desirable to give further information than the brief definition in the Glossary, a reference has been added to the volume and page of the *Gazetteer* at which a fuller explanation will be found. The different senses in which the same term is sometimes used in different parts of India, or in different connexions, have been distinguished. In the case of certain crops of wide distribution and a few official designations, synonyms have been appended. Ordinarily, the main heading for a vernacular term is the Hindust\u0101ni form, where this is the form used in the publications of the Government of India.\n\n\\(^1\\) To that list may be added the Index volume by E. Thurston to Watt's *Dictionary of Economic Products* (Calcutta, 1896), and the Hindust\u0101ni-English Vocabulary of Indian Birds by Lieut.-Colonel D. C. Phillott and Gobin Lal Bonnerjee (*J.A.S.B.* 1908, pp. 55-79).\nGLOSSARY\n\n\u0100bk\u0101ri. Excise of liquors and drugs.\n\nAdad. A pulse, *Phaseolus radiatus*.\n\nAgar.
