Williams, both of Birmingham, were charged with having, on the 24th of October last, burglariously entered the dwelling-house of Mr. Thos. Withers, of the Woodman inn, Hales Owen, and stolen therefrom \u00a31,350l. in gold. On the 26th ult. Police-constable Abbott, of the Birmingham police force, was on duty, in plain clothes, in Snow-hill, when he saw the prisoners, whom he knew as bad characters. The officer's suspicions were aroused by the appearance of the men, and he accordingly stopped and searched them. His suspicions proved to be correct, from the fact that \u00a3296l. 16s. 6d. in gold and silver was found upon the prisoner Edwards. The prisoners were locked up, and in due time brought before the magistrates at Birmingham, where, after a preliminary inquiry, they were remanded to Hales Owen. On Tuesday, the prosecutor said that he was a timber merchant, residing in Hales Owen. He had been in the habit of keeping money in his house to a large amount. On the 24th of October last he had as much as \u00a31,350l. in gold by the side of his bed. He kept the key of the chest in his pocket. About six o'clock in the evening his granddaughter went into the room and discovered the loss. She immediately called to him, and he found the box on the bed, and a quantity of writings thrown about. The gold had, however, been taken away. He had seen a quantity of sovereigns in the possession of Police-constable Abbott that morning, and he could swear that some of them were his property (the bag of gold was here produced, and the witness selected a sovereign with a peculiar mark upon it.) He had often seen that sovereign whilst counting his money. Police-constable Abbott stated that he met the prisoners in Snow-hill, and searched them. He found \u00a3296l. 16s. 6d. on Edwards, who said he could not account for his possession of the money, but if the officer had more right to it than he had, he (the officer) had better take it. Other evidence tending to connect the prisoners with the robbery was given, and they were committed for trial.\n\nMRS. BROWN, A WIDOW AT LAST.\u2014The husband of the woman Brown, whose anxiety to become a widow, it will be remembered, led to her examination before the Plymouth magistrates a short time since on a charge of endeavouring to cause her husband's death, died at his house, in Milton-street, on Sunday morning last.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206223815.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1016, "total-output-tokens": 627, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2472, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
