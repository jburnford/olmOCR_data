The prosecutrix is a housekeeper in the employ of two maiden ladies residing in Hackney. She made the acquaintance of prisoner, who said he had been a non-commissioned officer in the Grenadier Guards. He asked her to become his wife. She consented. Afterwards he told her he had lost his situation, and had accepted another with a machine company, but the proprietors wanted a sum of \u00a320 as surety. She advanced this sum, and a little time afterwards she let him have another \u00a310, as he was short in his takings. Under promise of marriage it was alleged he seduced her. Evidence was produced showing that prisoner was a married man. He was found guilty and sentenced to twelve months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200812236.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1568, "total-output-tokens": 258, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 936, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
