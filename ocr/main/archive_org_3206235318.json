It appears that the small sum of savings of which he was robbed at the time of the murder constituted nearly all he possessed, and his family are left in destitute circumstances. A great deal of sympathy is felt for them, and it is hoped that a sum will be raised sufficient to assist the widow in supporting her family, the youngest of whom is not 12 months old. The sum of \u00a317. 19s. has been raised, and further subscriptions will be received by Mr. Barnes, 4, Sussex-place.\n\nTHE CROYDON MURDERER.\u2014The execution of the sentence of death passed upon John Carver at the recent Surrey assizes, for the murder of his wife, has been respited, on the recommendation of the learned judge before whom he was tried.\n\nTHE LATE MARQUIS OF HASTINGS.\u2014It is stated that the whole of the debts of the late Henry, Marquis of Hastings, have been paid in full under the order of the Court of Chancery, with interest at 4 per cent., as under\u2014viz.:\u2014As to debts of 10l. and under, by Mr. Frederick John Blake, the late lord's solicitor; and as to debts over 10l., by the Accountant-general of the court.
