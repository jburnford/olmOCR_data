THE PRINCE OF WALES.\n\n1886.\n\nPrice Six Shillings.\nPREFACE.\n\nThe India Office List, of which the First Edition is now published, contains a brief statement of the services of each member of the India Office Establishment, of the higher grades of the Civil Service of India, and of other Government servants in civil employment in that country.\n\nOwing to considerations of space it has been found necessary in the case of some classes of public servants to include only those who have reached a certain rank in the Service as indicated by their substantive rate of pay.\n\nA Revised Edition of the work will be published annually, and the names of those whose services are recorded will be retained until their retirement from the public service, and in some cases for life. The present issue contains a certain number of retired civilians and others, selected on account of the positions they held on retirement, or for distinctions conferred on them in recognition of their services.\n\nThe issue of the present Edition has been delayed from unavoidable causes, chiefly the incomplete records available in many cases. It is intended that subsequent Editions shall be published about the middle of each year, and shall be corrected, as far as possible, up to the end of the preceding year.\n\nThe work has been compiled mainly from the separate histories of services published under the direction of the supreme and local governments in India, supplemented, where possible, from private sources.\n\nThe Registrar and Superintendent of Records will be glad to receive from those concerned early intimation of errors or omissions in this or future issues. Any communication which will entail alteration in the subsequent Edition should reach the India Office before the 1st June.\n\nIndia Office,\n1st October, 1886.\n## THE INDIA OFFICE LIST.\n\n### PRESIDENTS OF THE BOARD OF CONTROL.\n\n| Names                          | Assumed charge of office |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Viscount Lewisham             | 25 April, 1801           |\n| Viscount Castlereagh          | \u2014 July, 1802             |\n| The Earl of Minto             | 11 Feb., 1806            |\n| The Right Hon.

Sir Abraham Shipman (a) | Appointed 'General and Governor' on the 19th March, 1662, was prevented from landing in Bombay by the Portuguese, and died on the island of Anjediva in October, 1664. Secretary to Sir Abraham Shipman, succeeded him in command, and came to Bombay as governor in February, 1665. He remained in power till the 5th November, 1666. | |\n| Mr. Humfrey Cooke | 5 Nov., 1666 | Died 21st May, 1667. |\n| The Hon. Sir Gervase Lucas | 22 May, 1667 | Officiating. |\n| Captain Henry Garey | 23 Sept., 1668 | Died in Surat on the 14th July, 1669. |\n| Sir George Oxenden | 14 July, 1669 | Died in Surat on the 30th June, 1677. |\n| Mr. Gerald Aungier | 30 June, 1677 | |\n| Mr. Thomas Rolt | 27 Oct., 1681 | |\n\n(a.) The first four governors held Bombay for the Crown. The Island was handed over to the Company on the 23rd Sept., 1668. For the next nineteen years (1668-1687), except for occasional visits, and during three years (1672-1675) of Governor Aungier's rule, the Governors of Bombay spent almost the whole of their time in Surat, of whose factory they were presidents. During this time, Bombay was administered by an officer styled Deputy Governor. The transfer, in 1687, of the headquarters of the Company's power to Bombay to a great extent did away with the need of a Deputy Governor. But in spite of the change the title continued for many years to be borne by the second member of the Council. It would seem to have fallen into disuse some time between 1720 and 1738.\n\n(b.) Child was Governor and General with his headquarters in Bombay, whither he moved from Surat on the 2nd May, 1687, and where he died on the 4th Feb., 1690. In the year 1683, Bombay was the scene of a revolt against the Company's authority. The head of the rebellion was Captain Richard Keigwin, the third member of the Council. Placing the Deputy Governor under arrest, Keigwin ruled Bombay in the King's name from the 27th Dec., 1683, to the 19th Nov., 1684, when on promise of pardon he handed over the Island to Admiral Sir Thomas Grantham.\n## GOVERNORS OF BOMBAY.\n\n| Names                                      | Assumed charge of office | Remarks                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mr. Bartholomew Harris                     | 4 Feb., 1690             | Died in Surat on the 10th May, 1694.                                    |\n| Mr. Daniel Annesley                        | 10 May, 1694             | Officiating.                                                             |\n| Sir John Gayer (a)                         | 17 May, 1694             |                                                                         |\n| Sir Nicholas Waite                         | \u2014 Nov., 1704             |                                                                         |\n| Mr. William Aislalie                       | \u2014 Sept., 1708            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Stephen Strutt                         | \u2014 1715                   | Officiating.                                                             |\n| Mr. Charles Boone                          | \u2014 1716                   |                                                                         |\n| Mr. William Phipps                         | \u2014 1720                   |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Robert Cowan                           | \u2014 1728                   | Mr. Cowan was dismissed the service of Government.                      |\n| Mr. John Horne                            | 22 Sept., 1734           |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Stephen Law                            | 7 April, 1739            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. John Geckie                            | 15 Nov., 1742            | Officiating.                                                             |\n| Mr. William Wake                           | 26 Nov., 1742            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Richard Bourchier                      | 17 Nov., 1750            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Charles Crommelin                      | 28 Feb., 1760            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Thomas Hodges                          | 27 Jan., 1767            | Died 23rd February, 1771.                                               |\n| Mr. William Hornby                         | 26 Feb., 1771            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Rawson Hart Bodham                     | 1 Jan., 1784             | Officiating.                                                             |\n| Mr. Andrew Ramsay                          | 9 Jan., 1788             |                                                                         |\n| Major-General Sir William Medows, K.B.     | 6 Sept., 1788            |                                                                         |\n| Major-General Sir Robert Abercromby, K.B.  | 21 Jan., 1790            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. George Dick                            | 1 Nov., 1793             | Officiating.                                                             |\n| Mr. John Griffith                          | 3 Sept., 1795            |                                                                         |\n| Mr. Jonathan Duncan                        | 27 Dec., 1795            | Died in Bombay, 11th August, 1811.                                       |\n| Mr. George Brown                           | 11 Aug., 1811            | Officiating.                                                             |\n| Sir Evan Nepean, Bart.                     | 12 Aug., 1812            |                                                                         |\n| The Hon.
