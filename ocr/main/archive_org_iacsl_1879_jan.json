On June 17th, 1879, and following days, an Examination of Candidates will be held in London. At this Examination not fewer than Candidates will be selected, if so many shall be found duly qualified. Of these, will be selected for Presidency of Bengal, [for the Upper Provinces, and for the Lower Provinces.] for that of Madras, and for that of Bombay.*\u2014Notice will hereafter be given of the days and place of Examination.\n\n2.

The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary; and if the result of such inquiries in the case of any Candidate should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India: and if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4. The Examination will take place only in the following branches of knowledge:\u2014\n\n| Branches of Knowledge | Marks |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| English Composition   | 300   |\n| History of England\u2014Including a period selected by the Candidate | 300 |\n\n* The number of appointments to be made, and the number in each Presidency, &c., will be announced hereafter.\n\n\u2020 At the open competition to be held in 1880, candidates will be required to be above 17 on the 1st June and under 19 on the 1st January of that year. At subsequent competitions they will be required to be above 17, and under 19 on 1st June of the year in which the competition is held.\n\n\u2021 Evidence of health and character must bear date not earlier than the 1st March, 1879.\n\n\u00a7 The Fee for this Examination will be \u00a35, payable by means of a special stamp according to instructions which will be communicated to Candidates.\n\n\u00b6 Marks assigned in English Composition and Mathematics will be subject to no deduction.\n\nA considerable portion of the marks for English Literature will be allotted to the work specially prepared.

Selected Candidates, before proceeding to India, will be on probation for two years, during which time they will be examined periodically, with a view of testing their progress in the following subjects:\n\n| Subjects                          | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| 1.

Political Economy             | 350   |\n\nIn these Examinations, as in the open competition, the merit of the Candidates examined will be estimated by marks, and the number set opposite to each subject denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it at any one Examination. The Examination will be conducted by means of printed questions and written answers, and by *viva voce* Examination, as may be deemed necessary. The last of these Examinations will be held at the close of the second year of probation, and will be called the \"Final Examination,\" at which it will be decided whether a selected Candidate is qualified for the Civil Service of India. At this Examination Candidates will be permitted to take up any one of the following branches of Natural Science, viz.\u2014Botany, Geology, and Zoology, for which 350 marks will be allowed.\n\n10.

The stamps payable on these documents amount to \u00a31.\n\n(7.) Candidates rejected at the Final Examination of 1881 will in no case be allowed to present themselves for re-examination.\n\n\u2020 This choice must be exercised immediately after the result of the open competition is announced on such day as may be fixed by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n---\n\n**CHAPLAINS.**\n\n**REGULATIONS FOR THEIR ADMISSION.**\n\nCandidates for appointments as Junior Chaplains must have been two years in Orders, and be under thirty-four years of age, and must, prior to appointment, produce their letters of Orders, Deacon, and Priest, as well as testimonial, signed by three benefited clergymen; the appointments are made subject to the approval of the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London.\n\nChaplains must proceed to their destination within four months from the date of their nomination by the Secretary of State, and in failure thereof, without leave obtained from the Secretary of State for India in Council, their appointments will lapse.\n\nChaplains must, as a condition of their appointment, subscribe to the Indian Service Family Pension Fund from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nThe widows and families of Chaplains are also entitled to pensions, under the terms of such Royal Warrant, regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British Officers, as may be in force at the time being.

An Officer who is absent on duty for more than a month is not entitled to draw his \"Local Allowance\" for any part of such absence.\nCHAPTER III.\nGENERAL RULES.\n\n5. Leave of absence can never be claimed absolutely as of right. Nothing in this Code or its Supplements must be understood to limit the free discretion of the Government to refuse or revoke leave of absence of any description, at any time, according to the exigencies of the public service.\n\n6. If an officer who is absent on leave obtains promotion, substantive or officiating, or an increase of pay or other allowances which involves no change in or addition to his duties or responsibilities, the promotion or increase has effect at once. Otherwise the promotion of an absent officer has effect only from the date of his return to duty.\n\n7. An officer who is discharged from, or resigns, the public service, and is re-employed after an interval, cannot, without the sanction of the Government of India, count his service prior to discharge towards leave after re-employment.\n\nException.\u2014An officer discharged from the Indian Navy on its abolition, who was subsequently re-employed in the public service, may count service in the Indian Navy towards leave after re-employment, notwithstanding the occurrence of an interval between his discharge from the Indian Navy and his first re-employment. Any leave taken by such officer while in the Indian Navy will be treated in calculating the leave due to him under this Rule, as if such leave had been taken under the Rules to which he became subject on re-employment.\n\n8. If an officer who has obtained leave of absence makes over charge of his office before noon, his leave begins on and includes the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise it begins on and includes the following day.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nFURLOUGH.\n\n9. The amount of furlough admissible to a Covenanted Civil Servant, and the aggregate amount of furlough and of special leave with allowances, admissible to an Uncovenanted Officer, is limited to six years. All the Rules in the Code are subject to this limitation.\n\nExplanation.\u2014The following leave under other Rules is counted as furlough under this Section.\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014furlough and leave with allowances on medical certificate under former Rules.\n\n(1) Leave of the kind described in Section 4 (a), and junior furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855 are not counted against an officer under this Section.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014furlough and leave with allowances on medical certificate and leave on private affairs under former Rules, or under the Rules in Supplement F to this Code.\n\n10. The amount of furlough \"earned\" by an officer is one-fourth of his active service.\n\nProviso.\u2014Provided that, in making this calculation for an Uncovenanted Officer, only half of the active service rendered by him in offices other than those included in Schedule A shall be taken into account.\n\n1. The whole of the active service rendered while officiating in any of the offices included in Schedule A is to be taken into account.\n\n11. The amount of furlough \"due\" to an officer is the amount which he has earned, diminished by\u2014\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014\n\n(1) The amount of furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules, except junior furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855;\n\n(2) The excess over one year in the amount of leave with allowances, on medical certificate, which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014\n\n(3) The amount of furlough, or special leave, with allowances, which he has enjoyed under these or any other Rules;\n\n(4) The amount of leave on private affairs, or on medical certificate with allowances, which he has enjoyed under the Rules formerly applicable to him.\n\nProviso.\u2014Provided that if more than two years' furlough be due to an Uncovenanted Officer when he is first admitted to the benefit of these rules, the excess shall be cancelled.\n\n12. To an officer who has rendered three years' continuous service, furlough for not more than two years may be granted, as follows:\n\nOn medical certificate,\u2014unconditionally;\n\nWithout medical certificate,\u2014subject to these provisos:\u2014(1) That the furlough be due to him; (2) that he have rendered eight years' active service; (3) that the whole number of officers absent on furlough and special leave do not exceed the limit (if any) appointed by the Government of India.\n\n13. Furlough granted under Section 12, may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\n14. To an officer who has not rendered three years' continuous service, furlough for not more than one year may be granted on medical certificate.\n\n15. Furlough granted under Section 14 for less than one year may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\n16. (a) An officer on ordinary furlough, has a lien on his substantive appointment or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay. Ordinary furlough includes\u2014\n\n(1) The first two years of each separate period of furlough under Section 12, including any extension under Section 13; provided that ordinary furlough can, under no circumstances, extend beyond two years at one time. (2) So much of furlough under Section 14, including any extension under Section 15, as may be due, provided the Officer have rendered six months' continuous active service.\n\n(b) On every furlough a Covenanted Civil Servant has no lien; but an Uncovenanted Officer has a lien.\n\n17. An officer on ordinary furlough's entitled, subject to the limitations prescribed in Sections 18 and 19 to a leave allowance equal to half the average salary which he has earned during so much of his continuous active service as is within the three years preceding the day on which he gives up office.\n\nProvided that subsidiary leave shall not be included in active service under this Section nor periods during which an officer has been out of employ in India, otherwise than as a penalty for misconduct. And provided also that the leave allowances of an Uncovenanted Officer shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes furlough.\n\n18. The maximum leave allowance of a Covenanted Civil Servant on ordinary furlough is, if paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3250 a quarter, or if paid in India Rs. 8434 a month. The minimum is, if paid at the Home treasury, \u00a3125 a quarter, or his last salary, whichever is less, or if paid in India, Rs. 4163 a month, or his last salary, whichever is less.\n\n19. The maximum leave allowance of an Uncovenanted Officer on ordinary furlough is, if paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a quarter, or if paid in India, Rs. 6663 a month. There is no minimum.\n\n1. An officer on furlough does not forfeit his past leave allowance by resigning the service without returning to India.\n\n20. An officer on furlough other than ordinary, is entitled, if a Covenanted Civil Servant, to subsistence allowance, and, if an Uncovenanted Officer, to \u00a3120 a quarter paid at the Home treasury, or Rs. 400 a month paid in India or to one quarter of the average salary defined in Section 17, whichever is less.\n\n1. The following are the rates of monthly subsistence allowance for Covenanted Civil Servants:\u2014\n\nTo an officer of not more than eight years' actual residence in India. Rs. 250\nTo an officer of more than eight, but less than twelve years' actual residence in India ... 320\n\nTo an officer of twelve or more years' actual residence in India ... 400\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n21. Special leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months, provided that an officer who has had special leave must render six years' active service before he can again have such leave.\n\n(1) The corresponding leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this proviso.\n\n(2) An Uncovenanted Officer is not debarred from obtaining special leave with allowances under this Chapter by reason of his having had leave on private affairs under the Rules in Supplement F, such leave on private affairs being furlough in another form.\n\n22. An officer on special leave has a lien on his substantive appointment, or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay.\n\n23. For the first six months for which an officer is on special leave, whether the six months be included in the same leave or not, he is entitled to the leave allowance admissible under Sections 17, 18, and 19. Thereafter he is entitled to no leave allowance.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n24. (a) *Furlough and special leave out of India begin on, and include the day of the departure of the vessel on which the officer sails; and to an officer taking such leave, subsidiary leave, not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, may be granted from the day on which he gives up office to the day before that on which his furlough or special leave begins.\n\n(b) *Furlough and special leave out of India, end on, and include, the day before the arrival of the vessel on which the officer returns; and to an officer coming back from such leave, subsidiary leave, not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, may be granted from the day on which the vessel arrives, to the day before that on which he assumes the office to which he may be appointed.\n\n25. An officer may take furlough or special leave, partly in, and partly out of, India. But subsidiary leave is not admissible under Section 24, Clause (a), unless the furlough or special leave begins as furlough or special leave out of India, nor under Section 24, Clause (b), unless it ends as furlough or special leave out of India.\n\nProvided that if an Officer who has obtained subsidiary leave, with the intention of taking furlough or special leave out of India, is prevented by sickness or other urgent or adequate reason from embarking within the period of his subsidiary leave, the Local Government may order that his furlough or special leave shall begin in India at the end of his subsidiary leave, and consequently without forfeiture of this leave.\n\n(1) In the absence of such special order, if an Officer remains in India after the end of subsidiary leave under Section 24 Clause (a) his furlough or special leave will be held to have begun as furlough or special leave in India, and will be counted from the day on which he gave up office.\n\n26. An officer on subsidiary leave under Clause (a) of Section 24 has, or has not, a lien on an appointment according as he has, or has not, such lien on the first day of the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\n27. An officer on subsidiary leave under Clause (b) of Section 24 has, or has not, a lien on an appointment according as he has, or has not, such lien on the day last preceding the subsidiary leave.\n\n28. An officer on subsidiary leave is entitled to allowances as follows:\u2014\n\n* Applies to a Commissioned Military Officer in Civil employ.\n\n(a) If the leave be subsidiary to special leave, and the officer have had leave subsidiary to a former special leave no allowance.\n\n(b) If the leave be subsidiary to ordinary furlough or special leave, the allowance admissible under Section 17; but calculated, in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant without the limitation of maximum or minimum prescribed by Section 18. The limitations prescribed by Section 19, apply to the allowances of an Uncovenanted officer on subsidiary leave.\n\n(c) If the leave be subsidiary to furlough other than ordinary, the allowance admissible under Section 20.\n\n(d) If the officer, under Section 37, have ceased to have a lien on a substantive appointment\u2014as, for example, if a Covenanted Officer has been absent on extraordinary leave in extension of furlough\u2014in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, subsistence allowance; and, in the case of an Uncovenanted Civil Servant, no allowance.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer may draw allowances as if he were on privilege leave for any part of his subsidiary leave under Clause (a) of Section 24, for which if he were not going on furlough or special leave, privilege leave would be admissible to him. It is to be observed that an officer who has no lien on an appointment cannot benefit by this Rule.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n29. The amount of privilege leave admissible at one time is limited to three calendar months.\n\n30. The amount of privilege leave earned by an officer is one eleventh part of the time during which he has been on duty without interruption. Provided that no privilege leave can be earned by an officer by duty done, while three months' such leave is due to him; and that, whenever duty is interrupted, all claim to privilege leave earned theretofore is forfeited. Absence on privilege leave, though not counting as duty, is not an interruption of duty within the meaning of this Section.\n\n31. The privilege leave due to an officer is the privilege leave which he has earned, less the period during which he has been absent on privilege leave.\n\n(1) To Uncovenanted Judicial and Educational officers whose duties are not continuous, and who enjoy regular vacations during which they are allowed to be absent from duty, privilege leave is not admissible, except in case of urgent necessity.\n\n(2) The Local Government, may, with the sanction of the Government of India, impose a like restriction in the case of Covenanted Officers.\n\n32. To an officer who has been on duty, without interruption, for eleven calendar months, and who has not, for six calendar months, been absent on privilege leave, the whole or any part of the privilege leave due to him may be granted.\n\nAn officer applying for privilege leave must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking furlough, special leave, subsidiary leave, leave on private affairs or leave on medical certificate, for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying for permission to retire or to take such leave within the three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\n33. An officer on privilege leave has a lien on his substantive appointment. He also has a lien on his officiating appointment, so long as it is not resumed by another having a superior lien on it.\n\n34. An officer on privilege leave is entitled to a leave allowance equal to the salary which he would earn in the appointment on which he has a lien.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer on privilege leave is entitled to a leave allowance equal to his salary, even though another officer be appointed to act for him.\n\nAn officer who has no lien on an appointment is entitled, during privilege leave\u2014\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, to subsistence allowance.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer, to 10 allowance.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nEXAMINATION LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n[The Rules in this Chapter apply to Commissioned Military Officers in Civil employ, except those employed in the Public Works Department and in the Survey Department under the Surveyor-General of India, for whom there are special Departmental Rules. The Rules in this Chapter do not apply to Officers in the Forest Department, for whom also there are special Departmental Rules.]\n\n1. A Covenanted Civil Servant who is a candidate for a reward offered by the Government for the study of any of the Vernacular languages, may be allowed leave for one month for the purpose of being examined.\n\n2. If he pass the examination, he may be allowed similar leave for another month.\n\n3. An officer on examination leave has a lien on his appointment (substantive or officiating), and is entitled to leave allowance as if he were on privilege leave.\n\n4. An officer while absent from his office or from his station to attend a departmental examination, or (in the Punjab) an examination in Pashtu or Belechi, which is obligatory on certain officers, is considered to be on duty.\n\n5. Leave may not be given under Rule 4 to an officer to prepare for examination, or for recreation after examination. A reasonable time, including the day or days of examination should be allowed for the journey to and from the place of examination, and nothing more.\n\n6. Leave may not be granted to a Military Officer in Civil employ to enable him to pass an examination under the Government of India in the Military Department.\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nEXTENSION AND COMMUTATION OF LEAVE.\n\n35. Except as provided in Section 24, no kind of leave can be granted in continuation of any other kind; but any leave may be retrospectively changed for any other kind or amount of leave which might at first have been granted: provided that the grant, or extension, of furlough under this rule (otherwise than on medical certificate) is subject to Proviso 3 under Section 12.*\n\n1. Except by the Secretary of State, leave cannot be changed or extended without the permission of the Local Government, which originally granted it.\n\n2. An officer on furlough or special leave in Europe who wishes to have his leave extended must apply to the Secretary of State for India at least three months before the end of his leave.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nPAYMENT OF LEAVE ALLOWANCES.\n\n[This chapter applies to all officers in civil employ.]\n\n33. (a) Leave allowances are payable in India after the end of each month; but an officer on furlough or special leave out of India may, at his option, take payment at the Home treasury of the Government of India.\n\n1. An officer embarking on furlough or special leave must take with him a last pay-certificate, whether he intends to draw his allowances in England or not.\n\nb) If payment be taken at the Home treasury it is made quarterly, and rupees are converted into sterling at the rate of exchange fixed, for the time being, for financial transactions between the Imperial and the Indian Treasuries.\n\nException. The Absentee Allowance of a Military Officer on furlough out of India and drawn in England, who elected the Military Furlough Rules of 1868 before the 1st July, 1871, is paid at the rate of two shillings the Government rupee.\n\n1. Payment is made from the Home treasury as follows:\u2014\n\nOn fixed quarter-days (namely March 25th, June 24th, September 29th, and December 24th), a form is supplied on application to the India Office, containing\u2014\n\n1. A life-certificate to be filled up in the manner directed on the face of it.\n\n2. A cheque for the amount due (which is specified for the officer to fill up, and which may be cashed through any banker).\n\nIf an officer's contract of service contains a stipulation that \"a pound sterling shall be considered equal to and calculated at any specified rate,\" his leave allowances are converted into sterling at that rate.\n\nIf an officer receives an advance of pay in England to enable him to return to duty in India, the advance will be recovered at the rate or rates of exchange fixed for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments for the year in which the advance was made. The same rule will also apply when an advance is made in England to a person appointed there, proceeding to India to join his appointment.\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nRETURN TO DUTY.\n\n[This Chapter applies to all Civil Officers in Civil employ, and, in respect to leave of absence in India granted by the Civil authorities to Commissioned Military Officers in Civil employ.]\n\n37. An officer who remains absent after the end of his leave is entitled to no allowance for the period of such absence, and he ceases to have a lien on any appointment, if his leave was furlough, immediately, and if it was special or privilege leave, after a week.\n\nAn officer on furlough or special leave in Europe may not return to India, without obtaining the permission of the Secretary of State. He must apply for this permission at least three months before the end of his leave.\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE.\n\n38. Every application for leave is to be submitted to the Local Government, which will deal with it in such manner as the Governor-General in Council may prescribe\n\n1. When an officer applies for leave, he should quote the Section or Rule of this Code under which he considers himself entitled to the leave.\n\n2. If the officer is going on leave out of India, on Medical Certificate, he should take with him one copy of the Medical Report on his case.\n\n3. A duplicate of the Medical Report upon the case of an officer going to Europe on medical certificate should be forwarded through the Government under which the officer is employed for the information of the Medical Board attached to the India Office, so as to arrive as soon as the officer arrives in England.\n\n4. If an applicant for an extension or commutation of leave on medical certificate be residing out of India, and within twenty miles of London, he must produce a certificate from the Medical Board attached to the India Office showing the necessity for the extension or commutation. If he be residing more than twenty miles from London, certificates must be produced from two medical practitioners, and he may be called upon to produce other evidence.\n\n39.

Except under Rule 7, furlough shall not be repeated until after the completion of three years' actual service from the date of the last return from furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\nN.B. The words \"furlough, or extraordinary leave,\" in the above Rule mean furlough under these Rules, or extraordinary leave granted to any officer since he has been a Chief Justice or Judge of a High Court.\n\n5. The maximum term of furlough to be taken at any one time shall be fifteen months.\n\n6. Under medical certificate, furlough may be granted before it is at credit under Rule 2.\n\n7. On urgent private affairs, furlough may be granted before it is at credit under Rule 2, and although three years of actual service have not been completed since the last return from furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\nProvided that furlough under this Rule shall not exceed six months, and shall be granted only once during the whole period of a Judge's service in the High Court.\n8. The aggregate amount of all furlough which can be granted to a Judge during the whole period of his service in the High Court is two years and a half.\n\n9. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date of the Judge's quitting his office to the date of his return thereto. Furlough taken out of India shall be reckoned from the date of embarkation to the date of debarkation.\n\nIn the event of the furlough being taken partly in India and partly out of India, the commencement and termination of the furlough shall be respectively determined by the above Rules, according as the furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n10. For the interval clapping between the date of quitting his office and the commencement of furlough out of India, and between the termination of furlough out of India and resuming his office, a Judge may be allowed subsidiary leave not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, which in special cases may be extended.\n\n11. A Judge, when on furlough or subsidiary leave, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 833-5-4 per mensem in the case of leave taken in India, or \u00a31,000 per annum in the case of leave taken out of India.\n\n12. Except under medical certificate, the number of furloughs to be granted at any one time, and the grant of furloughs to individual Judges shall be subject to, and limited by, the exigencies of the service, which exigencies shall be determined exclusively by the authority granting the furlough.\n\n13. If, owing to the exigencies of the service, it may be necessary to place any limit on the number of Judges who may be absent on furlough at the same time, applications not supported by medical certificate will be granted in the following order:\n\nThe Judge to whose credit the greatest amount of furlough remains under Rule 2 shall have the preference.\n\nIf two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, the preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in a High Court is longest, reckoning, in the case of a Judge who has not taken furlough or extraordinary leave, from the date of his commencement of service in the High Court, and, in the case of a Judge who has taken furlough or extraordinary leave, from the date of his last return from such furlough or leave.\n\nIf two or more applicants are equal in both respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Court.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n14. Subject to the exigencies of the service, a Judge who has completed eleven months' continuous duty, inclusive of vacations, may, if the Government be satisfied that there is an urgent necessity, but not otherwise, be granted privilege leave for one month without deduction from his salary or acting allowances.\n\n15. In the same manner and under the same conditions an additional month of privilege leave shall be held to accrue to a judge after each further period of eleven months' continuous duty.\n\n16. Privilege leave shall not be taken in instalments; but any balance of privilege leave that may not have been taken shall be added to the next privilege leave which may accrue.\n\nProvided that the whole privilege leave taken at any one time shall not exceed three months, and that any accumulation of privilege leave beyond that period shall be forfeited.\n\nNote.\u2014Section 32, Rule 1 of the Code shall not be held to apply to a Chief Justice or Judge of a High Court, even though, under Rule 23, he may elect to abide by former Rules, whatever Rules such an Officer may elect, privilege leave shall not be granted to him except on urgent necessity being shown.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n17. Furlough and privilege leave shall not be taken as such, in continuation of each other; but if a Judge absent on one of these classes of leave be allowed to change it for another, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under the class of leave for which it was changed.\n\n18. Applications for leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Government may, from time to time, prescribe.\n\n19. Leave allowances shall be payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\n20. No substantive appointment shall be vacated, merely by reason of leave being granted under these rules.\n\n21. If a Judge shall overstay any leave, he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent, and if he shall so continue absent for more than one week, his office shall be liable to become vacant.\n\n22. No leave, except privilege leave and leave subsidiary to furlough, shall count as service for pension.\n\n23. Each Judge who stood appointed to a High Court on the 7th August, 1869, and has taken no leave since then, shall, on the next occasion of his taking leave, be given the option of accepting these Rules or abiding by those in force before that date for Judges of the High Courts of Judicature. Any Judge who has taken leave since the 7th August 1869, must abide by the Rules he elected when taking that leave.\n\nNote.\u2014Under this Rule a Covenanted Civil Servant, who stood appointed as Judge of a High Court on the 7th August, 1869, may take leave on Medical Certificate under the Rules which were in force before the 1st July, 1868, for the grant of such leave to Covenanted Civil Servants generally.\n\n24. If a Judge, who is a Covenanted Civil Servant, shall be permitted to resign his office and remain in the service, all leave which he may have taken as a Judge of the High Court shall be reckoned as if it had been taken under the rules for the leave of absence of Covenanted Civil Servants.\n\n25. The foregoing Rules regarding furlough and leave of absence, are, with the modifications A and B below stated, applicable also to the following officers.\n\nJudges of the Chief Court of the Punjab who are Barristers of England or Ireland or Members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland.\n\nRecorders in Burmah.\n\nFirst Judges of Small Cause Courts at Presidency Towns.\n\nSecretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department.\n\nModifications indicated above.\n\n(A) The Allowances of these Officers, while on furlough or subsidiary leave, shall not exceed half their salaries, and shall be limited also to the rate prescribed in Rule 11.\n\n(B) The privilege Leave of the Secretary to the Council of the Governor General for making Laws and Regulations shall be regulated by the Civil Leave Code.\nThe following Rules regulate the grant of leave of absence and acting allowances to Law Officers:\n\n1.

The leave of absence and acting allowances of a Law Officer who is a member of the Covenanted Civil Service are regulated by the provisions of the Civil Leave and Acting Allowance Codes.\n\n3. The leave of absence and acting allowances of a Law Officer who is not a member of the Covenanted Civil Service, or a Government Pleader or Government Prosecutor, but whose pay is fixed, and his whole time retained for the service of Government, are regulated by the provisions of the Civil Leave and Acting Allowance Codes as if he were a member of the Covenanted Civil Service.\n\n4. A Government Pleader or Government Prosecutor is entitled to such leave of absence and allowances when on leave, and to such acting allowances, as the authority who appoints him may think fit to grant; provided that no expense be caused to the Government.\n\n5. The leave of absence and acting allowances of a Law Officer who is not a member of the Covenanted Civil Service or a Government Pleader or a Government Prosecutor, whose pay is fixed but whose whole time is not retained for the service of Government are regulated by the following rules:\n\nI. \"Active service\" includes, besides time spent on duty, leave of absence taken under Rule III, and subsidiary leave of absence taken under Rule VIII.\n\nII. An application for leave of absence must be submitted, through the Officer who passes his pay, to the authority to which the Officer is directly subordinate.\n\nIII. Leave of absence during the vacation of the High or Chief Court within whose jurisdiction the Officer serves, may be granted without deduction of pay.\n\nNote.\u2014Provided that no expense is caused to the Government.\n\nIV. Leave may be granted on medical certificate for a period not exceeding one year; and leave so granted may, on medical certificate, be extended to twenty months.\n\nV. Leave of absence on medical certificate may not be granted again until after three years' active service.\n\nVI. Leave of absence on private affairs, for a period not exceeding six months, may be granted once only to an Officer who has rendered six years' active service.\n\nVII. After four years' active service, furlough without pay, but with retention of appointment, may be granted for a period not exceeding one year.\n\nVIII. In very urgent cases subsidiary leave of absence may be granted under Section 24 of the Civil Leave Code; provided that no expense be caused to the Government by the grant of such leave.\n\nIX. Excepting the case of subsidiary leave, no kind of leave may be granted in continuation of any other kind of leave; but any leave may be, retrospectively, changed for any other kind or amount of leave which might at first have been granted.\n\nX. If an officer, who has obtained leave of absence makes over charge of his office before noon, his leave begins on, and includes, the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise, it begins on and includes the following day.\n\nXI. If an officer resumes charge of his office after noon, his leave of absence ends on, and includes the day on which he resumes charge; otherwise it ends on and includes the day before he resumes charge.\n\nXII. An Officer while on leave under Rules IV, V, or VI., is entitled to half pay: Provided that his maximum leave allowance is, if paid in India, Rs. 833\u00bd a month, and, if paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3250 a quarter.\n\nXIII. An Officiating Officer is entitled to the pay of the appointment, less the fraction of it drawn by the absentee, in addition to the same fraction of the pay of his own substantive office, if any. In calculating this fraction, the maximum leave allowance of \u00a3250 a quarter, payable from the Home Treasury of the Government of India, is held to be equal to Rs. 2,500.\n\nProvisos:\u2014\n\n(I) The minimum salary of a Standing Counsel at Calcutta, is Rs. 1,000 a month, and\n\n(2) The minimum salary of a Government Advocate at Lahore, Allahabad, Rangoon, or Moulmein, is three-quarters of the pay of the appointment.\n\n6. Leave of absence may be granted under the Rules in Clause 5 to a Law Officer, who is paid by fees, whether his whole time be retained for the service of Government or not, on condition that he makes such arrangements for the performance of his duties as are satisfactory to the authority by which he is appointed, and on condition that, in case of his obtaining leave of absence on private affairs, under Rule VI., the Officiating Officer shall receive the whole of the fees attached to the office.\n\nSUPPLEMENT D.\n\nBishops.\n\n1. The following Rules regulate the grant of leave to Bishops.\n\n2. A Bishop may be allowed leave of absence either on medical certificate or on furlough.\n\n3. The amount of leave of absence on medical certificate admissible to a Bishop is limited to two years.\n\n4. Subject to the limitation in rule 3, leave of absence may be granted to a Bishop upon medical certificate for a period not exceeding one year. Leave so granted may be extended upon medical certificate to any period not exceeding eighteen calendar months.\n\n5. The amount of furlough admissible to a Bishop at one time is limited to six calendar months.\n\n6. The amount of furlough earned by a Bishop is one-eleventh of the time during which he has been on duty without interruption, provided that no additional furlough can be earned by duty done while six months' furlough is due and that, when duty is interrupted, all furlough earned theretofore is cancelled.\n\nThe furlough due to a Bishop is the furlough which he has earned less the period during which he has been absent on furlough.\nAbsence on furlough, though not counting as duty, is not an interruption of duty within the meaning of this Rule.\n\n7. To a Bishop who has been on duty without interruption for thirty-three calendar months, and who has not for twelve calendar months been absent on furlough, the whole or any part of the furlough due to him may be granted.\n\n8. An Archdeacon or a Chaplain appointed to hold charge of a diocese during the absence of the Bishop upon furlough or upon leave on medical certificate is entitled to an allowance of Rs. 500 a month in addition to the pay of his substantive office.\n\n9. A Bishop while absent upon furlough or upon leave on medical certificate is entitled to full pay less Rs. 500 a month, but not to any other allowances.\n\n10. An Archdeacon or a Chaplain appointed to hold charge of a diocese during the absence of the Bishop upon furlough or upon leave on medical certificate is entitled to the travelling and other similar allowances admissible to the Bishop.\n\n11.

Leave other than privilege leave granted to a Chaplain before his completion of twenty-five years' service ceases to have effect on such completion.\n\n**FURLOUGH.**\n\n3. The amount of furlough admissible to a Chaplain is limited to six years. All the Rules in this Supplement are subject to this limitation.\n\nFurlough and leave with allowances on medical certificate under former Rules are counted as furlough under this Rule; but leave of absence in India taken before the 25th of August, 1854, is not.\n\n4. (a) The amount of furlough \"earned\" by a Chaplain is one-fourth of his active service, and three months in addition thereto.\n\n(b) The amount of furlough \"due\" to a Chaplain, is the amount which he has earned, diminished by\u2014\n\n(1) The amount of furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules.\n(2) The excess over one year in the amount of leave with allowances on medical certificate which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\n5.

The Bishop of Calcutta will report to the Government of India when the limit is reached.\n\n(b) Furlough taken under this Section may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\n(c) The furlough of a Chaplain is strictly limited to a period of three years at one time, and cannot be extended even without allowances. But the Secretary of State for India reserves to himself the power of allowing a Chaplain to remain in Europe beyond three years, should special and exceptional circumstances require a modification of this Rule.\n\n6. (a) To a Chaplain who has not rendered three years continuous service, furlough for not more than one year may be granted on medical certificate.\n\n(b) Furlough granted under this section for less than one year may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\n7. A Chaplain on furlough is entitled to allowances as follows:\u2014\n\n| On ordinary furlough. | On other furlough. |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Archdeacon, and the Senior Chaplain of the Church of Scotland | \u00a3600 a year | \u00a3480 a year |\n| Senior Chaplains | \u00a3500 | \u00a3334 |\n| Junior Chaplains | \u00a3350 | \u00a3290 |\n\nExplanation.\u2014Ordinary furlough includes\u2014\n\n(1) The first two years of each separate period of furlough under Section 5\n(2) So much of furlough under Section 6 as may be due, provided that the Chaplain have rendered six months' continuous active service.\n\nNote.\u2014A Chaplain on furlough does not forfeit his past leave allowance by resigning the service without returning to India.\nSPECIAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n8. Special leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at any time, for not more than six months; provided that a Chaplain, who has had special leave, must render six years' active service before he can again have such leave.\n\n9. (a) For the first period of a Chaplain's special leave, he is entitled to the leave allowance admissible during ordinary furlough.\n\n(b) In subsequent periods he is entitled to no leave allowance.\n\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n10. (a) Furlough and special leave, out of India, begin on, and include, the date of the departure of the vessel on which the Chaplain sails; and to a Chaplain taking such leave, subsidiary leave, not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, may be granted from the day on which he gives up duty to the day before that on which his furlough or special leave begins.\n\n(b) Furlough and special leave, out of India, end on, and include, the day before the arrival of the vessel in which the Chaplain is; and to a Chaplain returning from such leave, subsidiary leave not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, may be granted from the day on which the vessel arrives, to the day before that on which he assumes the duty to which he may be appointed.\n\n1. Subsidiary leave may be granted to a Chaplain retiring from the service to the same extent and with the same allowances as if he were going on furlough.\n\n2. Subsidiary leave for more than thirty days may be granted in cases of necessity, but every such grant and the reason for it are to be reported to the Government of India.\n\nExplanation.\u2014A Chaplain may take furlough or special leave partly in, and partly out of India. But subsidiary leave is not admissible under Clause (a) of this Section, unless the furlough or special leave begins as furlough or special leave out of India; nor under Clause (b) unless it ends as furlough or special leave out of India.\n\nII. A Chaplain on subsidiary leave is entitled to the same allowances as during the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\n1. A Chaplain may draw allowances as if he were on privilege leave for any part of his subsidiary leave under Clause (a) of Section 10, for which, if he were not going on furlough or on special leave, privilege leave would be admissible to him.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n12. Privilege leave may be granted as follows:\n\nAfter five months' uninterrupted duty,\u2014for not more than one month.\n\nAfter ten months' uninterrupted duty,\u2014for not more than two months.\n\nAfter fifteen months' uninterrupted duty,\u2014for not more than three months.\n\nNote.\u2014In applying for privilege leave a Chaplain must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking furlough, special leave, subsidiary leave or leave on Medical Certificate for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely barred by this declaration from applying to retire or to take such leave within three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\n13. A Chaplain on privilege leave is entitled to the same pay and house-rent as if he were on duty.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS.\n\n14. The rules for\u2014\n\n(1) Extension and commutation of leave; and\n\n(2) Payment of leave allowances;\n\nare those contained in Sections 35 and 36 of the Code, and the rulings subjoined. But to a Chaplain going on furlough to England, an advance of the first quarter's allowances may be made, which advance is not recoverable in the event of his death.\n\n15. Applications for leave are to be dealt with as the Governor-General in Council may from time to time prescribe; and priority of claim is determined in accordance with Section 39 of the Code.\n\nSUPPLEMENT F.\n\nUNCovenANTED OFFICERS GENERALLY.\n\nPRELIMINARY.\n\n1. (a) Leave of absence from duty may be granted under the following Rules to officers who have substantive appointments on permanent establishments under the Government, and who are not entitled to leave under any of the other Rules in the Code or its Supplements.\n\n(b) These Rules apply fully only to those whose pay is not less than one hundred rupees a month. But leave may be granted under them to an officer whether he be in superior or inferior service whose pay is less than one hundred rupees a month, so far as it can be done without imposing any cost upon the State. The absentee allowance of the substantive incumbent must not exceed what remains from the pay of the appointment after provision is made for the efficient discharge of his duties during his absence. No leave in excess of the leave admissible under these Rules may be granted to such an officer, with allowances, or counting as service for pension.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer holding an appointment on a progressive pay, rising to a maximum of one hundred rupees, who is in receipt of the maximum pay, is not, by reason of the mean pay of the appointment being less than one hundred rupees, to be treated as an officer whose pay is less than one hundred rupees.\n\n2. In these Rules, \"pay\" means substantive monthly pay; \"salary\" means the sum of monthly pay and acting allowance. Personal allowance is to be taken as part of an officer's substantive pay.\n\n\"Average salary\" means the average salary for a month calculated for so much of the three years immediately preceding the day on which the officer gives up office, as he has passed on duty, or on privilege leave. But, whenever an officer whose appointment is not gazetted takes leave for not more than one month, or whenever such an officer's salary is less than three hundred rupees, his pay (not salary) when he gives up office, is to be taken in lieu of average salary.\n\n\"Half average salary\" is always subject to a maximum of Rs. 500 a month if paid in India, and \u00a3150 a quarter if paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India.\n\n\"One quarter average salary\" is always subject to a maximum of Rs. 400 a month if paid in India, and \u00a3120 a quarter if paid at the Home treasury.\n\nProvided always that the allowance of an officer during leave shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes leave.\n\nLEAVE ON MEDICAL CERTIFICATE.\n\n3. Leave on medical certificate may be granted, whenever sufficient cause is shown, for three years in all, but not for more than two years at one time; and no officer can have leave on medical certificate out of India more than twice.\n\n4. An officer on leave under Section 3 is entitled to half of his average salary for the first fifteen months\nof each period of absence, but not for more than thirty months in all.\n\nFor the rest of his leave under Section 3 he is entitled to a quarter of his average salary.\n\nLEAVE ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n5. Leave on private affairs for six months at a time may be granted to an officer who has not had furlough. The first leave under this section may be taken after six years' service, and the leave may be repeated after intervals of six years.\n\n(1) Leave on private affairs does not accumulate, nor can it be taken in instalments.\n\n(2) Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for leave on private affairs.\n\n6. An officer on leave under Section 5 is entitled to half of his average salary.\n\n(1) An Officer does not forfeit the allowance to which he is entitled under this Section by resigning the service at the end of the leave.\n\nFURLough.\n\n7. Furlough may be granted as follows to an officer who has not had leave on private affairs:\u2014\n\nAfter ten years' service, one year or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year or any less period.\n\nOr,\u2014after eighteen years' service, two years or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year or any less period.\n\nProvided that not more than two years in all may be granted.\n\n(1) Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for furlough.\n\n(2) Leave on private affairs under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1863 does not prevent the grant of furlough under this Section.\n\n8. An officer on furlough is entitled to half of his average salary.\n\nLEAVE WITHOUT ALLOWANCES.\n\n9. Leave without allowances may, in cases of necessity, be granted for such time as may be necessary. Time spent on leave under this section does not count as service for other leave. There is no limit to the length or frequency of leave under this Section, and it may be granted in continuation of leave on medical certificate and leave on private affairs, or furlough, but not in continuation of privilege leave.\n\nNote.\u2014Leave under this Section is extraordinary leave.\n\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE.\n\n10. Subsidiary leave for such time as may be sufficient may be added to leave on medical certificate, leave on private affairs, or furlough, when taken out of India, as prescribed in Section 24 of the Code. Fourteen days only are allowed to an officer at a Presidency town, who takes leave on medical certificate, leave on private affairs, or furlough out of India, and embarks or debarks, as the case may be, at this town. Subsidiary leave may also be granted to an officer going on, or returning from, leave on medical certificate to a sanitarium in India.\n\n11. An officer on subsidiary leave prefixed to other leave, is entitled to half his average salary. An officer on subsidiary leave following other leave, is entitled to half his average salary, or one quarter of his average salary, according to the rate of allowance to which he may be entitled at the end of the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n12. Privilege leave may be granted in accordance with the rules in Chapter VII. of the Code: provided that no officer whose salary is less than two hundred rupees a month can draw any allowances for time passed on privilege leave until he returns to duty.\n\nEXAMINATION LEAVE.\n\n13. An officer permitted to present himself at any examination which must be passed before a person is eligible for a higher subordinate appointment, such as a Deputy-Magistracy, may, under the orders of the Local Government, be allowed leave of absence for the number of days which is actually necessary to enable him to attend at the examination. During this absence, which is expected to be short, no deduction will be made from the officer's allowances, unless the head of the office finds such deduction necessary to enable him to make arrangements for carrying on the work. Such leave should not be allowed more than twice for each standard of examination.\n\n14. The master of a Government school in Bengal in receipt of a salary not exceeding two hundred rupees a month while absent from his office with the object of studying to qualify himself as a teacher of surveying, is considered to be absent on duty or on special deputation, provided that such period of absence shall not exceed three months.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n15. Leave on private affairs and furlough cannot be taken in continuation of any leave except subsidiary leave; but any leave may be retrospectively charged for any other kind or amount of leave which might first have been granted;* and if an officer absent on privilege leave, or on leave on private affairs, or on furlough, take extension of leave on medical certificate, the whole of the absence will be treated as leave on medical certificate.\n\n(1) Leave without allowances cannot be converted retrospectively into leave on Medical Certificate, but leave on Medical Certificate may be given in continuation of leave without allowances.\n\n16. No officer's appointment becomes vacant, simply by reason of his taking leave under these Rules. But absence without leave, or after the end of leave (excepting privilege leave, in which case a week's grace is allowed) involves loss of appointment; and after five years' continuous absence, whether with or without leave, an officer is considered to be out of Government employ.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE.\n\n17. (a) Leave may be granted to an officer by the authority whose duty it would be to fill up his appointment if vacant. The Local Government may empower heads of Departments to grant privilege leave to officers under their orders, who are appointed by Government; but if the officer, to whom leave is granted, be a gazetted officer, the grant of leave must be reported to the Local Government.\n\n* See foot-note to Section 47, case (a) of the Civil Pension Code.\n\nSUPPLEMENT G.\n\nPort Blair Police.\n\nI.

The Rules in this Code and its Supplements apply to all public officers, except the following, who are under Military Rules:\n\n(a) Officers and men in the Army or in the Navy (Including Covenanted Medical Officers).\n\n(b) Officers of the Subordinate Medical Department.\n\n3. The general provisions of the Code do not apply to the undermentioned officers, whose pensions are regulated by the special Rules contained in the Supplements.\n\n(a) Officers of the Covenanted Civil Service.\n\n(b) Judges of the High Courts of Judicature.\n\n(c) Chaplains.\n\n(d) Members of the Bengal Pilot Service.\n\n5. An officer's claim to pension or gratuity is governed by the Rules in force at the time when he resigns or is discharged from the service of Government. No officer has a claim to a benefit granted after his resignation or discharge.\n\n7. An officer cannot earn two pensions or gratuities in the same office at the same time, or by the same continuous service.\n\n11. Service under a covenant which contains no stipulation regarding pension or gratuity does not qualify, unless the Government of India specially permits it to qualify.\n\n13. Service as an apprentice or in the Bengal Presidency as a Supernumerary Assistant Surgeon does not qualify; and, except for compensation gratuity, superior service before completion of twenty-two years of age does not qualify. But this restriction does not apply to any of the officers described in Schedule A, except Class III. (2) b.\n\n14. Provided that an officer of Class I. in Schedule A lands in India within three months from the date of his appointment, and unless some other date be specified by the Secretary of State, his service counts from the date of the despatch appointing him to the Service. The service of an officer of Class I. who does not land in India within three months from the date of his appointment, and of any officer of Class II. or III. (1) counts from the date on which he landed in India.\n\n19. Service does not qualify unless the officer holds a substantive office on a permanent establishment.\n\n2. An officer officiating in an office which is vacant, or of which the permanent incumbent does not draw any part of the pay, may, if he is confirmed without break of continuity, and if the permanent incumbent is not at the time counting service in the office for pension, count service as if he had held the office substantively.\n\n44. Periods of absence on leave other than privilege or subsidiary leave are not reckoned as service. Leave subsidiary to leave on medical certificate is not reck-\n\nomed as service in the case of an officer who has twice before had leave on medical certificate beyond India.\n\nException.\u2014An officer belonging to any of the Classes described in Schedule A, except Class III. (2) counts furlough as service as follows:\n\nIf the service of the officer He counts as service be not less than furlough for\n\n20 years ... ... ... 2 years\n\n25 ,, ... ... ... 3 ,, 30 ,, ... ... ... 4 ,, 35 ,, ... ... ... 5 ,, 47. A break in the continuity of service entails forfeiture of past service, except in the following cases:\n\n(a) Authorised leave.\n\nNote.\u2014The Local Government may commute, retrospectively, periods of absence without leave into leave without allowances, for the purposes of the Civil Leave Code, Supplement F of that Code, and the Civil Pension Code.\n\n(b) Absence prolonged after the end of leave: provided that if an officer remains absent for more than a week after the end of privilege leave, his past services are forfeited, unless the authority whose duty it is to make the appointment re-appoints the officer, and makes a declaration (to be communicated to the Accountant-General) that his past services, or part of them, shall qualify. If he remains absent for more than a month, his past services cannot count without a special order by the Government of India.\n\n(c) Suspension immediately followed by re-instatement, which need not necessarily be to the same office.\n\n(d) Abolition of office.\n\n(e) Transfer to non-qualifying service in an establishment which is under Government control. The transfer must be made by an authority competent to sanction it; and an officer who voluntarily resigns qualifying service, cannot claim the benefit of this Rule. Transfer to a grant-in-aid school always entails forfeiture.\n\n(f) Transfer to service on the household establishment of the Viceroy.\n\n(g) Loss of appointment owing to the Mutiny, provided that the officer affected cleared his character and was re-appointed as soon as a suitable vacancy was found for him.\n\n(h) Transit from one appointment to another provided that the officer is transferred under the orders of competent authority, or if he is a Ministerial Officer, with the consent of the heads of both offices concerned.\n\n48. Resignation of the public service, or removal from it on account of misconduct, or for inefficiency, or\non account of failure to pass a prescribed examination, entails forfeiture of past service.\n\nNote.\u2014Resignation of one appointment to take up another appointment, service in which qualifies for pension or gratuity, is not held to be a resignation of the Public Service.\n\n49. Pensions and gratuities are of four classes:\n\n(a) Compensation pensions and gratuities.\n(b) Invalid pensions and gratuities.\n(c) Superannuation pensions and gratuities.\n(d) Retiring pensions.\n\n(1) Pension or gratuity may not be granted to an officer whom it is desired to remove for misconduct or inefficiency.\n\n(2) A gratuity is paid in a single sum, and not by instalments.\n\n(3) An officer may be admitted to pension or gratuity while absent on leave, whether in or out of India.\n\n50. A compensation pension or gratuity is awarded to an officer discharged from the public service because, on a reduction of establishment, his appointment is abolished.\n\nNote.\u2014A gratuity is intended to be less valuable than a pension, and must not be awarded if it is likely to impose upon the State a higher charge than would arise from a pension.\n\n52. An invalid pension or gratuity is awarded on retirement from the public service to an officer who, by bodily or mental infirmity, is permanently incapacitated\u2014\n\n(a) For the public service, or\n(b) For the particular branch of it to which he belongs.\n\n53. If the officer applying for pension or gratuity is sixty years old or upwards, no certificate by a Medical officer is necessary. It will suffice for the head of the office to certify to the incapacity of the applicant. Otherwise incapacity for service must be established by a Medical Certificate attested as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) If the Officer submitting it is on leave in England;\u2014by the Medical Board of the India Office.\n\n(b) If he is serving at a Presidency town;\u2014by the Surgeon General of the Indian Medical Department, or by the Standing Medical Committee at the Presidency.\n\n(c) If he is a superior Officer and is serving in the interior of the country under such circumstances that, in the opinion of the Local Government, he can be conveniently required to appear before a Military Invaliding Committee;\u2014by such Committee.\n\n(d) In other cases the Local Government may either accept a certificate given by a single Commissioned Medical Officer or Medical Officer in charge of a Civil Station, or assemble a Special Invaliding Committee at a convenient Civil Station. If the pension applied for exceed Rs. 100 a month, a certificate by a single Medical Officer should not be accepted as sufficient, if it is possible, without undue inconvenience, to assemble an Invaliding Committee, or to cause the applicant to appear before the Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, or the Standing Medical Committee of the Presidency.\n\n55. If the incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits, no pension or gratuity can be granted. Otherwise, it is for the Local Government to decide whether the officer's incapacity is such as to render it necessary to admit him to invalid pension or gratuity.\n\n56. A superannuation pension or gratuity is granted to an officer entitled or compelled, by rule, to retire at a particular age.\n\nAn Officer in a superior grade who has attained the age of fifty-five years may, at his option, retire from the service on a superannuation pension.\n\nAn officer in a superior grade who has attained the age of fifty-five years may be required to retire unless the Local Government considers him efficient, and permits him to remain in the service.\n\n57. A retiring pension is granted to an officer who voluntarily retires after completing the requisite period of service.\n\n58. The amount of pension or gratuity that may be granted is determined by length of service, as set forth in Sections 59, 60, and 61.\n\n(1) An officer entitled to pension may not take a gratuity instead of pension.\n\n(2) A pension or a gratuity (except a pension granted under Section 64) is fixed in rupees, and not in sterling money, even though it is to be paid in Europe.\n\n59. The amount of compensation and invalid pension and gratuity which may be granted, is as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) After a service of less than fifteen years\u2014\nA gratuity not exceeding (except in special cases and under the orders of the Government of India) one month's emoluments for each completed year of service; and not, under any circumstances, exceeding twelve months' emoluments in all.\n\nBroken periods of a year are not to be taken into account in calculating the amount of any gratuity admissible to an officer under any Rule in the Code.\n\n(b) After a service of not less than fifteen years, but less than twenty-five years\u2014\nA pension not exceeding one-third of the officer's average emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 3,000 a year, or, if the officer's average emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 2,000 a year.\n\n(c) After a service of not less than twenty-five years\u2014\nA pension not exceeding one-half of the officer's average emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year, or, if his average emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 4,000 a year.\n\nNote.\u2014An invalid pension on the following scale, but not being less than Rs. 1,000 or more than Rs. 2,000 a year, may be granted to an officer appointed to the service under the Regulations of the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, or specially educated in England, for the Forest Department under Regulations made by the Secretary of State:\u2014\n\nIf the service of the officer be not less than\n\n| Proportion of the officer's average emoluments |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 10 years ... ... \u2014ths                         |\n| 11 ,, ... ... \u2014ths \"                           |\n| 12 ,, \u2014ths \"                                  |\n| 13 ,, \u2014ths \"                                  |\n| 14 ,, \u2014ths \"                                  |\n| 15 ,, \u2014ths \"                                  |\n\n60. The amount of superannuation pension and gratuity which may be granted is that which would be admissible as an invalid pension or gratuity.\n\nProvided, that if an officer's qualifying service began after the 20th January, 1871, and after he attained the age of 25 years, the pension or gratuity admissible under this section is to be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years' service\ncompleted, not exceeding 30, and the denominator of which is 30. The limit of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000, or Rs. 5,000 is to be applied before, and not after, this multiplication.\n\nFor Officers entitled to the benefit of Section 3 (a) \"27\" should be substituted for \"36\" in this proviso.\n\n61. The amount of retiring pension which may be granted for superior service, is as follows:\n\nAfter a service of not less than thirty years,\u2014The same in amount as the invalid pension admissible after twenty-five years' service.\n\n63. In the following cases certain privileges exist in respect of the length of service required for pension.\n\n(a) To the following officers, not being Natives of Asia, pension is admissible after three years' less service than is required from other officers, provided that they began service after twenty-five years of age:\n\n(i) Directors of Public Instruction, Inspectors of schools, Principals and Professors of colleges, and Head Masters of colleges and high schools.\n\n(ii) Barristers of England or Ireland, or members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland, serving in offices to which the Local Government has, with the consent of the Government of India, declared it to be necessary to appoint Barristers of England or Ireland or members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland.\n\nTo entitle an officer to the benefit of this Rule, the whole of the service for which pension is claimed must have been passed in one or other of the offices indicated.\n\n64. To the following officers, being Barristers of England or Ireland, or Members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland, viz., Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab, First Judges of Small Cause Courts of Presidency Towns, Recorder of Rangoon, Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department (formerly Assistant Secretary in the Home Department, Legislative Branch, and afterwards Secretary to the Council of the Governor General for making Laws and Regulations), invalid and retiring pensions are admissible as follows:\n\n(a) After not less than six years and nine months' active service in one or other of the offices specified in this Section, an invalid pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\n(b) After not less than eight years and eight months' such service, an invalid pension of \u00a3500 a year.\n\n(c) After not less than eleven years and six months' such service, a retiring pension of \u00a3750 a year.\n\nActive service here includes, besides time spent on duty, whether in substantive or acting service, privilege leave, subsidiary leave, and periods of vacation during which the officer is not on furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\n69.

A Chaplain proceeding to England on retirement without applying for Pension to the Government of India, the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay (as the case may be), should procure a certificate from the Accountant General, showing his service, residence, the amount of pension to which he is entitled, and the date from which his pension may be paid. A Chaplain to whom pension has been granted in India should be careful before proceeding to England to obtain the usual certificate of the last issue of pay or pension to him in India.\n\n2. A Chaplain absent on furlough may retire without returning to India.\n\n3. A Chaplain belonging to the Bengal establishment, who wishes to obtain pension from the authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, through the Venerable the Archdeacon, or the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Calcutta. A Chaplain belonging to the Madras or Bombay Establishment must submit his application to the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay, as the case may be, through the Venerable the Archdeacon, or the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of his diocese. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, who wishes to obtain a pension from the authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of the Church of Scotland. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay must submit his application to the Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of his Presidency.\n\n4.

An officer so circumstanced can continue to enjoy this privilege; but all Pilots admitted to the Service after 27th October, 1877, are required to subscribe at the rates detailed on the margin of Section I.\n\n2. (a) Pilots are entitled to pension at the above rates on medical certificates by the standing invaliding committee.\n\n(b) A Pilot after thirty years' actual service in India, if he shall have attained the grade of Branch Pilot, shall be entitled to retire upon the pension of Government Rs. 200 a month, or if below the grade, upon a pension of Government Rs. 100 a month, provided that in any period of three consecutive years the number of pensions so granted do not exceed four.\n\n3.

The promotion of Officers while on probation will go on in their respective regiments. Officers of the British Army, when permanently transferred to the Staff Corps, will be removed from the strength of the regiment to which they belonged. It is discretional with the Governments in India to employ the Officers of the Staff Corps, in such manner as they may think best, in the situations for which their respective qualifications may render them most fitted. The appointments and promotions in the several departments rest with the Governments in India, and will be made irrespectively of the rank which the Officers may hold in the Staff Corps.\n\nOfficers of British regiments which may be ordered home and embark before the completion of their period of probation may, with the sanction of the Government of the Presidency, be allowed to remain in India to complete that period.\n\nOfficers of Her Majesty's British Regiments are eligible for appointment to the Staff Corps of any Presidency without reference to the Presidency in which their regiments may be serving, and they will be permitted to serve out their probation without reference to their regiments being in the meantime moved to another Presidency.\n\nApplication for admission to the Staff Corps, on probation, should be made to the Government, through, and with the sanction of, the Commander-in-Chief of the Presidency, and that of the Commander-in-Chief in India.\n\nA candidate for appointment to the Staff Corps, on probation, must produce the following certificates of his Commanding Officer and the Surgeon:\n\nCertificate of Commanding Officer.\n\nCertified that a candidate for the Staff Corps, completed two years' duty with a regiment on the one year of which (or the whole period of which, as the case may be), was spent in India, has passed the examination in the Native languages by the higher (or lower) standard, and has attained such a knowledge of his drill and duty as an officer of infantry (or cavalry) in all its branches as to qualify him for the command of a company (or troop) in all situations. He also possesses a fair knowledge of the Articles of War and of the Queen's Regulations, as well as of the Military Regulations of the Bengal (Madras or Bombay) Presidency, besides having gained some general acquaintance with the organization and nature of the duties of all branches of the army serving in Bengal (Madras or Bombay). I further certify that during the period he has been attentive to his duty, and that his conduct has been in all respects unexceptionable.\n\nStation and date.\n\nCommanding Regiment.\n\nSurgeon's Certificate.\n\nI certify that, to the best of my belief, is in good bodily health, and apparently well capable of undergoing the vicissitudes of service in India.\n\nStation and date.\n\nSurgeon\n\nReiment.\n\nThe date of transfer of an Officer to the Staff Corps will be that of his appointment on probation, except in the case of an Officer who has gained promotion in his regiment during his period of probation; in that case, he is allowed to enter the Staff Corps from the day following his promotion, with the rank then gained.\n\nExcept under very special circumstances, the period of probation will be limited to one year,\u2020 at the end of\n\n* See page xxxiv.\n\u2020 All leave, except privilege leave and leave to pass in the Native languages for admission to the Staff Corps will be excluded from the year's probation.\nwhich the candidate, if not qualified for admission to the Staff Corps, must be remanded to his regiment; and should his regiment be in England, he will be put on British pay from the date of failing to pass the final examination. If possible, he will be provided with a passage in a troop ship, but if none be available, then the actual expense of the passage, and no more, will be paid to the agent of the vessel conveying the Officer to England. In no case will the period of probation exceed a second twelve months.\n\nA British Officer, on probation for the Staff Corps, proceeding on leave to Europe, is to be held to have resigned his probationary position and appointment. Should an Officer so circumstanced be placed on the half-pay list, he will cease to be considered as a probationer.\n\nA probationer for the Staff Corps may at any time be allowed to withdraw his application, provided that he has not been actually admitted to that Corps by the Government in India.\n\nAs a general rule, a young Officer, on becoming a probationer, is appointed to do duty with a Native regiment.\n\nOn the completion of the year's probation, the candidate must produce certificates from his Commanding Officer (or the Officer under whom he has served) and from the Surgeon, similar to those obtained at the commencement of his probation; and he must pass an examination in the following tests, according to the nature of the duty or department in which he is to be employed.\n\nOn special grounds, but only when required for the convenience of the public service, examinations may be held at any time within two months of the expiration of the probationary year.\n\nShould he be found qualified, he will be admitted to the Staff Corps, and to the appointment or department for which he has proved his fitness. The circumstance of an Officer being in the Staff Corps will not exempt him from passing departmental tests, should he be transferred from one appointment or department to another.\n\nOfficers of Line Regiments, in which the purchase system was in force up to the 31st October, 1871, who entered the service prior to the 26th August, 1871, and whose permanent appointment to the Indian Staff Corps shall appear in the General Orders of one of the Local Governments of India on a date subsequent to the 15th March, 1868, and who, on the date of such permanent appointment (being the date of appointment as probationers for the Staff Corps), shall not have exceeded four years' service on full pay, from the date of first Commission, shall receive, on their names appearing in the \"London Gazette\" as finally transferred to the Staff Corps, the exact sum such Officers would have received, under War Office Regulations, had they retired from the service by the sale of their Commissions at the time of joining the Staff Corps as probationers.\n\nOfficers who have been appointed probationers subsequent to the 31st October, 1871, will be required to make and sign the declaration laid down in para. \"C,\" clause 139, sec. 4 of the Queen's Regulations.\n\nThe young Officers who, on final transfer to the Staff Corps, may receive the value of their commissions, will, if appointed probationers on or after the 1st of July, 1870, be debited with the cost of their successors' passage to India, in the same manner as other Officers who are allowed to retire from British Regiments in India with the value of their commissions.\n\nOfficers who are entitled to the value of their first commissions should apply for it to the agents of the regiment to which they formerly belonged.\n\nOfficers who desire to enter the Staff Corps under the provisions of the General Order from the Horse Guards, dated the 1st of May, 1868, must make their applications in such time as will admit of the requisite forms being complied with before the completion of their four years' service, as the Government cannot be responsible for any accidental delay, and applications for special consideration will not be received hereafter.\n\nOfficers joining the Staff Corps from the British Army must furnish a statement of their services duly vouched by their late Commanding Officers, showing in detail their actual service in India, and the periods of leave during such service, completed to the date of their transfer to the Staff Corps.\n\nNo Officers while away from their regiments as probationers for the Indian Staff Corps shall be permitted to retire from the service by the sale of their commissions, but such officers will still be eligible for such promotion in their regiments as may occur whilst they are probationers by or without purchase.\n\nThe claims to pension of widows and families of officers of the Staff Corps who may join from the British Army will be treated under the provisions of the Royal Warrant of the 27th December, 1870, or of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British officers as may be in force at the time being.\n\nRULES governing the admission of Officers to the Indian Staff Corps who may volunteer from Regiments serving elsewhere than in India.\n\nI. It has been decided, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that Officers under the rank of captain, serving in regiments elsewhere than in India, may be permitted to volunteer for the Indian Staff Corps.\n\nII. Candidates cannot volunteer for any particular Staff Corps, but on arrival in India will be posted to any Presidency as the exigencies of the service may demand.\n\nIII. Candidates must have completed two years' (in the case of West India Regiments, three years') and have less than five years' service, and not exceed 26 years of age at time of volunteering, and they cannot be admitted on probation after a service of seven years. Their applications must be submitted through the Commanding Officer direct to the Military Secretary, Horse Guards, and be accompanied by a certificate of qualification and conduct from the Commanding Officer of their regiment, and also by a medical certificate in the forms annexed (A and B). The declaration (C) required by Horse Guards G.O. No. 80, dated 1st December, 1873, must also be furnished by each applicant.\n\nIV. Officers will be required to embark for India within three months from the date of their acceptance by the Secretary of State for India as Probationers for the Staff Corps.\nV. Officers will not, however, be gazetted as Probationers until the date of their actual embarkation for India, and passage will be provided at the public expense.\n\nVI. On arrival at Bombay they will be posted to a Native Corps serving in the Presidency to which they may be nominated.\n\nVII. Passage will be granted at the public expense from the port of disembarkation to the Native Corps to which they have been attached, and afterwards whenever they may be moved under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Presidency in which serving, until they are finally and permanently posted.\n\nVIII. On or before the expiration of 18 months from date of joining a Native Corps on first arrival in India they will be required to pass the Lower Standard Examination in the Native Languages, and also the Examination prescribed for final admission to the Staff Corps.\n\nIX. No officer, however, will be eligible for Staff employment, regimental or other, until he shall have passed the Higher Standard Examination in the Native Languages. (In the term staff employment is not included the appointments of squadron and wing officer.)\n\nX. Officers who do not pass the Higher Standard Examination within three years of joining on probation will be permanently removed from the Staff Corps.\n\nXI. Applications for final transfer to the Staff Corps are to be accompanied by certificates in the forms annexed (D and E), signed by the commanding and medical officers of the Native regiment in which the probationers are serving.\n\nXII. If ultimately admitted to the Staff Corps, the date of such admission shall be the date of first appointment on probation. But no officer will be so admitted until he shall have actually served 12 months on probation.\n\nXIII. Their service for promotion in the Staff Corps will be reckoned from date of first commission, but that for furlough and pension from the date of their first arrival in India, provided that for service for furlough 2\u00bd years shall have been passed in the Staff Corps.\n\nXIV. Any officer failing to pass the Examinations specified in Rule VIII. will be posted to a British regiment in India or elsewhere.\n\nXV. During the period of probation, it will be open to the commanding officer of the Native regiment to represent to the Commander-in-Chief of the Presidency to which the Probationer belongs, that he does not think that the officer, either from temper or other cause, is suited for employment with Native troops, in which case the Commander-in-Chief in India, if satisfied with the reasons, will post him temporarily to a British regiment in India, on the establishment of which he will be borne as a supernumerary pending orders from His Royal Highness the Field-Marshal Commanding in Chief.\n\nXVI. And the same course will be followed in the case of a Probationer who may, during his period of probation, voluntarily resign Staff Corps service.\n\nXVII. Probationers who may proceed on leave to Europe will be held to have resigned their probationary appointment, and shall on arrival at Home report themselves to the Adjutant-General, Horse Guards.\n\nXVIII. Probationers may continue to wear the uniform of their British regiments until finally admitted to the Staff Corps.\n\nXIX. All admissions to the Staff Corps under the provisions of this General Order will be subject to any change which may be hereafter made in the existing Staff Corps Retiring Regulations.\n\n---\n\n**TABLE OF SALARIES ALLOWED FOR STAFF OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS OF THE SEVERAL PRESIDENCIES IN INDIA.**\n\n| Military Secretariats. | Rupees.

They must possess a diploma in surgery or a license to practise it, as well as a degree in medicine, or a license to practise it in Great Britain or Ireland.\n\n2. They must subscribe and send in to the Military Secretary, India Office, Westminster, so as to reach that address at least a fortnight before the date fixed for the Examination, a declaration according to the annexed form.\n\n3. This declaration must be accompanied by the following documents:\n\n(a) Proof of age either by the candidates' own declaration, form of which can be obtained at the India Office, pursuant to the Act 5 and 6 Will.

The physical fitness of candidates will be determined previous to examination by a Board of Medical Officers, who are required to certify that the candidate's vision is sufficiently good to enable him to perform any surgical operation without the aid of glasses. A moderate degree of myopia would not be considered a disqualification, provided it did not necessitate the use of glasses during the performance of operations, and that no organic disease of the eyes existed. Every candidate must also be free from organic disease of other organs, and from constitutional weakness, or other disability likely to unfit him for military service in India.\n\n5. On producing the foregoing qualifications, the candidate will be examined by the Examining Board in the following compulsory subjects, and the highest number of marks attainable will be distributed as follows:\u2014\n\n| Subjects                                      | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| a.

The eligibility of each candidate for the Indian Medical Service will be determined by the result of the examinations in these subjects only.\n\n7. Candidates, who desire it, will be examined in French, German, and Hindustani, Comparative Anatomy, Zoology, Natural Philosophy, Physical Geography, and Botany, with special reference to Materia Medica.\n\n8. The number of marks gained in these subjects will be added to the total number of marks obtained in the obligatory part of the examination by candidates who shall have been found qualified for admission, and whose position on the list of successful competitors will thus be improved in proportion to their knowledge of modern languages and natural sciences.\n\n9. The maximum number of marks allotted to the voluntary subjects will be as follows:\u2014\n\n| Subjects                                      | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| French, German, and Hindustani (150 each)     | 450   |\n| Natural Science                               | 300   |\n\n10. The subjects for this part of the examination will be taken from the following books:\u2014\n\n- \"Animal Kingdom,\" by W. S.

Brooks, \"Physical Geography,\" by Mrs. Somerville.\n\n11. The Examiners in London will prepare a list in order of merit, with the marks affixed in the different subjects, to be transmitted to the Director-General and communicated to the Professors of the Army Medical School. If any Candidate is found to be deficient in any particular subject, this shall be stated, in order that he may receive special instruction on the point at Netley.\n\n12. After passing his preliminary examination, candidates will be required to attend one entire course of practical instruction at the Army Medical School, before being admitted to examination for a commission, on\u2014\n\n(1) Hygiene.\n(2) Clinical and Military Medicine.\n(3) Clinical and Military Surgery.\n(4) Pathology of Diseases and Injuries incident to Military Service.\n\nThese courses are to be of not less than four months' duration; but candidates who have already gone through a course at Netley as candidates for the Army or Navy Medical Service may, if thought desirable, be exempted from attending the school a second time.\n\n13. During the period of his residence at the Army Medical School, each candidate will receive an allowance of 5s per diem, with quarters, or 7s. per diem without quarters, to cover all costs of maintenance; and he will be required to provide himself with uniform (viz., the regulation undress uniform of a Surgeon of the British service, but without the sword).\n\n14. All candidates will be required to conform to such rules of discipline as the Senate may, from time to time, enact.\n\n15. At the conclusion of the course, candidates will be required to pass an examination on the subjects taught in the school. The examination will be conducted by the professors of the school.\n\nThe Director-General, or any medical officer deputed by him, may be present and take part in the examination. If the candidate gives satisfactory evidence of being qualified for the practical duties of an Army Medical Officer, he will be eligible for a commission as Surgeon.\n\n16. The position of the candidates on the list of Surgeons will be determined by the combined results of the preliminary and of the final examinations, and, so far as the requirements of the service will permit, they will have the choice of Presidency in India, according to their position in that list.\n\nIndia Office, March, 1878.\n\nN.B. The examinations for admission to the Indian Medical Service will usually take place twice a year, viz., in February and in August.\n\nNote.\u2014The next examination will take place on the 17th of February 1879, for 14 appointments.\nDECLARATION AND SCHEDULE OF QUALIFICATIONS, TO BE FILLED UP BY CANDIDATES.\n\nChristian and Surname at full length.\n\nI , years of age in last, vide accompanying certificate, a Candidate for employment as Surgeon in Her Majesty's Indian Medical Service, do hereby attest my readiness to engage for that service, and to proceed on duty immediately on being gazetted.\n\nI declare that I labour under no mental nor constitutional disease, nor any imperfection or disability that can interfere with the most efficient discharge of the duties of a Medical Officer.\n\nThe Dates of Graduations and the Universities or Colleges are to be stated\n\nI have the Degree of A.M. or A.B. from the\nI have the Degree of M.D. or M.B. from the\nI have a License to Practise Medicine from the\nI have a Diploma in Surgery from the\nI have a License to Practise Surgery from the\n\nThe Candidate should here state whether he has served in the Medical Department of the Army or Navy, or in the Subordinate Medical Department in India.\n\n(Signature at full length)\n(Date)\n(Place of Residence)\n\nCandidates who desire to undergo the voluntary examination are to sign the following declaration:\n\nIt is my intention to undergo the voluntary examination in *\n\nN.B.

The regulations are those in force at the present time. They are subject to any alteration that may be determined on.\n\nPASSAGE TO INDIA.\n\n2. Passage allowance to India on appointment will be given, or a passage provided. When passages are provided on board the Indian troop ships, a charge for messing will be made at the rate laid down in the Royal Passage Warrant of 1865, viz., 3s. 6d. a day, but, when wine and beer are not included in the mess, and it is so stated on the messing certificate, the daily contribution required will be 2s. 6d. only.\n\n3. All Surgeons who shall neglect or refuse to proceed to India under the orders of the Secretary of State for India within two months from the date of leaving Netley, will be considered as having forfeited their appointment, unless special circumstances shall justify a departure from this regulation.\n\nPAY PREVIOUS TO EMBARKATION.\n\n4. Pay at the rate of 10s. a day will be allowed from date of passing final examination at the Army Medical School, until date of embarkation when a passage is provided, or for a period of two months when the Surgeon is permitted to make his own arrangements for passage. An advance of two months' pay will also be made on embarkation.\n\nGRADES AND RELATIVE RANK.\n\n5. The grades of Medical Officers in the Indian Military Forces are four in number, viz.:\n   1. Surgeon-General, ranking as Major-General according to the date of his Commission.\n   2. Deputy Surgeon-General, as Colonel according to the date of his Commission.\n   3. Surgeon-Major, as Major according to the date of his Commission; and after twenty years' service as Surgeon and Surgeon-Major, as Lieutenant-Colonel, but junior of that rank except for choice of quarters.\n   4. Surgeon as Lieutenant according to the date of his Commission; and after six years' service as Captain according to the date of the completion of such service.\n\nPROMOTION.\n\n6. A Surgeon is promoted to Surgeon-Major on completion of twelve years' service from date of first Commission, subject to his passing the prescribed examination.\n\n7. In cases, however, of emergency, or when the good of the service renders such alteration desirable, it is competent for the Secretary of State for India, on the recommendation of the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council, to shorten the period of service above mentioned, in such manner as he shall deem fit and expedient.\n\n* State what subjects will be taken up.\n8. The examination for promotion may be taken at any time after the Surgeon has served nine or more years.\n\n9. When Surgeons have served the requisite time, they will be examined in the following manner:\n\nA series of printed questions prepared by an examining board, consisting of the Principal of the Medical College and any two or more of the professors he may associate with himself for the purpose, will be sealed and sent by the Surgeon-General to the principal medical officers of stations where Surgeons may be eligible for examination. It will be the duty of the principal medical officer of the station to deliver these sealed questions to the Surgeons, and to see that they are answered without the assistance of books, notes, or communication with any other person. The answers are to be signed and delivered, sealed, to the Principal Medical Officer, who is to send them, unopened, to the Surgeon-General, together with a declaration from the Surgeon himself, or certificate from a superior medical officer, if there is one, that he has availed himself of every opportunity of practising surgical operations on the dead body.*\n\n10. The Surgeon is also required to transmit together with his answers to the Surgeon-General a medico-topographical account of the station where he may happen to be at the time, or of some other station where he may have been resident sufficiently long to enable him to collect the necessary information for such a report. Failing this, he will send a medico-statistical report of his charge for a period of at least twelve months.\n\n11. If the examining board is satisfied with the replies to the questions, and the Surgeon-General is satisfied with the certificates and with the medico-topographical or statistical report, the Surgeon will be held qualified for promotion.\n\n12. All promotion from the rank of Surgeon-Major to that of Deputy Surgeon-General, and from the rank of Deputy Surgeon-General to that of Surgeon-General, is given by selection for ability and merit.\n\n**Tenure of Office in Administrative Grades.**\n\n13. The tenure of office of Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General is limited to five years.\n\n14. Deputy Surgeons-General, if not disqualified by age are eligible either for employment for a second tour of duty in the same grade, or for employment in the higher grade of Surgeon-General by promotion thereto.\n\n15. Absence on leave in excess of six months on medical certificate, or of four months on private affairs, involves forfeiture of appointment.\n\n**Pay and Allowances when in India.**\n\n16.

Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General on vacating office at the expiration of the five years' tour of duty, will be permitted to draw in India respectively an unemployed salary of Rs. 1,200 per mensem in the former, and Rs. 900 in the latter case, for a period of six months from the date of their vacating office, after which they will be placed while unemployed on the following scale of pay:\n\n| Surgeon-General | Deputy Surgeon-General |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| After 30 years service on full pay | \u00a3 2 5 0 | \u00a3 1 4 0 |\n| \" 25 \" \" \" \" \" | \u00a3 2 5 0 | \u00a3 1 1 0 |\n| \" 20 \" \" \" \" \" or on promotion should this period of service not be completed | \u00a3 2 0 0 | \u00a3 1 8 0 |\n\nFurloughs.\n\n23. An Officer will be eligible for one year's furlough on the completion of five years' actual service in India, and for an additional year after each subsequent five years' service.\n\n24. While on furlough, an Officer will receive half the emoluments of his office.\n\n25. No absentee shall draw more than \u00a31,000 or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\n26. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years.\n\n27. Surgeons under six years' service, and in receipt of Indian allowances as subalterns, on returning to England on sick certificate receive passage allowance.\n\n28.

In each of the above cases stated in pars. 29 and 30, six months' absence on medical certificate will be allowed to count towards actual service in those grades.\n\n34. A Surgeon-General or Deputy Surgeon-General who has completed his term of service and has reverted to British pay, may reside in Europe, at the same time qualifying for higher pension.\n\n35. With a view to maintain the efficiency of the service, all Medical Officers of the rank of Surgeon-Major shall be placed on the Retired List when they shall have attained the age of fifty-five years, and all Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General when they shall have attained the age of sixty-five years.

A Medical Officer, retiring after a service of twenty-five years and upwards, may, if recommended for the same by the Government of his Presidency, receive a step of honorary rank, but without any consequent increase of pay.\n\n37. Officers compelled to leave the service on account of ill-health, and not entitled to full-pay pension under present regulations, will be allowed the half-pay of their relative rank, as laid down in the Royal Warrant of 10th May, 1873.\n\nWound Pensions.\n\n38.

(The Royal Warrant of 1st May, 1878, is the one now in force.)\n\n40. The widows and families of Medical Officers are also entitled to pensions from the Indian Service Family Pension Fund, to which all Surgeons must, as a condition of their appointment, subscribe from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nMILITARY FURLough REGULATIONS OF 1796.\n\nOfficers (of whatever rank) must be ten years in India before they can be entitled (except in cases of certified sickness, and as hereafter specified) to their rotation to be absent on furlough, and the same rule is applicable to assistant surgeons and veterinary surgeons. The furlough to be granted by the commander-in-chief at each presidency, with the approbation of the respective governments.\n\nOfficers who have not served ten years in India, but whose presence in England is required by urgent private affairs, may be allowed a furlough for one year without pay.\n\nOfficers coming to England on furlough are required immediately to report their arrival by letter, with their address, forwarding at the same time the certificates they received in India.\n\nThe period of furlough is three years, reckoning from its date to the day of the return of the officer to his presidency.\n\nOfficers are required to join the establishment to which they belong at the expiration of the three years' furlough, unless they shall have obtained an extension of leave, six months before the expiration of that period.\n\nNo furlough will be extended, except in cases of sickness, certified in the manner hereafter mentioned; or in cases in which it shall be proved that a further residence in Europe is indispensably necessary.\n\nAll officers finding it necessary to solicit a further leave of absence on account of sickness, must, if resident in London or its vicinity, appear before the Medical Board appointed for that purpose, who will report their opinion on the state of such officer's health. And if resident in the country in any part of the United Kingdom, they must transmit with their letter of application for such leave, a certificate according to the following form, signed by at least two gentlemen, eminent in the medical profession, viz.:\n\nI hereby certify, that I have carefully examined (state the nature of the case, as well as the name of the party), and I declare, upon my honour, that, according to the best of my judgment and belief, is at present unfit for military duty, and that it is absolutely necessary, for the recovery of his health, that he should remain at least longer in this country.\n\nAlso, previously to such extension of furlough being granted, such further proof shall be adduced by personal examination or by such other evidence as shall be deemed satisfactory.\n\nOfficers abroad in any part of Europe, applying to remain a further time from their duty on account of sickness, are to furnish a certificate of two eminent physicians, in the above form, with the attestation of a magistrate, that the persons who signed the certificate are physicians.\n\nOfficers having obtained an extension of furlough to a given period, must at its expiration apply for permission either to return to their duty or to reside a further time in England.\n\nIn every case in which an officer has had his furlough extended beyond the prescribed period on the ground of his health not being sufficiently restored, and shall apply for permission to return to his duty, he shall produce a certificate from the examining physician that his health is completely re-established, and that there is every probability of his being able to perform the active duties of his profession in India.\n\nNo officer who has failed to obtain an extension of furlough will be considered eligible to return to the service after five years' absence, under the Act of Geo. III. cap. 52, sec. 70.\n\nEvery officer upon leaving India will receive a printed copy of the General Order on this subject, published agreeably to the instruction of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the plea of ignorance of the regulations will not be admitted as any justification of the breach of them; officers, therefore, who shall come home on furlough, and who shall not in due time apply, so as to effect their return to the Presidency to which they belong within the period of three years from the commencement of their furlough, will subject themselves to the loss of the service, unless they shall be permitted to remain a further time in Europe.\n\nNo officer on furlough can receive pay for more than two years and a half from the period of his quitting India until he returns, excepting colonels of regiments and general officers; the latter are then allowed to draw the pay of their brevet rank beyond the above period.\n\nMILITARY FURLough REGULATIONS.\u2014Nov. 17, 1854.\n\nWith the view of adapting the regulations to the present increased facilities of communication, and to correct, as far as possible, any tendency in them to deter officers from resorting to the places which may be most conducive to the restoration of their health, when a change of climate is required for that purpose, the following rules are established, and are to have effect from the 1st February, 1854:\n\n1. All regimental officers in the service on the 1st February, 1854, who prefer retaining what may be considered the advantages of the old regulations, may do so, provided they signify their wish to that effect when they next apply for furlough or leave of absence, without any limitation whether such leave be in India or elsewhere; and officers who once make their election will not be entitled to any other choice, but will be afterwards subject to the new or old regulations, according to their decisions.\n\n2. Staff officers, as such, have not the above option allowed them, but they may retain the advantages of the old regulations by giving up their appointments, which, in such cases, will be considered vacated from the date of embarkation.\n\n3. To those officers who adopt them, the new regulations will apply retrospectively in respect of furlough and leave of absence beyond sea, and in computing their time of service for retirement, so that their furloughs or leaves of absence, whether under the old or the new rules, and whether on private affairs or sick certificate, within or beyond India, will count for ser-\nvice to the authorized extent only, in computing the time for retirement on full pay.\n\n4. Officers who have availed themselves of the option of the old rules are allowed to reconsider the question under the modifications now sanctioned.\n\n5. Officers who have not taken leave subsequent to the publication of the new rules on the 1st February, 1854, and who, consequently, may not have been called upon to declare whether they would abide by the old or the new regulations, will, on retirement from the service, be entitled to take full advantage of the privileges given by the new regulations.\n\nFURLoughS ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n6. Every officer will be allowed a furlough to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of two years at the expiration of ten years' service, and for a second period of two years after twenty years' service in India.\n\n7. The second furlough of two years will only be granted after ten years' service in India, from the date of the return to duty after the first furlough of two years. These furloughs are not to be cumulative, under any circumstances, but are limited to two years. Officers who have taken leave of absence on sick certificate to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, will be ineligible to a furlough on private affairs until they have served six years from their last return to duty. This rule does not apply to short leaves to sea.\n\nOfficers who take their first furlough after twenty years' service in India, may take their second furlough after an additional service of five years from the date of their first return to duty. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n8. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and to the regulations framed for and preservation of the efficiency of each regiment by limiting the number of absentees.\n\n9. Officers holding staff or other detached appointments, may be allowed furlough for a period of six months without losing their appointments; but, during that period, they will not be entitled to any portion of their staff salary, which will be drawn in full by the officers officiating for them.\n\nAbsence for six months under this rule does not preclude an officer from taking his furlough to Europe after ten years' service. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n10. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on furlough on private affairs, will be entitled to \"Furlough Pay\" only.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE ON SICK CERTIFICATE.\n\n11. Leave of absence on sick certificate will be granted for a term not exceeding eighteen months, whether it be to any place in Europe, or elsewhere out of India.\n\n12. Extension of such leave may be granted, as at present, on production of medical certificates, for further periods not exceeding eighteen months in the whole.\n\n13. An officer holding a staff or other detached appointment, will be allowed to be absent on sick certificate in England, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of twenty months, without losing his appointment; and, during the first six months only of such absence, he will be entitled to draw half the staff salary of his appointment, the officer officiating for him drawing the remaining half salary during the first six months, and the whole salary during the remainder of the time.\n\n14. An officer's claim to half staff salary for six months, as sanctioned in the preceding rule, will not be affected by his subsequently retiring from the service in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n15. No portion of command allowance, medical staff salary, or other similar allowance, which under the old rules was inadmissible to officers absent from their corps or stations, at the Cape or elsewhere, will be allowed to absent officers under these regulations.\n\n16. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on leave of absence on sick certificate, will be entitled for a period of six months to the same rate of Indian pay and allowances as was allowed under the old regulations, to officers proceeding to the Cape on medical certificate, and for the remaining period of their leave they will receive furlough pay only.\n\n17. If the leave on sick certificate be extended, furlough pay will be continued; but under no circumstances for a longer period than three years altogether, from the commencement of the absence.\n\nSTAFF OFFICERS.\n\n18. The term, \"staff officers,\" applies to all officers holding staff or detached appointments, military (general or regimental), political, or civil; also to general officers commanding divisions, members of the Medical Board, superintending surgeons, and others who, under the old rules, were entitled to draw half staff allowance when absent at the Cape.\n\n19. Staff officers absent on leave beyond the periods stated in Rules 9 and 13 respectively, cannot retain their appointments and allowances except on special grounds to be sanctioned by the Government of the presidency. Any such special grant of leave is to be reported at once, with the reasons for it, and to be subject to approval.\n\n20. The privilege of retaining staff appointments during leave of absence on sick certificate, or on furlough on private affairs will not be available a second time, if the fresh leave is on sick certificate, until an officer has been three years away on private affairs; until he has been six years in the discharge of his duties of his appointment, from the date of last return to it.\n\n21. This rule, however, does not apply to leaves of absence, whether on sick certificate or on private affairs, in India, or for brief periods to Ceylon, the Mauritius, or other places out of India.\n\n22. Officers commanding troops of Horse Artillery and Light Field Batteries, and officers generally in employment, will be allowed leave out of India under the same rules with respect to allowance and tenure of command or office, as regulated the grant of leave to the Cape to such officers under the old regulations, except as to the duration of those advantages, the time for their continuance being subject to the provisions of the new regulations.\n\nDATE OF FURLough AND ADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n23. The period of furlough on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, is to be calculated from the date of the departure from India of the ship in which the officer proceeds.\n\n24. Advances of pay and allowances, staff and regimental, to officers proceeding on leave of absence on sick certificate, who may be entitled to them, will be made in India for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England at the rates of exchange fixed annually for repayment of advances made on account of Her Majesty's Government. Furlough pay will continue to be issued in advance for six months when required by officers obtaining furlough on private affairs.\n\n25. The existing regulations regarding passage-money to officers are not affected by these rules.\n\n26. The certificates issued to officers who are granted furloughs on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, are to specify the time each officer has been absent on leave within Indian limits, as well as the time of his previous absence in Europe; but will not include the periods allowed for proceeding to the presidency or port of embarkation, and to enable officers to rejoin their regiments or stations after their return to India, nor the leave of one month's absence in six months, as authorized by the regulations. The last pay certificate of all officers proceeding to England on sick certificate is to specify the rate of regimental pay and allowances and staff salary to which they would have been entitled under the old regulations if proceeding to sea on medical certificate. This information is necessary in order that no difficulty may arise in the Pay Department of the India Office in adjusting the several payments which may be due.\n\nOFFICERS OF H.M.'S SERVICE.\n\n27. Officers of Her Majesty's service in India, whether employed regimentally or in staff or detached situations, are entitled to the advantages above laid down in respect to allowances and tenure of office when on furlough or leave of absence.\n\n28. In the case of officers of Her Majesty's service on furlough or sick certificate, in England or elsewhere, who may retire or exchange into regiments not on the Indian establishment, the grant to these officers of Indian allowances will cease from the date of their retirement or exchange, if it takes place before the expiration of six months from the date of quitting India.\nPERIODS OF ABSENCE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AS SERVICE FOR RETIRING PENSIONS.\n\n29. In order that all officers quitting India on furlough or sick certificate may be placed on an exact equality as regards loss of time, the period allowed by regulation for proceeding to the presidency, or to the nearest port of embarkation, as well as the time to enable officers to rejoin their corps or station after their return to India, will be considered as time counting for service for the retiring pension.\n\n30. No furlough or leave of absence, as announced in General Orders, exceeding two years in twenty years' aggregate service, three years in twenty-five years' service, and four years in thirty years' service, shall be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension; and no difference will be made in this respect between leave of absence taken in Europe or elsewhere, in or out of India, or whether the leave be on sick certificate or on private affairs.\n\n31. In the term \"Leave of Absence as announced in General Orders,\" is to be included all leave of absence, except the period allowed in Rule 29, and the ordinary indulgence of one month's leave in six months, as authorized by the existing regulations, and which are, in all cases, whether of regimental or staff officers, to be allowed to count as service for the pension. All leave to a greater extent, granted by political and other authorities, which may not hitherto have been published in General Orders, must be so announced hereafter.\n\n32. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of their regimental rank (under the regulations of 1796), must have served twenty-two years in India, out of which leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension.\n\n33. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of captains and majors (under the regulations of 1835-37) must have served twenty and twenty-four years respectively; out of which time leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more will be allowed to count as service.\n\n34. Officers to be entitled to retire as lieutenant-colonels must have served twenty-eight years; out of which leaves of absence for three years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n35. Officers to be entitled to retire as colonels must have served thirty-two years; out of which leaves of absence for four years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n36. The scale for medical officers and veterinary surgeons of privileged furlough and leave of absence as counting for the retiring pension, will be as follows:\n\n| Years, Months |\n|--------------|\n| 1            | 8          |\n| 2            | 0          |\n| 3            | 0          |\n| 4            | 0          |\n| 5            | 0          |\n| 6            | 0          |\n\nin 17 & under 20 years' service\n\n|                |\n|----------------|\n| 20             |\n| 25             |\n| 30             |\n| 35             |\n| 38             |\n| 33 years' service |\n\n37. It is to be distinctly understood, that under no circumstances whatever will an officer be permitted to retire on full pay until he has completed the full time of service above specified, whether he be in England at the close of his service or elsewhere.\n\n38. The privileged time of absence may, with the permission of the local government, be taken at any time, subject to these regulations. If, therefore, at the end of twenty years' service, of which eighteen had been passed on actual duty in India, an officer should be on furlough or sick certificate in Europe or elsewhere, he will be entitled to retire on the full pay of a captain without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pensions. In like manner, a medical officer on furlough or sick certificate, in Europe or elsewhere, at the end of seventeen years' service, fifteen years and four months of which have been passed on actual duty in India, will be entitled to retire on the lowest rate pension, without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pension.\n\n39. These rules do not in any way affect the existing regulations regarding the grant of leave in India, or for short periods to sea, whether on private affairs or on sick certificate, except as to the periods of such absence being taken into calculation in the time allowed to count as service for retirement on full pay.\n\nINDIAN MILITARY FURLOUGH RULES OF 1868.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\nThe following General Order by the Government of India, dated 25th February, 1874, No. 171, is republished:\n\n\"No. 171 of 1874.\u2014The Furlough Rules of 1868, as revised by various subsequent decisions, are republished for general information; and in future this General Order shall ordinarily be referred to in any matter depending on those rules. The rules previously in force will be designated, as heretofore, the Furlough Rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nThe following G. G. O. are cancelled prospectively from the 1st January, 1875:\n\nG. G. O. No. 630 of 1869 (1st clause).\nG. G. O. No. 627 of 1870.\nG. G. O. No. 613 of 1871.\n\n2. These rules are applicable to all officers who, on the 1st July, 1868, belonged to the several Indian Staff Corps, or to the Indian Army, and who have elected, or may elect, to adopt them: officers of the British Army who entered the Staff Corps after that date are of course subject to them.\n\nRules apply to Officers of Staff Corps and Indian Army.\n\nIn regard to the periods of leave of absence\n\nAlso to Officers of R. A. and R. E., late of Indian Army, when holding permanent non-regimental appointments.\n\nBut should an officer of the British Service be on leave under circumstances which, by these rules, would involve loss of appointment, he cannot take leave under them, but simply as a British Officer holding no appointment.\n\n3. These rules are not applicable to officers on the Invalid or Invalid Pension Establishment, even if previous to their transfer they should have elected them, being intended solely for officers on the effective list.\n\nDo not apply to Invalid Officers.\n\n4. They are not applicable to Regimental Officers of the British Service, even though formerly of Indian Army. Only partially to Officers of the British Service holding 5-year appointments.\n\nOfficers generally of the British Service, whether formerly belonging to the Indian Army, and now in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and new Line Regiments, or on the old Line Establishment: nor are they applicable to officers of the British Army holding staff appointments the tenure of which is limited to five years, except in the sense in which the rules of 1854 were made applicable, viz., as regulating the amount of absentee allowance to be granted to such officers holding staff appointments, when they are absent on furlough on medical certificate,\nDo not apply to Officers of the British Medical Staff.\n\n5. They are applicable to Officers of the Royal Engineers on the Imperial list, holding permanent non-regimental staff appointments.\n\nThese officers, therefore, and other Royal Engineer Officers of the Imperial list on permanent staff employ under the Government, will be entitled to a furlough of two years after eight years' service in India, or at the expiration of one year from the date of their return (for a second tour of service in India) on the completion of the prescribed home service after the first period of seven years' service in India.\n\nPay allowed them during furlough.\n\nRoyal Engineer Officers on the Imperial Establishment\n\nRules apply to R. E. Officers of the Imperial list on the fixed staff establishments of Sappers and Miners.\n\n6. Officers of British Regiments who may join the Staff Corps, can count as service towards furlough all their military service in India, provided that half of it (in no case less than four years) shall have been passed in the Staff Corps. But any leave to England they may have taken during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough already taken. Officers of the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n\n7. These rules apply also to all Warrant Officers holding Veteran or Honorary Commissions, who may elect them; the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of a Commission. They will receive during furlough half their total receipts, calculated as laid down in Rule V., but without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate. Warrant Officers not holding Commissions can obtain furlough under these rules only on medical certificate.\n\nSuch furlough may be for two years with retention of appointment and half of the aggregate allowances; but any extension of such leave (which will not be granted for more than one year in excess of the two years) or any leave taken within less than three years from the date of last return to duty, will be on \"English furlough pay.\" [See Note to para. 9.]\n\n8. Every Warrant Officer who attained warrant rank before the 19th February, 1869, and who has not made his election, will be required, on the first occasion of his applying for leave out of India, to state whether he desires to take the leave under these rules, or under those previously in force applicable to Warrant Officers, viz., G. G. O. Nos. 518 and 531 of 1854, G. G. O. No. 1559 of 1857, and subsequent orders. That election will be considered final.\n\nThose who became Warrant Officers after 19th February, 1869, are subject to these rules, and cannot elect any of the previous rules.\n\nLeave on medical certificate on Indian pay and allowances to places eastward of the Cape, as allowed to Commissioned Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1796 is not in any case admissible to a Warrant Officer.\n\nRules apply to Medical as to other Warrant Officers.\n\n9. The term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and twofold signification, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits, specified in paragraph 5 of these rules, converted at the rate of exchange fixed by the Secretary of State for the official year, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English pay under the rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nNote.\u2014Where in these Rules English furlough pay is mentioned as that to which an officer is to be restricted, the rates laid down in paragraph 11 of G. G. O. No. 69, dated 22nd January, 1868, and (for Medical Warrant Officers) paragraph 22 of G. G. O. No. 550 of 1868, are to be understood as intended in the cases of Warrant Officers.\n\nRULES.\n\nI.\u2014The distinction with respect to allowances which has been hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave, is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtaining of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\nII.* Officers can retain their appointments during all leave of absence granted by competent authority. But their pay during such absence will be the same as they would obtain under these rules had this exemption from forfeiture of appointment not been granted.\n\n* As altered by G. G. O. No. 1174 of 1875.\nIII.\u2014The Rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII. of George III., Chapter 52, Section 70;* but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the rules now prescribed. Nor do they affect the regulations by which General Officers Commanding Divisions and Brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their Commands.\n\nIV.\u2014Leave of absence will in future be of three kinds, viz.:\n\nI.\u2014Furlough in or out of India.\nII.\u2014General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, or short leave to sea.\nIII.\u2014Privilege leave.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFurlough.\n\nV.\u2014An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on furlough, will be allowed pay at Furlough pay, how reckoned. the rate of 50 per cent. of the salary of his substantive office. But an officer in civil employ and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary during the three years prior to his proceeding on furlough, or during his actual service in India should that be less than three years; and the time spent and the allowances drawn during any leave \"other than privilege leave,\" will be omitted in the calculation of average salary.\n\nNo absentee shall in either case draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nThe term \"salary\" will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay, or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances. But in the case of a military officer in civil employ, his acting allowances shall be taken into account as a part of his salary in calculating his furlough pay.\n\n\u00a7 2. An officer absent on furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his furlough, to furlough pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, whatever the salary of the office to which he may be transferred may be. This furlough pay will be continued to an officer in military employ after his return to India and until he joins his appointment, provided it is not less than the military pay, or pay and allowances, of his rank.\n\nBut an officer whose term of office shall lapse, who shall vacate his appointment, or whose appointment shall be abolished during his furlough, will revert at once to the furlough pay which he would draw in virtue of his rank, as laid down below, in \u00a7 4. Any case of sudden abolition of appointment may, however, be specially considered in the department of the Government under which the officer may have been employed. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher Staff Corps or regimental rank, whilst on furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers holding regimental medical charges will be allowed to retain such charges during the authorized periods of furlough, as if they were medical staff appointments. And the difference between the unemployed* grade pay of the officer holding the substantive charge and the consolidated salary of the charge will be considered the staff salary divisible between the absentee and the officer officiating for him.\n\nG. G. O. No. 1060 of 23rd Dec. 1864, para. 29.\n\nG. G. O. No. 370 of 4th April, 1867, para. 9.\n\nThe staff salary how divided.\n\n\u00a7 4. Officers not in staff employ will receive half the Indian pay of their rank, provided that an officer entitled to furlough shall in no case receive less than the above minimum of \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nMinimum furlough pay.\n\nNote.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the Military Fund during absence in Europe, will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\nVI.\u2014All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service,\u2014of which exigency the Government is to be exclusively the judge,\u2014and to any regulations that may be found necessary for limiting the number of absentees.\n\nNote.\u2014It is therefore within the competency of local Governments and of the Commander-in-Chief to decline to forward the application of any officer whose absence would, in their opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the public service, until such time as arrangements can be made for removing the difficulty; and it is the duty of every head of a department to\n\nApplications of officers who cannot be spared need not be forwarded.\n\n* The section referred to is quoted below:\u2014\n\nSection 70.\u2014\"And be it further enacted that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a Member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and who, having departed from India by leave of the Governor-General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or Native Corps of Troops or in the civil line of the Company's Service, unless in the case of any Civil Servant of the Company, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or, unless such person be permitted to return with his rank to India, by a vote or resolution passed by way of ballot by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days' previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any Military Officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\"\ndecline to forward any application for furlough, whenever the services of the officer cannot be spared without risking the efficiency of the department, any doubtful case being referred for the orders of Government.\n\nVII.\u2014The maximum amount of furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time, carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years: any extension of such furlough will be without pay unless it is on medical certificate, see Rule XIII. (But see Notes (3) and (4) Rule IX.) And no extension on private affairs beyond two years will be granted, though without pay, except upon satisfactory evidence of very urgent necessity.\n\nVIII.\u2014A period of at least three years' service after return from last furlough, except furlough for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months) must be completed before furlough can again be taken, unless obtained under medical certificate (see Rules XIII. and XIV. and Note 3 of Rule IX.).\n\nBut an officer who may be ordered to return to duty before the completion of his furlough for the purpose of proceeding on field service may be allowed to take the balance of such furlough at any time.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer in civil employ cannot reckon in this interval of three years any period of absence from actual duty, excepting those spent on privilege leave.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer will be eligible for two years' furlough on the completion of eight years' actual service in India (see para. 6 of this order); for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years, and so on, up to the maximum prescribed in Rule XVI. The grant of furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules VI. and VII. But see notes to this Rule.\n\n\u00a7 2.* Leave granted under these Rules, without furlough pay, will not reckon as furlough already taken in calculating the balance at an officer's credit, or as part of the total of eight years allowed as shown in Rule XVI, but all furlough with furlough pay, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, taken under these Rules, will so reckon.\n\n\u00a7 3.* Furlough and leave previously taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854 will count, as respects officers who have elected these Rules, as follows:\u2014\n\nHow far previous furlough bars furlough on private affairs.\n\nFurlough on private affairs, with pay, taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, counts in all respects as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, under the Rules of 1796, does not count in any respect as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, with pay, under the Rules of 1854, counts as part of the maximum of eight years allowed under these Rules, but until the maximum thus made up be reached, this leave will not count as furlough already taken in determining the amount of furlough to which an officer is entitled.\n\nLeave without pay under the Rules either of 1796 or 1854, does not count in any respects as furlough.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer appointed to any duty in England draws his Indian allowances, with or without any portion of his staff salary, he can count the period of such employment as service towards furlough; but if he is appointed to an office in England to which a fixed consolidated salary is attached, he cannot reckon the time of such employment as service towards furlough.\n\nNote (1).\u2014But an officer of less than eight years' service in India may obtain furlough not exceeding two years, on medical certificate, with furlough pay and retention of appointment, provided he has been three years in the Staff Corps, or\u2014in the case of a Royal Engineer officer holding a permanent staff appointment, or an officer not in the Staff Corps\u2014has served for three years in India.\n\nNote (2).\u2014If the officer has not been three years in the Staff Corps, or served three years in India, as the case may be, he will receive \"English furlough pay\" only, and must vacate his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nThis rule and the provisions in Note 1, however, are not applicable to officers of the Indian Army who entered the new Line Regiments, or Royal Artillery, and subsequently the Staff Corps.\n\nNote (3).\u2014Unemployed General Officers of the Staff Corps or local service can be granted furlough without serving the intervals of three and six years, respectively, prescribed in Rules VIII. and IX., and they can remain in Europe after they have exhausted the full period of furlough allowed during an officer's service by Rule XVI. (eight years on the whole) on the English furlough pay of their rank.\n\nNote (4).\u2014And a Major-General of the Staff Corps\u2014if he has so much furlough at his credit, and proceeds to England within a year of his being promoted to that rank, or of his ceasing to be employed\u2014can continue, after the expiration of the two years' furlough to receive half his Indian pay until he completes the period of three years during which he would be entitled to draw his Staff Corps pay if he were in India.\n\nX.\u2014An officer eligible for furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of furlough for which he may be eligible.\n\nIllustrations.\n\n1. An officer who has served nine years in India is entitled to two years' furlough: he takes only one year, and after his return remains in India for five years.\n\n| Total service in India | 14 years |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| Furlough due on that service | 3 years |\n| Furlough already taken | 1 year |\n| Balance for which he is eligible | 2 years |\n\n* As modified in G. G. O. No. 197 of 1st March, 1877\n2. An officer who has served 20 years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer is said to have furlough at his credit,\u2014even though he may not be able to obtain it owing to the number of absences, or other causes,\u2014when the calculation of his service, as in Illustration I above, shows a \"balance for which he is eligible.\"\n\n* XI.\u2014Furlough on urgent private affairs for six months on pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, may be granted when the officer has less than six months' furlough at his credit, or when from other causes, e.g., the number of absences, or his not having served three years since his last return to duty, he is not able to take it. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule IX., and also\u2014except in the case of an officer in civil employ, see Rule VIII. note\u2014of the three years which are required to intervene between two periods of furlough by Rule VIII.\n\nThis leave cannot be given in extension of furlough of any description. It cannot be extended beyond six months unless on medical certificate and on the same pay; in which case the officer will be deemed to have vacated his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.; the whole period will be reckoned in the maximum amount of furlough (8 years) allowed by Rule XVI., and no portion of it can form any part of the periods referred to in Rules VIII. and IX.\n\nNote.\u2014Ill-health is not considered as warranting furlough under this rule to any officer who under the provisions of these rules can obtain furlough on medical certificate without forfeiting his appointment.\n\nXII.\u2014Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during furlough. But, if he desires to spend in England the rest of a \"furlough in India,\" or vice versa, he must obtain permission to do so from the Government of his Presidency, or from the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be; and on landing in either country, he must report his arrival accordingly to the Military Department of his own Presidency, or to the India Office, forwarding a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination. He must also communicate his address. An officer who, on his return to India, reports his debarkation, without forwarding at once a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination, or submitting an application for such permission, will be considered to have returned to his duty.\n\nXIII.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate is obtainable as indicated in Notes (1) and (2) of Rule IX. and in Rule XIV. Absence on such furlough for a longer period than two years at one time will involve forfeiture of appointment. [But see exceptions in Rule II.] Furlough may, however, be extended on medical certificate up to a third year on an English furlough pay; and an officer on furlough on private affairs, who may be obliged to obtain an extension on medical certificate, will be thenceforward entitled to the same advantages, and subjected to the same disadvantages as to retention of appointment, pay, &c., as if he had originally obtained furlough on medical certificate.\n\nIf he exceeds three years' absence on medical certificate, the officer may have to retire or go on half-pay.\n\nExtension on medical certificate over three years to be without pay.\n\nOfficers on medical certificate must be pronounced fit for duty before returning to India.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer whose health may necessitate his taking furlough within three years from the date of last return from any furlough except that taken for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer on civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months), may obtain under the usual medical certificate, such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health; but he will receive only \"English furlough pay,\" and must vacate any appointment he may be holding, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\n\u00a7 2. If, however, he shall have served three years since the date of his last return to duty, although there may be no balance of furlough at his credit, he will be entitled, on obtaining furlough on medical certificate, to retain his appointment and to receive \"furlough pay,\" as laid down in Rule V., for the entire period not exceeding two years. Should the latter period be exceeded, he will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer entitled to furlough, or having a balance of furlough at his credit, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, must take the leave as furlough under Rule IX., but without forfeiting any passage-money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules,\u2014or, if a Subaltern, by Regulation, when proceeding on medical certificate.\n\n\u00a7 2. Should the officer be declared fit for duty before the expiration of two years, he may be granted extension on private affairs up to that limit, provided that he has so much at his credit, and that if he remains he will not be in excess of the established proportion of absentees. Any extension on private affairs of such furlough beyond the said period of two years, must be without pay.\n\n* As modified in G. G. O. No. 922, of 31 Aug., 1876.\n\u00a7 3. Any extension on medical certificate of furlough under \u00a7 1 of this rule beyond two years or any lesser period which may be at his credit under Rules IX. and X. will be regarded, in all respects, as furlough on medical certificate (Rule XIII.); and if the period of two years should not exhaust the balance of furlough at his credit under Rule X., the period or such balance till the latter is exhausted. On the aggregate of two years' leave being exceeded, the officer will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nTotal furlough with pay, &c., in an officer's service limited to eight years.\n\nFurlough not reckoned in this period.\n\n\u00a7 1.\u2014Leave without pay.\n\u00a7 2.\u2014Sick leave to Europe, or to the Colonies eastward of Cape under the Rules of 1796.\n\u00a7 3.\u2014Leave taken under Rule XI. of these Rules, provided it be not extended over the six months. If it be so extended, the whole period will reckon as part of the eight years.\n\u00a7 4.\u2014Leave necessitated by wounds or sickness contracted on active service, and any other leave which may be allowed by proper authority to reckon as service for pension.\n\u00a7 5.\u2014In the case of an unemployed officer, periods of residence in England on English pay after promotion to the rank of Major General, or to the rank of Regimental Colonel in the Royal (late Indian) Artillery and Engineers, or after completion of tour of service as Inspector General or Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, when the officer is no longer required to reside in India.\n\nAll other leave to Europe, or out of India for periods exceeding three months (see Rule XXVII.), including furlough on medical certificate under the Furlough Rules of 1854, will form part of the period of eight years.\n\nXVII.\u2014If taken in India, furlough will be reckoned from the date of the absentee's quitting his station to the date of his return thereto; if taken out of India, from the date of the sailing of the vessel in which he may have embarked, to the date of his bond fide disembarkation in India for the purpose of rejoining his appointment or Regiment: the date of embarkation (or of the vessel's leaving the Sandheads if from Calcutta) and that of disembarkation also, are included in the furlough.\n\nNote (1).\u2014As an illustration of this rule, it may be observed that a Madras officer's landing and reporting himself at Madras, en route to Calcutta to join his appointment in Bengal or the North-Western Provinces, &c., is not disembarkation in the sense intended by this rule.\n\nNote (2).\u2014To enable an officer who overstays his leave to obtain an extension, he should show that he took all needful precautions to insure his arrival in proper time, and if delayed by the departure of the vessel being deferred, he should obtain the certificate of the owner or agent that she had been bond fide advertised to sail from \u2014\u2014\u2014 on the \u2014\u2014\u2014 but that her departure had been delayed till the \u2014\u2014\u2014.\n\nSee General Order No. 52, dated 21st February, 1873.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Preparatory leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere will be granted for any period deemed necessary, not ordinarily exceeding 30 days. Leave up to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date succeeding that of his disembarkation in India.\n\nThis applies equally to furloughs taken under Rule XI. The authority which has power to grant preparatory leave can, on due cause being shown, grant any necessary extension of it, but this can be done only on very sufficient reasons.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer obtaining a furlough on private affairs or medical certificate must embark within three months of the date of the General Order which notifies it, or take up the first portion of his furlough in India until he embarks; if not, the General Order will cease to have effect. The only exception to this rule that can be allowed is when the officer is prevented from embarking within the three months owing to his detention in India by proper authority on bond fide public grounds.\n\nIf, however, the officer does not, within a reasonable time, avail himself of the furlough given him, his subsequently being placed on duty rendering his detention necessary will not exempt him from the rule; and in every case of such detention the officer must at once report it, and he is not to embark after the expiration of three months until he has applied for and obtained from the Government of his Presidency an extension of the period.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Officers who may be serving in other Presidencies than their own, if they desire to embark bond fide for Europe from the latter, may obtain preparatory leave accordingly, and their furlough will reckon from the date of their embarkation at their own Presidencies.\n\nNote (3).\u2014For full information as to the submission of applications for furlough, see G. G. O. No. 34, of 11th January 1869; G. G. O. No. 108, dated 26th January 1869; General Order by the Commander-in-Chief, No. 135, dated II June 1870.*\n\nNote (4).\u2014The allowances of Military officers in civil employ during preparatory leave, and after return to India until they rejoin their appointments, will be adjusted according to Civil Rules.\n\nNote (5).\u2014Leave preparatory to retirement from the service does not reckon as service towards pension.\n\nXIX.\u2014Furlough allowances are payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\n* See also Bombay G. O. C. 269 of 1873\nXX.\u2014Advances of furlough pay will continue to be made in India to those officers who desire it for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of six months from that date. No advance is made in England to officers on their returning to duty.\n\nAdvances of furlough pay given in India only.\n\nXXI.\u2014The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule V.\n\nPay of officers acting for those on furlough.\n\nXXII.*\u2014An Officer acting in India for an absence on furlough will be restricted, for the entire period that he may so act, to the half staff salary of the appointment in which he may be acting, in addition to the full pay of his rank, and the half staff salary of his own appointment, if he possess one. The aggregate staff salary granted to an acting officer in such cases will not be less than Rs. 100 per mensem, unless the full staff salary of the post in which he is officiating is less than that sum.\n\nPay of Warrant Officers acting for others on furlough.\n\n\u2020 Note.\u2014The indulgence granted by section 1 of this rule is only allowed to one directly officiating in the place of the officer absent on furlough, not to one acting in the room of an officer who is himself acting for an absentee on furlough.\n\nPeriods of furlough, &c., counting as service towards pension.\n\n| Years | Years |\n|-------|-------|\n| 2     | 20    |\n| 3     | 25    |\n| 4     | 30    |\n| 5     | 35    |\n| 6     | 38    |\n\nPeriods of furlough reckoned by Warrant Officers towards pension.\n\n| Years | Months |\n|-------|--------|\n| 9     | 14     |\n| 14    | 16     |\n\nThose who were promoted to warrant rank before that date, are allowed to continue if they prefer it, on the old rule, and reckon all leave in India as service, all out of India being deducted from their service, for pension.\n\nIllustration of the mode of computing service for pension in any case.\n\nTotal service from date of arrival in India, say ........................................... 30 years.\n\nLeave\u2014\n\nIn Europe, say .................................................................................................. 6\n\nIn India.............................................................................................................. 7\n\nOf which he can reckon......................................................................................... 3\n\nRemaining to be deducted....................................................................................... 5\n\nService counting for Pension.................................................................................... 10\n\nXXIII.\u2014On computing the furlough on private affairs to which an officer who has already enjoyed some portion of such furlough will be entitled, under these rules, it will be necessary to deduct the total amount of the furlough on private affairs of which he may have availed himself during his service from the total periods to which under Rule IX. he can lay claim. The balance within the limit of eight years' total furlough on private affairs and medical certificate laid down in Rule XVI., will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty.\n\nIllustration.\n\n(1).\u2014An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns India on the date on which this order is promulgated.

No. 585 of 1874.\n\u2021 Medical Officers also count 1 year and 8 months in 17 years' service (G.G.O. 305 of 1874).\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGeneral Leave on Private Affairs and Sick Certificate in India.\n\nXXV.\u2014An officer will be eligible, as at present, to take leave on private affairs or sick certificate anywhere in India for any period not exceeding six months, at the discretion of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief or of the Government under which he may be serving. During the entire period of his absence on this account the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively the officer will lose his staff appointment unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a Medical Board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in his entire period of service, but will not be regarded as furlough, nor will it affect the intervals entitling to furlough laid down in Rule IX. During this leave the absentee will draw a moiety of his staff salary in addition to the pay of his rank. But if the 12 months be exceeded, the whole leave must be reckoned as furlough, and allowances be adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Short leave, not exceeding three months, on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be taken to sea, on the above condition, but absence from India for any longer period will be treated as furlough.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014All general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXXIX.\u2014Privilege leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General leave, in extension of privilege leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\nXXX.\u2014In the case of the stations noted in the margin, privilege leave may, as at present, be granted for ninety days to officers of local Corps, or of Corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\nAssam. Khairuvara. Dera Ghazee Khan.\nShillong. Khotra. Rajapore.\nErinpoora. Bunnoo. Jacobabad.\nDeoee. Dera Ismael Khan.\n\nNo restriction as to place.\n\nXXXI.\u2014An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on privilege leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\nXXXII.\u2014Privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on privilege leave, the privilege leave will be converted into general leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMilitary Officers in Civil Employ.\n\nXXXIII.\u2014Those Military Officers (including Warrant Officers who hold Honorary, Veteran, or Unattached Commissions) in Civil or Political employ who may elect these rules when they take leave in India, come, as respect periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted, under the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules.\n\nFor preparatory or subsidiary leave, see Note (4) of Rule XVIII.\n\nSubsidiary Rule.\n\nXXXIV.\u2014Officers of the Indian Military and Medical services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made.\n\n\u00a7 2. Officers going home under these Rules will pay English rates of subscription only to the Military Fund.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers who may determine to abide by existing Rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII., VIII., and XIII., to the extent to which they may be entitled under the Furlough Regulations of 1854 or 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV. must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer under the Furlough Rules of 1796 elects the present Rules, his service for pension will...\nPrevious service of officers under 1796 Rules how reckoned.\n\nleave out of Indian limits taken previous to 1st July, 1868, will be wholly excluded from his service for pension; but he may reckon towards pension periods of leave taken subsequent to that date, according to the length of his service counting for pension, as shown in Rule XXIII.\n\nRetirement under 1796 Rules not affected.\n\nHis election of these Furlough Rules in no way affects his right to retire under the Pension Rules of 1796.\n\nFURLOUGH AND LEAVE RULES.\n\n30th December, 1875.\n\nNo. 1,316 of 1875.\u2014Under Instructions from Her Majesty's Government, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to publish the following revised Furlough and Leave Rules applicable to the Staff Corps and Indian Local and Medical Services.\n\n1. Officers included in Schedule A may receive, after five years' service in India or under the Government of India, one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these rules, be taken later.\n\n2. An Officer may receive at any time any portion of the furlough to which he is entitled; but, except under Rule 8, he may not be absent from duty on any ground for more than three years consecutively; nor, on return from furlough, may he receive, except under Rule 6, any further portion of the furlough to which he is entitled until after the interval of two years.\n\n3. It must be distinctly understood that furlough is subject to the exigencies of the public service. Officers commanding regiments, and Heads of Departments, will forward no application for furlough unless able to satisfy the superior authorities that their services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\n4. Furlough does not involve forfeiture of appointment, may be spent anywhere, and counts as service for pension.\n\n5. A commissioned Officer on furlough receives (up to, but not beyond, the sum of \u00a31,000 a year) half the emoluments of his office, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State; but in any case he does not receive less than \u00a3250 a year. The emoluments of his office include all pay, staff corps pay, staff salary, and Indian allowances he would receive in respect to it if he were on duty, and for the purpose of each payment his office is the office he fills on the day when that payment becomes due. A Warrant Officer receives half the emoluments of his office, calculated in the same manner as those of Commissioned Officers, no Warrant Officer, however, receiving as furlough pay less than the English furlough pay of his rank.\n\n6. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years; but such furlough will be deducted from his next accruing furlough until it is paid off. An Officer will not be allowed to anticipate furlough under this rule to an aggregate amount of more than two years.\n\n\u2020 An Officer of less than two years' service from date of coming under the new rules, falling sick, will be sent to England on medical certificate, on English furlough pay, subject to the decision of her Majesty's Government as to his ultimate disposal; a special report on each case being submitted to her Majesty's Government by the Government of India, or in the case of Officers of the Madras or Bombay army by the Government of those presidencies.\n\n\u2020 Furlough on medical certificate under this rule does not count as service for pension until it has been paid off as provided for in the rule.\n\n7. An Officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be placed temporarily or permanently on half-pay, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\n8. Under very urgent circumstances special furlough may be granted for private affairs, which need not be paid back; but it will be in all cases without any kind of pay, and will not count for pension.\n\n\u2020 The amount of leave which may be granted under this rule will be restricted to such period as the Government granting it is satisfied is actually necessary with reference to the urgency of the case.\n\n9. Advances for passage money, on need shown, will be granted to Officers on furlough, to be recovered in manner specified at the time of the grant; in India, at the discretion of the Local Government; and in England, at the discretion of the Secretary of State.\n\n10. Leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, and may not, except for very urgent reasons, be specially reported to the Government of India, be renewed till after six months have elapsed from its expiration. It must be spent at some place east of the 40th degree of east longitude. Subject to these conditions, it may be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the local authorities, who in granting it shall fix its duration, and may fix the limits within which it shall be spent, and whether during its continuance half-pay and allowances are to be deducted for the payment of a substitute; and they may grant it as preparatory to furlough, or for the purpose of a medical examination. Leave counts as service for pension and furlough. The local authorities shall be defined for the purpose of this rule by the Government of India.\n\n11. Leave and furlough are reckoned from and to the close of the days named in the order granting them.\n\n12. The position of Officers not included in Schedule A will be unchanged as respects leave or furlough.\n\n13. Officers now in the service placing themselves, from a given date, under these rules, shall count service for pension up to that date under the rules to which they were then subject.\n\n\u2020 An officer takes with him so much service for pension as he had become entitled to under former rules. Under the rules of 1854 and 1868, two years' leave in twenty years' service counts for pension, but in periods of less than twenty years no leave counts. Therefore, if an officer now under the rules of 1854 or 1868, of twenty years' service, with two years' leave, elects the present rules, his service for pension will be twenty years'; if an officer of nineteen years' service, with the same amount of leave, elects these rules, his service for pension will be seventeen years only.\n\n* As modified by G.G.O.

No. 489 of 25 May, 1877.\nSCHEDULE A.\n\nOfficers entering the Staff Corps or Indian Medical Service, and Warrant Officers attaining that rank, after the 31st December, 1875; and\u2014\n\nAny other officers, Commissioned or Warrant, belonging to the Indian Army or Medical Service, or Officers of the Staff Corps, who, after the 31st of December, 1875, shall, before asking for leave or furlough, apply in writing to their Local Governments to be placed definitely upon this Schedule; but their service for furlough under Rule I shall commence from the date of such entry or such application respectively.\n\n\u2020 The date of entry into the Staff Corps is that of entry for choice of furlough rules, viz., the date on which the Officer was originally appointed on probation. An Officer, therefore, whose date of admission to the Staff Corps is not after the 31st December, 1875, will have the choice of rules, but an Officer whose date of admission is after that date will have no option.\n\n\u2020 An Officer coming on this schedule, having furlough to his credit under previous rules, forfeits such furlough absolutely, he being required to serve five years from date of applying to be placed on the schedule before he can take one year's furlough, unless it be sick furlough under Rule 6. An Officer similarly circumstanced, but having furlough to his debit, is equally with the others entitled to take one year's furlough five years after joining the new rules.\n\nAny Officers in civil employment declared by the Government of India to be under civil leave rules shall not be under these rules.\n\n** The last pay certificate issued to an Officer to whom furlough or leave has been granted shall state the pay to which, under Rule 5, he is at that date entitled in respect to the office he is holding, noticing the date, if any fixed, at which he will vacate it.\n\nWith advertence to the foregoing rules, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify\u2014\n\nI. That no \"extra or special allowances\" drawn by an officer, which are now excluded from the account in calculating furlough pay under the Rules of 1868, can be reckoned in calculating furlough pay under these Rules (Rule 5).\n\nII. That the Governments of the three Presidencies, or their Excellencies the Commanders-in-Chief, in regard to Officers serving directly under them, shall be held to be the \"local authorities\" named in Rule 10.\n\nIII. That, pending further orders, a Staff Officer granted leave under Rule 10 shall receive, as heretofore, the pay or staff corps pay of his rank, and half the staff salary of his appointment during such leave; but full staff salary may be allowed him for the first two months (as now during privilege leave) when he makes approved arrangements for the performance of his duties during that period. In such cases the Government Officer granting the leave must state that the first two months are to be on full staff pay.\n\nN.B.\u2014It is distinctly to be understood that the rule regarding the pay to be drawn on leave under para. 10 is liable to be modified at any time in any way that the Government of India may deem expedient.\n\nIV. Pending further orders these rules are not applicable to any Officer in civil employ.\n\n7th December, 1877.\n\nNo. 1102 of 1877.\u2014His Excellency the Governor General in Council is pleased to notify the following supplementary regulations, which have received the approval of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India, providing for the case of Military Officers in Civil employ, referred to in paragraph IV. of the subsidiary rules appended to G.G.O. No. 1316 of the 30th December, 1875:\n\nI. Any Officer now in Civil employ, who is subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1854 or 1868, shall remain so subject.\n\nII. Any Military Officer who may hereafter enter Civil employ, who is not already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall remain subject to the rules applicable to him when he enters Civil employ.\n\nNote.\u2014Any Officer referred to in Rules I. and II. cannot elect the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, so long as he continues in Civil employ.\n\nIII. Any Officer who may enter Civil employ, who is already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall be subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code applicable to covenanted civil servants, both as regards furlough and leave taken out of India and in India.\n\nIV. If any Officer, who is employed in the civil administration, has taken furlough in the Military Department under the said rules of 1875, this furlough shall be treated, in calculating the furlough or special leave admissible to him under the preceding rule, as if it had been furlough taken under the Civil Leave Code. Leave so taken under the 10th Military Rule shall be treated as if it had been privilege leave taken under the Civil Leave Code, and the claims of the Officer under the Civil Leave Code adjusted accordingly.\n\nV. If an Officer, who has been subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code under the third of these rules, is again employed in the Military Department, and so again becomes subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, any furlough or special leave taken by him under the Civil Leave Code will be treated in calculating the furlough admissible to him under the said military rules, as if it had been furlough taken under the said military rules. Privilege leave taken under the Civil Leave Code Rules will be treated as if it had been leave taken under the 10th Military Rule. Subsidiary or examination leave taken under the Civil Leave Code will not affect the claims of such an Officer under the Military Furlough and Leave Rules.\n\nADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n22nd February, 1878.\n\nNo. 175 of 1878.\n\nUnder instructions from Her Majesty's Government, the Right Hon. the Governor General in Council is pleased to publish the following rules regarding advances of pay to Officers under the furlough rules of 1868 and 1875.\n\nOfficers proceeding on furlough to Europe may, if they desire it, receive an advance equivalent to three months' furlough pay.\n\nOfficers returning from furlough will similarly be granted advances of pay at the following rates, on obtaining permission to return:\n\nFor a Subaltern ... ... \u00a365\nFor a Captain ... ... \u00a3100\nFor a Field Officer ... ... \u00a3150\n\nRecovery of the advances made in England to be effected in India by five equal monthly instalments at the rate of exchange fixed for the year.\n\n\u2020 Rulings contained in G.G.O.
