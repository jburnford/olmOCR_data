On April 9th, 1878, and following days, an examination of Candidates will be held in London. At this examination not fewer than Candidates will be selected, if so many shall be found duly qualified. Of these, will be selected for the Presidency of Bengal (for the Upper Provinces, and for that of Madras, and for that of Bombay). Notice will hereafter be given of the days and place of examination.\n\n2. Any person desirous of competing at this Examination must produce to the Civil Service Commissioners, before the 1st of February, 1878, evidence showing:\n\n(a) That he is a natural born subject of Her Majesty;\n(b) That his age on the 1st March, 1878, will be above seventeen years and under twenty-one years.\nN.B.\u2014In the case of Natives of India this must be certified by the Government of India, or of the Presidency or Province in which the Candidate may have resided;\n(c) That he has no disease, constitutional affection, or bodily infirmity, unfitting him, or likely to unfit him, for the Civil Service of India; \u2020\n(d) That he is of good moral character; he must also pay such fee as the Secretary of State for India may prescribe.\u00a7\n\n3. Should the evidence upon the above points be prima facie satisfactory to the Civil Service Commissioners, the Candidate will, upon payment of the prescribed fee, be admitted to the Examination. The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary; and if the result of such inquiries, in the case of any Candidate should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India, and if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4. The Examination will take place only in the following branches of knowledge:\n\n| Branches of Knowledge                                      | Marks |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| English Composition                                        | 500   |\n| History of England\u2014including that of the Laws and Constitution | 500   |\n| English Language and Literature                            | 500   |\n| Language, Literature, and History of Greece                | 750   |\n| Language, Literature and History of Rome                   | 750   |\n| Ditto France                                               | 375   |\n\n* The Regulations are applicable to this Examination only.\n\n\u2020 The number of appointments to be made, and the number in each Presidency, &c., will be announced hereafter. It will probably be about half the usual number.\n\n\u2021 Evidence of health and character must bear date not earlier than the 1st January, 1877.\n\n\u00a7 The fee for this examination will be \u00a35, payable by means of a special stamp according to instructions which will be communicated to Candidates.\n\nCandidates are at liberty to name, before Feb. 1, 1878, any or all of these branches of knowledge. No subjects are obligatory.\n\n5. The merit of the persons examined will be estimated by marks, and the number set opposite to each branch in the preceding regulation denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it.\n\n6. No Candidate will be allowed any marks in respect of any subject of examination, unless he shall be considered to possess a competent knowledge of that subject.*\n\n7. The Examination will be conducted by means of printed questions and written answers, and by viv\u0101 voce Examination, as may be deemed necessary.\n\n8. The marks obtained by each candidate in respect of each of the subjects in which he shall have been examined will be added up, and the names of the candidates who shall have obtained a greater aggregate number of marks than any of the remaining candidates will be set forth in order of merit; and such candidates shall be deemed to be selected candidates for the Civil Service of India, provided they appear to be in other respects duly qualified.\n\nShould any of the selected candidates become disqualified, the Secretary of State for India will determine whether the vacancy thus created shall be filled up or not. In the former case, the candidate next in order of merit, and in other respects duly qualified, shall be deemed to be a selected candidate. A selected candidate declining to accept the appointment which may be offered to him will be disqualified for any subsequent competition.\n\nSelected candidates, before proceeding to India, will be on probation for two years, during which time they will be examined periodically, with a view of testing their progress, in the following subjects:\u2014\n\n* \"Nothing can be further from our wish than to hold out premiums for knowledge of wide surface and of small depth. We are of opinion that a Candidate ought to be allowed no credit at all for taking up a subject in which he is a mere smatterer.\"\u2014Report of Committee of 1854. A deduction of marks will be made under each subject, including Mathematics.\n\n\u2020 Full instructions as to the course of study to be pursued will be issued to the successful Candidates as soon as possible after the result of the open competition is declared.\n(1) Oriental Languages:\u2014\n\n| Language                  | Marks |\n|---------------------------|-------|\n| Sanskrit                  | 500   |\n| Vernacular Languages of India (each) | 400   |\n| The History and Geography of India | 350   |\n| Law                       | 1250  |\n| Political Economy         | 350   |\n\nIn these Examinations, as in the open competition, the merit of the candidates examined will be estimated by marks, and the number set opposite to each subject denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it at any one Examination. The Examination will be conducted by means of printed questions and written answers, and by viva voce Examination, as may be deemed necessary. The last of these examinations will be held at the close of the second year of probation, and will be called the \"Final Examination,\" at which it will be decided whether a selected candidate is qualified for the Civil Service of India.\n\n10. Any candidate who, at any of the periodical Examinations, shall appear to have wilfully neglected his studies, or to be physically incapacitated for pursuing the prescribed course of training, will be liable to have his name removed from the list of selected candidates.\n\n11. The selected candidates who, at the final examination, shall be found to have a competent knowledge of the subjects specified in Regulation 9, and who shall have satisfied the Civil Service Commissioners of their eligibility in respect of age, health, and character, shall be certified by the said Commissioners to be entitled to be appointed to the Civil Service of India, provided they shall comply with the regulations in force at the time for that Service.\n\n12. Applications from persons desirous to be admitted as candidates are to be addressed to the Secretary to the Civil Service Commissioners, London, S.W., from whom the proper form for the purpose may be obtained.\n\nJune 1877.\n\nThe Civil Service Commissioners are authorized by the Secretary of State for India in Council to make the following announcements:\n\n(1) Selected Candidates will be permitted to choose, according to the order in which they stand in the list resulting from the open competition, as long as a choice remains, the Presidency (and in Bengal the Division of the Presidency) to which they shall be appointed; but this choice will be subject to a different arrangement should the Secretary of State or Government of India deem it necessary.\n\n(2) No Candidate will be permitted to proceed to India before he shall have passed the final examination, and received a certificate of qualification from the Civil Service Commissioners, or after he shall have attained the age of twenty-four years.\n\n(3) The seniority in the Civil Service of India of the selected Candidates shall be determined according to the order in which they stand on the list resulting from the Final Examination.\n\n(4) It is the intention of the Secretary of State to allow the sum of \u00a350 after each of the three first half years of probation, and \u00a3150 after the last half year, to each selected Candidate who shall have passed the required Examinations to the satisfaction of the Commissioners, and shall have complied with such rules as may be laid down for the guidance of selected Candidates.\n\n(5) All selected Candidates will be required, after having passed the second periodical Examination, to attend at the India Office for the purpose of entering into an agreement binding themselves, amongst other things, to refund in certain cases the amount of their allowance in the event of their failing to proceed to India. For a Candidate under age a surety will be required.\n\n(6) After passing the Final Examination, each Candidate will be required to attend again at the India Office, with the view of entering into covenants. The stamps payable on these documents amount to \u00a31.\n\n(7) Candidates rejected at the Final Examination of 1880 will in no case be allowed to present themselves for re-examination.\n\nREGULATIONS FOR THE OPEN COMPETITION OF JULY, 1878.\n\nN.B.\u2014The Regulations are liable to be altered in future years.\n\n1.

Of these, will be selected for Presidency of Bengal, [for the Upper Provinces, and for the Lower Provinces,] for that of Madras, and for that of Bombay.\u2020\u2014Notice will hereafter be given of the days and place of Examination.\n\n2.

The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary: and if the result of such inquiries in the case of any Candidate should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India: and if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4. The Examination will take place only in the following branches of knowledge:\u2014\n\n| Branch                      | Marks |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| English Composition         | 300   |\n| History of England\u2014including a period selected by the Candidate | 300   |\n\n* This choice must be exercised immediately after the result of the open competition is announced, on such day as may be fixed by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n\u2020 The Fee for this Examination will be \u00a35, payable by means of a special stamp according to instructions which will be communicated to Candidates.\n\n\u2021 Marks assigned in English Composition and Mathematics will be subject to no deduction.\n\n\u00a7 A considerable portion of the marks for English History and Literature will be allotted to the work specially prepared.

The Examination will be conducted by means of printed questions and written answers, and by viva voce Examination, as may be deemed necessary.\n\n8. The marks obtained by each Candidate, in respect of each of the subjects in which he shall have been examined, will be added up, and the names of the Candidates who shall have obtained a greater aggregate number of marks than any of the remaining Candidates, will be set forth in order of merit, and such Candidates shall be deemed to be selected Candidates for the Civil Service of India, provided they appear to be in other respects duly qualified. Should any of the selected Candidates become disqualified, the Secretary of State for India will determine whether the vacancy thus created shall be filled up or not. In the former case, the Candidate next in order of merit, and in other respects duly qualified, shall be deemed to be a selected Candidate. A selected Candidate declining to accept the appointment which may be offered to him will be disqualified for any subsequent competition.\n\n9. Selected Candidates, before proceeding to India, will be on probation for two years, during which time they will be examined periodically, with a view of testing their progress in the following subjects:\u2014\n\n| Subjects                          | Marks |\n|----------------------------------|-------|\n| 1.

In awarding marks for this regard will be had partly to the extent and importance of the periods or books selected, and partly to the thoroughness with which they have been studied.\n\nThe Examination will range from Arithmetic, Algebra, and Elementary Geometry, up to the elements of the differential and integral calculus, including the lower portions of applied Mathematics.\n\nThe standard of marking in Sanskrit and Arabic will be determined with reference to a high degree of proficiency, such as may be expected to be reached by a Native of good education.\n\nFull instructions as to the course of study to be pursued will be issued to the successful Candidates as soon as possible after the result of the open competition is declared.\n\nIn these Examinations, as in the open competition, the merit of the Candidates examined will be estimated by marks, and the number set opposite to each subject denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it at any one Examination. The Examination will be conducted by means of printed questions and written answers, and by viva voce Examination, as may be deemed necessary. The last of these Examinations will be held at the close of the second year of probation, and will be called the \"Final Examination,\" at which it will be decided whether a selected Candidate is qualified for the Civil Service of India. At this Examination Candidates will be permitted to take up any one of the following branches of Natural Science, viz.\u2014Botany, Geology, and Zoology, for which 350 marks will be allowed.\n\nAny Candidate who, at any of the periodical Examinations, shall appear to have wilfully neglected his studies, or to be physically incapacitated for pursuing the prescribed course of training, will be liable to have his name removed from the list of selected Candidates.\n\nThe selected Candidates who, at the Final Examination, shall be found to have a competent knowledge of the subjects specified in Regulation 9, and who shall have satisfied the Civil Service Commissioners of their eligibility in respect of age, health, and character, shall be certified by the said Commissioners to be entitled to be appointed to the Civil Service of India, provided they shall comply with the regulations in force, at the time, for that Service.\n\nApplications from persons desirous to be admitted as Candidates are to be addressed to the Secretary to the Civil Service Commissioners, London, S.W., from whom the proper form for the purpose may be obtained.\n\nSeptember, 1877.\n\nThe Civil Service Commissioners are authorized by the Secretary of State for India in Council to make the following announcements:\u2014\n\n(1) Selected Candidates will be permitted to choose, according to the order in which they stand in the list resulting from the open competition as long as a choice remains the Presidency (and in Bengal the Division of the Presidency) to which they shall be appointed but this choice will be subject to a different arrangement, should the Secretary of State, or Government of India, deem it necessary.\n\n(2) The Probationers having passed the necessary Examinations, will be required to report themselves to their Government in India, not later than the close of December, 1881.\n\n(3) The seniority in the Civil Service of India of the selected Candidates shall be determined according to the Order in which they stand on the list resulting from the Final Examination.\n\n(4) An allowance of \u00a3150 a year will be given during each of the two years of their probation to all Candidates who pass their examination at some University to be approved beforehand by the Secretary of State.

A \"Local Allowance\" is not taken into account in calculating leave allowances or pensions.\n\nNote.\u2014A \"Local Allowance\" may be drawn by an Officer absent from his office on duty for a period not exceeding one month, provided that it is not drawn by a locum tenens. An Officer who is absent on duty for more than a month is not entitled to draw his \"Local Allowance\" for any part of such absence.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGENERAL RULES.\n\n5. Leave of absence can never be claimed absolutely as of right. Nothing in this Code or its Supplements must be understood to limit the free discretion of the Government to refuse or revoke leave of absence of any description, at any time, according to the exigencies of the public service.\n\n6. If an officer who is absent on leave obtains promotion, substantive or officiating, or an increase of pay or acting allowances which involves no change in or addition to his duties or responsibilities, the promotion or increase has effect at once. Otherwise the promotion of an absent officer has effect only from the date of his return to duty.\n\n7. An officer who is discharged from, or resigns, the public service, and is re-employed after an interval, cannot, without the sanction of the Government of India, count his service prior to discharge towards leave after re-employment.\n\nException.\u2014An officer discharged from the Indian Navy on its abolition, who was subsequently re-employed in the public service, may count service in the Indian Navy towards leave after re-employment, notwithstanding the occurrence of an interval between his discharge from the Indian Navy and his first re-employment. Any leave taken by such officer while in the Indian Navy will be treated in calculating the leave due to him under this Rule, as if such leave had been taken under the Rules to which he became subject on re-employment.\n\n8. If an officer who has obtained leave of absence makes over charge of his office before noon, his leave begins on and includes the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise it begins on and includes the following day.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nFURLough.\n\n9. The amount of furlough admissible to a Covenanted Civil Servant, and the aggregate amount of furlough and of special leave with allowances, admissible to an Uncovenanted Officer, is limited to six years. All the Rules in the Code are subject to this limitation.\n\nExplanation.\u2014The following leave under other Rules is counted as furlough under this Section.\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014furlough and leave with allowances on medical certificate under former Rules.\n\n(i) Leave of the kind described in Section 4 (a, 6), and junior furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855 are not counted against an officer under this Section.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014furlough and leave with allowances on medical certificate and leave on private affairs under former Rules, or under the Rules in Supplement F. to this Code.\n\n10. The amount of furlough \"earned\" by an officer is one-fourth of his active service.\n\nProviso.\u2014Provided that, in making this calculation for an Uncovenanted Officer, only half of the active service rendered by him in offices other than those included in Schedule A shall be taken into account.\n\n1. The whole of the active service rendered while officiating in any of the offices included in Schedule A is to be taken into account.\n\n11. The amount of furlough \"due\" to an officer is the amount which he has earned, diminished by\u2014\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014\n\n(1) The amount of furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules, except junior furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855;\n\n(2) The excess over one year in the amount of leave with allowances, on medical certificate, which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014\n\n(3) The amount of furlough, or special leave, with allowances, which he has enjoyed under these or any other Rules;\n\n(4) The amount of leave on private affairs, or on medical certificates with allowances, which he has enjoyed under the Rules formerly applicable to him.\n\nProviso.\u2014Provided that if more than two years' furlough be due to an Uncovenanted Officer when he is first admitted to the benefit of these rules, the excess shall be cancelled.\n\n12. To an officer who has rendered three years' continuous service, furlough for not more than two years may be granted, as follows:\n\nOn medical certificate,\u2014unconditionally;\nWithout medical certificate,\u2014subject to these provisions:\u2014(1) That the furlough be due to him; (2) that he have rendered eight years' active service; (3) that the whole number of officers absent on furlough and special leave do not exceed the limit (if any) appointed by the Government of India.\n\n13. Furlough granted under Section 12, may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\n14. To an officer who has not rendered three years' continuous service, furlough for not more than one year may be granted on medical certificate.\n\n15. Furlough granted under Section 14 for less than one year may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\n16. (a) An officer on ordinary furlough, has a lien on his substantive appointment, or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay. Ordinary furlough includes\u2014\n\n(1) The first two years of each separate period of furlough under Section 12, including any extension under Section 13; provided that ordinary furlough can, under no circumstances, extend beyond two years at one time. (2) So much of furlough under Section 14, including any extension under Section 15, as may be due, provided the Officer have rendered six months' continuous active service.\n\n(b) On other furlough a Covenanted Civil Servant has no lien; but an Uncovenanted Officer has a lien.\n\n17. An officer on ordinary furlough is entitled, subject to the limitations prescribed in Sections 18 and 19, to a leave allowance equal to half the average salary which he has earned during so much of his continuous active service as is within the three years preceding the day on which he gives up office.\n\nProvided that subsidiary leave shall not be included in active service under this Section, nor periods during which an officer has been out of employ in India, otherwise than as a penalty for misconduct. And provided also that the leave allowances of an Uncovenanted Officer shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes furlough.\n18. The maximum leave allowance of a Covenanted Civil Servant on ordinary furlough is, if paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3250 a quarter, or if paid in India Rs. 833\u00bd a month. The minimum is, if paid at the Home treasury, \u00a3125 a quarter, or his last salary, whichever is less, or if paid in India, Rs. 416\u00bd a month, or his last salary, whichever is less.\n\n19. The maximum leave allowance of an Uncovenanted Officer on ordinary furlough is, if paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a quarter, or if paid in India, Rs. 666\u00bd a month. There is no minimum.\n\n1. An officer on furlough does not forfeit his past leave allowance by resigning his service without returning to India.\n\n20. An officer on furlough other than ordinary, is entitled, if a Covenanted Civil Servant, to subsistence allowance, and, if an Uncovenanted Officer, to \u00a3120 a quarter paid at the Home treasury, or Rs. 400 a month paid in India, or to one quarter of the average salary defined in Section 17, whichever is less.\n\n1. The following are the rates of monthly subsistence allowance for Covenanted Civil Servants:\n\nTo an officer of not more than eight years' actual residence in India. Rs. 250\n\nTo an officer of more than eight, but less than twelve years' actual residence in India. Rs. 320\n\nTo an officer of twelve or more years' actual residence in India. Rs. 400\n\nCHAPTER V.\nSPECIAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n21. Special leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months, provided that an officer who has had special leave must render six years' active service before he can again have such leave.\n\n(1) The corresponding leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this proviso.\n\n(2) An Uncovenanted Officer is not debarred from obtaining special leave with allowances under this Chapter by reason of his having had leave on private affairs under the Rules in Supplement F, such leave on private affairs being furlough in another form.\n\n22. An officer on special leave has a lien on his substantive appointment, or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not subject to liability.\n\n23. For the first six months for which an officer is on special leave, whether the six months be included in the same leave or not, he is entitled to the leave allowance admissible under Sections 17, 18, and 19. Thereafter he is entitled to no leave allowance.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n24. (a) Furlough and special leave out of India begin on, and include the day of the departure of the vessel on which the officer sails; and to an officer taking such leave, subsidiary leave, not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, may be granted from the day on which he gives up office to the day before that on which his furlough or special leave begins.\n\n(b) Furlough and special leave out of India, end on and include, the day before the arrival of the vessel on which the officer returns; and to an officer coming back from such leave, subsidiary leave, not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, may be granted from the day on which the vessel arrives, to the day before that on which he assumes the office to which he may be appointed.\n\n25. An officer may take furlough or special leave, partly in, and partly out of, India. But subsidiary leave is not admissible under Section 24, Clause (a), unless the furlough or special leave begins as furlough or special leave out of India, nor under Section 24, Clause (b), unless it ends as furlough or special leave out of India.\n\n26. An officer on subsidiary leave under Clause (a) of Section 24 has, or has not, a lien on an appointment according as he has, or has not, such lien on the first day of the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\n27. An officer on subsidiary leave under Clause (b) of Section 24 has, or has not, a lien on an appointment, according as he has, or has not, such lien on the day last preceding the subsidiary leave.\n\n28. An officer on subsidiary leave is entitled to allowances as follows:\n\n(a) If the leave be subsidiary to special leave, and the officer have had leave subsidiary to a former special leave no allowance.\n\n(b) If the leave be subsidiary to ordinary furlough or special leave, the allowance admissible under Section 17; but calculated, in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant without the limitation of maximum or minimum prescribed by Section 18. The limitations prescribed by Section 19, apply to the allowances of an Uncovenanted officer on subsidiary leave.\n\n(c) If the leave be subsidiary to furlough other than ordinary, the allowance admissible under Section 20.\n\n(d) If the officer, under Section 37, have ceased to have a lien on a substantive appointment in the case of a Covenanted Officer, subsistence allowance; and, in the case of an Uncovenanted Civil Servant, no allowance.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n29. The amount of privilege leave admissible at one time is limited to three calendar months.\n\n30. The amount of privilege leave earned by an officer is one eleventh part of the time during which he has been on duty without interruption. Provided that no privilege leave can be earned by an officer by duty done, while three months' such leave is due to him; and that, whenever duty is interrupted, all claim to privilege leave earned thereafter is forfeited. Absence on privilege leave, though not counting as duty, is not an interruption of duty within the meaning of this Section.\n\n31. The privilege leave due to an officer is the privilege leave which he has earned, less the period during which he has been absent on privilege leave.\n\n(1) To Uncovenanted Judicial and Educational officers whose duties are not continuous, and who enjoy regular vacations during which they are allowed to be absent from duty, privilege leave is not admissible, except in case of urgent necessity.\n\n(2) The Local Government, may, with the sanction of the Government of India, impose a like restriction in the case of Covenanted Officers.\n\n32. To an officer who has been on duty, without interruption, for eleven calendar months, and who has not, for six calendar months, been absent on privilege leave, the whole or any part of the privilege leave due to him may be granted.\n\nAn officer applying for privilege leave must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking furlough, special leave, subsidiary leave, leave on private affairs or leave on medical certificate, for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying for permission to retire or to take such leave within the three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\n33. An officer on privilege leave has a lien on his substantive appointment. He has also a lien on his officiating appointment, so long as it is not resumed by an officer having a superior lien on it.\n\n34. An officer on privilege leave is entitled to a leave allowance equal to the salary which he would earn in appointment on which he has a lien.\n\n* Applies to a Commissioned Military Officer in Civil employ.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nEXAMINATION LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n[The Rules in this Chapter apply to Commissioned Military Officers in Civil employ, except those employed in the Public Works Department and in the Survey Department under the Surveyor-General of India, for whom there are special Departmental Rules.]\n\n(1) A Covenanted Civil Servant who is a candidate for a reward offered by the Government for the study of any of the Vernacular languages, may be allowed leave for one month for the purpose of being examined.\n\n(2) If he pass the examination, he may be allowed similar leave for another month.\n\n(3) An officer on examination leave has a lien on his appointment (substantive or officiating), and is entitled to leave allowance as if he were on privilege leave.\n\n(4) An officer while absent from his office or from his station to attend a departmental examination, or (in the Punjab) an examination in Pushtu or Belochi, which is obligatory on certain officers, is considered to be on duty.\n\n(5) Leave may not be given under Rule 4 to an officer to prepare for examination, or for recreation after examination. A reasonable time, including the day or days of examination should be allowed for the journey to and from the place of examination, and nothing more.\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nEXTENSION AND COMMUTATION OF LEAVE.\n\n35. Except as provided in Section 24, no kind of leave can be granted in continuation of any other kind; but any leave may be retrospectively changed for any other kind or amount of leave which might at first have been granted: provided that the grant, or extension, of furlough under this rule (otherwise than on medical certificate) is subject to Proviso 3 under Section 12.\n\n(1) Except by the Secretary of State, leave cannot be changed or extended without the permission of the Local Government, which originally granted it.\n\n(2) An officer on furlough or special leave in Europe who wishes to have his leave extended must apply to the Secretary of State for India at least three months before the end of his leave.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nPAYMENT OF LEAVE ALLOWANCES.\n\n[This chapter applies to all officers in civil employ.]\n\n36.

Payment is made from the Home treasury as follows:\n\nOn fixed quarter-days (namely March 25th, June 24th, September 29th, and December 24th), a form is supplied on application to the India Office, containing\u2014\n\n(1) A life-certificate to be filled up in the manner directed on the face of it.\n\n(2) A cheque for the amount due (which is specified) for the officer to fill up, and which may be cashed through any banker.\n\nIf an officer's contract of service contains a stipulation that \"a pound sterling shall be considered equal to and calculated at any specified rate,\" his leave allowances are converted into sterling at that rate.\n\nIf an officer receives an advance of pay in England to enable him to return to duty in India, the advance will be recovered at the rate or rates of exchange fixed for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments for the year in which the advance was made. The same rule will also apply when an advance is made in England to a person appointed there, proceeding to India to join his appointment.\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nRETURN TO DUTY.\n\n[This Chapter applies to all Civil Officers in Civil employ, and, in respect to leave of absence in India granted by the Civil authorities to Commissioned Military Officers in Civil employ.]\n\n37. An officer who remains absent after the end of his leave is entitled to no allowance for the period of such absence, and he ceases to have a lien on any appointment, if his leave was furlough, immediately, and if it was special or privilege leave, after a week.\n\nAn officer on furlough or special leave in Europe may not return to India, without obtaining the permission of the Secretary of State.

It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council, or Governor in Council of either of the Presidencies, as the case may be, to grant to an Ordinary Member of Council, leave of absence, under medical certificate, for a period not exceeding six months, and such Member, during his absence, shall retain his office, and shall, on his return and resumption of his duties, receive half his salary for the period of such absence; but, if his absence shall exceed six months, his office shall be vacated.\n\nSUPPLEMENT B.\n\nJUDGES OF HIGH COURTS AND CERTAIN LEGAL AND JUDICIAL OFFICERS.\n\nDEFINITIONS.\n\n1. In the following Rules \"actual service\" includes\u2014\n   (1) Time spent on duty as a Judge or Officiating Judge of a High Court.\n   (2) Privilege leave of absence.\n   (3) Subsidiary leave of absence.\n   (4) Duly authorized vacations, provided that the Judge is not absent on furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\n\"Extraordinary leave\" means any leave granted otherwise than under these rules.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\n2. One year's furlough shall be placed to the credit of each Judge, after the completion of every four years of actual service.\n\n3. Except under Rules 6 and 7, no furlough shall be granted until at credit under Rule 2.\n\nProvided that any Judge who may have been already in the service of the Government at the time of taking office in the High Court, and who was, at that time, entitled under the Rules applicable to the branch of the service to which he belonged to furlough, without medical certificate, may be granted furlough for a term not exceeding that to which he was so entitled, upon the condition that such furlough shall not be taken until the completion of two years actual service in the High Court, and shall not exceed one year.\n\n4. Except under Rule 7, furlough shall not be repeated until after the completion of three years' actual service from the date of the last return from furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\nN.B. The words \"furlough, or extraordinary leave,\" in the above Rule mean furlough under these Rules, or extraordinary leave granted to any officer since he has been a Chief Justice or Judge of a High Court.\n\n5. The maximum term of furlough to be taken at any one time shall be fifteen months.\n\n6. Under medical certificate, furlough may be granted before it is at credit under Rule 2.\n\n7. On urgent private affairs, furlough may be granted before it is at credit under Rule 2, and although three years of actual service have not been completed since the last return from furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\nProvided that furlough under this Rule shall not exceed six months, and shall be granted only once during the whole period of a Judge's service in the High Court.\n8. The aggregate amount of all furlough which can be granted to a Judge during the whole period of his service in the High Court is two years and a half.\n\n9. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date of the Judge's quitting his office to the date of his return thereto. Furlough taken out of India shall be reckoned from the date of embarkation to the date of debarkation.\n\nIn the event of the furlough being taken partly in India and partly out of India, the commencement and termination of the furlough shall be respectively determined by the above Rules, according as the furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n10. For the interval elapsing between the date of quitting his office and the commencement of furlough out of India, and between the termination of furlough out of India and resuming his office, a Judge may be allowed subsidiary leave not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, which in special cases may be extended.\n\n11. A Judge, when on furlough or subsidiary leave, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 833-5-4 per mensem in the case of leave taken in India, or \u00a31,000 per annum in the case of leave taken out of India.\n\n12. Except under medical certificate, the number of furloughs to be granted at any one time, and the grant of furloughs to individual Judges shall be subject to, and limited by, the exigencies of the service, which exigencies shall be determined exclusively by the authority granting the furlough.\n\n13. If, owing to the exigencies of the service, it may be necessary to place any limit on the number of Judges who may be absent on furlough at the same time, applications not supported by medical certificate will be granted in the following order:\n\nThe Judge to whose credit the greatest amount of furlough remains under Rule 2 shall have the preference.\n\nIf two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, the preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in a High Court is longest, reckoning, in the case of a Judge who has not taken furlough or extraordinary leave, from the date of his commencement of service in the High Court, and, in the case of a Judge who has taken furlough or extraordinary leave, from the date of his last return from such furlough or leave.\n\nIf two or more applicants are equal in both respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Court.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n14. Subject to the exigencies of the service, a Judge who has completed eleven months' continuous duty, inclusive of vacations, may, if the Government be satisfied that there is an urgent necessity, but not otherwise, be granted privilege leave for one month without deduction from his salary or acting allowances.\n\n15. In the same manner and under the same conditions an additional month of privilege leave shall be held to accrue to a judge after each further period of eleven months' continuous duty.\n\n16. Privilege leave shall not be taken in instalments; but any balance of privilege leave that may not have been taken shall be added to the next privilege leave which may accrue.\n\nProvided that the whole privilege leave taken at any one time shall not exceed three months, and that any accumulation of privilege leave beyond that period shall be forfeited.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n17. Furlough and privilege leave shall not be taken as such, in continuation of each other; but if a Judge absent on one of these classes of leave be allowed to change it for another, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under the class of leave for which it was changed.\n\n18. Applications for leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Government may, from time to time, prescribe.\n\n19. Leave allowances shall be payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\n20. No substantive appointment shall be vacated, merely by reason of leave being granted under these rules.\n\n21. If a Judge shall overstay any leave, he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent, and if he shall so continue absent for more than one week, his office shall be liable to become vacant.\n\n22. No leave, except privilege leave and leave subsidiary to furlough, shall count as service for pension.\n\n23. Each Judge who stood appointed to a High Court on the 7th August, 1869, and has taken no leave since then, shall, on the next occasion of his taking leave, be given the option of accepting these Rules or abiding by them in force before that date for Judges of the High Courts of Judicature. Any Judge who has taken leave since the 7th August, 1869, must abide by the Rules he elected when taking that leave.\n\n24. If a Judge, who is a Covenanted Civil Servant, shall be permitted to resign his office and remain in the service, all leave which he may have taken as a Judge of the High Court shall be reckoned as if it had been taken under the rules for the leave of absence of Covenanted Civil Servants.\n\n25.

The leave of absence and acting allowances of a Law Officer who is not a member of the Covenanted Civil Service, or a Government Pleader or Govern-\nment Prosecutor, but whose pay is fixed, and his whole time retained for the service of Government, are regulated by the provisions of the Civil Leave and Acting Allowance Codes as if he were a member of the Covenanted Civil Service.\n\n4. A Government Pleader or Government Prosecutor is entitled to such leave of absence and allowances when on leave, and to such acting allowances, as the authority who appoints him may think fit to grant; provided that no expense be caused to the Government.\n\n5. The leave of absence and acting allowances of a Law Officer who is not a member of the Covenanted Civil Service or a Government Pleader or a Government Prosecutor, whose pay is fixed but whose whole time is not retained for the service of Government are regulated by the following rules:\n\nI. \"Active service\" includes, besides time spent on duty, leave of absence taken under Rule III., and subsidiary leave of absence taken under Rule VIII.\n\nII.

Excepting the case of subsidiary leave, no kind of leave may be granted in continuation of any other kind of leave; but any leave may be, retrospectively, changed for any other kind or amount of leave which might at first have been granted.\n\nX. If an officer, who has obtained leave of absence makes over charge of his office before nor his leave begins on, and includes, the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise, it begins on and includes the following day.\n\nXI. If an officer resumes charge of his office after noon, his leave of absence ends on, and includes the day on which he resumes charge; otherwise it ends on and includes the day before he resumes charge.\n\nXII.

To a Bishop who has been on duty without interruption for thirty-three calendar months, and who has not for twelve calendar months been absent on furlough, the whole or any part of the furlough due to him may be granted.\n\n8.

Personal allowance is to be taken as part of an officer's substantive pay.\n\n\"Average salary\" means the average salary for a month calculated for so much of the three years immediately preceding the day on which the officer gives up office, as he has passed on duty, or on privilege leave. But, whenever leave is taken for not more than one month, or, whenever the officer's pay is less than three hundred rupees, the pay of the officer's appointment at the time he gives up office is to be taken in lieu of his \"average salary.\"\n\n\"Hall average salary\" is always subject to a maximum of Rs. 500 a month if paid in India, and \u00a3150 a quarter if paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India.\n\n\"One quarter average salary\" is always subject to a maximum of Rs. 400 a month if paid in India, and \u00a3120 a quarter if paid at the Home treasury.\n\nProvided always that the allowance of an officer during leave shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes leave.\n\nLEAVE ON MEDICAL CERTIFICATE.\n\n3. Leave on medical certificate may be granted, whenever sufficient cause is shown, for three years in all, but not for more than two years at one time; and no officer can have leave on medical certificate out of India more than twice.\n\n4. An officer on leave under Section 3 is entitled to half of his average salary for the first fifteen months of each period of absence, but not for more than thirty months in all.\n\nFor the rest of his leave under Section 3 he is entitled to a quarter of his average salary.\n\nLEAVE ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n5. Leave on private affairs for six months at a time may be granted to an officer who has not had furlough. The first leave under this section may be taken after six years' service, and the leave may be repeated after intervals of six years.\n\n(1) Leave on private affairs does not accumulate, nor can it be taken in instalments.\n\n(2) Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for leave on private affairs.\n\n6. An officer on leave under Section 5 is entitled to half of his average salary.\n\n(1) An Officer does not forfeit the allowance to which he is entitled under this Section by resigning the service at the end of the leave.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\n7. Furlough may be granted as follows to an officer who has not had leave on private affairs:\n\nAfter ten years' service, one year or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year or any less period.\n\nOr,\u2014after eighteen years' service, two years or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year or any less period.\n\nProvided that not more than two years in all may be granted.\n\n(1) Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for furlough.\n\n(2) Leave on private affairs under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1863 does not prevent the grant of furlough under this Section.\n\n8. An officer on furlough is entitled to half of his average salary.\n\nLEAVE WITHOUT ALLOWANCES.\n\n9. Leave without allowances may, in cases of necessity, be granted for such time as may be necessary. Time spent on leave under this section does not count as service for other leave. There is no limit to the length or frequency of leave under this Section, and it may be granted in continuation of leave on medical certificate and leave on private affairs, or furlough, but not in continuation of privilege leave.\n\nNote.\u2014Leave under this Section is extraordinary leave.\n\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE.\n\n10. Subsidiary leave for such time as may be sufficient may be added to leave on medical certificate, leave on private affairs, or furlough, when taken out of India, as prescribed in Section 24 of the Code. Fourteen days only are allowed to an officer at a Presidency town, who takes leave on medical certificate, leave on private affairs, or furlough out of India, and embarks or debarks, as the case may be, at this town. Subsidiary leave may also be granted to an officer going on, or returning from, leave on medical certificate to a sanitarium in India.\n\n11. An officer on subsidiary leave prefixed to other leave, is entitled to half his average salary. An officer on subsidiary leave following other leave, is entitled to half his average salary, or one quarter of his average salary, according to the rate of allowance to which he may be entitled at the end of the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n12. Privilege leave may be granted in accordance with the rules in Chapter VII. of the Code; provided that no officer whose salary is less than two hundred rupees a month can draw any allowances for time passed on privilege leave until he returns to duty.\n\nEXAMINATION LEAVE.\n\n13. An officer permitted to present himself at any\nexamination which must be passed before a person is eligible for a higher subordinate appointment, such as a Deputy-Magistracy, may, under the orders of the Local Government, be allowed leave of absence for the number of days which is actually necessary to enable him to attend at the examination. During this absence, which is expected to be short, no deduction will be made from the officer's allowances, unless the head of the office finds such deduction necessary to enable him to make arrangements for carrying on the work. Such leave should not be allowed more than twice for each standard of examination.\n\n14. The master of a Government school in Bengal in receipt of a salary not exceeding two hundred rupees a month while absent from his office with the object of studying to qualify himself as a teacher of surveying, is considered to be absent on duty or on special deputation, provided that such period of absence shall not exceed three months.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n15. Leave on private affairs and furlough cannot be taken in continuation of any leave except subsidiary leave; but any leave may be retrospectively changed for any other kind or amount of leave which might at first have been granted; and, if an officer absent on privilege leave, or on leave on private affairs, or on furlough, take extension of leave on medical certificate, the whole of the absence will be treated as leave on medical certificate.\n\n(1) Leave without allowances cannot be converted retrospectively into leave on Medical Certificate, but leave on Medical Certificate may be given in continuation of leave without allowances.\n\n16. No officer's appointment becomes vacant, simply by reason of his taking leave under these Rules. But absence without leave, or after the end of leave (excepting privilege leave, in which case a week's grace is allowed) involves loss of appointment; and after five years' continuous absence, whether with or without leave, an officer is considered to be out of Government employ.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE.\n\n17. (a) Leave may be granted to an officer by the authority whose duty it would be to fill up his appointment if vacant. The Local Government may empower heads of Departments to grant privilege leave to officers under their orders, who are appointed by Government; but if the officer, to whom leave is granted, be a gazetted officer, the grant of leave must be reported to the Local Government.\n\nSUPPLEMENT G.\n\nPORT BLAIR POLICE.\n\nI. Privilege leave to the men may be granted as under:\n\n2 months after 30 months' consecutive service.\n3 months after 36 months' consecutive service.\n\nSuch leave cannot be claimed as a right, and will only be granted when it can be given without inconvenience to the public service.\n\nDuring privilege leave full pay is admissible.\n\nII. Sick leave on full pay is granted for fifteen days, after which the men will receive subsistence as under:\n\nConstables Rs. 6 per mensem\nSerjeants 10\nChief Constables 15\nInspectors Two-thirds of salary.\n\nIII. Furlough to unmarried men, or men whose families will remain at their homes in India, will be given in turn after five years' continuous service in the Settlement.\n\nFurlough will also be given, in special cases, at the discretion of the Superintendent, to married men having their families at the Settlement, after a continuous service of not less than five years.\n\nIV. Such furlough will carry with it half-pay, and will be for periods of from four to six months, according to the distance of the applicant's home from Calcutta.\n\nV. Leave-men proceeding to India will be employed, ordinarily, on the voyage in guarding transferred convicts, and, when not required for the purpose they will be granted deck passages at the expense of the Government.\n\nVI. From the port of debarkation they will proceed to their homes at their own expense, and on the expiration of their furlough they will report themselves to the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, with a view to their employment as convict guards on the return voyage. If not required for this purpose, they will be granted a deck passage at the public expense.\n\nVII. The total number of men on leave at one time from all causes other than privilege leave shall not exceed ten per cent. of the Force.\n\nVIII. Absence without leave is punishable by dismissal or forfeiture of pay.\n\nEXTRACTS FROM THE CIVIL PENSION CODE, SHOWING THE CHIEF RULES APPLICABLE TO UNCOVENANTED SERVANTS IN THE SUPERIOR DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT IN INDIA, TOGETHER WITH AN ABSTRACT OF ITS VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS.\n\n2. The Rules in this Code and its Supplements apply to all public officers, except the following, who are under Military Rules:\n\n(a) Officers and men in the Army or in the Navy (including Covenanted Medical Officers).\n(b) Officers of the Subordinate Medical Department.\n\n3. The general provisions of the Code do not apply to the undermentioned officers, whose pensions are regulated by the special Rules contained in the Supplements.\n\n(a) Officers of the Covenanted Civil Service.\n(b) Judges of the High Courts of Judicature.\n(c) Chaplains.\n(d) Members of the Bengal Pilot Service.\n\n5. An officer's claim to pension or gratuity is governed by the Rules in force at the time when he resigns or is discharged from the service of Government. No officer has a claim to a benefit granted after his resignation or discharge.\n\n7. An officer cannot earn two pensions or gratuities\nin the same office at the same time, or by the same continuous service.\n\n11. Service under a covenant which contains no stipulation regarding pension or gratuity does not qualify, unless the Government of India specially permits it to qualify.\n\n19. Service qualifies only if the officer holds a substantive office on a permanent establishment.\n\n2. An officer officiating in an office which is vacant, or of which the permanent incumbent does not draw any part of the pay, may, if he is confirmed without break of continuity, and if the permanent incumbent is not at the time counting service in the office for pension, count service as if he had held the office substantively.\n\n44. Periods of absence on leave other than privilege or subsidiary leave are not reckoned as service. Leave subsidiary to leave on medical certificate is not reckoned as service in the case of an officer who has twice before had leave on medical certificate beyond India.\n\nException.\u2014In the case of an officer appointed to the service under the Regulations of the Royal Indian Engineering College, at Cooper's Hill, and of an officer especially educated in Europe for the Forest Department under Regulations made by the Secretary of State, furlough to the following extent counts as service:\n\n| Service from date of appointment | Furlough counts as service |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Under 20 years                   | None                      |\n| 20 years                         | 2 years                   |\n| 25 \"                             | 3 \"                       |\n| 30 \"                             | 4 \"                       |\n| 35 \"                             | 5 \"                       |\n\n47. A break in the continuity of service entails forfeiture of past service, except in the following cases:\n\n(a) Authorised leave.\n\n(b) Absence prolonged after the end of leave: provided that if an officer remains absent for more than a week after the end of privilege leave, his past services are forfeited, unless the authority whose duty it is to make the appointment re-appoints the officer, and makes a declaration (to be communicated to the Accountant-General) that his past services, or part of them, shall qualify. If he remains absent for more than a month, his past services cannot count without a special order by the Government of India.\n\n(c) Suspension immediately followed by re-instatement, which need not necessarily be to the same office.\n\n(d) Abolition of office.\n\n(e) Transfer to non-qualifying service in an establishment which is under Government control. The transfer must be made by an authority competent to sanction it; and an officer who voluntarily resigns qualifying service, cannot claim the benefit of this Rule. Transfer to a grant-in-aid school always entails forfeiture.\n\n(f) Transfer to service on the Household Establishment of the Viceroy.\n\n(g) Loss of appointment owing to the Mutiny, provided that the officer affected cleared his character and was re-appointed as soon as a suitable vacancy was found for him.\n\n(h) Transit from one appointment to another provided that the officer is transferred under the orders of competent authority, or if he is a Ministerial Officer, with the consent of the heads of both offices concerned.\n\n48. Resignation of the public service, or removal from it on account of misconduct, or for inefficiency, or on account of failure to pass a prescribed examination, entails forfeiture of past service.\n\n49. Pensions and gratuities are of four classes:\n\n(a) Compensation pensions and gratuities.\n\n(b) Invalid pensions and gratuities.\n\n(c) Superannuation pensions and gratuities.\n\n(d) Retiring pensions.\n\n(1) Pension or gratuity may not be granted to an officer whom it is desired to remove for misconduct or inefficiency.\n\n(2) A gratuity is paid in a single sum, and not by instalments.\n\n(3) An officer may be admitted to pension or gratuity while absent on leave, whether in or out of India.\n\n50. A compensation pension or gratuity is awarded to an officer discharged from the public service because, on a reduction of establishment, his appointment is abolished.\n\nNote.\u2014A gratuity is intended to be less valuable than a pension, and must not be awarded if it is likely to impose upon the State a higher charge than would arise from a pension.\n\n52. An invalid pension or gratuity is awarded on retirement from the public service to an officer who, by bodily or mental infirmity, is permanently incapacitated\u2014\n\n(a) For the public service, or\n\n(b) For the particular branch of it to which he belongs.\n\n53. If the officer applying for pension or gratuity is sixty years old or upwards, no certificate by a Medical officer is necessary. It will suffice for the head of the office to certify to the incapacity of the applicant.\n\n55. If the incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits, no pension or gratuity can be granted. Otherwise, it is for the Local Government to decide whether the officer's incapacity is such as to render it necessary to admit him to invalid pension or gratuity.\n\n56. A superannuation pension or gratuity is granted to an officer compelled, by rule, to retire at a particular age.\n\nAn officer in a superior grade who has attained the age of fifty-five years may be required to retire, unless the Local Government considers him efficient, and permits him to remain in the service.\n\n57. A retiring pension is granted to an officer who voluntarily retires after completing the requisite period of service.\n\n58. The amount of pension or gratuity that may be granted is determined by length of service, as set forth in Sections 59, 60, and 61.\n\n(1) An officer entitled to pension may not take a gratuity instead of pension.\n\n(2) A pension or a gratuity (except a pension granted under Section 64) is fixed in rupees, and not in sterling money, even though it is to be paid in Europe.\n\n59. The amount of compensation and invalid pension and gratuity which may be granted, is as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) After a service of less than fifteen years\u2014\n   A gratuity not exceeding (except in special cases and under the orders of the Government of India) one month's emoluments for each completed year of service; and not, under any circumstances, exceeding twelve months' emoluments in all.\n\nBroken periods of a year are not to be taken into account in calculating the amount of any gratuity admissible to an officer under any Rule in the Code.\n\n(b) After a service of not less than fifteen years, but less than twenty-five years\u2014\n   A pension not exceeding one-third of the officer's average emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 3,000 a year, or, if the officer's average emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 2,000 a year.\n\n(c) After a service of not less than twenty-five years\u2014\n   A pension not exceeding one-half of the officer's average emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year, or, if his average emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 4,000 a year.\n\nNote.\u2014An invalid pension on the following scale, but not being less than Rs. 1,000 or more than Rs. 2,000 a year, may be granted to an officer appointed to the service under the Regulations of the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, or specially edu-\ncated in England for the Forest Department under Regulations made by the Secretary of State:\n\nIf the service of the officer be not less than\n\n10 years ... ... ths of the officer's average emoluments.\n\n11 \" ... ... ths \"\n\n12 \" ... ... ths \"\n\n13 \" ... ... ths \"\n\n14 \" ... ... ths \"\n\n60. The amount of superannuation pension and gratuity which may be granted is that which would be admissible as an invalid pension or gratuity.\n\nProvided, that if an officer's qualifying service began after the 20th January, 1871, and after he attained the age of 25 years, the pension or gratuity admissible under this section is to be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years' service completed, not exceeding 30, and the denominator of which is 30. The limit of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000, or Rs. 5,000 is to be applied before, and not after, this multiplication.\n\n61. The amount of retiring pension which may be granted for superior service, is as follows:\n\nAfter a service of not less than thirty years,\u2014The same amount as the invalid pension admissible after twenty-five years' service.\n\n63. In the following cases certain privileges exist in respect of the length of service required for pension.\n\nTo the following officers, not being Natives of Asia, pension is admissible after three years' less service than is required from other officers, provided that they began service after twenty-five years of age:\n\n(i) Directors of Public Instruction, Inspectors of schools, Principals and Professors of colleges, and Head Master of schools and colleges.\n\n(ii) Barristers of England or Ireland, or members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland, serving in offices to which the Local Government has, with the consent of the Government of India, declared it to be necessary to appoint Barristers of England or Ireland, or members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland.\n\nTo entitle an officer to the benefit of this rule, the whole of the service for which pension is claimed must have been passed in one or other of the offices indicated.\n\n64. To the following officers, being Barristers of England or Ireland, or Members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland, viz., Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab, First Judges of Small Cause Courts of Presidency Town, Recorder of Rangoon, Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department (formerly Assistant Secretary in the Home Department, Legislative Branch, and afterwards Secretary to the Council of the Governor General for making Laws and Regulations), invalid and retiring pensions are admissible as follows:\n\n(a) After not less than six years and nine months' active service in one or other of the offices specified in this Section, an invalid pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\n(b) After not less than eight years and eight months' such service, an invalid pension of \u00a3500 a year.\n\n(c) After not less than eleven years and six months' such service, a retiring pension of \u00a3750 a year.\n\nActive service here includes, besides time spent on duty, whether in substantive or acting service, privilege leave, subsidiary leave, and periods of vacation during which the officer is not on furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\n69. (a) Unless there be something repugnant in the subject or context, the words \"pay\" and \"emoluments\" used in Sections 59, 60, and 61 mean the pay and emoluments which the officer was receiving immediately before his retirement from service.\n\n(b) \"Average emoluments\" means the average calculated upon the last five years of service.\n\n70. (a) In the term \"emoluments\" are included the following:\n\n(1) Pay of substantive appointment;\n(2) Personal allowance;\n(3) Fees or commission, if they are the authorised emoluments of an appointment, and are in addition to a substantive pay, and commission in the case of a Thoogee.\n(4) Field allowances (i.e., horse and tent allowance) to any officer of the Survey Department in the Bengal Presidency who retires from the service on or before the 1st September, 1882.\n(5) Charge allowances to signallers in the Telegraph Department.\n(6) Bullock train and Punjab Military Horse Van, Dakh allowances in the Post Office Department.\n\n(b) Other allowances are excluded.\n\n(c) Acting allowances may not be included unless the \"acting\" service counts under Section 19, Rule 2.\n\n89. A pension or gratuity is payable as follows:\n\nI. If it is stated in rupees,\n\n(a) At any Treasury of the Government of India in India; or,\n\n(b) If the recipient is resident elsewhere than in Asia, at his option at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments.\n\nII. If the amount is stated in sterling,\n\n(a) At the Home Treasury of the Government of India; or,\n\n(b) If the recipient is resident in Asia, at his option at any Treasury of the Government of India in India, at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments.\n\n90. Transfer of Pension from the Home treasury to an Indian treasury, or vice versa, is permitted only once.\n\n---\n\n**SUPPLEMENT A OF THE CIVIL PENSION CODE.**\n\n**COVENANTED CIVIL SERVANTS.**\n\n1.

Provided, however, that if a Judge of the High Court, selected from the Covenanted or Uncovenanted branches of the Civil Service, shall be compelled to retire, on medical certificate, after six years and nine months' actual service, he shall be allowed the option of taking his pension or retiring allowance either under these Rules or under the Rules applicable to the service to which he belongs.\n\n9. A Judge of the High Court, selected from the Covenanted Civil Service, shall be required to continue his subscriptions to the Civil Annuity and Civil Service Funds.\n\n10. If a Judge be transferred from one Court to another, the period for which he has officiated in the first Court shall count as service qualifying for retiring pension.\n\n11. If a Puisne Judge be promoted to be a Chief Justice in the same or another court, the time for which he has served as Puisne Judge will count for pension, according to the rate of a Puisne Judge's pension, and the time for which he serves as Chief Justice will count for pension according to the rate of a Chief Justice's pension.\n\n12.

If a Chief Justice of Madras, Bombay, or the North-Western Provinces be transferred to be Chief Justice of Calcutta the time for which he has served in the former capacity will count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of Madras, Bombay, or the North-Western Provinces, and the time for which he serves as Chief Justice of Calcutta shall count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of the High Court of Calcutta.\n\n---\n\n**SUPPLEMENT C.**\n\n**CHAPLAINS.**\n\n1. Pensions are granted to Chaplains under the following Rules.\n\n2. (a) \"Residence\" is reckoned, in the case of a Chaplain appointed in England, from arrival in India; and in the case of a Chaplain appointed in India, from date of covenant. It includes (1) time spent on duty, (2) privilege and subsidiary leave, (3) time passed out of employ, in India, otherwise than on leave.\n\n(b) \"Service\" includes \"residence,\" and, also, all time spent on leave of any description; but no time before the beginning of \"residence.\"\n\n3. A Chaplain who has completed seventeen years' residence and twenty years' service, or, if appointed before the 11th January, 1854, fifteen years' residence and eighteen years' service, is entitled to a retiring pension of \u00a3365 a year.\n\n1. Pensions are granted either by the Government of India, the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay (as the case may be), or by the Secretary of State. A Chaplain proceeding to England on retirement without applying for Pension to the Government of India, the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay (as the case may be), should procure a certificate from the Assistant General, showing his service, residence, the amount of pension to which he is entitled, and the date from which his pension may be paid. A Chaplain to whom pension has been granted in India should be careful before proceeding to England to obtain the usual certificate of the last issue of pay or pension to him in India.\n\n2. A Chaplain absent on furlough may retire without returning to India.\n\n3. A Chaplain belonging to the Bengal establishment, who wishes to obtain pension from the Authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, through the Venerable the Archdeacon, or the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Calcutta. A Chaplain belonging to the Madras or Bombay Establishment must submit his application to the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay, as the case may be, through the Venerable the Archdeacon, or the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of his diocese. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, who wishes to obtain pension from the authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of the Church of Scotland. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay must submit his application to the Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of his Presidency.\n\n4. A Chaplain must retire after twenty-five years' service, unless especially exempted by the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Governor-General in Council, or, if he belong to the Madras or Bombay establishment, of the Governor in Council of his Presidency.\n\n5. A Chaplain who is obliged, by bad health, to retire after completing seven years' residence, but before completing the periods of residence and service required by Section 3, will receive an invalid pension according to the following scale:\n\n- If he have completed ten years' residence ... \u00a3173 7 6 a year\n- If he have completed seven years' residence ... 127 15 0 a year\n- If he have not completed seven years' residence ... 63 17 6 a year\n\nThese allowances are admissible only after a trial of a temperate climate, and upon a certificate from the Medical Board attached to the Office of the Secretary of State for India that the officer is permanently unfit to serve in India.\nMembers of the Pilot Service in Bengal.\n\n[Note.\u2014The following Rules were declared in 1835.]\n\n1.

All pensioners under these rules are to make personal appearance at the Accountant General's office on the first day of every alternate month, or to afford such other proof of their existence as the Accountant General may, from time to time, require.\n\n7. Widows, and female orphans above the age of fifteen years are required to forward to the Accountant General's office declarations, half-yearly, in May and November, that they are not married, and that they have not been married at any intervening period. The declarations are to be countersigned by the executor to the estate of the deceased member of the Pilot service, or pensioner, or by the guardian of an orphan, and by a member of the Pilot service, certifying to the truth of the declaration to the best of their knowledge and belief. Forms of the declaration will be furnished on application at the office of the Accountant General.\n\n8. Contributions to the pension fund by members of the Pilot service who joined the service on or before the 1st July 1835, and pensions to them and to their families, will continue to be paid in Sicca rupees. All other contributions, allowances, and pensions, will be paid in Government rupees.\n\n1. If pensions payable in Sicca rupees are paid at the Home treasury of the Government of India, payment is made at 24\u00b7035d. for each Sicca rupee.\nINDIAN STAFF CORPS.\n\nROYAL WARRANT FOR THE FORMATION OF THE CORPS.\n\nVICTORIA R.\n\nWHEREAS it is expedient to provide a body of Officers for Our Service in India, by whom various offices and appointments hitherto held by Officers borne on the strength of the several Corps or Regiments of Our Forces in India shall in future be held; and whereas Our Secretary of State for India in Council has resolved to charge upon the Revenues of India the sum necessary to provide the pay, half-pay, and pensions of such body of Officers on the scale hereinafter contained, Our will and pleasure is that a Corps be formed in each of the Presidencies of Our Indian Dominions, to be denominated the Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Staff Corps respectively, to consist of such Officers as may be required for such employment, and are selected for such purpose by Our Governments in India, with the approbation of Our Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\nIt is also Our will and pleasure that all Officers now holding, or who immediately before the commencement of their present unexpired Furlough may have held such appointments, and in future Officers belonging to any of Our land Forces serving in India, under the rank of Regimental Field Officer, who shall have served three years with a Regiment, of which two shall have been in India,* shall be eligible to enter such Staff Corps; but such Officers will not be permanently transferred to the Staff Corps unless fully qualified, and until they shall have passed such periods of probation as may be determined on for the branch of the Indian Service for which they may be selected. Officers will receive Commissions in the Staff Corps on their names being submitted to us by Our Secretary of State for India.\n\nIt is Our further will and pleasure that the promotion and pay of the Staff Corps shall be regulated as follows:\u2014\n\n1. Ensigns, when permanently transferred to the Staff Corps, to have the rank of Lieutenant. Other Officers to have the rank which they may hold in their Regiments.\n\n2. Promotion in the Staff Corps to be governed by length of service.\u2020\n\nOfficers after twelve years' service, of which four must have been in the Staff Corps, to become Captains.\n\nAfter twenty years' service, of which six must have been in the Staff Corps, to become Majors.\n\nAfter twenty-six years' service, of which eight must have been in the Staff Corps, to become Lieutenant-Colonels.\n\nFive years' service in the Staff Corps as Lieutenant-Colonel to entitle the Officer so employed to the Brevet rank of Colonel.\n\n3. Officers now in Staff employment in India, joining the Staff Corps on its formation, shall count their previous Staff service towards promotion to the following extent:\u2014\n\nOne step of rank will be given to every Officer whose period of service would qualify him for it according to the above Rules. An interval of two years at least must intervene between each succeeding step.\n\n4. Officers in the Staff Corps will be eligible for Brevet rank in common with the rest of the Army.\n\n5. Officers of the Staff Corps holding Military appointments will take Military Command according to their Army rank, but Officers whilst holding only Civil appointments will not be entitled to assume such Command.\n\n6. Exchanges may be allowed between Officers of the Staff Corps under the substantive rank of Field Officer and Regimental Officers of the same rank on the recommendation of the Indian Governments. Officers of the Staff Corps exchanging into a Regiment will become the Juniors of their Regimental rank.\n\n7. The power of removing Officers from the effective List of the Staff Corps will be exercised by us through Our Secretary of State for India.\n\n8. Officers of the Staff Corps will receive pay according to the following scale:\u2014\n\n| Whilst required to remain in India. | Out of India. |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Rs. As P.                         | \u00a3 s. d.       |\n| General Officers                  | 1295 5 0 per mensem. | 1 5 0 per diem. |\n| Brevet-Colonel and Lieut.-Colonel | 827 14 0     | 1 0 0         |\n| Major                            | 640 14 0     | 0 16 0        |\n| Captain                          | 374 1 6      | 0 10 6        |\n| Lieutenant                       | 225 12 0     | 0 6 6         |\n\nEvery officer when in active employment will also receive, in addition to the above pay, such a sum as will make his total pay and allowances up to the sum assigned by the Governments in India, with the approval of the Secretary of State for India in Council, as the consolidated pay of the office which he may hold. Eventually a certain proportion of the senior Officers of the Staff Corps will receive Colonel's allowance.\n\n* This portion of the Royal Warrant has been revised by another Royal Warrant, dated 2nd May, 1868, which declares that\u2014\"Our will and pleasure is that from and after the date of this Our Warrant, Officers of Our Land Forces serving in India, under the rank of Regimental Field Officer, who shall have served two years with a Regiment, of which one shall have been in India, shall be eligible to enter the Bengal, Madras, or Bombay Staff Corps.\"\n\n\u2020 The periods of four, six, and eight years must be passed in the Staff Corps in India.\n\nNote.\u2014In order to entitle a Staff Corps Officer of the rank of Major-General to the unemployed pay mentioned in the Royal Warrant for that rank, he must have actually served not less than five years in the substantive rank of Field Officer\u2014the above five years being inclusive of any time he shall have been obliged to pass upon half-pay or leave in consequence of ill-health contracted in the service (as established by a Board of Medical Officers), or in consequence of wounds received in action.\n\nAn Officer of the Staff Corps promoted to the rank of Field Officer by Brevet for service in the field, who shall continue to serve uninterruptedly on full pay from the date of his promotion by Brevet to the date of his obtaining the rank of Major-General, is entitled to the unattached pay of that rank, notwithstanding he may not have served five years, with the regimental rank of Field Officer with a regiment, or in one of the situations specified in Clause 8 of the Royal Warrant of 31 Jan., 1859.\n9. Officers of the Staff Corps will be allowed to retire on the following scale of pension, provided that not less than half of the required periods of service shall have been passed in the Staff Corps:\n\n| Scale | \u00a3  s. d. |\n|-------|---------|\n| After 20 years' service in India | ... | 191 12 0 per annum. |\n| \" 24 \" | ... | 292 0 0 \" |\n| \" 28 \" | ... | 365 0 0 \" |\n| \" 32 \" | ... | 456 5 0 \" |\n\nRates introduced in 1866.\n\n| Scale | \u00a3  s. d. |\n|-------|---------|\n| After 35 years' service in India | ... | 600 0 0 \" |\n| \" 38 \" | ... | 750 0 0 \" |\n\nOfficers of Her Majesty's Indian Forces joining the Staff Corps will be entitled to pension under the Regulations of the Indian Service.*\n\n10. Officers of the Staff Corps in England who may not wish to retire, but who are unable to return to India, and Officers removed from the effective List who may not be entitled to retire on the above scale of pension, will be placed on a half-pay list, provided they have served three years in India in the Staff Corps on the same rate of half-pay and on the same conditions as Officers of a similar rank in Our Army.\n\n11. It is also Our will and pleasure that this Warrant shall be administered and interpreted by Our Secretary of State for India in Council, who shall be the sole and standing Authority upon the matters therein contained.\n\nGiven at Our Court at Windsor, this Sixteenth day of January, 1861, in the Twenty-fourth year of Our Reign, By Her Majesty's Command, (Signed) CHARLES WOOD.\n\nCONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT OF BRITISH OFFICERS TO THE STAFF CORPS.\n\nUnless for special applicants, whose cases will receive separate consideration, each on its own merits, it is deemed inexpedient to admit Officers of Her Majesty's British Army to the Staff Corps, whose standing in the service exceeds seven years, or thereabouts.\n\nThe selection of Officers for the Staff Corps rests with the Governments in India. The promotion of Officers while on probation will go on in their respective regiments. Officers of the British Army, when permanently transferred to the Staff Corps, will be removed from the strength of the regiment to which they belonged. It is discretional with the Governments in India to employ the Officers of the Staff Corps, in such manner as they may think best, in the situations for which their respective qualifications may render them most fitted. The appointments and promotions in the several departments rest with the Governments in India, and will be made irrespectively of the rank which the Officers may hold in the Staff Corps.\n\nOfficers of British regiments which may be ordered home and embark before the completion of their period of probation may, with the sanction of the Government of the Presidency, be allowed to remain in India to complete that period.\n\nOfficers of Her Majesty's British Regiments are eligible for appointment to the Staff Corps of any Presidency, without reference to the Presidency in which their regiments may be serving, and they will be permitted to serve out their probation without reference to their regiments being in the meantime moved to another Presidency.\n\nApplication for admission to the Staff Corps, on probation, should be made to the Government, through, and with the sanction of, the Commander-in-Chief of the Presidency, and that of the Commander-In-Chief in India.\n\nA candidate for appointment to the Staff Corps, on probation, must produce the following certificates of his Commanding Officer and the Surgeon:\n\nCertificate of Commanding Officer.\n\nCertified that of the regiment\n\nStaff Corps, completed two years' duty with a regiment on the\n\none year of which (or the whole period of which, as the case may be), was spent in India.\n\nhas passed the examination in the Native languages by the higher\n\n(or lower) standard, and has attained such a knowledge of his drill and duty as an officer of infantry (or cavalry)\n\nin all its branches as to qualify him for the command of a company (or troop) in all situations. He also possesses a fair knowledge of the Articles of War and of the Queen's Regulations, as well as of the Military Regulations of the Bengal (Madras or Bombay) Presidency, besides having gained some general acquaintance with the organization and nature of the duties of all branches of the army serving in Bengal (Madras or Bombay).\n\nI further certify that during the period he has been attentive to his duty, and that his conduct has been in all respects unexceptionable.\n\nStation and date.\n\nCommanding Regiment.\n\nSurgeon's Certificate.\n\nI certify that, to the best of my belief, is in good bodily health, and apparently well capable of undergoing the vicissitudes of service in India.\n\nStation and date.\n\nSurgeon Regiment.\n\nThe date of transfer of an Officer to the Staff Corps will be that of his appointment on probation, except in the case of an Officer who has gained promotion in his regiment during his period of probation; in that case, he is allowed to enter the Staff Corps from the day following his promotion, with the rank then gained.\n\nExcept under very special circumstances, the period of probation will be limited to one year,\u2020 at the end of which the candidate, if not qualified for admission to the Staff Corps, must be remanded to his regiment; and should his regiment be in England, he will be put on British pay from the date of failing to pass the final examination. If possible, he will be provided with a passage in a troop ship, but if none be available, then the actual expense of the passage, and no more, will be paid to the agent of the vessel conveying the Officer to England. In no case will the period of probation exceed a second twelve months.\n\n* See page xxxiv.\n\u2020 All leave, except privilege leave and leave to pass in the Native languages for admission to the Staff Corps will be excluded from the year's probation.\nA British Officer, on probation for the Staff Corps, proceeding on leave to Europe, is to be held to have resigned his probationary position and appointment. Should an Officer so circumstanced be placed on the half-pay list, he will cease to be considered as a probationer.\n\nA probationer for the Staff Corps may at any time be allowed to withdraw his application, provided that he has not been actually admitted to that Corps by the Government in India.\n\nAs a general rule, a young Officer, on becoming a probationer, is appointed to do duty with a Native regiment.\n\nOn the completion of the year's probation, the candidate must produce certificates from his Commanding Officer (or the Officer under whom he has served) and from the Surgeon, similar to those obtained at the commencement of his probation; and he must pass an examination in the following tests, according to the nature of the duty or department in which he is to be employed.\n\nOn special grounds, but only when required for the convenience of the public service, examinations may be held at any time within two months of the expiration of the probationary year.\n\nShould he be found qualified, he will be admitted to the Staff Corps, and to the appointment or department for which he has proved his fitness. The circumstance of an Officer being in the Staff Corps will not exempt him from passing departmental tests, should he be transferred from one appointment or department to another.\n\nOfficers of Line Regiments, in which the purchase system was in force up to the 31st October, 1871, who entered the service prior to the 26th August, 1871, and whose permanent appointment to the Indian Staff Corps shall appear in the General Orders of one of the Local Governments of India, on a date subsequent to the 1st March, 1868, and who, on the date of such permanent appointment (being the date of appointment as probationers for the Staff Corps), shall not have exceeded four years' service on full pay, from the date of first Commission, shall receive, on their names appearing in the \"London Gazette\" as finally transferred to the Staff Corps, the exact sum such Officers would have received, under War Office Regulations, had they retired from the service by the sale of their Commissions at the time of joining the Staff Corps as probationers.\n\nOfficers who have been appointed probationers subsequent to the 31st October, 1871, will be required to make and sign the declaration laid down in para. \"C,\" clause 139, sec. 4 of the Queen's Regulations.\n\nThe young Officers who, on final transfer to the Staff Corps, may receive the value of their commissions, will, if appointed probationers on or after the 1st of July, 1870, be debited with the cost of their successors' passage to India, in the same manner as other Officers who are allowed to retire from British Regiments in India with the value of their commissions.\n\nOfficers who are entitled to the value of their first commissions should apply for it to the agents of the regiment to which they formerly belonged.\n\nOfficers who desire to enter the Staff Corps under the provisions of the General Order from the Horse Guards, dated the 1st of May, 1868, must make their applications in such time as will admit of the requisite forms being compiled with before the completion of their four years' service, as the Government cannot be responsible for any accidental delay, and applications for special consideration will not be received hereafter.\n\nOfficers joining the Staff Corps from the British Army must furnish a statement of their services duly vouched by their late Commanding Officers, showing in detail their actual service in India, and the periods of leave during such service, completed to the date of their transfer to the Staff Corps.\n\nNo Officers while away from their regiments as probationers for the Indian Staff Corps shall be permitted to retire from the service by the sale of their commissions, but such officers will still be eligible for such promotion in their regiments as may occur whilst they are probationers by or without purchase.\n\nThe claims to pension of widows and families of officers of the Staff Corps who may join from the British Army will be treated under the provisions of the Royal Warrant of the 27th December, 1870, or of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British officers as may be in force at the time being.\n\n### TABLE OF SALARIES ALLOWED FOR STAFF OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS OF THE SEVERAL PRESIDENCIES IN INDIA.\n\n| Military Secretariats | Rupees

All natural-born subjects of Her Majesty, between 22 and 28 years of age at the date of the examination, and of sound bodily health, may be candidates. They may be married or unmarried. They must possess a diploma in surgery or a license to practise it, as well as a degree in medicine, or a license to practise it in Great Britain or Ireland.\n\nDeclaration to be submitted. 1. They must subscribe and send in to the Military Secretary, India Office, Westminster, so as to reach that address at least a fortnight before the date fixed for the Examination, a declaration according to the annexed form.\n\n3. This declaration must be accompanied by the following documents:\n\n(a) Proof of age either by the candidates' own declaration, form of which can be obtained at the India Office, pursuant to the Act 5 and 6 Will. IV., c. 62; or by extract from the register of the parish in which he was born (A certificate of baptism which does not afford proof of age will be useless.)\n\n(b) A certificate of moral character from a magistrate, or a minister of the religious denomination to which the candidate belongs, who has personally known him for at least two preceding years.\n\n(c) A certificate of registration in accordance with the Medical Act of 1858, of the degrees, diplomas, and licenses possessed by the candidate.\n\n4. The physical fitness of candidates will be determined previous to examination by a Board of Medical Officers, who are required to certify that the candidate's vision is sufficiently good to enable him to perform any surgical operation without the aid of glasses. A moderate degree of myopia would not be considered a disqualification, provided it did not necessitate the use of glasses during the performance of operations, and that no organic disease of the eyes existed. Every candidate must also be free from organic disease of other organs, and from constitutional weakness, or other disability likely to unfit him for military service in India.\n\n5. On producing the foregoing qualifications, the candidate will be examined by the Examining Board in the following compulsory subjects, and the highest number of marks attainable will be distributed as follows:\n\n| Subjects                          | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| a. Anatomy and Physiology         | 1,000 |\n| b. Surgery                        | 1,000 |\n| c. Medicine, including Therapeutics, Diseases of women and children | 1,000 |\n| d. Chemistry and Pharmacy, and a practical knowledge of Drugs | 100   |\n\n(The examination in medicine and surgery will be in part practical, and will include operations on the dead body, the application of surgical apparatus, and the examination of medical and surgical patients at the bedside.)\n\n6. The eligibility of each candidate for the Indian Medical Service will be determined by the result of the examinations in these subjects only.\n\n7. Candidates, who desire it, will be examined in French, German, and Hindustani, Comparative Anatomy, Zoology, Natural Philosophy, Physical Geography, and Botany, with special reference to Materia Medica.\n\n8. The number of marks gained in these subjects will be added to the total number of marks obtained in the obligatory part of the examination by candidates who shall have been found qualified for admission, and whose position on the list of successful competitors will thus be improved in proportion to their knowledge of modern languages and natural sciences.\n\n9. The maximum number of marks allotted to the voluntary subjects will be as follows:\n\n| Subjects                          | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| French, German, and Hindustani (150 each) | 450   |\n| Natural Science                   | 300   |\n\n10. The subjects for this part of the examination will be taken from the following books:\n\n- \"Animal Kingdom,\" by W. S. Dallas, F.L.S.\n- \"Outlines of the Structure and Functions of the Animal Kingdom,\" by Rymer Jones; or \"Cours \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire d'Histoire Naturelle,\" par Milne Edwards.\n- Lindley's \"School Botany,\" Lindley's \"Medical and Economic Botany,\" Henfrey's \"Elementary Course of Botany.\"\n- \"Elements of Natural Philosophy,\" by Golding Bird and C. Brooks, \"Physical Geography,\" by Mrs. Somerville.\n\n11. The Examiners in London will prepare a list in order of merit, with the marks affixed in the different subjects, to be transmitted to the Director-General and communicated to the Professors of the Army Medical School. If any Candidate is found to be deficient in any particular subject, this shall be stated, in order that he may receive special instruction on the point at Netley.\n\n12. After passing his preliminary examination, candidates will be required to attend one entire course of practical instruction at the Army Medical School, before being admitted to examination for a commission, on\u2014\n\n(1) Hygiene.\n(2) Clinical and Military Medicine.\n(3) Clinical and Military Surgery.\n(4) Pathology of Diseases and Injuries incident to Military Service.\n\nThese courses are to be of not less than four months' duration; but candidates who have already gone through a course at Netley as candidates for the Army or Navy Medical Service may, if thought desirable, be exempted from attending the school a second time.\n\n13. During the period of his residence at the Army Medical School, each candidate will receive an allowance of 5s per diem, with quarters, or 7s per diem without quarters, to cover all costs of maintenance; and he will be required to provide himself with uniform (viz., the regulation undress uniform of a Surgeon of the British service, but without the sword).\n\n14. All candidates will be required to conform to such rules of discipline as the Senate may, from time to time, enact.\n15. At the conclusion of the course, candidates will be required to pass an examination on the subjects taught in the school. The examination will be conducted by the professors of the school.\n\nThe Director-General, or any medical officer deputed by him, may be present and take part in the examination. If the candidate gives satisfactory evidence of being qualified for the practical duties of an Army Medical Officer, he will be eligible for a commission as Surgeon.\n\n16. The position of the candidates on the list of Surgeons will be determined by the combined results of the preliminary and of the final examinations, and, so far as the requirements of the service will permit, they will have the choice of Presidency in India, according to their position in that list.\n\nIndia Office, May, 1876.\n\nN.B.

The regulations are those in force at the present time. They are subject to any alteration that may be determined on.\n\nPASSAGE TO INDIA.\n\n2. Passage allowance to India on appointment will be given, or a passage provided. When passages are provided on board the Indian troop ships, a charge for messing will be made at the rate laid down in the Royal Passage Warrant of 1865, viz., 3s. 6d. a day, but, when wine and beer are not included in the mess, and it is so stated on the messing certificate, the daily contribution required will be 2s. 6d. only.\n\n3. All Surgeons who shall neglect or refuse to proceed to India under the orders of the Secretary of State for India within two months from the date of leaving Netley, will be considered as having forfeited their appointment, unless special circumstances shall justify a departure from this regulation.\n\nPAY PREVIOUS TO EMBARKATION.\n\n4. Pay at the rate of 10s. a day will be allowed from date of passing final examination at the Army Medical School, until date of embarkation when a passage is provided, or for a period of two months when the Surgeon is permitted to make his own arrangements for passage. An advance of two months' pay will also be made on embarkation.\n\nGRADES AND RELATIVE RANK.\n\n5. The grades of Medical Officers in the Indian Military Forces are four in number, viz.:\u2014\n   1. Surgeon-General, ranking as Major-General according to the date of his Commission.\n   2. Deputy Surgeon-General, as Colonel according to the date of his Commission.\n   3. Surgeon-Major, as Major according to the date of his Commission; and after twenty years' service as Surgeon and Surgeon-Major, as Lieutenant-Colonel, but junior of that rank except for choice of quarters.\n   4. Surgeon as Lieutenant according to the date of his Commission; and after six years' service as Captain according to the date of the completion of such service.\n\nPROMOTION.\n\n6. A Surgeon is promoted to Surgeon-Major on completion of twelve years' service from date of first Commission, subject to his passing the prescribed examination.\n\n7. In cases, however, of emergency, or when the good of the service renders such alteration desirable, it is competent for the Secretary of State for India, on the recommendation of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, to shorten the period of service above mentioned, in such manner as he shall deem fit and expedient.\n\n* State what subjects will be taken up.\n8. The examination for promotion may be taken at any time after the Surgeon has served nine or more years.\n\n9. When Surgeons have served the requisite time, they will be examined in the following manner:\n\nA series of printed questions prepared by an examining board, consisting of the Principal of the Medical College and any two or more of the professors he may associate with himself for the purpose, will be sealed and sent by the Surgeon-General to the principal medical officers of stations where Surgeons may be eligible for examination. It will be the duty of the principal medical officer of the station to deliver these sealed questions to the Surgeons, and to see that they are answered without the assistance of books, notes, or communication with any other person. The answers are to be signed and delivered, sealed, to the Principal Medical Officer, who is to send them, unopened, to the Surgeon-General, together with a declaration from the Surgeon himself, or certificate from a superior medical officer, if there is one, that he has availed himself of every opportunity of practising surgical operations on the dead body.*\n\n10. The Surgeon is also required to transmit together with his answers to the Surgeon-General a medico-topographical account of the station where he may happen to be at the time, or of some other station where he may have been resident sufficiently long to enable him to collect the necessary information for such a report. Failing this, he will send a medico-statistical report of his charge for a period of at least twelve months.\n\n11. If the examining board is satisfied with the replies to the questions, and the Surgeon-General is satisfied with the certificates and with the medico-topographical or statistical report, the Surgeon will be held qualified for promotion.\n\n12. All promotion from the rank of Surgeon-Major to that of Deputy Surgeon-General, and from the rank of Deputy Surgeon-General to that of Surgeon-General, is given by selection for ability and merit.\n\n**Tenure of Office in Administrative Grades.**\n\n13. The tenure of office of Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General is limited to five years.\n\n14. Deputy Surgeons-General, if not disqualified by age, are eligible either for employment for a second tour of duty in the same grade, or for employment in the higher grade of Surgeon-General by promotion thereto.\n\n15. Absence on leave in excess of six months on medical certificate, or of four months on private affairs, involves forfeiture of appointment.\n\n**Pay and Allowances when in India.**\n\n16. Officers who may hereafter be appointed to the Indian Medical Service will receive pay in India according to the following scale:\n\n| Rank                  | Years' Service | Pay and Allowances per Mensem |\n|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| Surgeon-Major         | 25            | Rs. 888 A. 12 P. 0            |\n|                       | 20            | Rs. 852 A. 3 P. 7             |\n|                       | 15            | Rs. 677 A. 6 P. 11            |\n|                       | 12            | Rs. 640 A. 14 P. 6            |\n| Surgeon               | 10            | Rs. 410 A. 9 P. 5             |\n|                       | 6             | Rs. 392 A. 5 P. 2             |\n|                       | 5             | Rs. 304 A. 14 P. 2            |\n|                       | under         | Rs. 286 A. 10 P. 0            |\n\n17. On first appointment they will only come into receipt of Indian pay and allowances from the date of their arrival within the limits of the Presidency to which they have been gazetted. When provided with passages on the troop ships, they draw Indian pay and allowances from date of disembarkation at Bombay.\n\n18. The salaries of the principal administrative and military appointments are fixed at the following consolidated sums:\n\n- Surgeon-General, Bengal: Rs. 2,700\n- Surgeon-General, Madras: Rs. 2,500\n- Surgeon-General, Bombay: Rs. 2,500\n- Deputy Surgeon-General: Rs. 1,800\n- Surgeon-Major of 20 years' service and upwards in charge of Native regiments: Rs. 1,000 with Rs. 90 horse allowance in Cavalry regiments.\n- Surgeon-Major in charge of ditto: Rs. 800 with Rs. 90 ditto\n- Surgeon above 5 years' full pay service in charge of Native regiments: Rs. 600 with Rs. 60 ditto\n- Surgeon under 5 years' do.: Rs. 450 with Rs. 60 ditto\n\n19. The salaries of other medical appointments in the Civil and Military Departments are consolidated, and vary from Rs. 1,800 to Rs. 400 per mensum.\n\n20. Qualified officers of the Medical Service are also eligible for appointments in the Assay Department. The salaries of these appointments are from Rs. 600 to Rs. 2,250 per mensum.\n\n21. A Medical Officer will, however employed, be restricted to the rate of pay laid down in paragraph 15, until he shall have passed the examination in Hindustani, known as the \"Lower Standard.\"\n\n*The Surgeon may see this certificate before it is sent to the Surgeon-General.*\n22. Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General on vacating office at the expiration of the five years tour of duty, will be permitted to draw in India respectively an unemployed salary of Rs. 1,260 per mensem in the former, and Rs. 900 in the latter case, for a period of six months from the date of their vacating office, after which they will be placed while unemployed on the following scale of pay:\n\n| Surgeon-General | Deputy Surgeon-General |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| After 30 years service on full pay | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| ... | 2 5 0 | 1 14 0 |\n| \" 25 \" \" \" \" \" or on promotion should this period of service not be completed | ... | ... |\n| ... | 2 0 0 | 1 8 0 |\n\nFurloughs.\n\n23. An Officer will be eligible for one year's furlough on the completion of five years' actual service in India, and for an additional year after each subsequent five years' service.\n\n24. While on furlough, an Officer will receive half the emoluments of his office.\n\n25. No absentee shall draw more than \u00a31,000 or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\n26. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years.\n\n27. Surgeons under six years' service, and in receipt of Indian allowances as subalterns, on returning to England on sick certificate receive passage allowance.\n\n28. Officers of the Administrative Grades are entitled during their tenure of appointment to six months leave of absence on sick certificate or four months leave on private affairs.\n\nRetiring Pensions.\n\n29. Officers of the Indian Medical Service will be allowed to retire on the following scale of pension, on completion of the required periods of service:\n\n| After 30 years' service in India | \u00a3 |\n|----------------------------------|---|\n| ... | 550 |\n| \" 27 \" \" \" \" \" | ... |\n| \" 24 \" \" \" \" \" | ... |\n| \" 21 \" \" \" \" \" | ... |\n| \" 17 \" \" \" \" \" | ... |\n\n30. Time of service for pension will reckon from date of arrival in India. The period of residence at the Army Medical School will reckon as service for the above pension, except in the cases of Officers who have gone through the course at Netley as candidates for the British Army or Navy Medical Service.\n\n31. A Surgeon-General, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, will be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3350 per annum, in addition to that which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n32. A Deputy Surgeon-General will, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3250 per annum, in addition to the pension to which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n33. In each of the above cases stated in pars. 29 and 30, six months' absence on medical certificate will be allowed to count towards actual service in those grades.\n\n34. A Surgeon-General or Deputy Surgeon-General who has completed his term of service and has reverted to British pay, may reside in Europe, at the same time qualifying for higher pension.\n\n35. With a view to maintain the efficiency of the service, all Medical Officers of the rank of Surgeon-Major shall be placed on the Retired List when they shall have attained the age of fifty-five years, and all Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General when they shall have attained the age of sixty-five years. In any special case, where it would appear to be for the good of the service that the Officer should continue in employment, he may be so continued, subject in each case to the sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n36. A Medical Officer, retiring after a service of twenty-five years and upwards, may, if recommended for the same by the Government of his Presidency, receive a step of honorary rank, but without any consequent increase of pay.\n\n37. Officers compelled to leave the service on account of ill-health, and not entitled to full-pay pension under present regulations, will be allowed the half-pay of their relative rank, as laid down in the Royal Warrant of 10th May, 1873.\n\n| Rank | Relative Rank | Rates of Half-pay |\n|------|---------------|------------------|\n|      |               | Per Day | Per Annum |\n|      |               | s. d.   | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| Surgeon-Major of 20 years' service | Lieut.-Colonel | 11 0 | 200 15 0 |\n| Surgeon-Major | Major | 9 6 | 173 7 6 |\n| Surgeon | Captain | 7 0 | 127 15 0 |\n| \" under 6 years' service | Lieutenant | 4 0 | 73 0 |\n| \" 3 \" \" \" \" \" | ... | 2 5 | 45 12 6* |\n\nOfficers cannot retire in India on half-pay (No. 54, 28th February 1865).\n\nWound Pensions.\n\n38. Medical Officers are entitled to the same allowances granted to Her Majesty's Indian Military Forces on account of wounds and injuries received in action as combatant Officers holding the same relative rank.\n\n* Under the conditions prescribed in the Regulations of the Indian Service\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS.\n\nDespatch to the Government of India, No. 132, of the 30th June, 1866.\n\nFamily Pension Fund Regulations.\n\n39. The claims to pension of widows and families of Medical Officers shall be treated under the provisions of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British Officers as may be in force at the time being. (The Royal Warrant of 27th December, 1870, is the one now in force.)\n\n40. The widows and families of Medical Officers are also entitled to pensions from the Indian Service Family Pension Fund, to which all Surgeons must, as a condition of their appointment, subscribe from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS OF 1796.\n\nOfficers (of whatever rank) must be ten years in India before they can be entitled (except in cases of certified sickness, and as hereafter specified) to their rotation to be absent on furlough, and the same rule is applicable to assistant surgeons and veterinary surgeons. The furlough to be granted by the commander-in-chief at each presidency, with the approbation of the respective governments.\n\nOfficers who have not served ten years in India, but whose presence in England is required by urgent private affairs, may be allowed a furlough for one year without pay.\n\nOfficers coming to England on furlough are required immediately to report their arrival by letter, with their address, forwarding at the same time the certificates they received in India.\n\nThe period of furlough is three years, reckoning from its date to the day of the return of the officer to his presidency.\n\nOfficers are required to join the establishment to which they belong at the expiration of the three years' furlough, unless they shall have obtained an extension of leave, six months before the expiration of that period. No furlough will be extended, except in cases of sickness, certified in the manner hereafter mentioned; or in cases in which it shall be proved that a further residence in Europe is indispensably necessary.\n\nAll officers finding it necessary to solicit a further leave of absence on account of sickness, must, if resident in India or its vicinity, appear before the Medical Board appointed for that purpose, who shall report their opinion on the state of such officer's health. And if resident in the country in any part of the United Kingdom, they must transmit with their letter of application for such leave, a certificate according to the following form, signed by at least two gentlemen, eminent in the medical profession, viz.\u2014\n\nI hereby certify, that I have carefully examined (state the nature of the case, as well as the name of the party), and I declare, upon my honour, that, according to the best of my judgment and belief, is at present unfit for military duty, and that it is absolutely necessary, for the recovery of his health, that he should remain at least longer in this country.\n\nAlso, previously to such extension of furlough being granted, such further proof shall be adduced by personal examination or by such other evidence as shall be deemed satisfactory.\n\nOfficers abroad in any part of Europe, applying to remain a further time from their duty on account of sickness, are to furnish a certificate of two eminent physicians, in the above form, with the attestation of a magistrate, that the persons who signed the certificate are physicians.\n\nOfficers having obtained an extension of furlough to a given period, must at its expiration apply for permission either to return to their duty or to reside a further time in England.\n\nIn every case in which an officer has had his furlough extended beyond the prescribed period on the ground of his health not being sufficiently restored, and shall apply for permission to return to his duty, he shall produce a certificate from the examining physician that his health is completely re-established, and that there is every probability of his being able to perform the active duties of his profession in India.\n\nNo officer who has failed to obtain an extension of furlough will be considered eligible to return to the service after five years' absence, under the Act of Geo. III. cap. 52, sec. 70.\n\nEvery officer upon leaving India will receive a printed copy of the General Order on this subject, published agreeably to the instruction of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the plea of ignorance of the regulations will not be admitted as any justification of the breach of them; officers, therefore, who shall come home on furlough, and who shall not in due time apply, so as to effect their return to the Presidency to which they belong within the period of three years from the commencement of their furlough, will subject themselves to the loss of the service, unless they shall be permitted to remain a further time in Europe.\n\nNo officer on furlough can receive pay for more than two years and a half from the period of his quitting India until he returns, excepting colonels of regiments and general officers; the latter are then allowed to draw the pay of their brevet rank beyond the above period.\n\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS.\u2014Nov. 17, 1854.\n\nWith the view of adapting the regulations to the present increased facilities of communication, and to correct, as far as possible, any tendency in them to deter officers from resorting to the places which may be most conducive to the restoration of their health, when a change of climate is required for that purpose, the following rules are established, and are to have effect from the 1st February, 1854:\n\n1. All regimental officers in the service on the 1st February, 1854, who prefer retaining what may be considered the advantages of the old regulations, may do so, provided they signify their wish to that effect when they next apply for furlough or leave of absence, without any limitation whether such leave be in India or elsewhere; and officers who once make their election will not be entitled to any other choice, but will be afterwards subject to the new or old regulations, according to their decisions.\n\n2. Staff officers, as such, have not the above option allowed them, but they may retain the advantages of the old regulations by giving up their appointments, which, in such cases, will be considered vacated from the date of embarkation.\n\n3. To those officers who adopt them, the new regulations will apply retrospectively in respect of furlough and leaves of absence beyond sea, and in computing their time of service for retirement, so that their furloughs or leaves of absence, whether under the old or the new rules, and whether on private affairs or sick certificate, within or beyond India, will count for ser-\nvice to the authorized extent only, in computing the time for retirement on full pay.\n\n4. Officers who have availed themselves of the option of the old rules are allowed to reconsider the question under the modifications now sanctioned.\n\n5. Officers who have not taken leave subsequent to the publication of the new rules on the 1st February, 1854, and who, consequently, may not have been called upon to declare whether they would abide by the old or the new regulations, will, on retirement from the service, be entitled to take full advantage of the privileges given by the new regulations.\n\nFURLoughs ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n6. Every officer will be allowed a furlough to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of two years at the expiration of ten years' service, and for a second period of two years after twenty years' service in India.\n\n7. The second furlough of two years will only be granted after ten years' service in India, from the date of the return to duty after the first furlough of two years. These furloughs are not to be cumulative, under any circumstances, but are limited to two years. Officers who have taken leave of absence on sick certificate to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, will be ineligible to a furlough on private affairs until they have served six years from their last return to duty. This rule does not apply to short leaves to sea.\n\nOfficers who take their first furlough after twenty years' service in India, may take their second furlough after an additional service of five years from the date of their first return to duty. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n8. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and to the regulations framed for and preservation of the efficiency of each regiment by limiting the number of absentees.\n\n9. Officers holding staff or other detached appointments, may be allowed furlough for a period of six months without losing their appointments; but, during that period, they will not be entitled to any portion of their staff salary, which will be drawn in full by the officers officiating for them.\n\nAbsence for six months under this rule does not preclude an officer from taking his furlough to Europe after ten years' service. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n10. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on furlough on private affairs, will be entitled to \"Furlough Pay\" only.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE ON SICK CERTIFICATE.\n\n11. Leave of absence on sick certificate will be granted for a term not exceeding eighteen months, whether it be to any place in Europe, or elsewhere out of India.\n\n12. Extension of such leave may be granted, as at present, on production of medical certificates, for further periods not exceeding eighteen months in the whole.\n\n13. An officer holding a staff or other detached appointment, will be allowed to be absent on sick certificate in England, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of twenty months, without losing his appointment; and, during the first six months only of such absence, he will be entitled to draw half the staff salary of his appointment, the officer officiating for him drawing the remaining half salary during the first six months, and the whole salary during the remainder of the time.\n\n14. An officer's claim to half staff salary for six months, as sanctioned in the preceding rule, will not be affected by his subsequently retiring from the service in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n15. No portion of command allowance, medical staff salary, or other similar allowance, which under the old rules was inadmissible to officers absent from their corps or stations, at the Cape or elsewhere, will be allowed to absent officers under these regulations.\n\n16. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on leave of absence on sick certificate, will be entitled for a period of six months to the same rate of Indian pay and allowances as was allowed under the old regulations to officers proceeding to the Cape on medical certificate, and for the remaining period of their leave they will receive furlough pay only.\n\n17. If the leave on sick certificate be extended, furlough pay will be continued; but under no circumstances for a longer period than three years altogether, from the commencement of the absence.\n\nSTAFF OFFICERS.\n\n18. The term, \"staff officers,\" applies to all officers holding staff or detached appointments, military (general or regimental), political, or civil; also to general officers commanding divisions, members of the Medical Board, superintending surgeons, and others who, under the old rules, were entitled to draw half staff allowance when absent at the Cape.\n\n19. Staff officers absent on leave beyond the periods stated in Rules 9 and 13 respectively, cannot retain their appointments and allowances except on special grounds to be sanctioned by the Government of the presidency. Any such special grant of leave is to be reported at once, with the reasons for it, and to be subject to approval.\n\n20. The privilege of retaining staff appointments during leave of absence on sick certificate, or on furlough on private affairs will not be available a second time, if the fresh leave is on sick certificate, until an officer has been three years, or, if on private affairs, until he has been six years in the discharge of the duties of his appointment, from the date of last return to it.\n\n21. This rule, however, does not apply to leaves of absence, whether on sick certificate or on private affairs, in India, or for brief periods to Ceylon, the Mauritius, or other places out of India.\n\n22. Officers commanding troops of Horse Artillery and Light Field Batteries, and officers generally in employment, will be allowed leave out of India under the same rules with respect to allowance and tenure of command or office, as regulated the grant of leave to the Cape to such officers under the old regulations, except as to the duration of those advantages, the time for their continuance being subject to the provisions of the new regulations.\n\nDATE OF FURLough AND ADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n23. The period of furlough on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, is to be calculated from the date of the departure from India of the ship in which the officer proceeds.\n\n24. Advances of pay and allowances, staff and regimental, to officers proceeding on leave of absence on sick certificate, who may be entitled to them, will be made in India for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England at the rates of exchange fixed annually for repayment of advances made on account of Her Majesty's Government. Furlough pay will continue to be issued in advance for six months, when required by officers obtaining furlough on private affairs.\n\n25. The existing regulations regarding passage-money to officers are not affected by these rules.\n\n26. The certificates issued to officers who are granted furloughs on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, are to specify the time each officer has been absent on leave within Indian limits, as well as the time of his previous absence in Europe; but will not include the periods allowed for proceeding to the presidency or part of embarkation, and to enable officers to rejoin their regiments or stations after their return to India, nor the leave of one month's absence in six months, as authorized by the regulations. The last pay certificate of all officers proceeding to England on sick certificate is to specify the rate of regimental pay and allowances and staff salary to which they would have been entitled under the old regulations if proceeding to sea on medical certificate. This information is necessary in order that no difficulty may arise in the Pay Department of the India Office in adjusting the several payments which may be due.\n\nOFFICERS OF H.M.'S SERVICE.\n\n27. Officers of Her Majesty's service in India, whether employed regimentally or in staff or detached situations, are entitled to the advantages above laid down in respect to allowances and tenure of office when on furlough or leave of absence.\n\n28. In the case of officers of Her Majesty's service on furlough or sick certificate, in England or elsewhere, who may retire or exchange into regiments not on the Indian establishment, the grant to these officers of Indian allowances will cease from the date of their retirement or exchange, if it take place before the expiration of six months from the date of quitting India.\nPERIODS OF ABSENCE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AS SERVICE FOR RETIRING PENSIONS.\n\n29. In order that all officers quitting India on furlough or sick certificate may be placed on an exact equality as regards loss of time, the period allowed by regulation for proceeding to the presidency, or to the nearest port of embarkation, as well as the time to enable officers to rejoin their corps or station after their return to India, will be considered as time counting for service for the retiring pension.\n\n30. No furlough or leave of absence, as announced in General Orders, exceeding two years in twenty years' aggregate service, three years in twenty-five years' service, and four years in thirty years' service, shall be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension; and no difference will be made in this respect between leave of absence taken in Europe or elsewhere, in or out of India, or whether the leave be on sick certificate or on private affairs.\n\n31. In the term \"Leave of Absence as announced in General Orders,\" is to be included all leave of absence, except the period allowed in Rule 29, and the ordinary indulgence of one month's leave in six months, as authorized by the existing regulations, and which are, in all cases, whether of regimental or staff officers, to be allowed to count as service for the pension. All leave to a greater extent, granted by political and other authorities, which may not hitherto have been published in General Orders, must be so announced hereafter.\n\n32. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of their regimental rank (under the regulations of 1796), must have served twenty-two years in India, out of which leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension.\n\n33. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of captains and majors (under the regulations of 1855-37) must have served twenty and twenty-four years respectively; out of which time leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more will be allowed to count as service.\n\n34. Officers to be entitled to retire as lieutenant-colonels must have served twenty-eight years; out of which leaves of absence for three years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n35. Officers to be entitled to retire as colonels must have served thirty-two years; out of which leaves of absence for four years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n36. The scale for medical officers and veterinary surgeons of privileged furlough and leave of absence as counting for the retiring pension, will be as follows:\n\n| Years, Months |\n|--------------|\n| 1            | 8 in 17 & under 20 years' service |\n| 2            | 0 in 20 \" 25 \" |\n| 3            | 0 in 25 \" 30 \" |\n| 4            | 0 in 30 \" 35 \" |\n| 5            | 0 in 35 \" 38 \" |\n| 6            | 0 in 35 years' service |\n\n37. It is to be distinctly understood, that under no circumstances whatever will an officer be permitted to retire on full pay until he has completed the full time of service above specified, whether he be in England at the close of his service or elsewhere.\n\n38. The privileged time of absence may, with the permission of the local government, be taken at any time, subject to these regulations. If, therefore, at the end of twenty years' service, of which eighteen had been passed on actual duty in India, an officer should be on furlough or sick certificate in Europe or elsewhere, he will be entitled to retire on the full pay of a captain without returning to India, and in the other terms of service for the higher pensions. In like manner, a medical officer on furlough or sick certificate, in Europe or elsewhere, at the end of seventeen years' service, fifteen years and four months of which have been passed on actual duty in India, will be entitled to retire on the lowest rate pension, without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pension.\n\n39. These rules do not in any way affect the existing regulations regarding the grant of leave in India, or for short periods to sea, whether on private affairs or on sick certificate, except as to the periods of such absence being taken into calculation in the time allowed to count as service for retirement on full pay.\n\nINDIAN MILITARY FURLOUGH RULES OF 1868.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\nThe following General Order by the Government of India, dated 25th February, 1874, No. 171, is republished:\n\n\"No. 171 of 1874.\u2014The Furlough Rules of 1868, as revised by various subsequent decisions, are republished for general information; and in future this General Order shall ordinarily be referred to in any matter depending on those rules. The rules previously in force will be designated, as heretofore, the Furlough Rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nThe following G. G. O. are cancelled prospectively from the 1st January, 1875:\n\nG. G. O. No. 650 of 1869 (1st clause).\nG. G. O. No. 627 of 1870.\nG. G. O. No. 618 of 1871.\n\n2. These rules are applicable to all officers who, on the 1st July, 1868, belonged to the several Indian Staff Corps, or to the Indian Army, and who have elected, or may elect, to adopt them; officers of the British Army who entered the Staff Corps after that date are of course subject to them.\n\nRules apply to Officers of Staff Corps and Indian Army.\n\nIn regard to the periods of leave of absence during which appointments may be held, and in regard to the increased allowances they are also applicable to officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, late of the Indian Army, holding permanent staff appointments not of a regimental nature, and to such officers of the Engineers of the Imperial Establishment as may be permanently employed on the staff in India.\n\nBut should an officer of the British Service, holding such permanent staff appointment, be allowed to proceed on leave under circumstances which, by these rules, would involve loss of appointment, he cannot take leave under them, but simply as a British Officer holding no appointment.\n\n3. These rules are not applicable to officers on the Invalid or Invalid Pension Establishment, even if previous to their transfer they should have elected them, being intended solely for officers on the effective list.\n\nDo not apply to Invalid Officers.\n\n4. They are not applicable to Regimental Officers generally of the British Service, whether formerly belonging to the Indian Army, and now in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and new Line Regiments, or on the old Line Establishment; nor are they applicable to officers of the British Army holding staff appointments the tenure of which is limited to five years, except in the sense in which the rules of 1854 were made applicable, viz., as regulating the amount of absentee allowance to be granted to such officers holding staff appointments, when they are absent on furlough on medical certificate.\nDo not apply to Officers of the British Medical Staff.\n\n5. They are applicable to Officers of the Royal Engineers on the Imperial list, holding permanent non-regimental staff appointments.\n\nThese officers, therefore, and other Royal Engineer Officers of the Imperial list on permanent staff employ under the Government, will be entitled to a furlough of two years after eight years' service in India, or at the expiration of one year from the date of their return (for a second tour of service in India) on the completion of the prescribed home service after the first period of seven years' service in India.\n\nThe English rate of pay of his rank only will be passed to such an officer during this leave; but on his return to India for a second tour of service the difference between that pay and \"Furlough Pay\" will be admitted to him; and if he should not return to India, his passage money to England will be paid to him.\n\nPay allowed them during furlough.\n\nRoyal Engineer Officers on the Imperial Establishment, who are merely doing duty with, or attached to, the Sappers and Miners but not on the fixed establishment and drawing staff salary, will, in regard to these rules, be on the footing of Regimental Officers of the British Service\u2014see preceding paragraph. If, however, they afterwards accept staff employ, they also will count their service for furlough from date of arrival in India.\n\n6. Officers of British Regiments who may join the Staff Corps, can count as service towards furlough all their military service in India, provided that half of it (in no case less than four years) shall have been passed in the Staff Corps. But any leave to England they may have taken during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough already taken. Officers of the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n\n7. These rules apply also to all Warrant Officers holding Veteran or Honorary Commissions, who may elect them; the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of a Commission. They will receive during furlough half their total receipts, calculated as laid down in Rule V., but without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate. Warrant Officers not holding Commissions can obtain furlough under these rules only on medical certificate.\n\nSuch furlough may be for two years with but any extension of such leave (which will not be granted for more than one year in excess of the two years) or any leave taken within less than three years from the date of last return to duty, will be on \"English furlough pay.\" [See Note to para. 9.]\n\n8. Every Warrant Officer who attained warrant rank before the 19th February, 1869, and who has not made his election, will be required, on the first occasion of his applying for leave out of India, to state whether he desires to take the leave under these rules, or under those previously in force applicable to Warrant Officers, viz., G. G. O. Nos. 518 and 531 of 1854, G. G. O. No. 1559 of 1857, and subsequent orders. That election will be considered final.\n\nThose who became Warrant Officers after 19th February, 1869, are subject to these rules, and cannot elect any of the previous rules.\n\nLeave on medical certificate on Indian pay and allowances to places eastward of the Cape, as allowed to Commissioned Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1796 is not in any case admissible to a Warrant Officer.\n\nRules apply to Medical as to other Warrant Officers.\n\n9. The term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and twofold signification, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits specified in paragraph 5 of these rules, converted at the rate of exchange fixed by the Secretary of State for the official year, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English pay under the rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nNote.\u2014Where in these Rules English furlough pay is mentioned as that to which an officer is to be restricted, the rates laid down in paragraph 11 of G. G. O. No. 69, dated 22nd January, 1868, and (for Medical Warrant Officers) paragraph 22 of G. G. O. No. 550 of 1868, are to be understood as intended in the cases of Warrant Officers.\n\nRULES.\n\nI.\u2014The distinction with respect to allowances which has been hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave, is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtaining of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\nII.* Officers can retain their appointments during all leave of absence granted by competent authority. But their pay during such absence will be the same as they would obtain under these rules had this exemption from forfeiture of appointment not been granted.\n\n* As altered by G. G. O. No. 1174 of 1875.\nIII.\u2014The Rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII. of George III., Chapter 52, Section 70; but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the rules now prescribed. Nor do they affect the regulations by which General Officers Commanding Divisions and Brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their Commands.\n\nIV.\u2014Leave of absence will in future be of three kinds, viz.:\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Furlough in or out of India.\nII.\u2014General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, or short leave to sea.\nIII.\u2014Privilege leave.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFurlough.\n\nV.\u2014An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on furlough, will be allowed pay at the rate of 50 per cent. of the salary of his substantive office.\n\nBut an officer in civil employ and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary during the three years prior to his proceeding on furlough, or during his actual service in India should that be less than three years; and the time spent and the allowances drawn during any leave \"other than privilege leave,\" will be omitted in the calculation of average salary.\n\nNo absentee shall in either case draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nThe term \"salary\" will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay, or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances. But in the case of a military officer in civil employ, his acting allowances shall be taken into account as a part of his salary in calculating his furlough pay.\n\n\u00a7 2. An officer absent on furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his furlough, to furlough pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, whatever the salary of the office to which he may be transferred may be.\n\nThis furlough pay will be continued to an officer in military employ after his return to India and until he joins his appointment, provided it is not less than the military pay, or pay and allowances, of his rank.\n\nBut an officer whose term of office shall lapse, who shall vacate his appointment, or whose appointment shall be abolished during his furlough, will revert at once to the furlough pay which he would draw in virtue of his rank, as laid down below, in \u00a7 4. Any case of sudden abolition of appointment may, however, be specially considered in the department of the Government under which the officer may have been employed. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher Staff Corps or regimental rank, whilst on furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers holding regimental medical charges will be allowed to retain such charges during the authorized periods of furlough, as if they were medical staff appointments.\n\nRegimental medical charges retained during furlough.\n\nG. G.O. No. 1060 of 23rd Dec. 1864, para. 25.\n\nG. G. O. No. 370 of 4th April, 1867, para. 9.\n\nThe staff salary how divided.\n\n\u00a7 4. Officers not in staff employ will receive half the Indian pay of their rank, provided that an officer entitled to furlough shall in no case receive less than the above minimum of \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nMinimum furlough pay.\n\nNOTE.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the Military Fund during absence in Europe, will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\nVI.\u2014All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service,\u2014of which exigency the Government is to be exclusively the judge,\u2014and to any regulations that may be found necessary for limiting the number of absences.\n\nNOTE.\u2014It is therefore within the competency of local Governments and of the Commander-in-Chief to declare the application of any officer whose absence would, in their opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the public service, until such time as arrangements can be made for removing the difficulty; and it is the duty of every head of a department to\n\nApplications of officers who cannot be spared need not be forwarded.\n\n* The section referred to is quoted below:\u2014\n\nSection 70.\u2014\"And be it further enacted that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a Member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and who, having departed from India by leave of the Governor-General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or Native Corps of Troops or in the civil line of the Company's Service, unless in the case of any Civil Servant of the Company, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or, unless such person be permitted to return with his rank to India, by a vote or resolution passed by way of ballot by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days' previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any Military Officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\"\ndecline to forward any application for furlough, whenever the services of the officer cannot be spared without risking the efficiency of the department, any doubtful case being referred for the orders of Government.\n\nVII.\u2014The maximum amount of furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time, carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years: any extension of such furlough will be without pay unless it is on medical certificate, see Rule XIII. (But see Notes (3) and (4) Rule IX.) No extension on private affairs beyond two years will be granted, though without pay, except upon satisfactory evidence of very urgent necessity.\n\nVIII.\u2014A period of at least three years' service after return from last furlough, except furlough for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months) must be completed before furlough can again be taken, unless obtained under medical certificate (see Rules XIII. and XIV. and Note 3 of Rule IX.).\n\nThree years' service to intervene between two furloughs.\n\nBut an officer who may be ordered to return to duty before the completion of his furlough for the purpose of proceeding on field service may be allowed to take the balance of such furlough at any time.\n\nException in cases of officers ordered out on field service.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer in civil employ cannot reckon in this interval of three years any period of absence from actual duty, excepting those spent on privilege leave.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer will be eligible for two years' furlough on the completion of eight years' actual service in India (see para. 6 of this order) for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years, and so on, up to the maximum prescribed in Rule XVI. The grant of furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules VI. and VII. But see notes to this Rule.\n\n\u00a7 2.* Leave granted under these Rules, without furlough pay, will not reckon as furlough already taken in calculating the balance at an officer's credit, or as part of the total of eight years allowed as shown in Rule XVI., but all furlough with furlough pay, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, taken under these Rules, will so reckon.\n\n\u00a7 3.* Furlough and leave previously taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, will count, as respects officers who have elected these Rules, as follows:\u2014\n\nFurlough on private affairs, with pay, taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, counts in all respects as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, under the Rules of 1796, does not count in any respect as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, with pay, under the Rules of 1854, counts as part of the maximum of eight years allowed under these Rules, but until the maximum thus made up be reached, this leave will not count as furlough already taken in determining the amount of furlough to which an officer is entitled.\n\nLeave without pay under the Rules either of 1796 or 1854, does not count in any respects as furlough.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer appointed to any duty in England draws his Indian allowances, with or without any portion of his staff salary, he can count the period of such employment as service towards furlough; but if he is appointed to an office in England to which a fixed consolidated salary is attached, he cannot reckon the time of such employment as service towards furlough.\n\nNote (1).\u2014But an officer of less than eight years' service in India may obtain furlough not exceeding two years, on medical certificate, with furlough pay and retention of appointment, provided he has been three years in the Staff Corps, or\u2014in the case of a Royal Engineer officer holding a permanent staff appointment, or an officer not in the Staff Corps\u2014has served for three years in India.\n\nNote (2).\u2014If the officer has not been three years in the Staff Corps, or served three years in India, as the case may be, he will receive \"English furlough pay\" only, and must vacate his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nThis rule and the provisions in Note 1, however, are not applicable to officers of the Indian Army who entered the new Line Regiments, or Royal Artillery, and subsequently the Staff Corps.\n\nNote (3). Unemployed General Officers of the Staff Corps or local service can be granted furlough without serving the intervals of three and six years, respectively, prescribed in Rules VIII. and IX., and they can remain in Europe after they have exhausted the full period of furlough allowed during an officer's service by Rule XVI. (eight years on the whole) on the English furlough pay of their rank.\n\nNote (4).\u2014And a Major-General of the Staff Corps\u2014if he has so much furlough at his credit, and proceeds to England within a year of his being promoted to that rank, or of his ceasing to be employed\u2014can continue, after the expiration of the two years' furlough to receive half his Indian pay until he completes the period of three years during which he would be entitled to draw his Staff Corps pay if he were in India.\n\nX.\u2014An officer eligible for furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of furlough for which he may be eligible.\n\nIllustrations.\n\n1. An officer who has served nine years in India is entitled to two years' furlough: he takes only one year, and after his return remains in India for five years.\n\n| Total service in India | 14 years |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| Furlough due on that service | 3 years |\n| Furlough already taken | 1 year |\n| Balance for which he is eligible | 2 years |\n\n*As modified in G. G. O. No. 197 of 1st March, 1877.*\n2. An officer who has served 20 years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer is said to have furlough at his credit,\u2014even though he may not be able to obtain it owing to the number of absentees, or other causes,\u2014when the calculation of his service, as in illustration I above, shows a \"balance for which he is eligible.\"\n\n* XI.\u2014Furlough on urgent private affairs for six months on pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, may be granted when the officer has less than six months' furlough at his credit, or when from other causes, e.g., the number of absentees, or his not having served three years since his last return to duty, he is not able to take it. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule IX., and also\u2014except in the case of an officer in civil employ, see Rule VIII. note\u2014of the three years which are required to intervene between two periods of furlough by Rule VIII.\n\nThis leave cannot be given in extension of furlough of any description. It cannot be extended beyond six months unless on medical certificate and on the same pay; in which case the officer will be deemed to have vacated his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.; the whole period will be reckoned in the maximum amount of furlough (8 years) allowed by Rule XVI., and no portion of it can form any part of the periods referred to in Rules VIII. and IX.\n\nNote.\u2014Ill-health is not considered as warranting furlough under this rule to any officer who under the provisions of these rules can obtain furlough on medical certificate without forfeiting his appointment.\n\nXII.\u2014Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during furlough. But, if he desires to spend in England the rest of a \"furlough in India,\" or vice versa, he must obtain permission to do so from the Government of his Presidency, or from the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be; and on landing in either country, he must report his arrival accordingly to the Military Department of his own Presidency, or to the India Office, forwarding a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination. He must also communicate his address. An officer who, on his return to India, reports his debarkation, without forwarding at once a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination, or submitting an application for such permission, will be considered to have returned to his duty.\n\nXIII.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate is obtainable as indicated in Notes (1) and (2) of Rule IX., and in Rule XIV. Absence on such furlough for a longer period than two years at one time will involve forfeiture of appointment. [But see exceptions in Rule II.] Furlough may, however, be extended on medical certificate up to a third year on \"English furlough pay;\" and an officer on furlough on private affairs, who may be obliged to obtain an extension on medical certificate, will be thenceforward entitled to the same advantages, and subjected to the same disadvantages as to retention of appointment, pay, &c., as if he had originally obtained furlough on medical certificate.\n\nIf he exceeds three years' absence on medical certificate, the officer may have to retire or go on half-pay.\n\nExtension on medical certificate over three years to be without pay.\n\nOfficers on medical certificate must be pronounced fit for duty before returning to India.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer whose health may necessitate his taking furlough within three years from the date of last return from any furlough except that taken for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer on civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months), may obtain under the usual medical certificate, such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health; but he will receive only \"English furlough pay,\" and must vacate any appointment he may be holding, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\n\u00a7 2. If, however, he shall have served three years since the date of his last return to duty, although there may be no balance of furlough at his credit, he will be entitled, on obtaining furlough on medical certificate, to retain his appointment and to receive \"furlough pay,\" as laid down in Rule V., for the entire period not exceeding two years. Should the latter period be exceeded, he will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer entitled to furlough, or having a balance of furlough at his credit, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, must take the leave as furlough under Rule IX., but without forfeiting any passage-money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules,\u2014or, if a Subaltern, by Regulation, when proceeding on medical certificate.\n\n\u00a7 2. Should the officer be declared fit for duty before the expiration of two years, he may be granted extension on private affairs up to that limit, provided that he has so much at his credit, and that if he remains he will not be in excess of the established proportion of absentees. Any extension on private affairs of such furlough beyond the said period of two years, must be without pay.\n\n* As modified in G. G. O. No. 922, of 31 Aug., 1876.\n\u00a7 3. Any extension on medical certificate of furlough under \u00a7 1 of this rule beyond two years or any lesser period which may be at his credit under Rules IX. and X. will be regarded, in all respects, as furlough on medical certificate (Rule XIII.); and if the period of two years should not exhaust the balance of furlough at his credit under Rule X., the period or periods of extension shall be deducted from such balance till the latter is exhausted. On the aggregate of two years' leave being exceeded, the officer will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nTotal furlough with pay, &c., in an officer's service limited to eight years.\n\nFurlough not reckoned in this period.\n\n\u00a7 1.\u2014Leave without pay.\n\n\u00a7 2.\u2014Sick leave to Europe, or to the Colonies eastward of Cape under the Rules of 1796.\n\n\u00a7 3.\u2014Leave taken under Rule XI. of these Rules, provided it be not extended over the six months. If it be so extended, the whole period will reckon as part of the eight years.\n\n\u00a7 4.\u2014Leave necessitated by wounds or sickness contracted on active service, and any other leave which may be allowed by proper authority to reckon as service for pension.\n\n\u00a7 5.\u2014In the case of an unemployed officer, periods of residence in England on English pay after promotion to the rank of Major General, or to the rank of Regimental Colonel in the Royal (late Indian) Artillery and Engineers, or after completion of tour of service as Inspector General or Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, when the officer is no longer required to reside in India.\n\nAll other leave to Europe, or out of India for periods exceeding three months (see Rule XXVII.), including furlough on medical certificate under the Furlough Rules of 1854, will form part of the period of eight years.\n\nXVI.\u2014The aggregate amount of furlough with pay and retention of appointment, on private affairs and on medical certificate, that may be granted to an officer during his service will be limited to eight years.\n\nNote.\u2014The following periods of leave, however, will not be reckoned in this period of eight years:\n\nDate from and to which furlough is reckoned.\n\nof the vessel's leaving the Sandheads if from Calcutta) and that of disembarkation also, are included in the furlough.\n\nNote (1).\u2014As an illustration of this rule, it may be observed that a Madras officer's landing and reporting himself at Madras, en route to Calcutta to join his appointment in Bengal or the North-Western Provinces, &c., is not disembarkation in the sense intended by this rule.\n\nNote 2).\u2014To enable an officer who overstays his leave to obtain an extension, he should show that he took all needful precautions to insure his arrival in proper time, and if delayed by the departure of the vessel being deferred, he should obtain the certificate of the owner or agent that she had been bona fide advertised to sail from \u2014\u2014\u2014 on the \u2014\u2014\u2014 but that her departure had been delayed till the \u2014\u2014\u2014 See General Order No. 52, dated 21st February, 1873.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Preparatory leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere on furlough will be granted for any period deemed necessary, not ordinarily exceeding 30 days. Leave up to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date succeeding that of his disembarkation in India.\n\nThis applies equally to furloughs taken under Rule XI. The authority which has power to grant preparatory leave can, on due cause being shown, grant any necessary extension of it, but this can be done only on very sufficient reasons.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer obtaining a furlough on private affairs or medical certificate must embark within three months of the date of the General Order which notifies it, or take up the first portion of his furlough in India until he embarks; if not, the General Order will cease to have effect. The only exception to this rule that can be allowed is when the officer is prevented from embarking within the three months owing to his detention in India by proper authority on bona fide public grounds.\n\nIf, however, the officer does not, within a reasonable time, avail himself of the furlough given him, his subsequently being placed on duty rendering his detention necessary will not exempt him from the rule; and in every case of such detention the officer must at once report it, and he is not to embark after the expiration of three months until he has applied for and obtained from the Government of his Presidency an extension of the period.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Officers who may be serving in other Presidencies than their own, if they desire to embark bona fide for Europe from the latter, may obtain preparatory leave accordingly, and their furlough will reckon from the date of their embarkation at their own Presidencies.\n\nNote (3).\u2014For full information as to the submission of applications for furlough, see G. G. O. No. 34, of 11th January 1869; G. G. O. No. 103, dated 26th January 1869; General Order by the Commander-in-Chief, No. 135, dated 11 June 1870.*\n\nApplication for furlough, how submitted.\n\nNote (4).\u2014The allowances of Military officers in civil employ during preparatory leave, and after return to India until they rejoin their appointments, will be adjusted according to Civil Rules.\n\nLeave preparatory to retirement.\n\nPay issued monthly in India, quarterly in England.\n\nNote (5).\u2014Leave preparatory to retirement from the service does not reckon as service towards pension.\n\nXIX.\u2014Furlough allowances are payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\n* See also Bombay G. O. C. 269 of 1878\nXX.\u2014Advances of furlough pay will continue to be made in India to those officers who desire it for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of six months from that date. No advance is made in England to officers on their returning to duty.\n\nXXI.\u2014The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule V.\n\nXXII.*\u2014An officer acting in India for an absentee on furlough will be restricted, for the entire period that he may so act, to the half staff salary of the appointment in which he may be acting, in addition to the full pay of his rank, and the half staff salary of his own appointment, if he possess one. The aggregate staff salary granted to an acting officer in such cases will not be less than Rs. 100 per mensem, unless the full staff salary of the post in which he is officiating is less than that sum.\n\nPay of Warrant Officers acting for others on furlough.\n\n\u2020 Note.\u2014The indulgence granted by section 1 of this rule is only allowed to one directly officiating in the place of the officer absent on furlough, not to one acting in the room of an officer who is himself acting for an absentee on furlough.\n\nPeriods of furlough, &c., counting as service towards pension.\n\n| Years | Years |\n|-------|-------|\n| 2     | 20    |\n| 3     | 25    |\n| 4     | 30    |\n| 5     | 35    |\n| 6     | 38    |\n\nPeriods of furlough reckoned by Warrant Officers towards pension.\n\n| Years | Months |\n|-------|--------|\n| 15    |        |\n| 12    |        |\n\nThose who were promoted to warrant rank before that date, are allowed to continue if they prefer it, on the old rule, and reckon all leave in India as service, all out of India being deducted from their service, for pension.\n\nIllustration of the mode of computing service for pension in any case.\n\nTotal service from date of arrival in India, say.................................................. 90 years.\n\nLeave\u2014\n\nIn Europe, say........................................................................................................... 6\n\nIn India..................................................................................................................... 3\n\nOf which he can reckon.............................................................................................. 7\n\nRemaining to be deducted............................................................................................ 10\n\nService counting for Pension......................................................................................... 4\n\nXXIV.\u2014In computing the furlough on private affairs to which an officer who has already enjoyed some portion of such furlough will be entitled, under these rules, it will be necessary to deduct the total amount of the furlough on private affairs of which he may have availed himself during his service from the total periods to which under Rule IX. he can lay claim. The balance within the limit of eight years' total furlough on private affairs and medical certificate laid down in Rule XVI., will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty.\n\nIllustration.\n\n(1).\u2014An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns to India on the date on which this order is promulgated. He accepts its conditions and serves four years longer in India. On the expiration of that term, he can take one year's furlough, thus\u2014\n\nTotal service in India.................................................................................................. 14 years\n\nLeave to which that service entitles him....................................................................... 3\n\nAlready enjoyed........................................................................................................... 2\n\nBalance....................................................................................................................... 1 year.\n\n(2).\u2014An officer of four years' service has proceeded on sick certificate to England for 20 months, extended afterwards to two years. He returns, serves six years in India, takes two years' furlough, and returns to India about the time of the promulgation of these rules, which he accepts. He must serve four years before he can take an additional year's furlough, thus\u2014\n\nTotal service up to return from furlough..................................................................... 14 years.\n\nTotal service in India.................................................................................................. 10\n\nFurlough enjoyed on that service.................................................................................. 2\n\nFurther period of service to entitle him to one year's furlough..................................... 4 years.\n\n* As modified in G.G.O. 585 of 1874.\n\u2020 Added by G.G.O. No. 585 of 1874.\n\u2021 Medical Officers also count 1 year and 8 months in 17 years' service (G.G.O. 305 of 1874).\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGeneral Leave on Private Affairs and Sick Certificate in India.\n\nXXV.\u2014An officer will be eligible, as at present, to take leave on private affairs or sick certificate anywhere in India for any period not exceeding six months, at the discretion of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief or of the Government under which he may be serving. During the entire period of his absence on this account the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively the officer will lose his staff appointment unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a Medical Board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in his entire period of service, but will not be regarded as furlough, nor will it affect the intervals entitling to furlough laid down in Rule IX. During this leave the absentee will draw a moiety of his staff salary in addition to the pay of his rank. But if the 12 months be exceeded, the whole leave must be reckoned as furlough, and allowances be adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Short leave, not exceeding three months, on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be taken to sea, on the above condition, but absence from India for any longer period will be treated as furlough.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014All general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXXIX.\u2014Privilege leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General leave, in extension of privilege leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\nXXX.\u2014In the case of the stations noted in the margin, privilege leave may, as at present, be granted for ninety days to officers of local Corps, or of Corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\nAssam. Khairwara. Dera Ghazee Khan.\nShillong. Khotra. Rajampore.\nErinpoora. Bunnoo. Jacobabad.\nDeolee. Dera Ismael Khan.\n\nXXXI.\u2014An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on privilege leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\nXXXII.\u2014Privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on privilege leave, the privilege leave will be converted into general leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMilitary Officers in Civil Employ.\n\nXXXIII.\u2014Those Military Officers (including Warrant Officers who hold Honorary, Veteran, or Unattached Commissions) in Civil or Political employ who may elect these rules when they take leave in India, come, as respect periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted, under the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules.\n\nFor preparatory or subsidiary leave, see Note (4) of Rule XVIII.\n\nSubsidiary Rule.\n\nXXXIV.\u2014Officers of the Indian Military and Medical services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made.\n\n\u00a7 2. Officers going home under these Rules will pay English rates of subscription only to the Military Fund.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers who may determine to abide by existing Rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII., VIII., and XIII. to the extent to which they may be entitled under the Furlough Regulations of 1854, or of 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV. must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer under the Furlough Rules of 1796 elects the present Rules, his service for pension will...\nPrevious service of officers under 1796 Rules how reckoned.\n\nLeave out of Indian limits taken previous to 1st July, 1868, and not then having elected the Rules of 1868, will not affect the case. All periods of leave taken subsequent to that date, according to the length of his service counting for pension, as shown in Rule XXIII.\n\nRetirement under 1796 Rules not affected.\n\nHis election of these Furlough Rules in no way affects his right to retire under the Pension Rules of 1796.\n\nFURLOUGH AND LEAVE RULES.\n\n30th December, 1875.\n\nNo. 1,316 of 1875.\u2014Under instructions from Her Majesty's Government, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to publish the following revised Furlough and Leave Rules applicable to the Staff Corps and Indian Local and Medical Services.\n\n1. Officers included in Schedule A may receive, after five years' service in India or under the Government of India, one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these rules, be taken later.\n\n2. An Officer may receive at any time any portion of the furlough to which he is entitled; but, except under Rule 8, he may not be absent from duty on any ground for more than three years consecutively; nor, on return from furlough, may he receive, except under Rule 6, any further portion of the furlough to which he is entitled until after the interval of two years.\n\n3. It must be distinctly understood that furlough is subject to the exigencies of the public service. Officers commanding regiments, and Heads of Departments, will forward no application for furlough unless able to satisfy the superior authorities that the Officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\n4. Furlough does not involve forfeiture of appointment, may be spent anywhere, and counts as service for pension.\n\n5.* A commissioned Officer on furlough receives (up to, but not beyond, the sum of \u00a31,000 a year) half the emoluments of his office, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State; but in any case he does not receive less than \u00a3250 a year. The emoluments of his office include all pay, staff corps pay, staff salary, and Indian allowances he would receive in respect to it if he were on duty, and for the purpose of each payment his office is the office he fills on the day when that payment becomes due. A Warrant Officer receives half the emoluments of his office, calculated in the same manner as those of Commissioned Officers, no Warrant Officer, however, receiving as furlough pay less than the English furlough pay of his rank.\n\n6. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years; but such furlough will be deducted from his next accruing furlough until it is paid off. An Officer will not be allowed to anticipate furlough under this rule to an aggregate amount to more than two years.\n\n\u2020 An Officer of less than two years' service from date of coming under the new rules, falling sick, will be sent to England on medical certificate, on English furlough pay, subject to the decision of her Majesty's Government as to his ultimate disposal; a special report on each case being submitted to her Majesty's Government by the Government of India, or in the case of Officers of the Madras or Bombay army by the Government of those presidencies.\n\n\u2020 Furlough on medical certificate under this rule does not count as service for pension until it has been paid off as provided for in the rule.\n\n7. An Officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be placed temporarily or permanently on half-pay, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\n8. Under very urgent circumstances special furlough may be granted for private affairs, which need not be paid back; but it will be in all cases without any kind of pay, and will not count for pension.\n\n\u2020 The amount of leave which may be granted under this rule will be restricted to such period as the Government granting it is satisfied is actually necessary with reference to the urgency of the case.\n\n9. Advances for passage money, on need shown, will be granted to Officers on furlough, to be recovered in manner specified at the time of the grant, in India, at the discretion of the Local Government; and in England, at the discretion of the Secretary of State.\n\n10. Leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, and may not, except for very urgent reasons, be specially reported to the Government of India, be renewed till after six months have elapsed from its expiration. It must be spent at some place east of the 90th degree of east longitude. Subject to these conditions, it may be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the local authorities, who in granting it shall fix its duration, and may fix the limits within which it shall be spent, and whether during its continuance half-pay and allowances are to be deducted for the payment of a substitute; and they may grant it as preparatory to furlough, or for the purpose of a medical examination. Leave counts as service for pension and furlough. Thelocal authorities shall be defined for the purpose of this rule by the Government of India.\n\n11. Leave and furlough are reckoned from and to the close of the days named in the order granting them.\n\n12. The position of Officers not included in Schedule A will be unchanged as respects leave or furlough.\n\n13. Officers now in the service placing themselves, from a given date, under these rules, shall count service for pension up to that date under the rules to which they were then subject.\n\n\u2020 An officer takes with him so much service for pension as he had become entitled to under former rules. Under the rules of 1854 and 1868, two years' leave in twenty years' service counts for pension, but in periods of less than twenty years no leave counts. Therefore, if an officer now under the rules of 1854-1868, of twenty years' service, with two years' leave, elects the present rules, his service for pension will be twenty years; if an officer of nineteen years' service, with the same amount of leave, elects these rules, his service for pension will be seventeen years only.\n\n* As modified by G.G.O. No. 440 of 11 May, 1877.\n\u2020 Rulings contained in G.G.O. No. 1,120 of 27 Oct., 1876.\n\u2021 Ruling contained in G.G.O. No. 480 of 25 May, 1877.\nOfficers entering the Staff Corps or Indian Medical Service, and Warrant Officers attaining that rank, after the 31st December, 1875; and\n\nAny other officers, Commissioned or Warrant, belonging to the Indian Army or Medical Service, or Officers of the Staff Corps, who, after the 31st of December, 1875, shall, before asking for leave or furlough, apply in writing to their Local Governments to be placed definitively upon this Schedule; but their service for furlough under Rule 1 shall commence from the date of such entry into such application respectively.\n\n\u2020 The date of entry into the Staff Corps is that of entry for choice of furlough rules, viz., the date on which the Officer was originally appointed on probation. An Officer, therefore, whose date of admission to the Staff Corps is not after the 31st December, 1875, will have the choice of rules, but an Officer whose date of admission is after that date will have no option.\n\n\u2021 An Officer coming on this schedule, having furlough to his credit under previous rules, forfeits such furlough absolutely, he being required to serve five years from date of applying to be placed on the schedule before he can take one year's furlough, unless it be sick furlough under Rule 6. An Officer similarly circumstanced, but having furlough to his debit, is equally with the others entitled to take one year's furlough five years after joining the new rules.\n\nAny Officers in civil employment declared by the Government of India to be under civil leave rules shall not be under these rules.\n\n** The last pay certificate issued to an Officer to whom furlough or leave has been granted shall state the pay to which, under Rule 5, he is at that date entitled in respect to the office he is holding, noticing the date, if any fixed, at which he will vacate it.\n\nWith advertence to the foregoing rules, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify\u2014\n\nI. That no \"extra or special allowances\" drawn by an officer, which are now excluded from the account in calculating furlough pay under the Rules of 1868, can be reckoned in calculating furlough pay under these Rules (Rule 5).\n\nII. That the Governments of the three Presidencies, or their Excellencies the Commanders-in-Chief, in regard to Officers serving directly under them, shall be held to be the \"local authorities\" named in Rule 10.\n\nIII. That, pending further orders, a Staff Officer granted leave under Rule 10 shall receive, as heretofore, the pay or staff corps pay of his rank, and half the staff salary of his appointment during such leave; but full staff salary may be allowed him for the first two months (as now during privilege leave), when he makes approved arrangements for the performance of his duties during that period. In such cases the Government Officer granting the leave must state that the first two months are to be on full staff pay.\n\nN.B.\u2014It is distinctly to be understood that the rule regarding the pay to be drawn on leave under para. 10 is liable to be modified at any time in any way that the Government of India may deem expedient.\n\nIV.
