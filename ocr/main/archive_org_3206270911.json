Neither shot took effect. Mr. Roberts then attacked the man with his sword and wounded him in several places; but he managed to escape by the back door.\n\nCHOKED BY A PIECE OF BEEF.\u2014Mr. Carttar held an inquest at the Merry Cricketers, Lower-road, Deptford, on Monday, on the body of Benjamin Bean Ling, aged five years, son of George Ling, bootmaker, of 270, Lower-road. On Saturday, at dinner time, the boy's mother placed a piece of beef in his plate, intending, as usual, to cut it into small pieces, but whilst she turned to place a kettle upon the fire, he cut off a piece of beef in his plate, and choked in attempting to swallow it. His father gave him some water, and put his finger down his throat, but could not reach it. The boy turned black in the face, and was laid on a bed, and Dr. Farraker, of Plough-road, Rotherhithe, was sent for, and arrived in about five minutes, when he pronounced the boy dead. The jury returned a verdict \"That deceased was accidentally choked whilst attempting to swallow a piece of beef.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206270911.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1844, "total-output-tokens": 340, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1293, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
