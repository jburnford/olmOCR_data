This discovery was nothing less than a machine formed on the model of Fi\u00e8shi's murderous engine. It is described as composed of fourteen barrels, each from three to four feet long, made of cast iron, and capable of containing each about twenty musket bullets. The ends of these barrels are said to be so skilfully stopped as, according to the armourer who examined them, to render their firing in a wrong direction utterly impossible.\n\nIt is said that the police found fourteen men in the house, and some of them actually at work at the machine, which was very nearly completed. They were arrested, and, after some examination, taken to the prefecture, where they arrived at a little before nine o'clock. In consequence of further information ten men more have been since taken into custody; these last were not in the house when first visited by the police; they were arrested in their respective domiciles. The details of the affair are not yet known with any degree of certainty. Rumours of a conflicting nature are in circulation as to the political character of the parties engaged in this affair. Probably they ought not to be comprised in any.\n\nPARIS, FRIDAY EVENING.\n\nThe general impression now, respecting the alleged conspiracy is that it is greatly exaggerated by the Patrie. The Constitutionnel, in fact, admits it to be so, and says that the only things discovered were some firearms. At the Bourse the whole affair has been treated as a mere attempt on the part of M. de Maupas to increase his own importance.\n\nAMERICA.\n\nThe Hermann steamer has arrived with papers from New York of the 19th ult. The latest accounts of the ballot for president by the Whig National Convention at Baltimore give the numbers as follows:\u2014General Scott, 134; Fillmore, 128; and Webster, 30.\n\nAn arrival from Honduras stated that the island of Ruatan, with five other islands dependent on Honduras Bay, had refused to acknowledge British authority, and claimed the protection of the independent state of Honduras, which had been granted to them. Everything was represented as being in a state of rebellion.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206200618.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 541, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2336, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
