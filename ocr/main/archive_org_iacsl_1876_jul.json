At this examination not fewer than Candidates will be selected, if so many shall be found duly qualified. Of these, will be selected for the Presidency of Bengal (for the Upper Provinces, and for that of Madras, and for that of Bombay.)\u2014Notice will hereafter be given of the days and place of examination.\n\n2. Any person desirous of competing at this examination must produce to the Civil Service Commissioners, before the 1st of February, 1876, evidence showing:\n\n(a) That he is a natural born subject of Her Majesty;\n(b) That his age on the 1st March, 1876, will be above seventeen years and under twenty-one years. N.B.\u2014In the case of Natives of India this must be certified by the Government of India, or of the Presidency or Province in which the Candidate may have resided;\n(c) That he has no disease, constitutional affection, or bodily infirmity, unfitting him, or likely to unfit him, for the Civil Service of India; \u2020\n(d) That he is of good moral character; he must also pay such fee as the Secretary of State for India may prescribe.\u00a7\n\n3. Should the evidence upon the above points be prima facie satisfactory to the Civil Service Commissioners, the Candidate will, upon payment of the prescribed fee be admitted to the examination. The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary; and if the result of such inquiries, in the case of any Candidate should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India, and if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4. The examination will take place only in the following branches of knowledge:\n\n| Branches of Knowledge | Marks |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| English Composition   | 500   |\n| History of England\u2014 including that of the Laws and Constitution | 500 |\n| English Language and Literature | 500 |\n| Language, Literature, and History of Greece | 750 |\n| Language, Literature and History of Rome | 750 |\n| Ditto France | 375 |\n| Ditto Germany | 375 |\n| Ditto Italy | 375 |\n| Mathematics (pure and mixed) | 1250 |\n| Natural Science; that is, (1) Chemistry, including heat, (2) Electricity and Magnetism, (3) Geology and Mineralogy, (4) Zoology, (5) Botany | 1000 |\n\n**The total (1000) marks may be obtained by adequate proficiency in any two or more of the five branches of science included under this head.\n\nMoral Sciences; that is, Logic, Mental and Moral Philosophy | 500 |\nSanskrit Language and Literature | 500 |\nArabic Language and Literature | 500 |\n\nCandidates are at liberty to name, before Feb. 1, 1876, any or all of these branches of knowledge.

The merit of the persons examined will be estimated by marks, and the number set opposite to each branch in the preceding regulation denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it.\n\n6. No Candidate will be allowed any marks in respect of any subject of examination, unless he shall be considered to possess a competent knowledge of that subject.\n\n7. The examination will be conducted by means of printed questions and written answers, and by viv\u00e2 voce examination, as may be deemed necessary.\n\n8. The marks obtained by each Candidate in respect of each of the subjects in which he shall have been examined will be added up, and the names of the Candidates who shall have obtained a greater aggregate number of marks than any of the remaining Candidates will be set forth in order of merit; and such Candidates shall be deemed to be selected Candidates for the Civil Service of India, provided they appear to be in other respects duly qualified.\n\nShould any of the selected Candidates\u2014\n\n\u2020 \"Nothing can be further from our wish than to hold out premiums for knowledge of wide surface and of small depth. We are of opinion that a Candidate ought to be allowed no credit at all for taking up a subject in which he is a mere smatterer.\"\u2014Report of Committee of 1854. A deduction of marks will be made under each subject, including Mathematics.\n\n* The Regulations are liable to be altered in future years.\n\u2020 The number of appointments to be made, and the number in each Presidency, &c., will be announced hereafter.\n\u2021 Evidence of health and character must bear date not earlier than the 1st January, 1876.\n\u00a7 The fee for this examination will be \u00a35, payable by means of a special stamp according to instructions which will be communicated to Candidates.\nbecome disqualified, the Secretary of State for India will determine whether the vacancy thus created shall be filled up or not. In the former case, the Candidate next in order of merit and in other respects duly qualified shall be deemed to be a selected Candidate. A selected Candidate declining to accept the appointment which may be offered to him will be disqualified for any subsequent competition.\n\n9. Selected Candidates, before proceeding to India, will be on probation for two years, during which time they will be examined periodically, with a view of testing their progress, in the following subjects*:\n\n(1) Oriental Languages:\u2014 Marks.\n   Sanskrit ... ... ... 500\n   Vernacular \u2020 Languages of India (each) ... ... 400\n\n(2) The History and Geography of India ... ... 350\n\n(3) Law ... ... ... 1250\n\n(4) Political Economy ... ... 350\n\nIn these examinations, as in the open competition, the merit of the Candidates examined will be estimated by marks, and the number set opposite to each subject denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it at any one examination. The examination will be conducted by means of printed questions and written answers, and by viv\u0101 voce examination, as may be deemed necessary.

The allowances of these Officers, while on furlough or subsidiary leave, shall not exceed half their salaries, and shall be limited also to the rate prescribed in Rule 11.\n\n2. With reference to Rule 22, the pensions to which these Officers are entitled under medical certificate after nine years' service shall be due after eight years and eight months' actual service; and the pensions to which they are in like manner entitled after seven years' service shall be due after six years and nine months' actual service.\n\nThe following Notification is also published, for general information and guidance:\n\n**NOTIFICATION No. 3,070.**\n\nA question having been raised as to whether the Resolution of the Financial Department, No. 101, dated the 24th April, 1869, and published at page No. 917 of the \"Gazette of India\" of 1st May, 1869, on the subject of privilege leave, is applicable to Judges of Her Majesty's High Courts of Judicature, the Governor General in Council observes that privilege leave to these and certain other officers, under the Rules recently prescribed, differs from ordinary privilege leave, in that no Judge of a High Court is held entitled to such leave, unless Government be satisfied that there is an urgent necessity for it. Leave under Chapter II. of the Rules in question is therefore rather in the nature of short leave on urgent private affairs, while vacation takes the place of privilege leave.\n\nOn these considerations, His Excellency in Council is pleased to declare that the Resolution above quoted shall not be held to apply to Judges of Her Majesty's High Courts of Judicature, or to the other Officers to whom the Rules governing the leave of those Judges have been declared applicable.\n\n**NOTIFICATION No. 3,486.**\n\nWith reference to the Notification of this Department, No. 3,070, dated the 2d instant, published at page 255 of the \"Gazette of India,\" the Governor General in Council is pleased to explain that the Resolution No. 101, dated 24th April, 1869, shall not be held to apply to any High Court Judge or other Judicial Officer to whom the new Rules governing the leave of High Court Judges have been declared applicable, even though, under Rule 23 of those Rules, he may elect to abide by former Rules. Whatever Rules any of these Officers may elect, privilege leave will not be granted to him except on urgent necessity being shown, since all of them have equally the benefit of vacation.\n\nHis Excellency in Council is further pleased to declare that the only exception will be the Secretary to the Council of the Governor General for making Laws and Regulations, since this Officer does not enjoy vacations. He will therefore be exempted from showing urgent necessity for privilege leave, but the Resolution No. 101, dated 24th April, 1869, will be applicable to him.\n\n**RULES REGARDING LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO CHAPLAINS.**\n\n**DEFINITIONS.**\n\n1. In the following rules, \"Actual Service\" includes the period during which a Chaplain is on duty, also periods spent on privilege and subsidiary leave, and periods during which a Chaplain not on leave may be out of employ in India.\n\n\"Extraordinary Leave\" means any leave granted otherwise than under these rules.\n\n\"Long Extraordinary Leave\" means extraordinary leave extending beyond a period of three months.\n\n\"Long Furlough\" means furlough extending beyond a period of three months.\n\n\"Salary\" includes acting allowances.\n\nA Chaplain's \"Station\" means that station to which he stands appointed, or such other place as the Government to which he is subordinate may determine.\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFURLough.\n\n2.

The maximum term of furlough to be taken at any one time shall be two years.\n\n7.\u2020 Except under Rule 8, a Chaplain when on furlough shall be granted allowances at the rates noted in the margin.\n\n8. Under medical certificate\u2014\n\n(a) Furlough may be taken on the above conditions, without reference to the amount at credit under Rule 3.\n\n(b)\u2020 Furlough for a period not exceeding one year may be taken, even if less than three years have elapsed since the last return from long extraordinary leave or long furlough. When on furlough under this clause, a Chaplain shall be entitled to only the allowances noted in the margin, unless he has completed six months actual service since his last return from long extraordinary leave, or long furlough, and there remains some leave to his credit under Rule 3, in which case a Chaplain shall draw the full allowances mentioned in Rule 7, until that credit be exhausted, but in no case for a period exceeding one year.\n\n(c) Furlough taken without medical certificate, or under clause (a) of this rule, may be extended beyond two years for a period not exceeding one year. During the period of extension of furlough beyond two years under this clause, a Chaplain shall be entitled to the allowances mentioned in the margin of Rule 7 (b).\n\n9. Furlough taken or extended under Rule 8 shall be subject to the provision of Rule 2.\n\n10. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date of the Chaplain quitting his station to the date of his return thereto. Furlough taken out of India shall be reckoned from the date of embarkation to the date of return.\n\nIn the event of the furlough being taken partly in India and partly out of India, the commencement and termination of the furlough shall be determined by the above rules, according as the furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n11. For the interval elapsing between departure from his station and the commencement of furlough, and between the termination of furlough and the re-arrival at his station, a Chaplain shall be allowed subsidiary leave not ordinarily exceeding in each case thirty days. During those periods his allowances shall be the same as during the furlough to which the said leave is subsidiary.\n\n12. Subject to the exigencies of the service, both as regards the number of furloughs available at any one time, and as regards individual applications, of which exigencies the Government of India, Madras, or Bombay, as the case may be, shall be exclusively the judge, furloughs shall be granted under these rules. Extension of furlough, other than furlough under medical certificate, will be granted by the Local Governments only.\n\n13. All applications for furlough under medical certificate, in accordance with these rules, shall be granted without restriction.\n\n14. If, owing to the exigencies of the service, it may be necessary to place any limit on the number of Chaplains who may be absent on furlough at the same time, applications not supported by medical certificate shall be granted in the following order:\n\nThe applicant to whose credit the greatest amount of furlough remains under Rule 3 shall have the preference.\n\nIf two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, the preference...\nshall be given to the applicant whose actual service in India is longest, reckoning in the case of a Chaplain who has not taken long extraordinary leave, or long furlough, from the date of his arrival in India, and in the case of a Chaplain who has taken long extraordinary leave, or long furlough, from the date of his last return from such leave or furlough.\n\nIf two or more applicants are equal in both respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Gradation List.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n15. Subject to the exigencies of the State, a Chaplain who has completed five months' continuous duty may take privilege leave for one month without deduction from his salary or house-rent, but with loss of conveyance and gaol allowances.\n\n16.

Special leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at the discretion of the Government for a period not exceeding six months. In respect of allowances to be drawn during the leave and of subsidiary leave, the conditions of special leave shall be the same as those prescribed for furlough under Rules 7 and 11.\n\n19. Rule 17 shall, mutatis mutandis apply to a Chaplain over-staying special leave.\n\n20. Special leave may be repeated without allowances after intervals of at least six years' actual service.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n21. Applications for leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Governor General of India in Council may from time to time prescribe.\n\n22. Furlough, privilege leave and special leave shall not be taken as such in continuation of each other; but if a Chaplain absent on one of these classes of leave be allowed to change it for another, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under the class of leave for which it was changed.\n\n23. Subject to considerations of State, there shall be no restriction as to the places where a Chaplain may reside when on leave.\n\n24. Leave allowance shall be payable monthly, if payment is taken in India, and quarterly, if payment is taken in England. When furlough is taken in England, an advance of the first quarter's allowances may be made in India. Such advance shall not be recoverable in case of death.

H. Lushington,\nSecretary to the Government of India\n\nNOTE.\u2014Chaplains who came to Europe under the furlough rules previously in force are allowed the benefits of the above rules should they so elect, from the 1st August, 1863.\nREGULATIONS FOR THE EXAMINATION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF SURGEON IN HER MAJESTY'S INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE.\n\n1. All natural-born subjects of Her Majesty, between 22 and 28 years of age at the date of the examination, and of sound bodily health, may be candidates. They may be married or unmarried. They must possess a diploma in surgery or a license to practise it, as well as a degree in medicine, or a license to practise it in Great Britain or Ireland.\n\n2. They must subscribe and send in to the Military Secretary, India Office, Westminster, so as to reach that address at least a fortnight before the date fixed for the Examination, a declaration according to the annexed form.\n\n3. This declaration must be accompanied by the following documents:\n\n(a) Proof of age either by the candidates' own declaration, form of which can be obtained at the India Office pursuant to the Act 5 and 6 Will. IV., c. 62; or by extract from the register of the parish in which he was born. (A certificate of baptism which does not afford proof of age will be useless.)\n\n(b) A certificate of moral character from a magistrate, or a minister of the religious denomination to which the candidate belongs, who has personally known him for at least two preceding years.\n\n(c) A certificate of registration in accordance with the Medical Act of 1858, of the degrees, diplomas, and licenses possessed by the candidate.\n\n4. The physical fitness of candidates will be determined previous to examination by a Board of Medical Officers, who are required to certify that the candidate's vision is sufficiently good to enable him to perform any surgical operation without the aid of glasses. A moderate degree of myopia would not be considered a disqualification, provided it did not necessitate the use of glasses during the performance of operations, and that no organic disease of the eyes existed. Every candidate must also be free from organic disease of other organs, and from constitutional weakness, or other disability likely to unfit him for military service in India.\n\n5. On producing the foregoing qualifications, the candidate will be examined by the Examining Board in the following compulsory subjects, and the highest number of marks attainable will be distributed as follows:\n\n| Subjects                          | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| a. Anatomy and Physiology         | 1,000 |\n| b. Surgery                        | 1,000 |\n| c. Medicine, including Therapeutics, the Diseases of women and children | 1,000 |\n| d. Chemistry and Pharmacy, and a practical knowledge of Drugs | 100   |\n\n(The examination in medicine and surgery will be in part practical, and will include operations on the dead body, the application of surgical apparatus, and the examination of medical and surgical patients at the bedside.)\n\n6. The eligibility of each candidate for the Indian Medical Service will be determined by the result of the examinations in these subjects only.\n\n7. Candidates, who desire it, will be examined in French, German, and Hindustani, Comparative Anatomy, Zoology, Natural Philosophy, Physical Geography, and Botany, with special reference to Materia Medica.\n\n8. The number of marks gained in these subjects will be added to the total number of marks obtained in the obligatory part of the examination by candidates who shall have been found qualified for admission, and whose position on the list of successful competitors will thus\nbe improved in proportion to their knowledge of modern languages and natural science.\n\n9. The maximum number of marks allotted to the voluntary subjects will be as follows:\n\n| Subject                          | Marks |\n|----------------------------------|-------|\n| French, German, and Hindustani   | 450   |\n| Natural Science                  | 300   |\n\n10. The subjects for this part of the examination will be taken from the following books:\n\n- \"Animal Kingdom,\" by W. S. Dallas, F.L.S.\n- \"Outlines of the Structure and Functions of the Animal Kingdom,\" by Rymer Jones; or \"Cours \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire d'Histoire Naturelle,\" par Milne Edwards.\n- Lindley's \"School Botany,\" Lindley's \"Medical and Economic Botany,\" Henfrey's \"Elementary Course of Botany.\"\n- \"Elements of Natural Philosophy,\" by Golding Bird and C. Brooks.\n- \"Physical Geography,\" by Mrs. Somerville.\n\n11. The Examiners in London will prepare a list in order of merit, with the marks affixed in the different subjects, to be transmitted to the Director-General and communicated to the Professors of the Army Medical School. If any Candidate is found to be deficient in any particular subject, this shall be stated, in order that he may receive special instruction on the point at Netley.\n\n12. After passing his preliminary examination, candidates will be required to attend one entire course of practical instruction at the Army Medical School, before being admitted to examination for a commission, on\u2014\n\n(1) Hygiene.\n(2) Clinical and Military Medicine.\n(3) Clinical and Military Surgery.\n(4) Pathology of Diseases and Injuries incident to Military Service.\n\nThese courses are to be of not less than four months' duration; but candidates who have already gone through a course at Netley as candidates for the Army or Navy Medical Service may, if thought desirable, be exempted from attending the school a second time.\n\n13. During the period of his residence at the Army Medical School, each candidate will receive an allowance of 5s per diem, with quarters, or 7s per diem without quarters, to cover all costs of maintenance; and he will be required to provide himself with uniform (viz., the regulation undress uniform of a Surgeon of the British service, but without the sword).\n\n14. All candidates will be required to conform to such rules of discipline as the Senate may, from time to time, enact.\n\n15. At the conclusion of the course, candidates will be required to pass an examination on the subjects taught in the school. The examination will be conducted by the professors of the school.\n\nThe Director-General, or any medical officer deputed by him, may be present and take part in the examination. If the candidate give satisfactory evidence of being qualified for the practical duties of an Army Medical Officer, he will be eligible for a commission as Surgeon.\n\n16. The position of the candidates on the list of Surgeons will be determined by the combined results of the preliminary and of the final examinations, and, so far as the requirements of the service will permit, they will have the choice of Presidency in India, according to their position in that list.\n\nIndia Office, May, 1876.\n\nN.B. The examinations for admission to the Indian Medical Service will usually take place twice a year, viz., in February and in August.\n\nNote.\u2014The next examination will take place in August, 1876, for 13 appointments.\nDECLARATION AND SCHEDULE OF QUALIFICATIONS, TO BE FILLED UP BY CANDIDATES.\n\nChristian and Surname at full length.\n\nI , years of age in last, vide accompanying certificate, Candidate for employment as Surgeon in Her Majesty's Indian Medical Service, do hereby attest my readiness to engage for that service, and to proceed on duty immediately on being gazetted.\n\nI declare that I labour under no mental nor constitutional disease, nor any imperfection or disability that can interfere with the most efficient discharge of the duties of a Medical Officer.\n\nThe Dates of Graduations and the Universities or Colleges are to be stated.\n\nI have the Degree of A.M. or A.B. from the\nI have the Degree of M.D. or M.B. from the\nI have a License to Practise Medicine from the\nI have a Diploma in Surgery from the\nI have a License to Practise Surgery from the\n\nThe Candidate should here state whether he has served in the Medical Department of the Army or Navy, or in the Subordinate Medical Department in India.\n\n(Signature at full length)\n(Date)\n(Place of Residence)\n\nCandidates who desire to undergo the voluntary examination are to sign the following declaration:\n\nIt is my intention to undergo the voluntary examination in *\n\nN.B.

The regulations are those in force at the present time. They are subject to any alteration that may be determined on.\n\nPASSAGE TO INDIA.\n\n2. Passage allowance to India on appointment will be given, or a passage provided. When passages are provided on board the Indian troop ships, a charge for messing will be made at the rate laid down in the Royal Passage Warrant of 1865 viz., 3s. 6d. a day, but, when wine and beer are not included in the mess, and it is so stated on the messing certificate, the daily contribution required will be 2s. 6d only.\n\n3. All Surgeons who shall neglect or refuse to proceed to India under the orders of the Secretary of State for India within two months from the date of leaving Netley, will be considered as having forfeited their appointment, unless special circumstances shall justify a departure from this regulation.\n\nPAY PREVIOUS TO EMBARKATION.\n\n4. Pay at the rate of 10s. a day will be allowed from date of passing final examination at the Army Medical School, until date of embarkation when a passage is provided, or for a period of two months when the Surgeon is permitted to make his own arrangements for passage. An advance of two months' pay will also be made on embarkation.\n\nGRADES AND RELATIVE RANK.\n\n5. The grades of Medical Officers in the Indian Military Forces are four in number, viz.:\n\n1. Surgeon-General, ranking as Brigadier-General, according to the date of his Commission; if with an army in the field, or after three years' service in India as Surgeon-General, as a Major-General, from the date of his joining such army in the field, or according to the date of the completion of such service.\n2. Deputy Surgeon General, as Lieutenant Colonel according to the date of his Commission; and after five years' service as Deputy Surgeon-General, as Colonel according to the date of the completion of such service.\n\n3. Surgeon-Major, as Major according to the date of his Commission; and after twenty years' service as Surgeon and Surgeon-Major, as Lieutenant-Colonel, but junior of that rank except for choice of quarters.\n\n4. Surgeon as Lieutenant according to the date of his Commission; and after six years' service as Captain according to the date of the completion of such service.\n\nPromotion.\n\n6. A Surgeon is promoted to Surgeon-Major on completion of twelve years' service from date of first Commission, subject to his passing the prescribed examination.\n\n7. In cases, however, of emergency, or when the good of the service renders such alteration desirable, it is competent for the Secretary of State for India, on the recommendation of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, to shorten the period of service above mentioned, in such manner as he shall deem fit and expedient.\n\n8. The examination for promotion may be taken at any time after the Surgeon has served nine or more years.\n\n9. When Surgeons have served the requisite time, they will be examined in the following manner:\n\nA series of printed questions prepared by an examining board, consisting of the Principal of the Medical College and any two or more of the professors he may associate with himself for the purpose, will be sealed and sent by the Surgeon-General to the principal medical officers of stations where Surgeons may be eligible for examination. It will be the duty of the principal medical officer of the station to deliver these sealed questions to the Surgeons, and to see that they are answered without the assistance of books, notes, or communication with any other person. The answers are to be signed and delivered, sealed, to the Principal Medical Officer, who is to send them, unopened, to the Surgeon-General, together with a declaration from the Surgeon himself, or certificate from a superior medical officer, if there is one, that he has availed himself of every opportunity of practising surgical operations on the dead body.*\n\n10. The Surgeon is also required to transmit together with his answers to the Surgeon-General a medico-topographical account of the station where he may happen to be at the time, or of some other station where he may have been resident sufficiently long to enable him to collect the necessary information for such a report. Failing this, he will send a medico-statistical report of his charge for a period of at least twelve months.\n\n11. If the examining board is satisfied with the replies to the questions, and the Surgeon-General is satisfied with the certificates and with the medico-topographical or statistical report, the Surgeon will be held qualified for promotion.\n\n12. All promotion from the rank of Surgeon-Major to that of Deputy Surgeon-General, and from the rank of Deputy Surgeon-General to that of Surgeon-General, is given by selection for ability and merit.\n\nTenure of Office in Administrative Grades.\n\n13. The tenure of office of Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General is limited to five years.\n\n14. Deputy Surgeons-General, if not disqualified by age, are eligible either for employment for a second tour of duty in the same grade, or for employment in the higher grade of Surgeon-General by promotion thereto.\n\n* The Surgeon may see this certificate before it is sent to the Surgeon-General.\nPay and Allowances when in India.\n\n15. Officers who may hereafter be appointed to the Indian Medical Service will receive pay in India according to the following scale:\n\n| Rank                  | Years' Service | Pay and Allowances per Mensem |\n|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| Surgeon-Major         | 25            | Rs. 888 12 0                  |\n|                       | 20            | Rs. 852 3 7                   |\n|                       | 15            | Rs. 677 6 11                  |\n|                       | 12            | Rs. 640 14 6                  |\n| Surgeon               | 10            | Rs. 410 9 5                   |\n|                       | 6             | Rs. 392 5 2                   |\n|                       | 5             | Rs. 304 14 2                  |\n|                       | under         | Rs. 286 10 0                  |\n\n16. On first appointment they will only come into receipt of Indian pay and allowances from the date of their arrival within the limits of the Presidency to which they have been gazetted. When provided with passages on the troop ships, they draw Indian pay and allowances from date of disembarkation at Bombay.\n\n17.

The salaries of other medical appointments in the Civil and Military Departments are consolidated, and vary from Rs. 1,800 to Rs. 400 per mens-m.\n\n19. Qualified officers of the Medical Service are also eligible for appointments in the Assay Department. The salaries of these appointments are from Rs. 600 to Rs. 2,250 per mensem.\n\n20. A Medical Officer will, however employed, be restricted to the rate of pay laid down in paragraph 15, until he shall have passed the examination in Hindustani, known as the \"Lower Standard.\"\n\n21. Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons General on vacating office at the expiration of the five years tour of duty, will be permitted to draw in India respectively an unemployed salary of Rs. 1,200 per mensem in the former, and Rs. 900 in the latter case, for a period of six months from the date of their vacating office, after which they will be placed while unemployed on the following scale of pay:\n\n| Deputy Surgeon-General | Surgeon-General |\n|------------------------|-----------------|\n| After 30 years service on full pay | \u00a3 2 5 0 | \u00a3 1 14 0 |\n| \" 25 \" \" \" \" \" or on promotion should this period of service not be completed | \u00a3 2 5 0 | \u00a3 1 10 0 |\n| \" 20 \" \" \" \" \" or on promotion should this period of service not be completed | \u00a3 2 0 0 | \u00a3 1 8 0 |\nFurloughs.\n\n22. An Officer will be eligible for one year's furlough on the completion of five years actual service in India, and for an additional year after each subsequent five years service.\n\n23. While on furlough, an Officer will receive half the emoluments of his office.\n\n24. No absentee shall draw more than \u00a31,000 or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\n25. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years.\n\n26. Surgeons under six years' service, and in receipt of Indian allowances as subalterns, on returning to England on sick certificate receive passage allowance.\n\nRetiring Pensions.\n\n27. Officers of the Indian Medical Service will be allowed to retire on the following scale of pension, on completion of the required periods of service:\n\n| After 30 years' service in India | \u00a3 |\n|---------------------------------|--|\n| \" 27 \"                           | 550 |\n| \" 24 \"                           | 456 |\n| \" 21 \"                           | 365 |\n| \" 17 \"                           | 282 |\n|                                  | 220 |\n\n28. Time of service for pension will reckon from date of arrival in India. The period of residence at the Army Medical School will reckon as service for the above pension, except in the cases of Officers who have gone through the course at Netley as candidates for the British Army or Navy Medical Service.\n\n29. A Surgeon-General, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, will be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3350 per annum, in addition to that which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n30. A Deputy Surgeon-General will, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3250 per annum, in addition to the pension to which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n31. In each of the above cases stated in pars. 25 and 26, six months' absence on medical certificate will be allowed to count towards actual service in those grades.\n\n32. A Surgeon-General or Deputy Surgeon-General who has completed his term of service and has reverted to British pay, may reside in Europe, at the same time qualifying for higher pension.\n\n33. With a view to maintain the efficiency of the service, all Medical Officers of the rank of Surgeon-Major shall be placed on the Retired List when they shall have attained the age of fifty-five years, and all Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General when they shall have attained the age of sixty-five years. In any special case, where it would appear to be for the good of the service that the Officer should continue in employment, he may be so continued, subject in each case to the sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n34. A Medical Officer, retiring after a service of twenty-five years and upwards, may if recommended for the same by the Government of his Presidency, receive a step of honorary rank, but without any consequent increase of pay.\n35. Officers compelled to leave the service on account of ill-health, and not entitled to full-pay pension under present regulations, will be allowed the half-pay of their relative rank, as laid down in the Royal Warrant of 10th May, 1873.\n\n| Rank                        | Relative Rank | Rates of Half-pay |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n|                             |               | Per Day | Per Annum |\n| Surgeon-Major of 20 years' service | Lieut.-Colonel | 11 0   | 200 15 0 |\n| Surgeon-Major                | Major         | 9 6    | 173 7 6  |\n| Surgeon                      | Captain       | 7 0    | 127 15 0 |\n| \" under 6 years' service     | Lieutenant    | 4 0    | 73 0 0*  |\n| \" 3 \"                       |               | 2 6    | 45 12 6* |\n\nOfficers cannot retire in India on half-pay (No. 54, 28th February 1865).\n\nWOUND PENSIONS.\n\n36. Medical Officers are entitled to the same allowances granted to Her Majesty's Indian Military Forces on account of wounds and injuries received in action as combatant Officers holding the same relative rank.\n\nFAMILY PENSIONS.\n\n37. The claims to pension of widows and families of Medical Officers shall be treated under the provisions of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British Officers as may be in force at the time being. (The Royal Warrant of 27th December, 1870, is the one now in force.)\n\n38. The widows and families of Medical Officers are also entitled to pensions from the Indian Service Family Pension Fund, to which all Surgeons must as a condition of their appointment, subscribe from the date of their arrival in India.\n\n* Under the conditions prescribed in the Regulations of the Indian Service\nOfficers (of whatever rank) must be ten years in India before they can be entitled (except in cases of certified sickness, and as hereafter specified) to their rotation to be absent on furlough, and the same rule is applicable to assistant surgeons and veterinary surgeons. The furlough to be granted by the commander-in-chief at each presidency, with the approbation of the respective governments.\n\nOfficers who have not served ten years in India, but whose presence in England is required by urgent private affairs, may be allowed a furlough for one year without pay.\n\nOfficers coming to England on furlough are required immediately to report their arrival by letter, with their address, forwarding at the same time the certificates they received in India.\n\nThe period of furlough is three years, reckoning from its date to the day of the return of the officer to his presidency.\n\nOfficers are required to join the establishment to which they belong at the expiration of the three years' furlough, unless they shall have obtained an extension of leave, six months before the expiration of that period. No furlough will be extended, except in cases of sickness, certified in the manner hereafter mentioned; or in cases in which it shall be proved that a further residence in Europe is indispensably necessary.\n\nAll officers finding it necessary to solicit a further leave of absence on account of sickness, must, if resident in London or its vicinity, appear before the Medical Board appointed for that purpose, who will report their opinion on the state of such officer's health. And if resident in the country in any part of the United Kingdom, they must transmit with their letter of application for such leave, a certificate according to the following form, signed by at least two gentlemen, eminent in the medical profession, viz.:\u2014\n\nI hereby certify, that I have carefully examined (state the nature of the case, as well as the name of the party), and I declare, upon my honour, that, according to the best of my judgment and belief, is at present unfit for military duty, and that it is absolutely necessary, for the recovery of his health, that he should remain at least longer in this country.\n\nAlso, previously to such extension of furlough being granted, such further proof shall be adduced by personal examination, or by such other evidence as shall be deemed satisfactory.\n\nOfficers abroad in any part of Europe, applying to remain a farther time from their duty on account of sickness, are to furnish a certificate of two eminent physicians, in the above form, with the attestation of a magistrate, that the persons who signed the certificate are physicians.\n\nOfficers having obtained an extension of furlough to a given period, must at its expiration apply for permission either to return to their duty or to reside a further time in England.\n\nIn every case in which an officer has had his furlough extended beyond the prescribed period on the ground of his health not being sufficiently restored, and shall apply for permission to return to his duty, he shall produce a certificate from the examining physician that his health is completely re-established, and that there is every probability of his being able to perform the active duties of his profession in India.\n\nNo officer who has failed to obtain an extension of furlough will be considered eligible to return to the service after five years' absence, under the Act of 33 Geo. III. cap. 52, sec. 70.\n\nEvery officer upon leaving India will receive a printed copy of the General Order on this subject, published agreeably to the instruction of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the plea of ignorance of the regulations will not be admitted as any justification of the breach of them; officers, therefore, who shall come home on furlough, and who shall not in due time apply, so as to effect their return to the Presidency to which they belong within the period of three years from the commencement of their furlough, will subject themselves to the loss of the service, unless they shall be permitted to remain a further time in Europe.\n\nNo officer on furlough can receive pay for more than two years and a half from the period of his quitting India until he returns, excepting colonels of regiments and general officers; the latter are then allowed to draw the pay of their brevet rank beyond the above period.\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS.\u2014Nov. 17, 1854.\n\nWith the view of adapting the regulations to the present increased facilities of communication, and to correct, as far as possible, any tendency in them to deter officers from resorting to the places which may be most conducive to the restoration of their health, when a change of climate is required for that purpose, the following rules are established, and are to have effect from the 1st February, 1854:\n\n1. All regimental officers in the service on the 1st February, 1854, who prefer retaining what may be considered the advantages of the old regulations, may do so, provided they signify their wish to that effect when they next apply for furlough or leave of absence, without any limitation whether such leave be in India or elsewhere; and officers who once make their election will not be entitled to any other choice, but will be afterwards subject to the new or old regulations, according to their decisions.\n\n2. Staff officers, as such, have not the above option allowed them, but they may retain the advantages of the old regulations by giving up their appointments, which, in such cases, will be considered vacated from the date of embarkation.\n\n3. To those officers who adopt them, the new regulations will apply retrospectively in respect of furlough and leave of absence beyond sea, and in computing their time of service for retirement, so that their furloughs or leaves of absence, whether under the old or the new rules, and whether on private affairs or sick certificate, within or beyond India, will count for service to the authorized extent only, in computing the time for retirement on full pay.\n\n4. Officers who have availed themselves of the option of the old rules are allowed to reconsider the question under the modifications now sanctioned.\n\n5. Officers who have not taken leave subsequent to the publication of the new rules on the 1st February, 1854, and who, consequently, may not have been called upon to declare whether they would abide by the old or the new regulations, will, on retirement from the service, be entitled to take full advantage of the privileges given by the new regulations.\n\nFURLoughs ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n6. Every officer will be allowed a furlough to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of two years at the expiration of ten years' service, and for a second period of two years after twenty years' service in India.\n\n7. The second furlough of two years will only be granted after ten years' service in India, from the date of the return to duty after the first furlough of two years. These furloughs are not to be cumulative, under any circumstances, but are limited to two years. Officers who have taken leave of absence on sick certificate to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, will be ineligible to a furlough on private affairs until they have served six years from their last return to duty. This rule does not apply to short leaves to sea.\n\nOfficers who take their first furlough after twenty years' service in India, may take their second furlough after an additional service of five years from the date of their first return to duty. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n8. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and to the regulations framed for and preservation of the efficiency of each regiment by limiting the number of absentees.\n\n9. Officers holding staff or other detached appointments, may be allowed furlough for a period of six months without losing their appointments; but, during that period, they will not be entitled to any portion of their staff salary, which will be drawn in full by the officers officiating for them.\n\nAbsence for six months under this rule does not preclude an officer from taking his furlough to Europe after ten years' service. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n10. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on furlough on private affairs, will be entitled to \"Furlough Pay\" only.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE ON SICK CERTIFICATE.\n\n11. Leave of absence on sick certificate will be granted for a term not exceeding eighteen months, whether it be to any place in Europe, or elsewhere out of India.\n\n12. Extension of such leave may be granted, as at present, on production of medical certificates, for further periods not exceeding eighteen months in the whole.\n\n13. An officer holding a staff or other detached appointment, will be allowed to be absent on sick certificate in England, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of twenty months, without losing his appointment; and, during the first six months only of such absence, he will be entitled to draw half the staff salary of his appointment, the officer officiating for him drawing the re-\nmaining half salary during the first six months, and the whole salary during the remainder of the time.\n\n14. An officer's claim to half staff salary for six months, as sanctioned in the preceding rule, will not be affected by his subsequently retiring from the service in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n15. No portion of command allowance, medical staff salary, or other similar allowance, which under the old rules was inadmissible to officers absent from their corps or stations, at the Cape or elsewhere, will be allowed to absent officers under these regulations.\n\n16. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on leave of absence on sick certificate, will be entitled for a period of six months to the same rate of Indian pay and allowances as was allowed under the old regulations to officers proceeding to the Cape on medical certificate, and for the remaining period of their leave they will receive furlough pay only.\n\n17. If the leave on sick certificate be extended, furlough pay will be continued; but under no circumstances for a longer period than three years altogether, from the commencement of the absence.\n\nSTAFF OFFICERS.\n\n18. The term, \"staff officers,\" applies to all officers holding staff or detached appointments, military (general or regimental), political, or civil; also to general officers commanding divisions, members of the Medical Board, superintending surgeons, and others who, under the old rules, were entitled to draw half staff allowance when absent at the Cape.\n\n19. Staff officers absent on leave beyond the periods stated in Rules 9 and 13 respectively, cannot retain their appointments and allowances except on special grounds to be sanctioned by the Government of the presidency. Any such special grant of leave is to be reported at once, with the reasons for it, and to be subject to approbation.\n\n20. The privilege of retaining staff appointments during leave of absence on sick certificate, or on furlough on private affairs will not be available a second time, if the fresh leave is on sick certificate, until an officer has been three years, or, if on private affairs, until he has been six years, in the discharge of the duties of his appointment, from the date of last return to it.\n\n21. This rule, however, does not apply to leaves of absence, whether on sick certificate or on private affairs, in India, or for brief periods to Ceylon, the Mauritius, or other places out of India.\n\n22. Officers commanding troops of Horse Artillery and Light Field Batteries, and officers generally in employment, will be allowed leave out of India under the same rules with respect to allowance and tenure of command or office, as regulated the grant of leave to the Cape to such officers under the old regulations, except as to the duration of those advantages, the time for their continuance being subject to the provisions of the new regulations.\n\nDATE OF FURLOUGH AND ADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n23. The period of furlough on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, is to be calculated from the date of the departure from India of the ship in which the officer proceeds.\n\n24. Advances of pay and allowances, staff and regimental, to officers proceeding on leave of absence on sick certificate, who may be entitled to them, will be made in India for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England at the rates of exchange fixed annually for repayment of advances made on account of Her Majesty's Government. Furlough pay will continue to be issued in advance for six months when required by officers obtaining furlough on private affairs.\n\n25. The existing regulations regarding passage-money to officers are not affected by these rules.\n\n26. The certificates issued to officers who are granted furloughs on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, are to specify the time each officer has been absent on leave within Indian limits, as well as the time of his previous absence in Europe; but will not include the periods allowed for proceeding to the presidency or port of embarkation, and to enable officers to rejoin their regiments or stations after their return to India, nor the leave of one month's absence in six months, as authorized by the regulations. The last pay certificate of all officers proceeding to England on sick certificate is to specify the rate of regimental pay and allowances and staff salary to which they would have been entitled under the old regulations if proceeding to sea on medical certificate. This information is necessary in order that no difficulty may arise in the Pay Department of the India Office in adjusting the several payments which may be due.\n\nOFFICERS OF H.M.'S SERVICE.\n\n27. Officers of Her Majesty's service in India, whether employed regimentally or in staff or detached situations, are entitled to the advantages above laid down in respect to allowances and tenure of office when on furlough or leave of absence.\n\n28. In the case of officers of Her Majesty's\nservice on furlough or sick certificate, in England or elsewhere, who may retire or exchange into regiments not on the Indian establishment, the grant to these officers of Indian allowances will cease from the date of their retirement or exchange, if it take place before the expiration of six months from the date of quitting India.\n\nPERIODS OF ABSENCE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AS SERVICE FOR RETIRING PENSIONS.\n\n29. In order that all officers quitting India on furlough or sick certificate may be placed on an exact equality as regards loss of time, the period allowed by regulation for proceeding to the presidency, or to the nearest port of embarkation, as well as the time to enable officers to rejoin their corps or station after their return to India, will be considered as time counting for service for the retiring pension.\n\n30. No furlough or leave of absence, as announced in General Orders, exceeding two years in twenty years' aggregate service, three years in twenty-five years' service, and four years in thirty years' service, shall be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension; and no difference will be made in this respect between leave of absence taken in Europe or elsewhere, in or out of India, or whether the leave be on sick certificate or on private affairs.\n\n31. In the term \"Leave of Absence as announced in General Orders,\" is to be included all leave of absence, except the period allowed in Rule 29, and the ordinary indulgence of one month's leave in six months, as authorized by the existing regulations, and which are, in all cases, whether of regimental or staff officers, to be allowed to count as service for the pension. All leave to a greater extent, granted by political and other authorities, which may not hitherto have been published in General Orders, must be so announced hereafter.\n\n32. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of their regimental rank (under the regulations of 1796), must have served twenty-two years in India, out of which leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension.\n\n33. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of captains and majors (under the regulations of 1835-37) must have served twenty and twenty-four years respectively, out of which time leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more will be allowed to count as service.\n\n34. Officers to be entitled to retire as lieutenant-colonels must have served twenty-eight years; out of which leaves of absence for three years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n35. Officers to be entitled to retire as colonels must have served thirty-two years; out of which leaves of absence for four years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n36. The scale for medical officers and veterinary surgeons of privileged furlough and leave of absence as counting for the retiring pension, will be as follows:\n\n| Years | Months |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 8      |\n| 2     | 0      |\n| 3     | 0      |\n| 4     | 0      |\n| 5     | 0      |\n| 6     | 0      |\n\nin 17 & under 20 yrs.' service\n\nin 20 ,, 25 ,, 30 ,, 35 ,, 38 ,, 38 yrs.' service\n\n37. It is to be distinctly understood, that under no circumstances whatever will an officer be permitted to retire on full pay until he has completed the full time of service above specified, whether he be in England at the close of his service or elsewhere.\n\n38. The privileged time of absence may, with the permission of the local government, be taken at any time, subject to these regulations. If, therefore, at the end of twenty years' service, of which eighteen had been passed on actual duty in India, an officer should be on furlough or sick certificate in Europe or elsewhere, he will be entitled to retire on the full pay of a captain without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pensions. In like manner, a medical officer on furlough or sick certificate, in Europe or elsewhere, at the end of seventeen years' service, fifteen years and four months of which have been passed on actual duty in India, will be entitled to retire on the lowest rate pension, without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pension.\n\n39. These rules do not in any way affect the existing regulations regarding the grant of leave in India, or for short periods to sea, whether on private affairs or on sick certificate, except as to the periods of such absence being taken into calculation in the time allowed to count as service for retirement on full pay.\nINDIAN MILITARY FURLOUGH RULES OF 1868.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\nThe following General Order by the Government of India, dated 25th February, 1874, No. 171, is republished:\n\n\"No. 171 of 1874.\u2014The Furlough Rules of 1868, as revised by various subsequent decisions, are republished for general information; and in future this General Order shall ordinarily be referred to in any matter depending on those rules. The rules previously in force will be designated, as heretofore, the Furlough Rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nThe following G. G. O. are cancelled prospectively from the 1st January, 1875:\n- G. G. O. No. 630 of 1869 (1st clause).\n- G. G. O. No. 627 of 1870.\n- G. G. O. No. 613 of 1871.\n\n2. These rules are applicable to all officers who, on the 1st July, 1868 belonged to the several Indian Staff Corps, or to the Indian Army, and who have elected, or may elect to adopt them: officers of the British Army who entered the Staff Corps after that date are of course subject to them.\n\nRules apply to Officers of Staff Corps and Indian Army.\n\nIn regard to the periods of leave of absence during which appointments may be held, and in regard to the increased allowances they are also applicable to officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, late of the Indian Army, holding permanent staff appointments not of a regimental nature, and to such officers of the Engineers of the Imperial Establishment as may be permanently employed on the staff in India.\n\nBut should an officer of the British Service, holding such permanent staff appointment, be allowed to proceed on leave under circumstances which, by these rules, would involve loss of appointment, he cannot take leave under them, but simply as a British Officer holding no appointment.\n\n3. These rules are not applicable to officers on the Invalid or Invalid Pension Establishment, even if previous to their transfer they should have elected them, being intended solely for officers on the effective list.\n\nDo not apply to Invalid Officers.\n\n4. They are not applicable to Regimental Officers generally of the British Service, whether formerly belonging to the Indian Army, and now in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and new Line Regiments, or on the old Line Establishment: nor are they applicable to officers of the British Army holding staff appointments the tenure of which is limited to five years, except in the sense in which the rules of 1854 were made applicable, viz., as regulating the amount of absentee allowance to be granted to such officers holding staff appointments, when they are absent on furlough on medical certificate.\n\nDo not apply to Officers of the British Medical Staff.\n\nOfficers of the British Medical Staff are not entitled to this advantage.\n\n5. They are applicable to Officers of the Royal Engineers on the Imperial Establishment, who are employed in the Public Works Department, or who are receiving a staff salary as on the fixed establishment of the Sappers and Miners; these will count service towards furlough from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nThese officers, therefore, and other Royal Engineer Officers of the Imperial list on permanent staff employ under the Government, will be entitled to a furlough of two years after eight years' service in India, or at the expiration of one year from the date of their return (for a second tour of service in India) on the completion of the prescribed home service after the first period of seven years' service in India.\nThe English rate of pay of his rank only will be passed to such an officer during this leave; but on his return to India for a second tour of service, the difference between that pay and \"Furlough Pay\" will be admitted to him; and if he should not return to India, his passage money to England will be paid to him.\n\nRoyal Engineer Officers on the Imperial Establishment, who are merely doing duty with, or attached to, the Sappers and Miners, but not on the fixed establishment and drawing staff salary, will, in regard to these rules, be on the footing of Regimental Officers of the British Service\u2014see preceding paragraph. If, however, they afterwards accept staff employ, they also will count their service for furlough from date of arrival in India.\n\n6. Officers of British Regiments who may join the Staff Corps, can count as service towards furlough all their military service in India, provided that half of it (in no case less than four years) shall have been passed in the Staff Corps. But any leave to England they may have taken during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough already taken. Officers of the British Service who formerly belonged to the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n\n7. These rules apply also to all Warrant Officers holding Veteran or Honorary Commissions, who may elect them; the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of a Commission. They will receive during furlough half their total receipts, calculated as laid down in Rule V., but without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate. Warrant Officers not holding Commissions can obtain furlough under these rules only on medical certificate.\n\nSuch furlough may be for two years with retention of appointment and half of the aggregate allowances; but any extension of such leave (which will not be granted for more than one year in excess of the two years), or any leave taken within less than three years from the date of last return to duty, will be on \"English furlough pay.\" [See Note to para. 9.]\n\n8. Every Warrant Officer who attained warrant rank before the 19th February, 1869, and who has not made his election, will be required, on the first occasion of his applying for leave out of India, to state whether he desires to take the leave under these rules, or under those previously in force applicable to Warrant Officers, viz., G. G. O. Nos. 518 and 531 of 1854, G. G. O. No. 1559 of 1857, and subsequent orders. That election will be considered final.\n\nThose who became Warrant Officers after 19th February, 1869, are subject to these rules, and cannot elect any of the previous rules.\n\nLeave on medical certificate on Indian pay and allowances to places eastward of the Cape, as allowed to Commissioned Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1796, is not in any case admissible to a Warrant Officer.\n\nThese rules respecting Warrant Officers apply to Honorary Assistant Surgeons and Warrant Officers in the Medical Department.\n\n9. The term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and two-fold signification, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits, specified in paragraph 5 of these rules, converted at the rate of exchange fixed by the Secretary of State for the official year, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English pay under the rules of 1796 and 1854.\nNote.\u2014Where in these Rules English furlough pay is mentioned as that to which an officer is to be restricted, the rates laid down in paragraph 11 of G. G. O. No. 69, dated 22nd January, 1868, and (for Medical Warrant Officers) paragraph 22 of G. G. O. No. 550 of 1868, are to be understood as intended in the cases of Warrant Officers.\n\nRULES.\n\nI.\u2014The distinction with respect to allowances which has been hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave, is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtainment of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\nII.\u2014Leave taken under the rules now prescribed will not involve forfeiture of appointment, except in the cases herein specially provided for.\n\nOfficers of the Staff Corps and local Indian Service, and Officers on the General List, can retain their appointments during all leave of absence granted by competent authority. But their pay during such absence will be the same as they would obtain under these rules had this exemption from forfeiture of appointment not been granted.\n\nIII.\u2014The Rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII. of George III., Chapter 52, Section 70;* but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the rules now prescribed. Nor do they affect the regulations by which General Officers Commanding Divisions and Brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their Commands.\n\nIV.\u2014Leave of absence will in future be of three kinds, viz.:\n\n1.\u2014Furlough in or out of India.\n2.\u2014General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, or short leave to sea.\n3.\u2014Privilege leave.\n\nChapter I.\n\nFurlough.\n\nV.\u2014An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on furlough, will be allowed pay at the rate of 50 per cent. of the salary of his substantive office.\n\nBut an officer in civil employ and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary during the three years prior to his proceeding on furlough, or during his actual service in India should that be less than three years; and the time spent and the allowances drawn during any leave \"other than privilege leave,\" will be omitted in the calculation of average salary.\n\n* The section referred to is quoted below:\n\nSection 70.\u2014\"And be it further enacted that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a Member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and who, having departed from India by leave of the Governor-General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or Native Corps of Troops or in the civil line of the Company's Service, unless in the case of any Civil Servant of the Company, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or, unless such person be permitted to return with his rank to India, by a vote or resolution passed by way of ballot by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days' previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any Military Officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\"\nNo absentee shall in either case draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nThe term \"salary\" will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay, or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances.\n\nBut in the case of a military officer in civil employ, his acting allowances shall be taken into account as a part of his salary in calculating his furlough pay.\n\n\u00a7 2. An officer absent on furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his furlough, to furlough pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, whatever the salary of the office to which he may be transferred may be. This furlough pay will be continued to an officer in military employ after his return to India and until he joins his appointment, provided it is not less than the military pay, or pay and allowances, of his rank.\n\nBut an officer whose term of office shall lapse, who shall vacate his appointment, or whose appointment shall be abolished during his furlough, will revert at once to the furlough pay which he would draw in virtue of his rank, as laid down below, in \u00a7 4. Any case of sudden abolition of appointment may, however, be specially considered in the department of the Government under which the officer may have been employed. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher rank.\n\nPay when the appointment lapses, or is vacated during furlough.\n\nPay of officers promoted during furlough.\n\nStaff Corps or regimental rank, whilst on furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers holding regimental medical charges retained during furlough.\n\n* G. G. O. No. 1060 of 23rd Dec. 1864, para. 29.\nG. G. O. No. 370 of 4th April, 1867, para. 9.\n\nThe staff salary how divided.\n\n\u00a7 4. Officers not in staff employ will receive half the Indian pay of their rank, provided that an officer entitled to furlough shall in no case receive less than the above minimum of \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nNote.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the Military Fund during absence in Europe, will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\nVI.\u2014All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service,\u2014of which exigency the Government is to be exclusively the judge,\u2014and to any regulations that may be found necessary for limiting the number of absentees.\n\nNote.\u2014It is therefore within the competency of local Governments and of the Commander-in-Chief to decline to forward the application of any officer whose absence would, in their opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the public service, until such time as arrangements can be made for removing the difficulty; and it is the duty of every head of a department to decline to forward any application for furlough, whenever the services of the officer cannot be spared without risking the efficiency of the department, any doubtful case being referred for the orders of Government.\n\nVII.\u2014The maximum amount of furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time, carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years: any extension of such furlough will be without pay unless it is on medical certificate, see Rule XIII. (But see Notes (3) and (4) Rule IX.) And no extension on private affairs beyond two years will be granted, though without pay, except upon satisfactory evidence of very urgent necessity.\nVIII.\u2014A period of at least three years' service after return from last furlough, except furlough for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months) must be completed before furlough can again be taken, unless obtained under medical certificate (see Rules XIII. and XIV. and Note 3 of Rule IX.).\n\nBut an officer who may be ordered to return to duty before the completion of his furlough for the purpose of proceeding on field service may be allowed to take the balance of such furlough at any time.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer in civil employ cannot reckon in this interval of three years any period of absence from actual duty, excepting those spent on privilege leave.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer will be eligible for two years' furlough on the completion of eight years' actual service in India (see para. 6 of this order); for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years, and so on, up to the maximum prescribed in Rule XVI. The grant of furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules VI. and VII. But see notes to this Rule.\n\n\u00a7 2. No furlough, or extension of furlough, if without pay, will reckon as \"furlough already taken\" in calculating the balance at an officer's credit, as shown in Rule X. But furlough on private affairs under the Rules of 1796 will of course so reckon.\n\nHow far previous furlough on medical certificate bars furlough on private affairs.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer appointed to any duty in England draws his Indian allowances, with or without any portion of his staff salary, he can count the period of such employment as service towards furlough; but if he is appointed to an office in England to which a fixed consolidated salary is attached, he cannot reckon the time of such employment as service towards furlough.\n\nNote. (1.)\u2014But an officer of less than eight years' service in India may obtain furlough not exceeding two years, on medical certificate, with furlough pay and retention of appointment, provided he has been three years in the Staff Corps, or\u2014in the case of a Royal Engineer officer holding a permanent staff appointment, or an officer not in the Staff Corps\u2014has served for three years in India.\n\nNote (2.)\u2014If the officer has not been three years in the Staff Corps or served three years in India, as the case may be, he will receive \"English furlough pay\" only, and must vacate his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nThis rule and the proviso in Note 1, however, are not applicable to officers of the Indian Army who entered the new Line Regiments, or Royal Artillery, and subsequently the Staff Corps.\n\nNote (3).\u2014Unemployed General Officers of the Staff Corps or local service can be granted furlough without serving the intervals of three and six years, respectively, prescribed in Rules VIII. and IX., and they can remain in Europe after they have exhausted the full period of furlough allowed during an officer's service by Rule XVI. (eight years on the whole) on the English furlough pay of their rank.\n\nNote (4).\u2014And a Major-General of the Staff Corps\u2014if he has so much furlough at his credit, and proceeds to England within a year of his being promoted to that rank, or of his ceasing to be employed\u2014can continue, after the expiration of the two years' furlough to receive half his Indian pay until he completes the period of three years during which he would be entitled to draw his Staff Corps pay if he were in India.\nX.\u2014An officer eligible for furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of furlough for which he may be eligible.\n\nIllustrations.\n\n1. An officer who has served nine years in India is entitled to two years' furlough: he takes only one year, and after his return remains in India for five years.\n\nHe is then eligible for two years' furlough as follows:\n\nTotal service in India ........................................... 14 years.\nFurlough due on that service .................................... 3 \"\nFurlough already taken ............................................. 1 year.\nBalance for which he is eligible .................................. 2 years.\n\n2. An officer who has served 20 years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer is said to have furlough at his credit,\u2014even though he may not be able to obtain it owing to the number of absentees, or other causes,\u2014when the calculation of his service, as in illustration 1 above, shows a \"balance for which he is eligible.\"\n\nXI.\u2014Furlough on urgent private affairs for six months on pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, maybe granted when the officer has no furlough at his credit, or when from other causes, e.g. the number of absentees, or his not having served three years since his last return to duty, he is not able to take it. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule IX., and also\u2014except in the case of an officer in civil employ, see Rule VIII. note\u2014of the three years which are required to intervene between two periods of furlough by Rule VIII.\n\nThis leave cannot be given in extension of furlough of any description. It cannot be extended beyond six months unless on medical certificate and on the same pay; in which case the officer will be deemed to have vacated his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.; the whole period will be reckoned in the maximum amount of furlough (8 years) allowed by Rule XVI., and no portion of it can form any part of the periods referred to in Rules VIII. and IX.\n\nNote.\u2014Ill-health is not considered as warranting furlough under this rule to any officer who under the provisions of these rules can obtain furlough on medical certificate without forfeiting his appointment.\n\nXII.\u2014Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during furlough. But, if he desires to spend in England the rest of a \"furlough in India,\" or vice versa, he must obtain permission to do so from the Government of his Presidency, or from the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be; and on landing in either country, he must report his arrival accordingly to the Military Office, forwarding a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination. He must also communicate his address.\n\nReports, &c., required.\n\nconsidered to have returned to his duty.\n\nXIII.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate is obtainable as indicated in Notes (1) and (2) of Rule IX. and in Rule XIV. Absence on such furlough for a longer period than two years at one time will involve forfeiture of appointment. [But see exceptions in Rule II.] Furlough may, however, be extended on medical certificate up to a third year on\n\"English furlough pay;\" and an officer on furlough on private affairs, who may be obliged to obtain an extension on medical certificate, will be thenceforward entitled to the same advantages, and subjected to the same disadvantages as to retention of appointment, pay, &c., as if he had originally obtained furlough on medical certificate.\n\nIf he exceeds three years' absence on medical certificate, the officer may have to retire or go on half-pay.\n\nExtension on medical certificate over three years to be without pay.\n\nOfficers on medical certificate must be pronounced fit for duty before returning to India.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer whose health certificate, such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health; but he will receive only \"English furlough pay,\" and must vacate any appointment he may be holding, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\n\u00a7 2. If, however, he shall have served three years since the date of his last return to duty, although there may be no balance of furlough at his credit, he will be entitled, on obtaining furlough on medical certificate, to retain his appointment and to receive \"furlough pay,\" as laid down in Rule V., for the entire period not exceeding two years. Should the latter period be exceeded, he will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer entitled to furlough, or having a balance of furlough at his credit, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, must take the leave as furlough under Rule IX., but without forfeiting any passage-money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules,\u2014or, if a Subaltern, by Regulation, when proceeding on medical certificate.\n\n\u00a7 2. Should the officer be declared fit for duty before the expiration of two years, he may be granted extension on private affairs up to that limit, provided that he has so much at his credit, and that if he remains he will not be in excess of the established proportion of absentees. Any extension on private affairs of such furlough beyond the said period of two years, must be without pay.\n\n3. Any extension on medical certificate of furlough under \u00a7 1 of this rule beyond two years or any lesser period which may be at his credit under Rules IX. and X. will be regarded, in all respects, as furlough on medical certificate (Rule XIII.); and if the period of two years should not exhaust the balance of furlough at his credit under Rule X., the period or periods of extension shall be deducted from such balance till the latter is exhausted. On the aggregate of two years' leave being exceeded, the officer will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nTotal furlough with pay, &c., in an officer's service limited to eight years.\n\nFurlough not reckoned in this period.\n\n\u00a7 1.\u2014Leave without pay.\n\nIn the event of an officer not being able to return to his duty after an absence of three years, it will rest with the Secretary of State for India in Council to order him to appear before a Medical Board, with a view to placing him on the retired list, if entitled to pension, or on the half-pay list.\n\nShould the circumstances of the case warrant a further extension of furlough, it can only be granted without pay.\n\nNote.\u2014All officers, however employed, and whatever the amount of leave granted them may be, who leave India on sick certificate, are required to produce a certificate of fitness for duty before they can be allowed to return.\n\nXVI.\u2014The aggregate amount of furlough with pay and retention of appointment, on private affairs and on medical certificate, that may be granted to an officer during his service will be limited to eight years.\n\nNote.\u2014The following periods of leave, however, will not be reckoned in this period of eight years:\u2014\n\u00a7 2.\u2014Sick leave to Europe, or to the Colonies eastward of Cape under the Rules of 1796.\n\n\u00a7 3.\u2014Leave taken under Rule XI of these Rules, provided it be not extended over the six months. If it be so extended, the whole period will reckon as part of the eight years.\n\n\u00a7 4.\u2014Leave necessitated by wounds or sickness contracted on active service, and any other leave which may be allowed by proper authority to reckon as service for pension.\n\n\u00a7 5.\u2014In the case of an unemployed officer, periods of residence in England on English pay after promotion to the rank of Major General, or to the rank of Regimental Colonel in the Royal (late Indian) Artillery and Engineers, or after completion of tour of service as Inspector General or Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, when the officer is no longer required to reside in India.\n\nAll other leave to Europe, or out of India for periods exceeding three months (see Rule XXVII.), including furlough on medical certificate under the Furlough Rules of 1854, will form part of the period of eight years.\n\nXVII.\u2014If taken in India, furlough will be reckoned from the date of the absentee's quitting his station to the date of his return thereto; if taken out of India, from the date of the sailing of the vessel in which he may have embarked, to the date of his bon\u00e2 fide disembarkation in India for the purpose of rejoining his appointment or Regiment: the date of embarkation (or of the vessel's leaving the Sandheads if from Calcutta) and that of disembarkation also, are included in the furlough.\n\nNote (1).\u2014As an illustration of this rule, it may be observed that a Madras officer's landing and reporting himself at Madras, en route to Calcutta to join his appointment in Bengal or the North-Western Provinces, &c., is not disembarkation in the sense intended by this rule.\n\nNote 2.\u2014To enable an officer who overstays his leave to obtain an extension, he should show that he took all needful precautions to insure his arrival in proper time, and if delayed by the departure of the vessel being deferred, he should obtain the certificate of the owner or agent that she had been bon\u00e2 fide advertised to sail from \u2014\u2014\u2014 on the \u2014\u2014\u2014 but that her departure had been delayed till the \u2014\u2014\u2014. See General Order No. 52, dated 21st February 1873.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Preparatory leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere on furlough will be granted for any period deemed necessary, not ordinarily exceeding 30 days. Leave up to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date succeeding that of his disembarkation in India. This applies equally to furloughs taken under Rule XI. The authority which has power to grant preparatory leave can, on due cause being shown, grant any necessary extension of it, but this can be done only on very sufficient reasons.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer obtaining a furlough on private affairs or medical certificate must embark within three months of the date of the General Order which notifies it, or take up the first portion of his furlough in India until he embarks; if not, the General Order will cease to have effect. The only exception to this rule that can be allowed is when the officer is prevented from embarking within the three months owing to his detention in India by proper authority on bon\u00e2 fide public grounds.\n\nIf, however, the officer does not, within a reasonable time, avail himself of the furlough given him, his subsequently being placed on duty rendering his detention necessary will not exempt him from the rule; and in every case of such detention the officer must at once report it, and he is not to embark after the expiration of three months until he has applied for and obtained from the Government of his Presidency an extension of the period.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Officers who may be serving in other Presidencies than their own, if they desire to embark bon\u00e2 fide for Europe from the latter, may obtain preparatory leave accordingly, and their furlough will reckon from the date of their embarkation at their own Presidencies.\nNOTE (3).\u2014For full information as to the submission of applications for furlough, see Application for furlough how submitted.\n\nG.

Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of six months from that date. No advance is made in England to officers on their returning to duty.\n\nXXI.\u2014The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule V.\n\nXXII.\u2014An officer acting in India for an absentee on furlough will be restricted for the entire period that he may so act, to the half staff salary of the appointment in which he may be acting, in addition to the full pay of his rank, and the half staff salary of his own appointment, if he possess one. The staff salary granted to an acting officer will, however, in no such case be less than Rs. 100 per mensem.\n\nPay of Warrant Officers acting for others on furlough.\n\nPeriods of furlough, &c., counting as service towards pension.\u2020\n\n| Years | Years |\n|-------|-------|\n| 2     | 20    |\n| 3     | 25    |\n| 4     | 30    |\n| 5     | 35    |\n| 6     | 38    |\n\nPeriods of furlough reckoned by Warrant Officers towards pension.\n\n\u00a7 2.

The balance within the limit of eight years' total furlough on private affairs and medical certificate laid down in Rule XVI., will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty.\n\nIllustration.\n\n(1).\u2014An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns to India on the date on which this order is promulgated. He accepts its conditions and serves four years longer in India.

He returns, serves six years in India, takes two years' furlough, and returns to India about the time of the promulgation of these rules, which he accepts. He must serve four years before he can take an additional year's furlough, thus\u2014\n\nTotal service up to return from furlough.......................14 years.\nTotal service in India ..............................................10 \"\nFurlough enjoyed on that service ................................2 \"\n\nFurther period of service to entitle him to one year's furlough 4 years.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGeneral Leave on Private Affairs and Sick Certificate in India.\n\nXXV.\u2014An officer will be eligible, as at present, to take leave on private affairs or sick certificate anywhere in India for any period not exceeding six months, at the discretion of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief or of the Government under which he may be serving. During the entire period of his absence on this account the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively the officer will lose his staff appointment unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a Medical Board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in\nIf extended over one year, reckons as furlough.\n\nin addition to the pay of his rank. But if the 12 months be exceeded, the whole leave must be reckoned as furlough, and allowances be adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Short leave, not exceeding three months on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be taken to sea, on the above condition, but absence from India for any longer period will be treated as furlough.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014All general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXXIX.\u2014Privilege leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General leave, in extension of privilege leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\nXXX.\u2014In the case of the stations noted in the margin, privilege leave may, as at present, be granted for ninety days to officers of local Corps, or of Corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\n90 days allowed from certain stations.\n\nAssam.

Dera Ismael Khan.\n\nXXXI.\u2014An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on privilege leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\nXXXII.\u2014Privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on privilege leave, the privilege leave will be converted into general leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMilitary Officers in Civil Employ.\n\nXXXIII.\u2014Those Military Officers (including Warrant Officers who hold Honorary, Veteran, or Unattached Commissions) in Civil or Political employ who may elect these rules when they take leave in India, come, as respect periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted, under the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules.\n\nFor preparatory or subsidiary leave, see Note (4) of Rule XVIII.\n\nSubsidiary Rule.\n\nXXXIV.\u2014Officers of the Indian Military and Medical services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made.\n\n\u00a7 2. Officers going home under these Rules will pay English rates of subscription only to the Military Fund.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers who may determine to abide by existing Rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII., VIII., and XIII. to the extent to which they may be entitled under the Furlough Regulations of 1854, or of 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their\nappointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV. must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer under the Furlough Rules of 1796 elects the present Rules, his service for pension will be reckoned under the former Rules up to 1st July, 1868, and thenceforward under the Rules of 1868; and the fact of the officer having been on furlough on 1st July, 1868, and not then having elected the Rules of 1868, will not affect the case. All periods of leave out of Indian limits taken previous to 1st July, 1868, will be wholly excluded from his service for pension; but he may reckon towards pension periods of leave taken subsequent to that date, according to the length of his service counting for pension, as shown in Rule XXIII.\n\nRetirement under 1796 Rules not affected.\n\nHis election of these Furlough Rules in no way affects his right to retire under the Pension Rules of 1796.\n\nFURLOUGH AND LEAVE RULES.\n\n30th December, 1875.\n\nNo. 1,316 of 1875.\u2014Under instructions from Her Majesty's Government, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to publish the following revised Furlough and Leave Rules applicable to the Staff Corps and Indian Local and Medical Services.\n\n1. Officers included in Schedule A may receive, after five years' service in India or under the Government of India, one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these rules, be taken later.\n\n2. An Officer may receive at any time any portion of the furlough to which he is entitled; but, except under Rule 8, he may not be absent from duty on any ground for more than three years consecutively; nor, on return from furlough, may he receive, except under Rule 6, any further portion of the furlough to which he is entitled until after the interval of two years.\n\n3. It must be distinctly understood that furlough is subject to the exigencies of the public service. Officers commanding regiments, and Heads of Departments, will forward no application for furlough unless able to satisfy the superior authorities that the Officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\n4. Furlough does not involve forfeiture of appointment, may be spent anywhere, and counts as service for pension.\n\n5. An Officer on furlough receives (up to, but not beyond, the sum of \u00a31,000 a year) half the emoluments of his office, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State; but in any case he does not receive less than \u00a3250 a year. The emoluments of his office include all pay, staff corps pay, staff salary, and Indian allowances he would receive in respect to it if he were on duty, and for the purpose of each payment his office is the office he fills on the day when that payment becomes due.\n\n6. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years; but such furlough will be deducted from his next accruing furlough until it is paid off. An Officer will not be allowed to anticipate furlough under this rule to an aggregate amount of more than two years.\n\n7. An Officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be placed temporarily or permanently on half-pay, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\n8. Under very urgent circumstances special furlough may be granted for private affairs, which need not be paid back; but it will be in all cases without any kind of pay, and will not count for pension.\n\n9. Advances for passage money, on need shown, will be granted to Officers on furlough, to be recovered in manner specified at the time of the grant; in India, at the discretion of the Local Government; and in England, at the discretion of the Secretary of State.\n\n10. Leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, and may not, except for very urgent reasons, to be specially reported to the Government of India, be renewed till after six months have elapsed from its expiration. It must be spent at some place east of the 40th degree of east longitude. Subject to these conditions, it may be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the-\nlocal authorities, who in granting it shall fix its duration, and may fix the limits within which it shall be spent, and whether during its continuance half-pay and allowances are to be deducted for the payment of a substitute; and they may grant it as preparatory to furlough, or for the purpose of a medical examination. Leave counts as service for pension and furlough. The local authorities shall be defined for the purpose of this rule by the Government of India.\n\n11. Leave and furlough are reckoned from and to the close of the days named in the order granting them.\n\n12. The position of Officers not included in Schedule A will be unchanged as respects leave or furlough.\n\n13. Officers now in the service placing themselves, from a given date, under these rules, shall count service for pension up to that date under the rules to which they were then subject.\n\nSCHEDULE A.\n\nOfficers entering the Staff Corps or Indian Medical Service, and Warrant Officers attaining that rank, after the 31st December, 1875; and\n\nAny other officers, Commissioned or Warrant, belonging to the Indian Army or Medical Service, or Officers of the Staff Corps, who, after the 31st of December, 1875, shall, before asking for leave or furlough, apply in writing to their Local Governments to be placed definitively upon this Schedule; but their service for furlough under Rule 1 shall commence from the date of such entry or such application respectively.\n\nAny Officers in civil employment declared by the Government of India to be under civil leave rules shall not be under these rules.\n\n** The last pay certificate issued to an Officer to whom furlough or leave has been granted shall state the pay to which, under Rule 5, he is at that date entitled in respect to the office he is holding, noticing the date, if any fixed, at which he will vacate it.\n\nWith advertence to the foregoing rules, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify\u2014\n\nI. That no \"extra or special allowances\" drawn by an officer, which are now excluded from the account in calculating furlough pay under the Rules of 1868, can be reckoned in calculating furlough pay under these Rules (Rule 5).\n\nII. That the Governments of the three Presidencies, or their Excellencies the Commanders in Chief, in regard to Officers serving directly under them, shall be held to be the \"local authorities\" named in Rule 10.\n\nIII. That, pending further orders, a Staff Officer granted leave under Rule 10 shall receive, as heretofore, the pay or staff corps pay of his rank, and half the staff salary of his appointment during such leave; but full staff salary may be allowed him for the first two months (as now during privilege leave) when he makes approved arrangements for the performance of his duties during that period. In such cases the Government Officer granting the leave must state that the first two months are to be on full staff pay.\n\nN.B.\u2014It is distinctly to be understood that the rule regarding the pay to be drawn on leave under para. 10 is liable to be modified at any time in any way that the Government of India may deem expedient.\n\nIV.

An officer who is married at the date of his admission into the service must report the fact of his marriage at the time, and the names and dates of birth of his children, if any have been born to him. An officer in the service must report his marriage, or the birth of a child born in wedlock, or the death of a wife or child, within one month of the occurrence, to the Examiner of Fund Accounts in the Presidency, or the Director of Military Funds, India Office, when an officer is in Europe.

The birth of every child born alive must be reported; but if a child die before it is thirty days old, no payment in respect of it will be required.\nPosthumous Child.\n\n16.

An officer who desires to complete his payments during the term of his service in India, so as to be exempt from contributions after his retirement, will be permitted to do so at rates to be determined by the tables appended to General Hannyngton's report, dated London, 7th June 1870, or by any other tables that may be hereafter substituted by the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n18. An officer may at any time commute his future payments into a single payment, the amount of such payment being regulated by the same tables.\n\nDuration of Pensions:\n\n19. If a widow remarry, her pension will cease during coverture, but if she again become a widow she will be entitled to revert to her pension as widow of her first husband, or, if her last husband have been a contributor, to receive a pension at her option as the widow of her last husband. A widow can only receive one pension.\n\n20. The pension of a male orphan is payable until he attains the age of 21 years.\n\n21. The mother or guardian of a male orphan who has completed the age of 16 may, at any time thereafter (on application in Forms F. to H. annexed to these regulations), have the residue of his pension commuted into a single payment, for the due application of which the mother or guardian will be held responsible. The following table gives the commuted values of such pensions:\n\n| Years | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Months | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3   |\n| 0     | 129 | 106 | 81  | 56  | 28  |\n| 3     | 123 | 100 | 75  | 49  | 21  |\n| 6     | 117 | 94  | 68  | 42  | 14  |\n| 9     | 111 | 87  | 62  | 35  | 7   |\n\n22. The pension of a female orphan continues until her marriage, and then ceases absolutely. It does not revive on widowhood.\n\nGood Conduct.\n\n23. The pensions provided under these regulations shall, in all cases, be held during good behaviour only, and will be withheld if any pensioner is found to be leading an immoral life, or on proof of any gross misconduct. The order of the Secretary of State for India in Council in any such case shall be final and conclusive.\n\nAlienation of Pension.\n\n24. A pension paid under these regulations may not be transferred or assigned, or in any way alienated, from the pensioner to whom or for whose benefit it is payable.\n\nPassage Money.\n\n25. An officer may, by a special contribution, provide passage money from India for his widow and orphans. The amount so secured will belong to the officer's estate, but will be primarily applicable to the provision of passage money and outfit for his widow and children. The amount secured must not exceed 1,500 rupees, and a health certificate must in every case be furnished by the subscriber. The value will be determined by the Tables in Major-General Hannyngton's report.\n\nTransfer to Her Majesty's Corps.\n\n26. Officers who may be transferred from the Indian Staff Corps to Her Majesty's Line regiments will be entitled to receive back such portion of their contributions as may be in excess of the risk borne by the fund during their membership.\n\nHalf-Pay.\n\n27. Married officers placed on half-pay may receive back such portions of their contributions as is in excess of the risk borne by the fund during the term of their membership, or they may continue to subscribe at Indian rates for full benefits, or at lower\nrates for reduced benefits. In the event of their return to full pay, they shall in addition to the subscription of their rank, be required to pay such donation as the circumstances of the case may demand. Unmarried officers may continue to subscribe at the Europe rate of subscription, and will not be entitled to any refund in the event of their withdrawal.\n\nRetired Officers.\n\n28. Married officers who retire from the service on the pension of their rank may continue to subscribe in that rank at the Europe rate of subscription, or they may withdraw from the fund, receiving back such portion of their contributions as is in excess of the risk borne by the fund during the term of their membership; but the usual subscription will be deducted from the pension of all such officers until they shall have intimated in writing their intention of withdrawing. Unmarried officers may continue their subscription on the same terms as married officers, but will not be entitled on retirement to any refund in the event of their withdrawal.\n\nDismissed Officers.\n\n29. An officer who is dismissed the service by sentence of a court martial, or by other competent authority, will cease, ipso facto, to be a contributor under these regulations, and will have no claim to any refund. His family will not be entitled to any pensions under these regulations.\n\nCertificates.\n\n30.

Officers will receive Commissions in the Staff Corps on their names being submitted to us by Our Secretary of State for India.\n\n* This portion of the Royal Warrant has been revised by another Royal Warrant, dated 2nd May, 1868, which declares that\u2014\"Our will and pleasure is that from and after the date of this Our Warrant, Officers of Our Land Forces serving in India, under the rank of Regimental Field Officer, who shall have served two years with a Regiment, of which one shall have been in India, shall be eligible to enter the Bengal, Madras, or Bombay Staff Corps.\"\nIt is Our further will and pleasure that the promotion and pay of the Staff Corps shall be regulated as follows:\n\n1.

Officers now in Staff employment in India, joining the Staff Corps on its formation, shall count their previous Staff service towards promotion to the following extent:\n\nOne step of rank will be given to every Officer whose period of service would qualify him for it, according to the above Rules. An interval of two years at least must intervene between each succeeding step.\n\n4. Officers in the Staff Corps will be eligible for Brevet rank in common with the rest of the Army.\n\n5. Officers of the Staff Corps holding Military appointments will take Military Command according to their Army rank, but Officers whilst holding only Civil appointments will not be entitled to assume such Command.\n\n6. Exchanges may be allowed between Officers of the Staff Corps under the substantive rank of Field Officer and Regimental Officers of the same rank on the recommendation of the Indian Governments. Officers of the Staff Corps exchanging into a Regiment will become the Juniors of their Regimental rank.\n\n7. The power of removing Officers from the effective List of the Staff Corps will be exercised by us through Our Secretary of State for India.\n\n8. Officers of the Staff Corps will receive pay according to the following scale:\n\n| Whilst required to remain in India. | Out of India. |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Rs.

Eventually a certain proportion of the senior Officers of the Staff Corps will receive Colonel's allowance.\n\n9. Officers of the Staff Corps will be allowed to retire on the following scale of pension, provided that not less than half of the required periods of service shall have been passed in the Staff Corps:\n\n| SCALE. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|--------|---------|\n| After 20 years' service in India | 191 12 0 per annum. |\n| \" 24 \" | 292 0 0 \" |\n| \" 28 \" | 365 0 0 \" |\n| \" 32 \" | 456 5 0 \" |\n\nRATES INTRODUCED IN 1866.\n\n| After 35 years' service in India | 600 0 0 \" |\n| \" 38 \" | 750 0 0 \" |\n\n* The periods of four, six, and eight years must be passed in the Staff Corps in India.\n\n\u2020 NOTE.\u2014In order to entitle a Staff Corps Officer of the rank of Major-General to the unemployed pay mentioned in the Royal Warrant for that rank, he must have actually served not less than five years in the substantive rank of Field Officer\u2014the above five years being inclusive of any time he shall have been obliged to pass upon half-pay or leave in consequence of ill-health contracted in the service (as established by a Board of Medical Officers), or in consequence of wounds received in action.\n\nAn Officer of the Staff Corps promoted to the rank of Field Officer by Brevet for service in the field, who shall continue to serve uninterruptedly on full pay from the date of his promotion by Brevet to the date of his obtaining the rank of Major-General, is entitled to the unattached pay of that rank, notwithstanding he may not have served five years, with the regimental rank of Field Officer with a regiment, or in one of the situations specified in Clause 8 of the Royal Warrant of 31 Jan., 1859.\nOfficers of Her Majesty's Indian Forces joining the Staff Corps will be entitled to pension under the Regulations of the Indian Service.*\n\n10. Officers of the Staff Corps in England who may not wish to retire, but who are unable to return to India, and Officers removed from the effective List who may not be entitled to retire on the above scale of pension, will be placed on a half-pay list, provided they have served three years in India in the Staff Corps on the same rate of half-pay and on the same conditions as Officers of a similar rank in Our Army.\n\n11. It is also Our will and pleasure that this Warrant shall be administered and interpreted by Our Secretary of State for India in Council, who shall be the sole and standing Authority upon the matters therein contained.\n\nGiven at Our Court at Windsor, this Sixteenth day of January, 1861, in the Twenty-fourth year of Our Reign. By Her Majesty's Command, (Signed) CHARLES WOOD.\n\nCONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT OF BRITISH OFFICERS TO THE STAFF CORPS.\n\nUnless for special applicants, whose cases will receive separate consideration, each on its own merits, it is deemed inexpedient to admit Officers of Her Majesty's British Army to the Staff Corps, whose standing in the service exceeds seven years, or thereabouts.\n\nThe selection of Officers for the Staff Corps rests with the Governments in India. The promotion of Officers while on probation will go on in their respective regiments. Officers of the British Army, when permanently transferred to the Staff Corps, will be removed from the strength of the regiment to which they belonged. It is discretional with the Governments in India to employ the Officers of the Staff Corps, in such manner as they may think best, in the situations for which their respective qualifications may render them most fitted. The appointments and promotions in the several departments rest with the Governments in India, and will be made irrespectively of the rank which the Officers may hold in the Staff Corps.\n\nOfficers of British regiments which may be ordered home and embark before the completion of their period of probation may, with the sanction of the Government of the Presidency, be allowed to remain in India to complete that period.\n\nOfficers of Her Majesty's British Regiments are eligible for appointment to the Staff Corps of any Presidency, without reference to the Presidency in which their regiments may be serving, and they will be permitted to serve out their probation without reference to their regiments being in the meantime moved to another Presidency.\n\nApplication for admission to the Staff Corps, on probation, should be made to the Government, through, and with the sanction of, the Commander-in-Chief of the Presidency, and that of the Commander-in-Chief in India.\n\nA candidate for appointment to the Staff Corps, on probation, must produce the following certificates of his Commanding Officer and the Surgeon:\n\nCertificate of Commanding Officer.\n\nCertified that of the regiment, a candidate for the Staff Corps, completed two years' duty with a regiment on the , one year of which (or the whole period of which, as the case may be), was spent in India.\n\nhas passed the examination in the Native languages by the higher (or lower) standard, and has attained such a knowledge of his drill and duty as an officer of infantry (or cavalry) in all its branches as to qualify him for the command of a company (or troop) in all situations. He also possesses a fair knowledge of the Articles of War and of the Queen's Regulations, as well as of the Military Regulations of the Bengal (Madras or Bombay) Presidency, besides having gained some general acquaintance with the organization and nature of the duties of all branches of the army serving in Bengal (Madras or Bombay).\n\nI further certify that during the period has served with this regiment, he has been attentive to his duty, and that his conduct has been in all respects unexceptionable.\n\nStation and date.\n\nCommanding Regiment.\n\nSurgeon's Certificate.\n\nI certify that, to the best of my belief, is in good bodily health, and apparently well capable of undergoing the vicissitudes of service in India.\n\nStation and date.\n\nSurgeon Regiment.\n\nThe date of transfer of an Officer to the Staff Corps will be that of his appointment on\n\n* See page xliii.\nprobation, except in the case of an Officer who has gained promotion in his regiment during his period of probation; in that case, he is allowed to enter the Staff Corps from the day following his promotion, with the rank then gained.\n\nExcept under very special circumstances, the period of probation will be limited to one year,* at the end of which the candidate, if not qualified for admission to the Staff Corps, must be remanded to his regiment; and should his regiment be in England, he will be put on British pay from the date of failing to pass the final examination. If possible, he will be provided with a passage in a troop ship, but if none be available, then the actual expense of the passage, and no more, will be paid to the agent of the vessel conveying the Officer to England. In no case will the period of probation exceed a second twelve months.\n\nA British Officer, on probation for the Staff Corps, proceeding on leave to Europe, is to be held to have resigned his probationary position and appointment. Should an Officer so circumstanced be placed on the half-pay list, he will cease to be considered as a probationer.\n\nA probationer for the Staff Corps may at any time be allowed to withdraw his application, provided that he has not been actually admitted to that Corps by the Government in India.\n\nAs a general rule, a young Officer, on becoming a probationer, is appointed to do duty with a Native regiment.\n\nOn the completion of the year's probation, the candidate must produce certificates from his Commanding Officer (or the Officer under whom he has served) and from the Surgeon, similar to those obtained at the commencement of his probation; and he must pass an examination in the following tests, according to the nature of the duty or department in which he is to be employed.\n\nOn special grounds, but only when required for the convenience of the public service, examinations may be held at any time within two months of the expiration of the probationary year.\n\nShould he be found qualified, he will be admitted to the Staff Corps, and to the appointment or department for which he has proved his fitness. The circumstance of an Officer being in the Staff Corps will not exempt him from passing departmental tests, should he be transferred from one appointment or department to another.\n\nOfficers of Line Regiments, in which the purchase system was in force up to the 31st October 1871, who entered the service prior to the 26th August, 1871, and whose permanent appointment to the Indian Staff Corps shall appear in the General Orders of one of the Local Governments of India, on a date subsequent to the 15th March, 1868, and who, on the date of such permanent appointment (being the date of appointment as probationers for the Staff Corps), shall not have exceeded four years' service on full pay, from the date of first Commission, shall receive, on their names appearing in the \"London Gazette\" as finally transferred to the Staff Corps, the exact sum such Officers would have received, under War Office Regulations, had they retired from the service by the sale of their Commissions at the time of joining the Staff Corps as probationers.\n\nOfficers who have been appointed probationers subsequent to the 31st October 1871, will be required to make and sign the declaration laid down in para. \"C,\" clause 139, ec. 4 of the Queen's Regulations.\n\nThe young Officers who, on final transfer to the Staff Corps, may receive the value of their commissions, will, if appointed probationers on or after the 1st of July 1870, be debited with the cost of their successors' passage to India, in the same manner as other Officers who are allowed to retire from British Regiments in India with the value of their commissions.\n\nOfficers who are entitled to the value of their first commissions should apply for it to the agents of the regiment to which they formerly belonged.\n\nOfficers who desire to enter the Staff Corps under the provisions of the General Order from the Horse Guards, dated the 1st of May 1868, must make their applications in such time as will admit of the requisite forms being complied with before the completion of their four years' service, as the Government cannot be responsible for any accidental delay, and applications for special consideration will not be received hereafter.\n\nOfficers joining the Staff Corps from the British Army must furnish a statement of their services duly vouched by their late Commanding Officers, showing in detail their actual service in India, and the periods of leave during such service, completed to the date of their transfer to the Staff Corps.\n\n* All leave, except privilege leave and leave to pass in the Native languages for admission to the Staff Corps, will be excluded from the year's probation.\nNo Officers while away from their regiments as probationers for the Indian Staff Corps shall be permitted to retire from the service by the sale of their commissions, but such officers will still be eligible for such promotion in their regiments as may occur whilst they are probationers by or without purchase.\n\nThe claims to pension of widows and families of officers of the Staff Corps who may join from the British Army will be treated under the provisions of the Royal Warrant of the 27th December 1870, or of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British officers as may be in force at the time being.\n\n### TABLE OF

further Regulations for governing the Promotion in the Army of the Officers of Our Indian Forces, Our will and pleasure is, that the Regulations annexed to this Our Royal Warrant be established, and be the sole Regulations under which the Promotion in the Army of such Officers shall be effected.\n\nGiven at Our Court at Windsor this 21st day of December, 1871, in the Thirty-fifth Year of Our Reign. By Her Majesty's Command, ARGYLL.\n\n1. Field Marshals shall be appointed at the will of the Sovereign, and the rank shall be conferred without reference to seniority.\n\n2. The names of General Officers shall be borne upon three separate lists. The first shall contain the names of those on the fixed establishment; the second, those who having been promoted out of their regular turn are supernumerary to the fixed establishment; and the third, those who have retired from the service with the honorary rank of general officers.\n\n3. The fixed establishment of General Officers shall be the following:\n\n| Generals | - | 33 |\n| Lieutenant-Generals | - | 53 |\n| Major-Generals | - | 87 |\n\nTotal | - | 173 |\n\n4. Promotion on the establishment from the rank of lieutenant-general to that of general, and from the rank of major-general to that of lieutenant-general, shall be made as vacancies occur, according to seniority, subject however to the provision laid down in the last paragraph of clause 11.\n\n5. Every vacancy on the establishment of general officers shall be filled by the promotion of the senior colonel, subject to the provision in the last paragraph of clause 11, or by the transfer of a general officer from the supernumerary list as provided in clause 8.\n\n6. Temporary rank and command as general, lieutenant-general, or major-general, may, for the convenience of Our service be conferred, without regard to seniority, on lieutenant-generals, major-generals, or colonels respectively; and if the officer during the continuance of such temporary rank and command shall have conducted himself to Our satisfaction, the rank so held may, upon the recommendation of Our Governor-General in Council, be converted into permanent rank after having been held for five years in time of peace, or for any shorter period in the field during war. A colonel who shall vacate an appointment as temporary major-general, and whose temporary rank shall not have been made permanent, may, upon the recommendation of Our Governor-General in Council, be made an honorary major-general, and shall retain that rank until he succeed to the establishment in virtue of his seniority on the list of colonels.\n\n7. Promotion may be conferred upon a lieutenant-general, major-general, or colonel, without regard to seniority, for distinguished service in the field, and in such case the recommendation of Our Governor-General in Council, detailing the services for which the officer is promoted, shall be published in the General Orders of Our Indian military forces, and in the \"London Gazette.\"\n\n8. An officer not below the rank of colonel, promoted after temporary service in a higher rank, or for distinguished service in the field, shall be borne as supernumerary, and shall not be placed on the establishment in his new rank until the time when he would have attained such rank by seniority; that is to say, when the surviving officer who stood next senior on the list to the officer promoted under clause 6 or 7, shall have attained the same rank on the establishment, the next vacancy shall be filled by the transfer of the supernumerary general officer to the establishment.\n\n9. A supernumerary major-general, who has been promoted after temporary service and absorbed, under clause 8, into the establishment, shall have seniority according to the date of his permanent rank as major-general, and shall rise to be lieutenant-general and general, whether before or after his absorption into the establishment, in accordance with that seniority. A supernumerary general officer who has been promoted for distinguished service in the field, and absorbed under clause 8, shall take his seniority from the date of his promotion as published in the \"London Gazette.\"\n\n10. The officers of the Staff Corps on the Indian List having been transferred to the general list of the British army according to the regulations contained in clause 39 of Our Royal Warrant of the 27th of December, 1870, their names shall be retained on the Indian List in italics, until their death or retirement, for the purpose of regulating the promotion of the officers below them on that list.\n\n11. On the occurrence of a vacancy in the fixed number of General Officers on\nthe Indian List, specified in clause 3 of this Warrant, whether among those who remain effective on that list, or among those whose names are merely retained in italics, and who shall be considered as forming part of the said fixed establishment, the name of the senior officer in each grade on the Indian List below that in which the vacancy may occur (with the exception of the grade of lieutenant-colonel), shall be moved up to the next higher grade; but in the case of the officers whose names remain in italics, there shall be no actual promotion, the arrangement being limited to the transfer of the names for the purpose of regulating the promotion of those officers who remain effective on the Indian List; and the promotion of an effective colonel on the Indian List to the rank of major-general shall in no case be affected by casualties among the general officers of the staff corps, until the number of general officers to be added to the British Establishment under clause 24 of Our said Royal Warrant of the 27th of December 1870, shall be complete.\n\n12. The rank of brigadier-general shall be local or temporary only.\n\n13. A lieutenant-colonel may attain the rank of colonel\u2014\n\n(a.)
