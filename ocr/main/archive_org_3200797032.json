At a quarter to four o'clock that morning Lilly, a constable, No. 332 K, was on duty in Caroline-street, when he met the prisoner, and he said, \"I have just come from a fire,\" alluding to a conflagration in Philpot-street, Commercial-road, \"and there is another one up the street, close to the brewery.\" Lilly caught hold of him, and found that his coat and hands were covered with whitewash, and on being asked to account for it he said, \"I have just come from a fire; I'll show you where it is.\" On reaching No. 2, which is an unoccupied house, prisoner pulled open the shutters and said, \"Can't you hear the fire now?\" and Lilly then heard the crackling of wood. He sprang his rattle, and William Gadd, sergeant, 23 H, and Alfred Ford, 358 K, came up. Ford got in the window, and on opening the back parlour door he found the staircase in flames; also the ground and basement floor partly burnt. Lilly ran for the turncock, and in the meantime Sergeant Gadd and Ford, assisted by a man with a hose in the Commercial Brewery, next door to the house, commenced playing on the fire. In ten minutes' time a fire engine arrived, and the flames were extinguished. Sergeant Gadd gave the prisoner into custody. The prisoner said he went to put out the fire. He was remanded, one surety in \u00a320 being accepted for his appearance.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200797032.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1706, "total-output-tokens": 404, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1511, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
