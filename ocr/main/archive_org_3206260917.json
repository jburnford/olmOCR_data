James Bain, minister of the Established Church of Duthil, \u00a31,000 as damages. There had been some strong expressions of opinion in the neighbourhood as to the condition of the graves in the churchyard, and the people resented an examination which was made, by order of the Home Secretary, by two medical officers of health. Mr. Bain published in a local newspaper a letter in which he asserted that he had detected Allan and another farmer in the act of probing graves with a stick. This statement, it was contended, had done the plaintiff much harm in the neighbourhood, by fixing upon him the opprobrium of disturbing the graves. The defendant was examined, and said he found Allan turning the stick round and round in a hole he had made, but which he accused the minister of having made previously. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206260917.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1798, "total-output-tokens": 250, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1034, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
