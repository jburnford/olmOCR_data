He took hold of her leg up her petticoats, pulled her foot out of the stirrup, and then again put his hand up her dress, and took hold of her leg above the knee, pinching and hurting it very much. He then pushed her off the horse, and she must have fallen had not a gentleman caught her. The prisoner was then taken to the station. The horses were not hired of the defendant, and he had nothing to do with them, he being a donkey driver.\u2014Mr. Oliver, of 10, Quadrant-grove, Kentish-town, proved the above. A boy tried to throw her off her horse, and the prisoner made use of bad language.\u2014The prisoner in an insolent manner denied the charge, and said \"he had never seen them 'ere young women afore.\"\u2014The magistrate fined the defendant 40s. and costs, or in default one month's hard labour in the house of correction.\u2014The prisoner was locked up in default.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206211502.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1844, "total-output-tokens": 355, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1341, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
