Foreign Member of the Academies of Brufels and Caen, and Correspondent of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris.\n\nTO THE REV. DR. MASKELYNE.\n\nREV. SIR,\n\nRead May 7, 1778. The inclosed observations are a sequel to those I communicated to you in 1775, and which are printed in the LXVIth vol. of Phil. Trans. for the year 1776.\n\nLouvain being a very considerable and the only university in the Austrian Netherlands, and upon that account a town of very great note, I was particularly desirous of settling its longitude and latitude with all the accuracy my situation and time would admit of; and the more so, that I believe myself to be the first person who ever made any astronomical observations in that place, and\nand the first, of course, who has determined its position with any degree of certainty: there is, however, reason to think, that the government there will, in a short time, provide an observatory, and supply the same with proper instruments; the first use of which will, no doubt, be to verify the inclosed observations. I spared no pains to render their results as accurate as possible. With this view I collected, by the help of my friends, all the observations of Jupiter's satellites I could, corresponding to each of ours; convinced by a mature consideration of this matter, that the most effectual method of obviating the unavoidable errors which arise from the different goodness and power of instruments from the different conformation of eyes, different states of the atmosphere and other circumstances, is to compare each observation to as great a number corresponding as possible, made in different places by known observers, whose longitudes from a given meridian are well determined, and then taking a mean arising from each such comparison. The amazing differences which not unfrequently are found in observations of this kind, even among astronomers of high note, confirm me still more in this opinion; and I own, I should prefer, in order to settle the longitude of any place by Jupiter's satellites, three or four immersions and as many emersions, made in favourable circumstances,\nand compared with a great number of corresponding ones, made in different places, to a far greater number, which could but be compared with those of one or two astronomers only. If this consideration be of the weight it appears to me, it has not been sufficiently attended to, and I mention it as it may be of use, particularly to young astronomers.\n\nThe meridian zenith distances of the Sun and stars were taken with a quadrant one foot and a half radius made by Bird, exactly and very steadily fixed in the plane of the meridian. The declinations of the fixed stars, with the equations for aberration and nutation, were taken from the Connoissance des Temps; the Sun's declination from the Nautical Almanac; its parallax and refractions, with the corrections for the barometer and thermometer, were computed from Mayer's tables published by the Board of Longitude. It may not be improper to add, that, when I observed both the upper and lower limbs of the Sun upon the meridian, I made the horizontal wire of the quadrant merely a tangent to the Sun's limb; for which reason its diameter will come out by such observations considerably greater than it really was.\n\nFor the observations of Jupiter's satellites we used a reflector two feet and a half focal length, a telescope by Short,\nshort, 18 inches focus, and sometimes an achromatic treble-object glass of the same length, and not much inferior to it, made by Mr. Ramsden; the times were got by a quadrant and a grid-iron pendulum.\n\nIt is necessary to mention the difference of meridians between Paris and the places where the observations were made to which we compared our own; the more so, as some are not generally known, and others differ a small matter, from what is commonly supposed and printed in the Connoissance des Tems.\n\nM. Messier, in communicating a considerable number of observations, informed me in a letter of the longitudes of the following places:\n\nCorbeil East of R. Observatory at Paris, \u2014 \u2014 o 38\nNolon, Mem. of Acad. of Sciences, 1764, \u2014 o 345\nPerinaldo, by nine corresponding observations of 24's first satellite, o 21 33\n\nBy a letter from Mr. Mallet,\n\nGeneva, \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 o 14 40\n\nAnd by a letter on this occasion from M. Bernoulli,\n\nBerlin, East, \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 o 44 10\nMilan, East of ditto, \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 o 27 24\nPetersburg, \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 i 52 o\n\nBy the Rev. Mr. Hornsby's letter,\n\nOxford, West of Greenwich, 4' 59''; hence of Paris, o 14 15\n\nBy Mr. Dalby's letter,\n\nMuswell-hill, 30'' West of Greenwich, and of Paris, \u2014 o 9 46\nThe longitudes of the other observatories are assumed, as set down in the *Connoissance des Tems*, 1777, as being well settled.\n\nTwenty seconds were added to, or subtracted from, the observations of the satellites made at Greenwich, with the six-feet reflector, on account of the great and superior power of that instrument.\n\nAlthough Jupiter's satellites observed at Brussels be emersions only, nevertheless, as they agree with what the astronomers of the Academy of Sciences at Paris have done, as appears by the *Connoissance des Tems*, the result is well established.\n\nBeing desirous of affording every means of examining and forming a right judgement of these observations, I could not avoid saying thus much concerning them. It now remains for me to return you my thanks for the obliging communication of your observations.\n\nI am, &c.\n\nNATH. PIGOTT.\nLatitude of the Refuge de Vrowperg, Rue des Dominicaines, at Louvain.\n\n| Year | Month | Date | Description                                      | Latitude

quadrant to the East and West, in order to determine the error of the line of collimation, which I found to be 25', to be subtracted from the observed zenith distances, I computed the latitude likewise from the same stars, and can depend the more upon the result from them, as, being so near the zenith, they were little affected by refraction, and not at all by the error of the line of collimation, because observed both on the quadrantal arc and arc of excess.\n\nBy \u03b6 ur\u1e63ae majoris the latitude was found, \u2014 50\u00b0 53' 1\"\nBy \u03b5 ur\u1e63ae majoris the latitude
