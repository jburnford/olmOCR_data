Jones was further charged with stealing a brooch from a room at 85, Geneva-road, Brixton.\u2014The case showed the good look-out that police-officers have with regard to protection of the public and property. On Monday afternoon, Detective Dalton, W, was passing through Loughborough-park in plain clothes, when he noticed the prisoners loitering about in front of several houses. Having obtained permission from a lady living nearly opposite to where the men were to go into her house so as to keep observation upon their movements, and finding that they moved a little distance further, he was obliged by the lady with a pair of field glasses. These he used with such good effect as to enable him not only to identify the prisoners, but to follow their every movement. He saw Davies go into the front garden of 124, and creep along on his hands and knees to the parlour window. The other two prisoners remained, as it were, on guard outside. Jones, after some little time, forced the window and entered the room. In a few moments he returned carrying a bundle, and then joined his associates. Dalton followed them some little distance, and saw Davis and Morris go into a public-house. He then stopped Jones and asked him about his conduct, upon which he made a blow at the officer, who seized him. A determined struggle ensued, in the course of which Jones \"slipped\" two coats, one of which was afterwards identified as being stolen from the house mentioned. The officer, however, determined not to let his man escape, seized him by a belt he was wearing. This the prisoner, however, \"slipped,\" but to his dismay Dalton made use of this by putting it round his (prisoner's) neck and so holding him until further assistance arrived. The other prisoners shortly afterwards came up, when Dalton called upon several parties who had assembled to assist him in securing them, but owing to the violent threats the parties were afraid to help. Fortunately, however, information had been sent to the station, and Inspector Mars dispatched constables to the assistance of Dalton, and the prisoners were after considerable difficulty removed in custody.\u2014Mr. Biron ordered a remand, and at the same time wished to express his approval of the manner in which Dalton, the constable, had acted. To further mark his sense of the officer's conduct he wrote on the charge-sheet as follows:\u2014\"Constable Dalton deserves, in my opinion, great praise for his conduct in this case. He is well known at this court as an excellent officer.\"\u2014The prisoners, who throughout the hearing treated the whole matter with the greatest indifference, were then remanded.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206257721.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 694, "total-output-tokens": 655, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2962, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
