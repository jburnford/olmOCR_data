JOHNSTONE AND ANOTHER.\u2014This was an action (tried in the Court of Queen's Bench yesterday morning) against the proprietor of the Standard newspaper for a libel contained in a leading article, published in the Standard shortly after the trial of the plaintiff at Brussels, on the alleged charges of murder and forgery.\n\nMr. Baker Greene said that it would be mere affectation to infer that the gentlemen of the jury were ignorant of the case which had just terminated, and in which the plaintiff in the present action had obtained a verdict. The present case, however, was a totally different one, the onus being thrown on the defendants, who were the proprietor and publisher of the Standard, Evening Standard, and Herald. The defendants did not deny the libel; they admitted it, and had placed four distinct pleas on the record. In the first place they pleaded that the libels were inserted without malice; secondly, that they were inserted without gross negligence; thirdly, that before the action was commenced, they inserted an ample apology; and, fourthly, for the damages which the plaintiff had sustained they had paid 20s. into court as compensation. If the jury were of opinion that the defendants did not establish any one of those pleas, it would be their duty to return a verdict for the plaintiff. Having stated the issue involved, the learned counsel proceeded to explain the facts of the case and the libels complained of. He said that the plaintiff had never traded on his reputation, and even at the present time he was perfectly prepared, if the defendants would withdraw the imputations which they had made on the plaintiff, to discontinue the action.\n\nMr. Coleridge said the defendants had already done so in the fullest possible way, and they thought that quite sufficient; they had corrected every point on which the plaintiff had requested correction in his own words. He was quite willing on behalf of the defendants that a juror should be withdrawn.\u2014Mr. Baker Greene could not assent to that course.\n\nA copy of the apology which the plaintiff had desired should be inserted was put in and read. The letters of the defendants admitting the libel were also put in. This was the case for the plaintiff.\n\nMr. Coleridge addressed the jury on behalf of the defendants, and said he left the issue with the greatest confidence in the hands of the jury.\n\nThe learned judge summed up and the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206230154.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1016, "total-output-tokens": 544, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2505, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
