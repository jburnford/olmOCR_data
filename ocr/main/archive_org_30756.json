DRAKE-BROCKMAN, F.R.C.S.E.,\n\nIndian Medical Service,\n\nAgency Surgeon, Eastern Rajputana States,\n\nFellow of the Royal Institute of Public Health,\n\nFellow of the Zoological Society of London,\n\nMember of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\n\n&c., &c., &c.\n\nAJMER:\n\nSCOTTISH MISSION INDUSTRIES CO., LTD.\nPREFACE.\n\nI have endeavoured in these pages to furnish information and facts relating to the history of the several States (as well as their respective Chiefs), and the physical and economic condition of their inhabitants, which I trust will prove of real value to Medical and other Officers who may come after me, affording them an insight into the life and condition of the people living in these States, such as has not usually formed a marked feature in other similar works, but which, nevertheless, I venture to suggest, are very important as well as necessary, and should be known to every Medical Officer holding this charge.\n\nThe text has been profusely illustrated, where possible or necessary, by means of Maps and Plans, to my mind a valuable and instructive addition to a work of this nature, and one which I feel sure will be appreciated by the reader. A complete list of villages (together with their population in the last Census of 1901, etc.), in the three States has also been added, which should be useful to Officers touring in these Districts.\n\nThe task of collecting the information and details necessary for the compilation of this work has been an exceedingly difficult and laborious one, in that, owing to the deficiency, and, in some instances entire absence of any reliable records, much of that recorded has had in the first instance to be obtained by personal enquiry, often to be subsequently confirmed or otherwise by investigation on the spot, a tedious process at the best of times, but one which, in this particular instance, has been rendered more irksome by the fact that I have been transferred to other appointments during the period in which this work has been in progress, thus materially delaying its completion.\n\nCordial acknowledgments are due to Mr. J. A. Devenish, C.E., State Engineer in the Bharatpur State, for much valuable information regarding irrigation in that State, and for the many excellent Maps and Plans with which the book is provided, and also to Mr. A. N. C.E., State Engineer of the Dholpur State, for similar aid afforded in connection with the section on that State. I must also express my indebtedness to Colonel Powlett's Gazetteer of Karauli for information regarding geographical data, etc., which has been useful, as also to Munshi Jwala Sahai's History of Bharatpur, for many important details of much interest in connection with the sieges of our.\n\nH.

It is bounded on the north by the Gurgaon District of the Punjab, on the east by the Muttra and Agra Districts of the United Provinces, on the south by the Native States of Dholpur and Karauli, on the south-west by Jaipur, and on the west by Alwar territory.\n\nThe land in Bharatpur territory is generally fertile and usually flat. The marked fertility of the land contributes towards rendering the revenues of the State superior to those of many a State of equal and even greater area in Rajputana; but this is also brought about, I fancy, by means of the large numbers of Jats and Meos inhabiting it, who are born cultivators, and utilize every available square yard of the land for purposes of cultivation, as well as due in great part to the excellent system of irrigation which prevails throughout the State, and which has of late years been so materially improved and added to during the time that the administration of the State has been under British control.\n\nA large extent of hilly country exists in the southern portion of the State, which is much intersected by ravines, and is called the \"Dang,\" being inhabited principally by a sturdy and fine caste of men called Gujars, who, however, bear an unenviable notoriety for dacoity, but whose members nevertheless are enlisted in large numbers as recruits for our native army, and, I am told, turn out excellent soldiers. At Baretha and Bansi Paharpur, on these hills, there are quarries of white and red sandstone, very useful for building purposes. The supply of this stone in slabs, pillars, and various other forms is very great, as not only are the houses in Bharatpur, Dig and other towns of the State built of this material, but it is also exported in large quantities to Agra, Delhi and other distant places.\nElevations above sea level of the more important hills in this State, as found by great Trigonometrical Survey, are shown in the following table:\n\n| Name of Hill | Pergunnah in which situated | Position | Elevation above the level of the Sea |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|\n|              |                             | Latitude | Longitude                           |\n| Alipur       | Akheygarh                   | 27\u00b0 8\"   | 77\u00b0 1\"                              | 1,357 |\n| Chapra       | Pahari                      | 27\u00b0 43\"  | 77\u00b0 3\"                              | 1,222 |\n| Damdama      | Biana                       | 26\u00b0 54\"  | 77\u00b0 17\"                             | 1,222 |\n| Rasia        | Nagar                       | 27\u00b0 26\"  | 77\u00b0 12\"                             | 1,065 |\n| Usira        | Rupbas                      | 26\u00b0 57\"  | 77\u00b0 40\"                             | 817   |\n| Madhoni      | Bharatpur                   | 27\u00b0 13\"  | 77\u00b0 28\"                             | 725   |\n\nRivers.\u2014There are no perennial rivers in the State; the four rivers, viz., the Utangan or Banganga, the Gambhir, the Kakund and the Ruparel, which pass through the State, flow only during the rains, and dry up entirely two or three months after the latter have ceased. The Banganga, which enters the State on the west from Jaipur territory, and passes on to the Agra District on the south-east is said to damage the fertility of the land by depositing sand upon it; this statement, however, is not, I think, supported by results, and this silted material, which is deposited, I should fancy must be rich in organic matter, and of itself must materially benefit the land. The advantages of saturating the intervening tracts of arable land, and ultimately providing a copious supply of drinking water to the city of Bharatpur, where the well water is extremely brackish, counteracts any harm which may be done by the introduction of sand. This arrangement is, however, open to grave objections on sanitary grounds, proving detrimental to the public health in many ways, but as such will be commented upon later; nothing further need be said about it here. The Jaipur State had intended in 1873 to prevent the flow of this river\ninto Bharatpur territory by a masonry embankment thrown across it at Jamwai Ramgarh; this was with reason strongly objected to by the Bharatpur Durbar. After long discussion and enquiry, the Government of India decided that the Jaipur Durbar should take upon itself the responsibility of compensating any loss that the embankment might cause to Bharatpur, but the Durbar refused to undertake this responsibility, and the project had to be given up entirely.\n\nThe Gambhir also comes from Jaipur territory at the south, and after receiving the waters of the Kakund, about 8 miles higher, joins the Banganga near the village of Kurka in the Biana tehsil.\n\nThe Kakund, a tributary of the Gambhir, rises in the hills in the Karauli State, and enters Bharatpur territory on the southern border of the Dang. Its course for several miles is over an elevated rocky plateau, from which it descends by a series of falls near the village Gordha Daro; and at one of the falls called Dir the water is very deep and never dries up. It is the waters of this river that are collected and dammed up by the Baretha Bund, a very large and extensive work, which appears to have been commenced some years ago and then abandoned, being ultimately completed in the year 1899 by the P. W. D. of this State, under the supervision of Mr. Devenish, the State Engineer.\n\nThe Ruparel, entering the western border from Alwar territory, is held up by a very extensive irrigation work called the Sikri Bund, which curves round in a southern direction. The bund is 8 miles in length and has 21 masonry outlets, sufficient to discharge 15,650 cubic feet of water per second in heavy floods. It is intended not to store water, but simply to hold it up for distribution as necessary, according to the requirements of agriculture. Of the two main courses to which, through these outlets, the water is led, one flows to the north-east towards Gopalgarh, Pahari and Kaman, and the other to southeast towards Dig, Kumher and Bharatpur. The effectual irrigation of land in these pergunnahs greatly depends upon this river, and so much of the water is utilized on the way that except in years of very heavy rains it never passes to the opposite border of the State to enter the Muttra and Agra Districts. The water of the Ruparel being so much needed by Bharatpur, the Alwar State was bound, in\nan engagement entered into by Nawab Ahmad Bakhsh Khan, Vakil of Alwar, on the 21st of Rajab 1220 Hijri (A.D. 1805), to keep the bund of Laswari Nadi (the Ruparel) always open, in so far as is necessary for the benefit of the country of the Bharatpur Rajah, with the promise that the \"Maharajah (of Alwar) will strictly adhere to this agreement.\" Deviation from the terms of this agreement on the part of Alwar, however, caused constant disputes between the two States, till Colonel Sir Henry Montgomery Lawrence, the Agent Governor-General for Rajputana, decided in 1855 that from 10th June to 9th October, four months every year, Bharatpur should receive the water of the river freely, and in the remaining eight months Alwar can utilize it by means of temporary bunds or any other means. As, however, the subject of irrigation in this State will be fully dealt with by the late State Engineer, who has kindly consented to write a note on the subject for this Gazetteer, I shall refer the reader to it for further information.\n\nRailways.\u2014Bharatpur State is traversed by the Agra-Bandikui section of the Rajputana-Malwa Railway for a distance of 34 miles, and the stations on the line within the State are Ikran, Bharatpur, Helak and Nadbai. A new line of railway has already been surveyed, which when sanctioned by the Government of India, will pass through the State directly north and south, and connect up Karauli, providing through communication with Delhi and the north, vide map attached.\n\nRoads.\u2014The chief roads in the State are the Agra-Ajmer road (31 miles), Bharatpur-Dig-Kaman road (34 miles), Bharatpur-Muttra (22 miles), Bharatpur-Fatehpur-Sikri (8 miles), Bharatpur-Biana (24 miles), Dig-Gordhan (5 miles), and Dig-Nagar to Alwar border (25 miles). Besides these, which are metalled, there are other good katcha roads, e.g., that connecting Agra with Hindoun, passing through Biana and running for 29 miles within this State, and others connecting Kaman with Gopalgarh, Uchain with Bhusawar, &c.\n\nOn page 5 is a table showing the mileage between most of the important towns in the State.\nTable showing Mileage between the important Towns in the

more or less at the confluence of the waters of the rivers Ruparel and Banganga, those of the former being stored in the Moti Jheel Bund, about a mile due north of the city, while those of the latter, being brought from the Ajan Bund to the Atal Bund adjoining the city, furnish the moat around the fort with a large supply of water annually, which replenishes the wells used by the inhabitants for drinking and other purposes. In years of excessive floods the city has been in danger of being submerged. This evil has now been partially remedied by an excellent system of drainage instituted by the State P.W.D., as well as better control over the water in the Ajan Bund; and shortly a direct channel into the Atal Bund is to be brought from the Kunj Behari mori on the Agency Sewar Road, which will prevent a large amount of very unnecessary inundation. This low-lying position of the city has been, however, very advantageous in time of war, as the water in the bunds or hills in the vicinity can be easily allowed to pour into the earthworks' ditch, and thus render the place doubly fortified against attack; this was doubtless the reason which prevented the army under Lord Lake from approaching the city wall, and ultimately resulted in total failure of the siege of 1805. But in 1826 a party of Lord Combermere's troops, who had been previously stationed at the Moti Jheel to watch the escape of water from the lake, made an attack upon the city, which ultimately ended in its capture. The city is nearly five miles in circumference, the length from south-west to north-east being about 3 miles, and the breadth a little less than one mile and a half. A high metalled road lined on each side by fine trees constructed by Major Morrison, a former Political Agent, for the purposes of communication as well as to serve the purpose of protecting the city from floods, encircles the city and is five and a half miles in length. No such completely circular road surrounds any other capital city in Rajputana. Inside this road are a wide and deep ditch and a mud wall of great height and thickness, which aid in\nfortifying the place. The city can be entered by the ten following gates:\u2014(1) Muttra gate, facing east; (2) Bir Narayan gate, facing south-east; (3) Atal Bund gate, and (4) the Nimdah gate, facing south; (5) the Anah gate (6) the Chandpol, and (7) Basan gates, all facing west; (8) the Gordhan gate, and (9) the Jagina gate, facing north; and (10) the Surajpol gate, facing west. The main street, or bazar through the city from the Muttra gate to the Kumher gate is paved with stone slabs, and many of the other principal streets also are either paved or metalled. The four noteworthy buildings in the city are:\u2014Two temples, one of Lachmanji, a particular deity of the ruling family, and the other dedicated to Ganga, generally sacred to all Hindus, the Jama Masjid, and lastly but by no means least the Victoria Hospital. The Ganga Mandar and Jama Masjid are built at the cost of all State servants respectively of the Hindu and Mahomedan religions, by the order of late Maharajah Balwant Singh. One month's pay of every newly-entertained servant is deducted for the purpose, and as only a small sum of money is collected during the year from this source, the progress of these buildings has been slow; but notwithstanding that the work was commenced about fifty years ago, they are still incomplete! The Charbagh Kothi was, until lately, used as the Session Judge's Court, but was transferred to the Medical Department of the State on the erection of the Victoria Hospital, and after several additions and alterations by the State P. W. D. forms now a part of the Hospital buildings. The whole of this estate has now been built over, and forms the now well-known Victoria Hospital, recently erected by the State in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of our late much-lamented Queen Empress, and regarding which I shall give a full and further description later on. In the north-west portion of the city is a masonry stone fort of square dimensions, occupying a prominent situation, with high walls, and surrounded by a moat about 200 feet wide, very deep, and containing large quantities of fish. There are two gates into the Fort, the roads to which cross the moat by masonry bridges; the one facing south called the Choburja gate, has a little fortification of four towers before it, hence the name Choburja, and the other to the north, named Asht Dhati gate, was so called from the Hasht Dhati, or eight metalled gate, brought\nby Maharajah Jawahir Singh from Delhi on his conquest of that city. The palaces forming the residence of the Maharajah and his family are within the Fort. One of them, locally called the Kamra, is a building of much renown in the surrounding country. It was built by Maharajah Balwant Singh after English style, for the reception and accommodation originally of his European guests. There are also, within the Fort, one or two fine old palaces now uninhabited and in ruins. The palace at present inhabited by the ruling Chief is of modern design, and not by any means handsome. It is surmounted by a clock tower, and is lighted throughout by electric light. The Fort itself has eight bastions, the first of which, called the Jawahir Burj, with palaces upon it built by Maharajah Jawahir Singh, is on the north; (2), the Burj of Khan Douran Khan on the west; (3), the Sinsina Burj, also called Jeth Malwali on the south-west; (4), the Bagar Burj, and (5), Burj of Nawal Singh, built by a thakur of that name, on the south; (6), the Bhainsawali and (7), the Burj of Gokal Ram Risaldar on the east; and (8), the Kalka Burj on the north-east.\n\nBharatpur was once a thriving city, but its population has much decreased of late years owing to the following causes:\u2014Firstly, it was a mart for the purchase and sale of salt, which was manufactured in large quantities in the pergunnahs of Bharatpur, Kumher and Dig. The annual produce of salt amounted to about 150,000 maunds, yielding an income of about Rs. 3,00,000 to the State, and gave employment to many thousands of people. The profits accruing from the manufacture of it were great, and larger, it is said, than the net State revenue! Namak-ka-Katla was a wealthy and flourishing part of the city, but since the suppression of this source of industry in 1879, the Katla has become almost depopulated. Secondly, as the late Maharajah Jaswant Singh lived throughout his life at Sewar, four miles to the west, elected for its salubrity by Major Morrison during the Maharajah's minority, a large number of State servants, in order to live with their master, had to remove to Sewar and desert their houses in the city, and it was not till after his death and accession of his son, Ram Singh, who took up his residence in the Fort Palaces, that Bharatpur resumed a populated appearance. This also has lately largely increased under British administration, and\nsoon the difficulty will be to provide sufficient accommodation, and prevent overcrowding within the walls of the city.\n\n**Municipality.**\u2014A Municipal Board has, at my suggestion and under my control, recently been started on the same lines as in British territory, to which have been entrusted more or less the usual duties of such a body.\n\nThis Board has taken over all the duties hitherto carried on by the \"Sanitary Board,\" which was instituted some years ago, and did such good work for the place and people.\n\nBharatpur is said to have been originally founded by Rustam, a Jat of the Sograya clan about 200 years ago, when it was only a small mud fort. In 1733 Maharajah Suraj Mull took it from Khem Karan, the son of Rustam, and improved it, building the larger Fort, and also the earthworks around the city. It was named Bharatpur after Phurath, the brother of Ram of Ajodhia, whose other brother Lachman is worshipped as the family deity by the Chief, and whose name is also engraved in the State arms and seals. The name of Ram is usually repeated in ordinary compliments by the people of Bharatpur as \"Ram Ram Sahib.\"\n\n**Military.**\u2014There are two regiments of Imperial Service Troops stationed here, one of Infantry and the other a Transport Corps. The former is located in excellent lines at Kanjoli, about two miles north along the Dig road, the latter at the village of Mandholi, about three miles due west of the city near Sewar. There are also one Cavalry and three Infantry regiments of State troops. The army of Bharatpur, including irregulars, as reported in 1890, consisted of 8,207 infantry, 1,647 cavalry, 298 artillerymen and 12 guns, classed serviceable. Of these forces, the Durbar placed a regiment of 600 cavalry, and another of 800 infantry at the disposal of the Government of India for Imperial service. The number of Raj troops has, however, been of late years much reduced.\n\n**Hospitals.**\u2014Besides the Victoria Hospital here, about which I shall have more to say later on, there is a very good Out-patient Dispensary situated in the centre of the city, which is very popular.\n\nA Female Dispensary and Zenana Hospital also exist in connection with the Victoria Hospital, the latter having\naccommodation for 12 purdah-nashin women. Further details regarding Medical Institutions will be found under \"Medical Department.\"\n\nPrisons.\u2014The Central Prison and Subsidiary Jail and Lunatic Asylum are located out at Sewar. A large Printing department is also in progress in connection with the Central Jail Factory, and worked entirely by prisoners. Further details will be found under the section \"Jail Department.\"\n\nSchools.\u2014There is an excellent City School lately built and situated near the City Dispensary in the centre of the city, under the superintendence of a competent school-master, which is very popular. Particulars of this will be found under the section\u2014\"Educational Department.\"\n\nTehsil.\u2014Bharatpur is the head-quarters of the Deorhi Tehsil.\n\nPost Offices.\u2014Of these there are two, one central in the heart of the city, the other in the Agency compound. Attached to both of these are Telegraph Offices, the latter office being in direct communication with Agra by a special wire, which is a great convenience to the public, and expedites telegraphic communication with other parts.\n\nDig.\n\nNext to Bharatpur in importance and renowned for its fountain palaces, called Bhawans, is the town of Dig, situated to the north-west of, and 23 miles from, Bharatpur. It is a very old town, mentioned in the Skandh Puran, and in the 4th chapter of Bhagwat Mahatam as Dirgh or Dirghpur, meaning \"large.\" The reason why it was so named appears to be, that on the site where Dig now stands was situated the larger of two hamlets belonging to the older town, Ow, three miles to the south, and its designation as \"Dirgh\" or \"large\" has been converted into the present name Dig.\n\nDig is situated to the south of Manus Nayi, the southeastern branch of the Ruparel river, and though the town itself has not a very low position, there are many depressions along the course of the river, such as Kho Dahar, the Shishamwala Bund, the Gordhan Darwaza Bund, and others around the town. Dig is enclosed by earth-works now in ruins, which, on the west side of the town, are strengthened by a masonry wall, and is entered by the nine following gates:\u2014\naccommodation for 12 purdah-nashin women. Further details regarding Medical Institutions will be found under \"Medical Department.\"\n\nPrisons.\u2014The Central Prison and Subsidiary Jail and Lunatic Asylum are located out at Sewar. A large Printing department is also in progress in connection with the Central Jail Factory, and worked entirely by prisoners. Further details will be found under the section \"Jail Department.\"\n\nSchools.\u2014There is an excellent City School lately built and situated near the City Dispensary in the centre of the city, under the superintendence of a competent school-master, which is very popular. Particulars of this will be found under the section\u2014\"Educational Department.\"\n\nTehsil.\u2014Bharatpur is the head-quarters of the Deorhi Tehsil.\n\nPost Offices.\u2014Of these there are two, one central in the heart of the city, the other in the Agency compound. Attached to both of these are Telegraph Offices, the latter office being in direct communication with Agra by a special wire, which is a great convenience to the public, and expedites telegraphic communication with other parts.\n\nDig.\n\nNext to Bharatpur in importance and renowned for its fountain palaces, called Bhawans, is the town of Dig, situated to the north-west of, and 23 miles from, Bharatpur. It is a very old town, mentioned in the Skandh Puran, and in the 4th chapter of Bhagwat Mahatam as Dirgh or Dirghpur, meaning \"large.\" The reason why it was so named appears to be, that on the site where Dig now stands was situated the larger of two hamlets belonging to the older town, Ow, three miles to the south, and its designation as \"Dirgh\" or \"large\" has been converted into the present name Dig.\n\nDig is situated to the south of Manus Nayi, the southeastern branch of the Ruparel river, and though the town itself has not a very low position, there are many depressions along the course of the river, such as Kho Dahar, the Shishamwala Bund, the Gordhan Darwaza Bund, and others around the town. Dig is enclosed by earth-works now in ruins, which, on the west side of the town, are strengthened by a masonry wall, and is entered by the nine following gates:\u2014\n(1) the Ow or Kumher gate and (2) the Bhura gate, on the south; (3) the Panhori gate, (4) the Shalpore gate, and (5) the Bandha gate, on the west; (6) the Kama gate and (7) the Delhi gate, on the north; (8) the Jasondhi gate and (9) the Gordhan gate, on the east. The space within the surrounding wall is nearly as much in area as that of Bharatpur, but it is inhabited sparsely, and consists of many scattered hamlets at long distances from each other, separated by cultivated fields, ruins of buildings, or bare pieces of ground. Dig is crossed by two metalled roads nearly at right angles to each other, proceeding from the town in each of the four following directions:\u2014North to Kaman, south to Kumher and Bharatpur, east to Gordhan and Muttra and west to Nagar and Alwar. At the south-east angle of the town is the Shah Burj, a high rocky eminence, having on its summit an area of 50 square yards and enclosed by a rampart, having four commanding bastions facing the four cardinals points. Within the walls of the town, and much nearer to its southern position than others, is the Fort, an imposing structure with high ramparts twenty feet thick, furnished with bastions commanding the town and the country around. Inside the Fort are the ruins of a fine palace, which has recently been renovated and converted into a small District Jail for the accommodation of 50 prisoners, and has proved a great boon to both Jail and Judicial administrations. All prisoners convicted of petty offences can undergo their sentences here, without transfer to the Central Prison at Bharatpur.\n\nA very interesting view of the surrounding country, showing extent and position of outlying forts, earth-works palaces, and gardens, may be obtained from the highest burj of the Fort, which still contains a very large gun. This latter in its time must have been a very formidable weapon, considering its size and position and the range it commands. To the west of the Fort are the beautiful palaces built by the great Suraj Mull, and much improved and ornamented by the late Maharajah Jaswant Singh, who spent large sums in renovating the buildings and protecting them from damage, and furnished them throughout for the accommodation of Europeans. It was here that the late Earl of Dufferin when Governor-General spent a few days, and, history says, was so enchanted with his visit that he gave his portrait to\nthe late Maharajah, which now adorns the walls of the main hall of the Gopal Bhawan. They have also recently been visited by H. E. Lord Curzon. These palaces, which, according to Thornton, are only surpassed in India for elegance of design and perfection of workmanship by the Taj Mahal of Agra, are constructed of fine hard sandstone quarried at Bansi-Paharpur in the Rupbas pergunnah of this State. They form a quadrangle, in the centre of which is a garden, an oblong space of 475 by 350 feet, laid out with flower beds and fountains. To the east and west are large masonry tanks, with another garden on the other side of the western tank, beyond the buildings forming the quadrangle. The building on the north is called the Nand Bhawan, a hall measuring 66 by 40 feet, built of grey sandstone, with verandas on the east and west. The main building on the west is called the Gopal Bhawan, and is the largest of all the palaces, being two-storeyed on three sides, with an extensive lofty hall between them; this is also built entirely of grey sandstone. On either side of the Gopal Bhawan, at suitable distances are two smaller buildings called the Sanwan and Bhadon Bhawans, the posterior sides of which, as well as of the Gopal Bhawan, command a view of the western tank and the gardens beyond it. These three Bhawans, though having only one storey in the front at the ground level, have in addition two more lower storeys at the back, one of which is partially or wholly under water throughout the year. This, however, varies, being dependent upon the height of the water level in the tank. On the southern side of the quadrangle are two palaces facing north; one, called the Suraj Bhawan on the west, is built entirely of marble quarried at Makrana in Jodhpur, and tastefully ornamented with stones of different colours, and in design similar to those seen in the Taj Mahal of Agra. This building was till recently utilized as a Dak Bungalow for the convenience of visitors and sightseers. The Durbar have now, however, built a capacious Dak Bungalow close by the palaces for visitors, which is much patronized. The other palace on the east, built of grey sandstone like the others, is called the Kishen Bhawan. On the roof of a very substantial building between these two palaces exists a reservoir, which supplies the fountains in all these palaces and gardens with water. The dimensions of this reservoir are $135 \\times 104 \\times 6.75$ feet, with a\ncapacity for holding 94,770 cubic feet of water. This reservoir is filled by the aid of bullocks in the usual way from two capacious and practically inexhaustible wells situated at either corner, and takes about a fortnight to fill, working day and night. The strength necessary in a roof which has to support the enormous weight of so large a volume of water is, I should say, unique, and scarcely has a parallel in India. On the eastern side of the quadrangle, and commanding a view of the eastern tank, is the Kishen Bhawan (called also the Barah Dari), an open square building with verandahs on all sides, and a double line of fountains in each of the verandahs. To the south, behind the Suraj Bhawan, out of the quadrangle but adjoining it, is the Zenana Palace known as the Hardeo Bhawan, with an orange orchard enclosed by buildings on all the three sides. Partly behind the Kishen Bhawan, and on the southern aspect of the eastern tank, but quite apart from them, is an old palace built long before the construction of the Bhawans, during Thakur Badan Singh's reign. This also is an extensive building with two compounds, though not possessing the beauty of the other more recent palaces.\n\nDig is the head-quarters of a tehsil, and contains a very good Dispensary with accommodation for 12 in-patients, has a district Jail for 60 prisoners located within the Fort, also a School and Post and Telegraph Offices. It also contains a Judge's Court, &c., and a Sanitary Board, worked by native residents under the presidency of the tehsildar.\n\nGOBERDHAN.\n\nSituated due east of Dig, and connected therewith by a very good metalled road at a distance of about seven miles, is the town of Goberdhan in the Muttra district. Though situated in British territory this town has a great connection with the Bharatpur State, in that not only does the State own extensive and valuable property there, in fact the greater portion of the town, but it is the place where the mortal remains of its Chiefs are buried, and where extensive and very handsome chhuttries and tanks have been erected to their memory.\n\nThe chhuttries at present existing at Goberdhan are three in number, all situated towards the north-east side of\nthe Mansi Ganga tank, the first having been erected to the memory of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, the next to the memory of Maharajah Baldeo Singh, and the third, at present in course of construction, to Maharajah Balwant Singh. A very handsome chhuttrie has also been erected by the State to the memory of the great Maharajah Suraj Mull, the originator of the Dig Palaces, at a tank called Kushm Sirowar, situated one and a half miles from Goberdhan on the road to Rada Kund in the Muttra district. Here also exist two more chhuttries on a smaller scale to the memory of Suraj Mull's wives, as well as a chabutra to the north side of the same tank to the memory of Maharajah Jawant Singh, all of which are made of cut sandstone quarried in, and brought from, Bharatpur territory for the purpose; they are of exceedingly handsome design, and certainly a credit to their instigators, both in point of work as well as design.\n\nLarge sums of money must have been spent over them, but as the expenditure has extended over a number of years before their completion, the State revenues have not been overtaxed for the purpose, and no unnecessary burden has been entailed on the State finances thereby. At Goberdhan also exists the famous tank called the Mansi Ganga, mentioned in the Prem Sagar, in the centre of which exists the famous portion of rock near which at times the water is said to have been turned into milk. The whole tank is surrounded by numerous handsome stone buildings, and is resorted to yearly by thousands of pilgrims from all parts of the country, who come for the purpose of worship to Muttra. Though this place is not actually in Bharatpur territory I have thought that a description of it would not be out of place here, owing to its historical associations with the State, and it would repay the visitor to Dig to take the opportunity to run over the border and pay a visit to Goberdhan, and see for himself some of the fine buildings there, to whose elegance and beauty scant justice can be done on paper.\n\nKama.\n\nKama is a very old town situated in the north of the State, and sacred to Hindus as being a portion of\nthe Brij country, where Krishna resided in his early life. Its former name is said to have been Brahampore, but Rajah Kam Sen, the maternal grandfather of Krishna changed it, after his own name, to Kama. Being now included among the Bans, such as Brindaban, Mahaban, &c., it is also called Kamban, and is visited annually in pilgrimage by large numbers of the Baishnow Hindus in the month of Bhadon, known as Banyatra. There exist here the remains of a curious old temple consisting of 84 pillars named Chourasi-Khamba, and it is said that these pillars are never correctly numbered. Kaman had long been under the rule of the Jaipur Chiefs, and it is only since the time of Maharajah Jawahir Singh that it has been added to Bharatpur territory. Palaces built by the Jaipur Chiefs exist to this day, but are now used as the Tehsil Offices, &c. There are many important Hindu temples at Kama; two of them, those of Gokal Chandraman and Madan Mohan, were taken by Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh to his newly-built city of Jaipur, and after a residence of about a century and a quarter they were turned out by the late Maharajah Ram Singh during his persecution of the Baishnows. After a short stay at Bikaner, where the State could not bear the expense or meet other demands, they had to return to Kama.\n\nThere is also a tank at Kama, named Bimal-Kund surrounded on all sides by temples, and a chhuttri built to the memory of Rajah Kamak Sen stands on the bank of the tank. Kama is now a very dilapidated town situated on rising ground and surrounded on the south by jheels, and contains remnants of many pukka buildings, also a Dispensary, Tehsil, Thana, Post Office and a P. W. D. Inspection Bungalow. The town is in direct communication with Bharatpur by a first-class metalled road at a distance of 35 miles, and with Gopalgarh by a very good katcha road, a distance of 14 miles. The Dispensary is situated close to the Tehsil Serai; a new and more modern building, however, on a more suitable site will shortly be erected.\n\nBiana.\n\nThe town of Biana is situated on an eminence in a small plain, between two ranges of hills running more or less parallel to each other, and in a direction from north-east\nto south west. The Biana hill itself is covered with the remains of large buildings; among them is a fort in which there is a high stone pillar called Bhimlath, or the staff of Bhim, conspicuous for a long distance. There is an immense number of Mahommedan tombs scattered about at some distance from the town, inscriptions on some of these tombs bearing the dates 421-22 Hizri or A.D. 1030-31. There is around the town only too evident proof of past bloodshed in the form of extensive cemeteries, some of the graves in which are very handsome and still in an excellent state of preservation, and are chiefly made of the red sandstone so abundant in the vicinity. This town is the headquarters of a tehsil, and contains a branch Dispensary, Police Thana, Post Office and School and a P.W.D. Bungalow for the use of State Officials. The town is connected by good roads\u2014with Hindoun to the south, Fatehpur-Sikri to the east, and Bharatpur to the north. In this tehsil is the village of Bareta, 5 miles due east, noted for its lake and bund; a small out-door patient dispensary exists there for use of the P.W.D. subordinates, which is also much patronized by villagers residing in the vicinity.\n\nBhusawar.\n\nThe town of Bhusawar is a large and thriving one, situated in the south-west corner of the State, and is said to have been founded by Bhusawar Khan, an officer of Mahmud Gaznavi, some 800 years ago. There are some copper mines in the range of hills in the Bhusawar pergannah, but they have not been worked for many years. Bhusawar is noted for the fertility of its soil and for the numerous topes of mango trees which abound in the neighbourhood of the town, though the trees themselves are not of a very superior quality. A road (katcha) connects it with Weir and Uchain and a track to the south affords communication with Ballabgarh. As a result of the late settlement, the tehsil headquarters have been removed to Weir, only a Naib-Tehsildar residing here. The town contains a Thana, Dispensary and School, and until quite recently it was the headquarters of a tehsil, which, as abovementioned, has now been removed to Weir.\nWeir.\n\nWeir was founded by Thakur Badan Singh upwards of 125 years ago. He built a fort, palace and gardens here. It was formerly the place of residence of Partab Singh, the second surviving son of Badan Singh and a brother of the famous Suraj Mall, who much embellished the place. The garden close to the palace, on account of the abundance of trees, is called the Naulakha Bagh, and the other garden with a palace in it is called Phulbari. The town contains a Police Thana, Branch Dispensary and School, and is the head-quarters of a tehsil under the late settlement, the tehsil from Bhusawar having been recently transferred here. It also has a Public Works Department Rest House. The town, like most others in Bharatpur, is in a very tumbled down and dilapidated condition.\n\nKumher.\n\nThe town of Kumher lies on the direct road to Dig, at a distance of 11 miles from Bharatpur, with which it is connected by a first-class metalled road. It is a dilapidated and tumbled down place now, surrounded by strong and extensive earth-works, which are pierced by gates at the entrance of the principal roads into the city, and contains a Tehsil, Dispensary, Thana, Post Office, and School. There were two brothers, Kumbhi and Sumbhi, Jats of the village of Sinsini, the former founded the town and gave it his name. Thakur Badan Singh lived for a long time at this place, he built several substantial buildings and made a wall round the town. In 1754 it was unsuccessfully besieged by the Mahrattas, and Khandu Rao, the son of Malhar Rao Hulcar, the great Mahratta leader, was killed here, and his cenotaph exists near the town. Tiffenthaler, describing its condition a century ago, states it to be a considerable burgh or rather a small city, situated in a plain and surrounded by a mud wall and a ditch. Most of the houses are of plaster, but several are of masonry and tiled. Of the last description is a fine palace situated on a moderate eminence, which commands an extensive view over the surrounding plain, and serves as a fort, being surrounded by strong walls.\nBesides the above towns, the population of which is above 5,000, there are those of Rupbas, Nagar, Nadbai and Pahari, all with the exception of the last named head-quarters of tehsils of the same name; and Uchain, Akheygarh and Gopalgarh, which formerly were tehsil head-quarters, but which latter under the new settlement have been transferred to other towns, viz., Rupbas, Nadbai and Nagar respectively.\n\nRupbas.\u2014Rupbas was founded by Rup Singh, originally a descendant of the Chitor Maharana, but converted to Islam in the reign of Akbar the Great, and subsequently called Mian Rup, being one of the favourite associates of the Emperor, and holding Khanwa as fief. He built a palace and a beautiful tank, which are still in existence, though the former is in a dilapidated condition, the palace being now used as the Tehsil Office. Rupbas being very near to Fatehpur Sikri, the country residence of Akbar, was used by the Emperor as a shooting box. Raised slabs of stone or chabutras are still to be found in the Ghannah close by (which used to be extensive forests, and served as large game preserves in the neighbourhood of Rupbas), from which the Emperor used to shoot. The traffic in stone, upon which there is a royalty, has increased greatly under the supervision of the Executive Engineer, and brings in large profits to the State P. W. D. A. Bungalow and P. W. D. Offices have been erected at Bansi Paharpur, 7 miles off, by the State, on account of the quarry industry, also a small out-patient Dispensary exists here under the superintendence of the Medical Department, which is said to be a great boon to the quarry-men, amongst whom, I am told, there is a large amount of fibroid phthisis, but this I should very much doubt, as the quarry-men do not work the stone in the same way that stone masons do, but simply excavate it.\n\nThere exists here also a garden with a handsome little building constructed by Maharajah Balwant Singh. Village Khanwa in this tehsil is famous for the great battlefield of Sanga Rana and Baber, described in connection with Biana. It was founded by Kan Mohammed Pathan 1,000 years ago, and is still inhabited by his descendents, called\nGaddis, who claims to be Pathans, but are converts from Hinduism. In this pergunnah, and only eight miles from the town are the famous Bansi and Paharpur quarries of sandstone already mentioned.\n\nPaharsar.\u2014Paharsar in the Nadbai Tehsil was formerly called Lohagarh, and was conquered by two officers of Sultan Mahmud in the course of three hours or a \"pahar,\" and was thenceforth named Paharsar, or conquered in a pahar. It is inhabited by a large community of Sayads of the Shiya creed, many of whom are men of high attainments in learning, holding respectable posts in British territory, in this and other native States, and are mostly in a well-to-do condition. My own experience of them certainly is, that their intellectual capacity is far in advance of the ordinary native of this State.\n\nAkheygarh.\u2014Akheygarh, which has a fort, was founded by Akhai Singh, one of the numerous sons of Thakur Badan Singh, and brother of the great Suraj Mall. Pathena, a village in this tehsil, was given in jagir to a body of thakurs, with the idea (being of fighting instinct) that they might be able to keep peace on the frontier. But in 1887 the thakurs themselves rebelled against the State, and Maharajah Jaswant Singh, after a siege of less than a week, ousted them, and destroyed their fort. From personal enquiry, however, of some of the older inhabitants still living it would appear that they made a good fight for it. Under the new settlement the tehsil has lately been transferred to Nadbai. The town is situated a few yards from the Alwar border, and was probably placed there for strategic purposes. It contains a Tehsil and Dispensary, both of which are very shortly to be removed to Nadbai, a far more suitable site, and also a Post Office and School only two miles off the R.-M. Railway at Kherli station.\n\nGopalgarh.\u2014Gopalgarh is named after the mud fort built by Gopal Singh, a sardar of Maharajah Suraj Mall, at the village named Dorola, in order to coerce the turbulent population of Meos, of whose country the Mewat,\nlying in the Bharatpur State, is the centre. It used to be the head-quarters of a tehsil, and till recently possessed a dispensary, both of which have now been abolished and transferred to Nagar. It is connected with Kaman to the east by a very good katcha road, at a distance of about 14 miles, also with Pahari and Nagar by tracks on the north and south respectively. The Meos, originally Minas, were converted to Islam during the several invasions of India by Sultan Mahmud, between A.D. 1001 and 1030. The memory of Masaud, who accompanied Mahmud in these invasions, is much revered by the Meos. Their oath on Salar (meaning the flag of Masaud) is most binding. Whilst professing the Musalman faith, they observe many of the Hindu festivals and indulge in drinking wine. Like Hindus, their daughters do not inherit the father's property, and they believe greatly in omens, and consider the howl of jackals, the bark of a fox, chirping of a bird, and the passing from right to left or vice versa of a deer, a cat or a snake, to be fortunate or the reverse, as the case may be. The dress of both men and women greatly resembles that of Hindus. Infanticide was once common amongst them, but the practice has altogether died out now. When converted to Islam, the Meos did not give up their thieving and plundering propensities, and to this day they are most determined cattle-lifters; but to do them justice it must be said of the Meos that, with such exceptions as are addicted to crime, they are generally respectable and thrifty land-holders. A niece of Husen Khan, Meo, is said to have been in the seraglio of the Emperor Akbar.\n\nSikri, a large town in the vicinity of Gopalgarh, possesses the bund or embankment mentioned in connection with the Ruparel river, which is also called the Laswari Nadi, after the village of that name, known as the last battlefield of Lord Lake against Scindhia. The bund is a very extensive one, and the very large amount of cultivation around shows evidence of its utility. A small outpatient Dispensary in connection with the P. W. D. exists here, under the direction of the Medical Department, and is much patronised and appreciated.\nNagar.\u2014Nagar, now head-quarters of a tehsil and noted for the manufacture of earthen vessels of black clay, has a Dispensary, Police Thana, School and Post Office, it is connected with Dig by a very good road, metalled more than half way, as far as the village of Russya, the total distance being about 13 miles. The town is situated on rising ground near the border of Alwar territory, and at one time belonged to the Alwar Raj. Since 1899 a Dispensary has been opened here after the abolition of that at Gopalgarh. A Tehsil, Thana, Post Office and School also exist.\n\nPahari.\u2014Pahari, so called because it is situated near a hillock, is said to have been founded in the reign of the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h by one of his slaves, Shahamat Ali. Here is the tomb of Shahab Khan, a Khanzada much respected by Musalmans and Meos. Pahari is one of the districts ceded to Maharajah Ranjit Singh by General Perron, the French Commander of Scindhia's army, for services rendered to him. A Dispensary, Tehsil, Post Office and School exist here.\n\nBallabgarh.\u2014Ballabgarh is the head-quarters of a small estate containing fourteen villages owned by the late Foujdar Debi Singh, one of the principal sardars of the State and member of the State Council. It is at present under attachment in liquidation of debt, and is included in the Bhusawar Tehsil. There is a fort and a palace for the residence of the Foujdar at Ballabgarh. It is a picturesque spot, the town and fort being situated in a basin, surrounded by rocky hills, some of which are covered with trees, but the majority with scanty jungle, abounding, however, with pig, hy\u00e6na, chinkora, and often frequented by panther, and even tiger occasionally. It is connected with Bhusawar to the north by a track, available, however, for cart traffic.\nThe geographical position of the towns above described is shown in the following table:\n\n| Names       | Latitude | Longitude |\n|-------------|----------|-----------|\n|             | Degrees  | Minutes   | Degrees | Minutes |\n| Bharatpur   | 27       | 12        | 77      | 33      |\n| Dig         | 27       | 29        | 77      | 23      |\n| Kama        | 27       | 40        | 77      | 20      |\n| Biana       | 26       | 54        | 77      | 20      |\n| Bhusawar    | 27       | 2         | 77      | 7       |\n| Weir        | 27       |           | 77      | 14      |\n| Kumher      | 27       | 19        | 77      | 26      |\n| Rupbas      | 26       | 59        | 77      | 38      |\n| Khanwa      | 27       | 2         | 77      | 37      |\n| Uchain      | 27       | 6         | 77      | 29      |\n| Paharsar    | 27       | 10        | 77      | 20      |\n| Akheygarh   | 27       | 14        | 77      | 7       |\n| Pathena     | 27       | 8         | 77      | 5       |\n| Nagar       | 27       | 25        | 77      | 10      |\n| Gopalgarh   | 27       | 40        | 77      | 7       |\n| Sikri       | 37       | 34        | 77      | 7       |\n| Laswara     | 27       | 33        | 76      | 59      |\n| Pahari      | 27       | 43        | 77      | 8       |\n| Ballabgarh  | 26       | 58        | 77      | 8       |\nHISTORY OF THE SIEGES OF BHARATPUR.\n\nOn the 1st January 1805 the British army, under the personal command of Lord Lake, left Dig, and being joined en route by the 75th regiment, a very necessary reinforcement, arrived before Bharatpur on the 3rd, and took up a position in a garden to the south-west of the town, which appeared a most suitable spot for occupation during the siege. After an interval of some days of preparation, on January 9th the first assault was made but ended in failure, resulting in a loss of 300 European soldiers and 200 sepoys, with an excessive casualty list amongst officers, as might be expected in such an undertaking. Bharatpur at first sight did not present any very formidable aspect to an army, before which many of the mightiest bulwarks of India had fallen; it was encircled by none of those rugged steeps which guarded the approach to Gwalior. The only works visible were a lofty mud wall and a broad ditch not easily fordable; but though the very extent of its walls which embraced the town, forming a circumference of about seven miles, must have materially increased the difficulty of protecting them, the Maharajah applied himself to its defence with the utmost zeal and resolution. \"The Kingdom of the Mahratas,\" he said, \"was in their saddles; but his was within his ramparts.\" Hitherto the victorious British army had reduced even the strongest fortresses without difficulty in the usual way, but the defenders of Bharatpur in this instance not only fought with the most daring valour, but called into requisition means of defence and annoyance which the English army had never hitherto elsewhere encountered, and to meet which they were wholly unprepared.\n\nAfter a few days of desultory bombardment, and reinforcement by arrival of another brigade under the command of Major-General Smith, a most determined assault, preceded by a vigorous bombardment, was made on January 20th, resulting in a breach of the earth-works. This, however, ended disastrously for the British, the casualty returns showing 18 officers and 500 men killed and wounded, the loss of the defenders only amounting to 50.\n\nA division of Bombay troops having arrived in the interim the attack was renewed on the 20th February, but owing to the bold front shown by the defenders, as well as\nthe disastrous effects of explosions caused by mines, the casualties among the attacking force on this occasion was 894 killed and wounded.\n\nThe attack was renewed the next day, which, however, after two hours of hard fighting, was ultimately abandoned, the British returning to their trenches, having lost nearly 1,000 killed and wounded. Such was the result of the fourth and last attack of this siege.\n\nThus ended the first memorable siege of Bharatpur, in which the British were repulsed in four successive attempts, sustaining in killed and wounded a loss of 3,203 officers and men.\n\nMost of the English guns had become unserviceable from incessant firing; the whole of the artillery stores had been expended, provisions were exhausted, and the sick and wounded had become very numerous. The army thus being no longer in a condition to renew hostile operations, the ordnance was withdrawn from batteries and the troops from the trenches on the 22nd February, and moving to the north-east of the Bharatpur Fort, Lord Lake, on the 25th February, occupied a position from which he commanded the roads to Agra, Muttra and Dig, his head-quarter camp, it is said, being pitched on the spot upon which the Agency Surgeon's bungalow now stands.\n\nWeary of the enormous expense of the war, and having a just dread of the pertinacity of the English General, Maharajah Ranjit Singh now took advantage of the elevation of General Lake to the peerage, and offered his congratulations, accompanied by a profession of his desire for peace, and his readiness to proceed in person to the British camp. The proposal of the Maharajah for peace, therefore, met with Lord Lake's sympathy, and he unhesitatingly settled the terms of a treaty on the 10th April 1805, which provided for peace and the payment by the Maharajah of an indemnity of 20 lakhs.\n\nIn 1826, during the reign of Maharajah Balwant Singh, matters, however, gradually began to lapse into a very disturbed state, and ultimately, at the instigation of Sir Chas. Metcalfe, the Governor-General in Council was obliged to undertake measures to support the youthful Maharajah Balwant Singh, then on the gaddi, by force of arms. Accordingly in 1826, during the reign of Maharajah Balwant\nSingh, a vast force, exceeding 20,000 men, with more than 100 pieces of artillery, advanced upon Bharatpur, under the Commander-in-Chief, General Lord Combermere, who had gained high distinction under the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War, as Sir Stapleton Cotton. On the 5th December His Lordship's head-quarters were at Muttra, whence he ordered the second division of infantry, commanded by Major-General Nicolls, with the first brigade of Cavalry and a detachment of Skinner's Horse, to march from Agra via Danagore to Bharatpur to take up a position to the west of the town. The first division of infantry under Major-General Reynell, with the second brigade of Cavalry and the remainder of Skinner's Horse, marched by another route to take up a position on the north-east of the town. With this column proceeded the Commander-in-Chief and his head-quarters, arriving before Bharatpur on 10th December. Here his Lordship humanely proposed to Durjan Sal the withdrawal of all the women and children from the town, promising their safe conduct through his camp, to which proposal only an evasive answer was received from the usurper.\n\nOn the approach of the British army, the Rajah of Nimrana, who was stationed at the Gundwa or Moti Jheel Bund, cut the embankment with a view to filling up the broad deep ditch that surrounds the town, as they had done during Lord Lake's siege in 1805, but the English troops, with the wisdom of the lesson taught in that siege, having arrived before he had quite effected his purpose, slew the Rajah, and made themselves masters of the embankment, quickly repairing the breach that had been made by him.\n\nDisappointed at the failure of this, his first attempt, Durjan Sal sent Dewan Jawahir Lal, Faujdar Churaman, and Lala Hurdeo Bakhsh to Sir Charles Metcalfe to negotiate peace, but as nothing short of restoration of the Maharajah Balwant Singh to the State could save him from the attack, and he was determined not to give in willingly, war became inevitable.\n\nSeveral days were occupied in the construction of earthworks, during which a party of about 200 of Durjan Sal's Cavalry attempted to make their escape; being intercepted, however, about forty of them were killed, and upwards of one hundred were made prisoners.\nOn the 23rd December the besiegers, under a heavy fire from the garrison, completed their first parallel trench in the vicinity of Gopalgarh, the north-eastern part of the city, and on the morning of the 24th two heavy batteries opened fire upon the city. Other batteries were brought into action in quick succession, and during the remainder of the month a vast quantity of powder and shot was expended, till scarcely a roof in the town was left uninjured; but neither shot nor shell could make any impression on a tough mud wall, the most impenetrable of all possible defences, and which moreover was 50 to 60 feet thick! A mine was therefore commenced on the evening of the 6th January 1826, in one portion of the wall on the northern face of the earth-works, but unfortunately it was not sufficiently advanced by daybreak, and the engineers, apprehending discovery if their operations were detected, it was prematurely exploded, and produced no material effect. A second attempt to mine was made, but those employed in it were countermined from the interior before they had entered many feet; the gallery made was subsequently blown up, it having been discovered that the defenders were keeping watch on them.\n\nSome European deserters from the British army went over to Durjan Sal, who entrusted them with a gun, which they worked so skilfully that on the 8th January a shot fired from it set fire to one of the tumbrils in the British camp, blowing up 20,000 lbs. weight of gunpowder. On the 14th another mine under one of the bastions was exploded too precipitately, producing no more effect than great smoke and a terrific noise; but two more were driven into the same work, and these being fired on the 16th so far succeeded, that with the aid of another day's battering a breach was effected. On the 17th, however, an immense mine having been completed and charged with a vast quantity of powder, the following day was fixed for the storming of the city.\n\nEarly in the morning of the 18th January 1826, the storming parties established themselves in the advanced trenches. The breach on the left, which was already practicable for an assault, was to be attacked by the brigade under General Nicolls, headed by His Majesty's 59th Regiment; the breach on the right was to be attacked by General\nReynell's brigade, headed by His Majesty's 14th Regiment, the explosion of a mine under the north-east bastion called the Nalwali Burj being the signal for commencement of the attack. This took place at eight o'clock with terrific effect. The explosion was enormous; the whole of the salient angle and portion of the stone cavalier behind it was hurled into the air, which for a time became as dark as night, while all the garrison who were stationed there were blown to the winds or buried amidst the ruins. The result was an enormous breach. Owing, however, to defective construction of the mine, many of the ejected stones and masses of earth fell upon the heads of the attacking parties, killing a number of men and severely wounding three officers. The stones and debris fell so thickly about Lord Combermere himself that Brigadier-General MacCombe was knocked down by his side, and two sepoys were killed within a few feet of His Lordship.\n\nThe troops, however, pushed home the attack with great pertinacity, and in excellent order ascended the breaches and cleared them in the teeth of a very determined resistance on the part of Bakhshi Kishen Ram and Faujdar Kishen Ballabh and their followers. On the left, where the ascent was steep and difficult, the Grenadiers moved up slowly and resolutely without stopping to pull a trigger in return for the volleys of round shot, grape and musketry which were fired upon them. Within two hours the ramparts of the town on the north-east between the Muttra and Kumher gates were in possession of the besiegers, who also rushed in from all the breaches effected between these gates. The garrison on the Anah and Nimda gates made a feeble attempt at resistance, but being overwhelmed by the invaders from the Muttra gate, they soon threw away their muskets and fled. The gates of the citadel surrendered early in the afternoon, and the victorious British force was in undisputed command of both the City and Fort before dusk of the same evening!\n\nBrigadier-General Sleigh, who commanded the Cavalry, had taken excellent precautions outside to prevent the escape of Durjan Sal, and when that Chief, with 160 chosen horses attempted to force his passage through Naswaria Bas to Kumher Gate, with a view to escaping to Biana, he was made prisoner by the 8th Light Dragoons, as the result of\ninformation given by Balmukand Naswaria. One of his wives, two of his sons (Thakur Khushal Singh and Kallyan Singh) and Sriji Mahant were also captured with him. Jagat Singh, his eldest son, succeeded in reaching Biana, but he was also afterwards captured there. They were all brought up before Lord Combermere, by whom Durjan Sal, with his family, was sent as a State prisoner to Allahabad, and the thakurs and the mahant were confined for some time in the Fort at Agra. Durjan Sal's descendants still continue to reside at Benares. The entire losses sustained by the British army during the siege and storming amounted to 61 Europeans and 42 Natives killed, and 283 Europeans and 183 Natives wounded. The loss of the garrison was estimated at 4,000, nearly all killed by the awful explosion of the great mine.\n\nThe whole of the enemy's ordnance numbering 135 pieces was captured by the English; twelve of them were purchased by Jani Baij Nath for the State, and a very heavy gun may be seen to this day on a high platform in Fort William as a souvenir of this important victory. Many others in a disabled condition lie off their mountings in the Fort at Bharatpur in different situations.\n\nAfter the British camp, with ammunition, arms and stores, had been removed to a place of safety near Adi garden on the Moti Jheel, the principal bastions and other important parts of the fortifications were blown up, and it was left to the monsoon rains to complete the ruin of the earth-works, whose boasted impregnability was henceforth destroyed for ever. With the fall of this celebrated fortress perished all expectation of successful resistance to British arms; and Dig Biana, Kama, and all other forts within the State surrendered at once, and were forthwith garrisoned by British troops, while the inhabitants returned peaceably to their homes and occupations.\n\nOn the 5th February 1826, Lord Combermere, Sir Charles Metcalfe, Mr. William Fraser and other British officers proceeded to the palace, and during a public Durbar held for the purpose, installed Balwant Singh as Maharajah in succession to his father, under the Regency of his mother, Amrit Kanwar, and the Dewanship of Jani Baij Nath and superintendence of a British Political Agent.\nFAMILY OF THE RULING CHIEF.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThe ruling Chiefs of Bharatpur claim to have been originally Jadon Rajputs and descendents of Krishna. Both the Karauli and Bharatpur families claim Sindpal as their common ancestor. Thanpal, the twelfth in order from Sindpal, had several sons, from the eldest of whom (Dharampal) the Karauli family is descended, whilst the Bharatpur family sprang from Madanpal, the third son of Thanpal. From Madanpal the Bharatpur family trace their descent to Balchand, the nineteenth successor to Sindpal. The story about Balchand currently believed in by the Bharatpur and Karauli Durbars is as follows:\n\nBalchand one day went, as was his custom, on a plundering expedition. On the way he met a Jat of the Dogar clan, resident of the village of Hindoun, now in Jaipur. This Jat was bringing home his wife from Hodal. Balchand made prisoners of both the Jat and his wife, and carried them off to his home at Sinsini.* Balchand had no family by his own wife and made his Jat prisoner his concubine, and by her had two sons, Bijji and Sijji. From that time the ancestors of the Bharatpur family have been called Sinsinwal Jats, from the village of Sinsini where Balchand lived.\n\nMost of the authorities consulted corroborate the fact that the Jats have sprung from the Jadon-Bhatti clan of Rajputs, of which the Karauli and Jaisalmer houses are the foremost representatives.\n\n* A village in the Dig Tehsil, situated about midway between Dig and Kumher and a few miles to the west of the main road.\n| No. | Name of the Maharajah | Date of Birth | Date of ascending the Throne | Date of Death or otherwise | Ruling Period | Remarks |\n|-----|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------|\n| 1   | Maharajah Badan Singh | Not known    | Cheit Sudi 1st Sambat 1879 | Jaith Sudi 10th Sambat 1812 | 33 years, 2 months and 10 days. |\n| 2   | Surej Mal            | do.          | Jaith Sudi 12th Sambat 1891 | Poos Jadi 12th Sambat 1820 | 8 years, 6 months and 15 days. |\n| 3   | Jawalbar Singh       | do.          | Poos Badi 13th Sambat 1890 | Sawan Sudi 13th Sambat 1829 | 4 years, 7 months and 17 days. |\n| 4   | Ratan Singh          | do.          | Bhadon Badi 1st Sambat 1825 | Chet Sudi 5th Sambat 1825 | 7 months and 20 days. |\n| 5   | Kehri Singh          | do.          | Cheit Sudi 6th Sambat 1825 | Cheit Badi 15th Sambat 1825 | 7 years, 11 months and 24 days. |\n| 6   | Rajjit Singh         | do.          | Cheit Sudi 1st Sambat 1824 | Aghan Sudi 15th Sambat 1824 | 27 years, 8 months and 15 days. |\n| 7   | Randhir Singh        | do.          | Poos Badi 1st Sambat 1822 | Asoj Sudi 4th Sambat 1822 | 17 years, 9 months and 19 days. |\n| 8   | Baldeo Singh         | do.          | Asoj Sudi 5th Sambat 1880 | Phagun Sudi 11th Sambat 1880 | 1 year, 5 months and 19 days. |\n| 9   | Rao Durjan Sal       | do.          | Cheit Sudi 9th Sambat 1881 | Poos Sudi 10th Sambat 1881 | 9 months, and 15 days. |\n| 10  | Maharajah Balwant Singh | Phagun Badi 6th Sambat 1876 | Phagun Sudi 11th Sambat 1882 | Phagun Sudi 10th Sambat 1904 | 27 years, 2 months and 20 days. |\n| 11  | Jawwant Singh        | do.          | Poos Sudi 11th Sambat 1910 | Asoj Sudi 2nd Sambat 1910 | 40 years, 7 months and 17 days. |\n| 12  | Ram Singh            | do.          | Bhadon Sudi 7th Thursday, Sambat 1950 | Poos Badi 3rd Sambat 1950 | 7 years, 8 months and 13 days. |\n| 13  | Kishen Singh         | do.          | Tuesday, Bhadon Sudi 11th Sambat 1956 | Asoj Badi 11th Sambat 1956 | Do. |\n\nHas been deposed by order of Government.\nEthnology.\u2014It will not be out of place here to append a few notes regarding the history of this caste, with which the ruling Chief of this State is connected. From local enquiry in the State it would appear that there are about 84 distinct and separate sections of this caste, amongst which the following are of the most importance:\u2014Sinsinwal (from which the family of the ruling Chief is drawn), Khoontel, Haga, Nohvar, Sogariya, Chahur, Bhagoha, Dagar (also found in Patiala State), Bamrolya Rana (that from which the family of the Dholpur Chief is drawn) Poniya, Garhasiya, Kohir, Indoliya, Bisantiya, Ghanyar, Desvar, Tabatiya, Thenua, &c.\n\nThe most important and numerous of these sections, at any rate as far as this State is concerned, are those of Sinsinwal and Khoontelia, to the former of which the family of the reigning Chief owe their origin. From enquiry it would appear that the first-known and oldest of these sections of the Jat caste was that of the Poniyas, from which all the other sections named appear to have sprung from time to time, the next in origin to the above being the Tabatiya section, followed by that of the Thenua family.\n\nAs regards the actual origin of the Jat caste, in these parts at any rate, local legends say that there was, hundreds of years ago, a Rajah, resident in Orissa in Bengal, who had five sons named respectively Jad, Pooru, Turoo, Kooroo, and Oorbus. From the first-named is supposed to have sprung the family of Jadons, a section of Thakurs from which both the ruling Chiefs of Bharatpur and Karauli claim descent; and from the fourth son (Kooroo) is said to have sprung the Poniya clan of Jats, as it appears that this son did not marry, but took unto himself a woman of quite another caste (not known), by whom he had issue, a son, whom he called Poniya, from which latter the whole family of Jats is supposed to have originated (vide above). He is said to have travelled westwards, and ultimately settled down in these parts with his family.\nThe customs of this caste are somewhat varied and peculiar, the chief peculiarities of which may be detailed briefly here.\n\nJats, Minas and Gujars can all smoke together, can usually eat together out of the same degchi, but not out of the same thali; they are also allowed to drink from the hands of several castes, from all or any of which latter they can take women as pseudo concubines under a curious custom called \"dareja,\" which will be mentioned in connection with their marriage customs.\n\nMarriage Customs.\u2014The widows of either the above-named castes can be sold to members of the same or either of the other two. This custom is called \"dareja,\" and is looked upon as an inferior sort of marriage, which gives the woman a position little better than a concubine or slave, but which legitimizes any children which she ultimately may bear her master, though the woman herself, by allying herself thus becomes an outcast actually from the caste of which she was originally a member. Male members of this caste are not allowed to take women for this purpose from the castes of Chamar, Dhobi, Brahmin, Mussulman, or any of the lower Hindu castes. It is just possible that the curious facts above alluded to, in regard to their marriage customs, may account in a great measure for the origin of a large number of the sections which are found to exist in this particular caste.\nANTHROPOMETRY OF THE JAT CASTE.\n\nIt may not be out of place here to record a few notes on this subject, in connection with the ethnology of this caste.\n\nIn an investigation carried out by me under the auspices of the Government of the N.-W. P. and Oudh some years ago, in connection with an Ethnographical Survey of those provinces, results of which have been published in a book entitled, \"Castes and Tribes of the N.-W. P. and Oudh,\" by Mr. W. Crooke, B.A., I.C.S., I took anthropometrical measurements of some representatives of this caste, detailed measurements of which will be found in the above book.\n\nAt a later period I took a further series of measurements of members of this caste, numbering one hundred residents of these parts, details of which are given at the end of this section. In this series, the only two measurements taken were those of the nasal indexes and facial angles (of Cuvier), as being the only anthropometrical measurements now recognised by all the most eminent authorities on the subject to be of any value in the distinction of race.\n\nNasal Index.\u2014In the former series the Jat comes out with a nasal index of 55, indicating a very leptorrhine nose. This, owing to the small number taken at the time, is hardly a fair comparison; a reference, however, to the more recent table in which one hundred adult males of this caste were taken, and the above two measurements recorded, will show that the average of the nasal indices for that number is 68\u00b750, a figure of more reliable scientific value.\n\nFacial Angle.\u2014All the measurements under this head were recorded with Broca's facial goniometer, the best instrument for this purpose. All human beings, no matter to what race they may belong, are to some extent prognathous, the difference being one only of degree: the more acute angle shown naturally indicating the greater degree of prognathism present. In the series shown here, measurements of the facial angle of Cuvier (more reliable on the living subject than that of Camper) were taken on one hundred adult males of this caste, on reference to\nwhich series it will be seen that the average angle recorded was 62\u00b098', on the whole a low one, showing that a fair amount of prognathism exists in this caste, which measurement if taken into consideration along with that of the nasal index, the most reliable test of racial distinction, would rather tend to show that the Jat caste does not stand very high in the social scale, if anthropometry is to be taken as affording any reliable means of ascertaining such, which, by the way, some well-known ethnologists would have us believe.\n\nFor further details regarding this interesting question, I would refer the reader to the book* above-mentioned, in which will be found tables of measurements of a large number of castes, which is of considerable scientific interest in the investigation of the origin of caste, a subject which must be of special interest to the ethnologist from many points of view, and with which complex question it would be out of place for one to enter further in a work of this kind.\n\n* \"Tribes and Castes of the N.-W.

Council, but for the purposes of administration is divided into two districts, which latter are again sub-divided into twelve tehsils. A complete alphabetical list of all the villages in the State in each tehsil is appended, giving full particulars prepared for the use of the Vaccination Department, which contains the latest details as revised by the late Settlement Operations in the State. On the next page is given a table showing the number of villages, area and population according to the Census of 1891. Since then, however, a new Settlement has involved a redistribution of the tehsils, and another Census has been taken, which will show some considerable difference as compared with this table.\n| Tehsils | Number of Villages | Area in square miles | Number of Houses | Sexes | Total Population | Religions |\n|---------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|------------------|-----------|\n|         |                    |                     |                 | Males | Females          |           |\n| Bharatpur (Deorhi) | 178 | 257\u00b712 | 17,916 | 59,266 | 48,718 | 107,984 | 87,777 | 18,472 | 1,733 | 2 |\n| Rupbas | 71 | 115\u00b787 | 3,150 | 16,351 | 13,835 | 30,186 | 27,656 | 2,512 | 18 | |\n| Byana | 160 | 300\u00b798 | 8,277 | 40,646 | 34,480 | 75,126 | 70,605 | 4,194 | 327 | |\n| Uchain | 97 | 129\u00b724 | 6,302 | 25,585 | 22,150 | 47,735 | 43,047 | 4,239 | 449 | |\n| Bhusawar | 143 | 214\u00b787 | 11,322 | 44,134 | 38,529 | 82,663 | 77,138 | 4,969 | 556 | |\n| Akheygarh | 99 | 141\u00b736 | 4,511 | 25,035 | 20,060 | 45,695 | 42,957 | 2,461 | 277 | |\n| **Total** | **748** | **1159\u00b744** | **51,508** | **211,617** | **177,772** | **389,389** | **849,180** | **36,847** | **3,360** | **2** |\n\n| Dug | Number of Villages | Area in square miles | Number of Houses | Sexes | Total Population | Religions |\n|-----|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|------------------|-----------|\n| Dig | 116 | 194\u00b748 | 9,291 | 34,315 | 28,410 | 62,725 | 55,283 | 7,011 | 431 | |\n| Kumher | 106 | 161\u00b759 | 7,345 | 27,478 | 23,702 | 51,180 | 58,056 | 2,790 | 334 | |\n| Kaman | 106 | 131\u00b774 | 5,526 | 23,444 | 20,614 | 44,058 | 28,606 | 14,888 | 564 | |\n| Pahari | 84 | 101\u00b750 | 4,414 | 15,038 | 12,696 | 27,737 | 9,566 | 18,072 | 99 | |\n| Gopalgarh | 122 | 173\u00b729 | 6,449 | 21,595 | 19,196 | 40,791 | 19,006 | 21,587 | 195 | |\n| Nagar | 77 | 52\u00b775 | 2,784 | 13,986 | 9,957 | 23,943 | 17,986 | 5,910 | 17 | |\n| **Total** | **611** | **815\u00b735** | **35,809** | **135,856** | **114,578** | **250,434** | **178,506** | **70,248** | **1,640** | |\n\n| **Grand Total** | **1,359** | **1974\u00b779** | **87,317** | **347,473** | **292,350** | **639,823** | **527,686** | **107,135** | **5,000** | **2** |\nThe principal agricultural classes in this State, according to the Census of 1891, were:\n\n| Caste     | Males | Females | Total |\n|-----------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Jats      | 52,226| 43,051  | 95,277|\n| Brahmins  | 42,094| 35,735  | 77,829|\n| Meos      | 25,300| 21,647  | 46,947|\n\n---\n\n**Population of the Principal Towns in the Bharatpur State, According to Census of 1901**\n\n| Division          | Name of Tehsils | Village | Area in square miles | Number of Houses | Population | Total |\n|-------------------|-----------------|---------|---------------------|------------------|------------|-------|\n| Akheygarh         |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Bharatpur         |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Ruphas            |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Byana             |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Weir              |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Pahari            |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Kaman             |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Nagar             |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Dig               |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Kumber            |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n| Total             |                 |         |                     |                  |            |       |\n\nTotal of Tehsils: 1,361\n\nBharatpur City: 1\n\nGrand Total: 1,362\n\nTotal of Tehsils: 1,361\n\nBharatpur City: 1\n\nGrand Total: 1,362\nDuring the reign of Maharajah Balwant Singh there existed no courts nor departments at all. The affairs of State were, however, conducted by \"Shuqqas,\" the State accounts being in the charge of Dewan Har Sewak. On the death of Maharajah Balwant Singh, his son, Maharajah Jaswant Singh, succeeded to the gaddi in A.D. 1853, and the State affairs were conducted by Dhaq Giyasi Ram for a few years. In 1855 A.D. (Sambat 1911) Sir Henry Lawrence, the Resident in Rajputana, visited Bharatpur, and seeing the state of affairs there, appointed Major Morrison as Political Agent, with full administrative powers. Departments such as Judicial, Revenue, &c., were then established. Tehsils and Police Thanas were also instituted, and a system of keeping records was introduced. Lala Bhola Nath was then appointed as Dewan of the State, and Chaudhri Charan Singh and Faujdar Brij Ballab as Magistrates of Dig (District of Mewat) and Bharatpur city respectively. The management of the Deorhi Department and personal affairs of the Maharajah was entrusted to Dhaq Gulab Singh, and later on Captain John Nixon was appointed as Settlement Commissioner. In the year 1858 a Panchayat or State Council was created, consisting of Dhaq Giyasi Ram, Faujdar Gordhan Singh, Chaudhri Ratan Singh, Chaudhri Girwar Singh, Dewan Lalta Parshad, Bakshi Ganga Ram and Dewan Ram Parshad. At this juncture Babu Bhola Nath was appointed tutor to His Highness the Maharajah Jaswant Singh, who was still a minor.\n\nThe administration of the State remained under a Political Agent till Sambat 1925, when the Maharajah coming of age assumed the management of State affairs himself, with Bakshi Sawal Singh as his chief adviser. Some time after this His Highness was given full powers, and ruled solely till the end of 1893, at which period he died. He was succeeded by his son, Ram Singh, at whose accession a Council was formed consisting of Foujdar Debi Singh, Bakshi Gobind Singh, Dhaq Zorawar Singh, Captain Raghunath Singh and Pandit Bishen Lal as its members.\n\nIn the year 1895 owing to mal-administration, a Dewan (Kunwar Harbamji) was appointed. This arrangement continued till the year 1898, when a Council was again\nestablished which still conducts the administration of the State, under the guidance and control of the Political Agent.\n\nOn the death of Maharajah Jaswant Singh in 1893 his son, Ram Singh, succeeded to the gaddi. Full powers were not, however, given to him at once, and a Council composed of four members was formed. This was, however, in 1895 for political reasons temporarily abolished, and a Dewan was appointed to carry on the administration under the guidance of the Political Agent. In 1898 on the departure of the Dewan, a Council was again instituted composed of four members (recently increased to five), under the presidency of the Political Agent, in whom all executive authority is centered. This mode of administration is still in vogue, and likely to continue during the minority of the young Chief at present on the gaddi, as he is yet but an infant.\n\nAs before mentioned the State is divided into two districts, each under the charge of a Deputy Collector, for purposes of Revenue administration, as well as under a Nazim, each for judicial work, the head-quarters being Bharatpur for the southern and Dig for the northern portion of the State. Each of these districts is divided up into tehsils, which are in charge of tehsildars, who perform both Revenue and Judicial duties in their respective ilakas.\n\nMedical, Jail, Vaccination, and Sanitation Departments.\u2014A detailed account of these will be found under their respective heads.\n\nPublic Works Department.\u2014This important department has, until recent years, been under the superintendence of native subordinates. On the death of Maharajah Jaswant Singh an officer of the Imperial Establishment (Mr. J. A. Devenish, C.E.) was deputed to this State by the Government of India, and who continued to exercise supervision over its working from 1894 till 1901. During his tenure many important works of public utility have been erected, some of great magnitude, for further particulars regarding which see article on Irrigation and the description of the Victoria Hospital.\n\nEducational Department.\u2014Vide separate article.\n## Approximate Income and Expenditure of the Bharatpur State by Average of Five Years from Sambat 1952.\n\n| No. | Principal Heads                        | Amount | Rs. | A. | P. | No. | Principal Heads                          | Amount | Rs. | A. | P. |\n|-----|----------------------------------------|--------|-----|----|----|-----|------------------------------------------|--------|-----|----|----|\n| 1   | Land Revenue                           |        |     |    |    | 1   | Religious and Charitable                 |       |     |    |    |\n| 2   | Salt                                   |        |     |    |    | 2   | Deorhi or Household expenses             |       |     |    |    |\n| 3   | Customs                                |        |     |    |    | 3   | Civil Administration                     |       |     |    |    |\n| 4   | Administration                          |        |     |    |    | 4   | Army and Police                          |       |     |    |    |\n| 5   | P.

G.-G. for Rajputana) was in charge. Ten years later the Agency seems to have been brought under reduction and amalgamated with the Jaipur Residency.\n\nIn the year 1873, Dholpur was made into a separate political charge and placed under Colonel T. Dennehy, who held the appointment till 1885, a period of 12 years, when that State was again amalgamated with the Eastern Rajputana States Agency, which appointment appears to have been resuscitated in the year 1887. Since that date this Agency, composed of the three States of Bharatpur, Dholpur and Karauli, has remained unchanged, with the exception of its head-quarters, which, until the year 1897 had been at Dholpur, were by order of Government then transferred to Bharatpur for political reasons, where it has since remained.\n\nA list of Political Officers attached to this Agency, with dates of appointment, is herewith appended for reference.

After this the Dholpur Agency was amalgamated with the Eastern Rajputana States Agency.\nFAIRS, MELAS, &c.,\n\nWith Dates and an Approximate Estimate of the Number of People frequenting them.\n\nThere are a large number of small fairs held throughout the State at different periods of the year, mostly for agricultural purposes, for sale of grain, agricultural stock, &c., and where the gatherings are local and of little importance. There are, however, two or three very large gatherings of people; for instance the Sitla fairs at Byana, the Mohurrum at Bharatpur, and the Dusera festival, at which large crowds of people assemble, and which often afford great facilities for the dissemination of epidemic diseases. At these latter the Medical and Sanitary departments of the State make arrangements for supervision and medical relief, and with that view I have had arranged a list showing all the fairs, &c., usually held in this State, together with the probable gatherings expected at each, which is most useful information for the Sanitary department, and enables them to make preparations for meeting any epidemic that may ensue as a result of such.\n| No. | Name of Police Circle | Place where Mela takes place | Name of Mela | Date of Mela | Period | Probable Gathering |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------|------------------|\n| 1   | Thana Sharqi Bhpr.     | Out of Muttra Gate            | Urs          | 30-1-1900   | 1 day  | 400              |\n| 2   | Kama                  | Mandar Ghata                  | Phuldole     | 25-2-1900   |        | 500              |\n| 3   | Dig                   | Poonchhri                     | Samoti Amawas| 36-8-1900   |        | 600              |\n| 4   | Dig                   | Katla Naraina                 | Sidh         | 21-3-1900   |        | 800              |\n| 5   | Thana Sharqi Bhpr.     | Our of Gordian Gate           | Saligram     | 30-3-1900   |        | 5,000            |\n| 6   | Rupbas                | Jatwansi                      | Phuldole     | 19 & 20-3-1900 | 2 days | 250              |\n| 7   | Thana Gharbi Bhpr.     | Sidh ka Mud                   | Sitla        | 24-3-1900   | 1 day  | 2,500            |\n| 8   | ditto                 | Out of Mindesh Gate           | Phuldole     | 27-3-1900   |        | 250              |\n| 9   | Byana                 | Birambad                      | Sitla        | 23 to 25-3-1900 | 3 days | 15,000           |\n| 10  | do                    | Uchain                        | Sitla        | 26 & 27-3-1900 | 2 days | 10,000           |\n| 11  | Uchain                | Uchain town                   | Zat Nakti Devi| 8-4-1900   |        | 700              |\n| 12  | do                    | Pichhona                      | Sururji      | 20-4-1900   |        | 500              |\n| 13  | do                    | Rudawal                       | Dajoj        | 18-4-1900   |        | 700              |\n| 14  | Dig                   | Sinail                        | Sidh         | 4-4-1900    | 1 day  | 400              |\n| 15  | do                    | Janother                      | Gangore      | 2-4-1900    |        | 500              |\n| 16  | do                    | Iklehra                       | Devi         | 6-4-1900    |        | 500              |\n| 17  | Thana Sharqi Bhpr.     | Out of Muttra Gate            | Jaitabati    | 1-4-1900    |        | 400              |\n| 18  | G.

waste by wild cattle, but since 1896 A.D. effective measures have been taken for the suppression of the nuisance, which is now happily a thing of the past.\n\nThe history of them is briefly as follows:\n\nTheir origin is commonly attributed to herds being released to roam in the jungle during war time, reinforced from time to time by ownerless animals and those released for religious purposes. The nuisance gradually increased, and reached large dimensions after the famine of 1877-78. The causes of the increase of wild cattle, and the consequent abandonment of cultivation were cumulative and reactive. Thus jungle and long grass grew on the deserted fields, which then became a cover for the herds which were wont to sally forth at night to devastate the crops in the neighbourhood. Cultivation could only be maintained by building mud walls round the fields, and by keeping watch through the night on the enclosed crop, as the cattle used to breach and surmount the walls.\n\nThe lot of the few remaining cultivators in the affected districts became most miserable. They were worn out with watching their crops and at last obliged to abandon their land, and had to subsist only by grazing cattle.\n\nThe land, once abandoned, could only be reclaimed by extirpating the long grass at great expense. Adding to these causes the depopulation and poverty that followed the famine of 1877, it is easy to realise how the people, prevented by religious scruples from taking the lives of the sacred animals, were harassed by them and gradually forced to retreat before their increasing inroads. In 1896 a map was made by the State Engineer of the affected district, and it was found that some 200 villages were suffering from the pest, which was, however, confined to the district north of the Banganga River and south of the Dig hills. Doubtless\nthe presence of carnivora in the southern district and of a Mohammedan population in the north prevented their spread beyond these limits. In consequence of complaints from the neighbouring British districts attempts were made at different times to mitigate the evil, but as far as any internal measures were concerned, these were ill-designed, half-hearted, and utterly inadequate. Protection to the Agra and Muttra districts was, however, ultimately afforded about ten years ago by the construction of a wire fence along the bodrer, 41 miles in length, which still exists. In 1896, while the State was being administered by the late Colonel Loch, Political Agent, a scheme was prepared by the State Engineer, Mr. Devenish, in the interests of agriculture, for confining the cattle within barbed wire fences to be constructed around the principal forest, known as the Keladeo Ghunna. The cattle were to be gradually driven in herds from their several haunts to the enclosure, which was to be $11\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles in area and 16 miles in circumference.\n\nThe scheme was sanctioned by the Administration, the fence was constructed, and a special department was formed for driving the cattle, and, as it was then hoped, for taming them afterwards. The herds were first surrounded by temporary enclosures near their several separate retreats, care being taken to select suitable ground containing trees to which the animals could be fastened after noosing. After preliminary handling in these temporary enclosures, the herds were all driven one by one during the succeeding three years within the permanent wire fence enclosure, where they now remain. The number of cattle thus enclosed was more than 5,000!\n\nThe enclosed forest land contains ample pasturage and water, and only the cattle which are undergoing taming are fed by hand. The wild cattle are extremely difficult to tame, and very little progress has been made in this operation, only 266 having been tamed and sold up to 1899. The object of the confinement of the cattle has, however, been achieved, and the results have been remarkably successful, nearly the whole of the deserted land having since come into cultivation!\nA few remarks may be noted as to the natural history of these wild cattle. They are smaller and less powerful than the tame cattle of the district, freedom under the disadvantages of insufficient food and water having tended to let their size and strength degenerate. The bulls, with their large dewlaps and humps, appear to be fine beasts, but few, if any, of them when tamed are acceptable to the villagers for the plough or the well, and their progeny from tame kine is small and weedy, great damage in this respect having been done to the tame herds by the intrusion of wild bulls. The bulls of a herd consort together, except during the pairing season, and in this curious habit closely follow the ways of other wild animals of the ruminant species. The prevalent colour is grey. There were formerly no carnivora in the neighbourhood of Bharatpur, but since the enclosure of the wild cattle a few panthers and occasionally tigers have taken up their abode in the Ghunna, several of which have been shot recently.\n\nThe impounded cattle usually keep in excellent condition and breed freely; during the last few years, however, owing to excessive flooding of the land within the enclosure, large numbers have died.\nCLIMATE.\n\nThe climate of the States in this Agency is generally dry, and, I should say, healthy, the State of Bharatpur being the least so of the three for various reasons, foremost among which is the large amount of inundated land that exists during the monsoon, partly natural, owing to floods from the rivers in the States, as well as partly artificial, owing to the existence of large irrigation works. These latter facts of course render the land very fertile, and afford great facilities for agriculture, but are not altogether without their drawbacks from an essentially sanitary point of view, as they render the soil waterlogged and damp, which factor favours the production of malarial fevers, rheumatism, &c., and other diseases which are known to be directly attributable to such phenomena. For the above reasons the climate of Bharatpur is cooler than that of either of the two other States. In all three States there is a large proportion of hilly and broken country called the \"Dang,\" especially noticeable in the States of Dholpur and Karauli, in which latter it is more or less a general feature of the country, and is in the former most marked along the course of the river Chambal, which borders it on the south along its entire length. In the hot months the thermometer registers very high, and the enormous amount of radiation off sand and rock is so great as to practically never allow the earth to cool down during the 24 hours, resulting in great discomfort to the inhabitants, who, as a rule, usually migrate during this time to the low-lying ground in the neighbourhood of the rivers, where also a little grazing can usually be obtained for their cattle.\n\nDuring the hot months a strong west wind blows often night and day, which allows of the full use of tatties to those who can afford such. Taking into consideration the average rainfall of the Province, I should say that on the whole, the Eastern States enjoy an amount of rainfall above the average of any others in Rajputana. This may partially be due to their situation at the extreme eastern side, where they probably come in for some of the monsoon current coming up from the Bay of Bengal, as well as from that coming from Bombay side. The above fact is also, I think,\nborne out by the slight amount of famine which has been apparent locally, at times too when this calamity has been so severe in other parts of the same Province; though as regards Bharatpur, its comparative immunity to such must be attributed in great part to the excellent system of irrigation which exists in that State, which at times renders it independent of the local rainfall. This factor is especially noticeable to anyone making a tour through this State and comparing it with the other two in this Agency.\n\nA detailed statement of rainfall records for the past ten years will be found under the head \"Meteorological Data.\"\nMETEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.\n\nUntil quite recently no Meteorological Observatory existed in any of the States of this Agency, and therefore no meteorological data are available with the exception of rainfall records, which appear to have been taken purely for agricultural reasons, and these too in a very unsatisfactory manner, and consequently are entirely unreliable from a scientific standpoint. The accompanying tables give the rainfall at each of the recording stations in this State, from which it will be seen that the advent of famine has been remarkably prognosticated by the gradually-decreasing rainfall both in the years 1895 and 1896, culminating in the famine of 1897, when a normal rainfall alleviated the distress, and again in the years 1898 and 1899 when the fall was slightly less than normal, which resulted in scarcity but not actual famine, and which was ultimately relieved by the abundant and timely rains of 1900. Though this State appears to have had a fair amount of rain in the years 1898 and 1899 other parts of Rajputana suffered severely in this respect, which drought ultimately culminated in the severest famine (that of 1900) which has ever been experienced in the memory of any of us. I attribute the immunity more or less enjoyed by Bharatpur in the late famines, to the very excellent system of irrigation which prevails in the State, but which, perhaps, is owing in part also to the efforts of the rural population themselves, the vast majority of whom are past-masters in the art of agriculture, and utilize every square inch of soil for agricultural purposes where possible. A note on the famines which have affected this State will be found later on.\n\nThe average rainfall of the Bharatpur State is annually about 25 inches; this during the last ten years has been greatly exceeded in the years 1891 to 1894 inclusive, but much diminished in the years 1895 to 1897, a condition, as above stated, ending up with famine in the latter year; and again in the year 1899 which was also as regards this State followed by scarcity not actually tantamount to famine, owing to the fact that the previous seasons had been for this State as regards rainfall fairly good ones, though other parts of the province suffered severely, resulting in some instances in actual decimation of the population!\n\nThe rainfall seems to be, as a rule, fairly evenly distri-\nbuted over the State, the largest amounts being registered as having fallen over the Bharatpur tehsil.\n\nThere are twelve recording stations in this State, all of which are located at the head-quarters of each tehsil, the instruments being of the Symons' pattern, and in the custody of the Medical Subordinate in charge of the local dispensary, by whom all observations are recorded, and submitted monthly to the office of the Agency Surgeon for disposal.\n\nTill lately, these instruments were in a very neglected state, but I have been able with the help of the late Dewan to ensure their better protection by the erection of barbed wire fences around each enclosure. Where possible, these instruments have been placed as close as possible to the dispensaries, but in a few cases, owing to local causes, this has not been practicable.\n\nThe following list indicates the position of every instrument, each of which is annually inspected and reported upon by the Agency Surgeon during his cold weather tours:\n\nBharatpur, located at the Victoria Hospital.\nUchain near Dispensary.\nRoopbas Tehsil.\nByana Dispensary.\nWeir Tehsil.\nBhusawar Dispensary.\nAkheygarh\nNagar\nPahari\nKaman in Tehsil.\nDig Dispensary.\nKumher\n\nAll the instruments are in excellent condition and well looked after, and the records accurately and carefully kept.\n\nIn the year 1901 a small Observatory was erected by my exertions in the grounds of the Victoria Hospital at the Charbagh inside the city of Bharatpur, on a spot selected by the Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India, who very kindly visited the place, at my request, for that purpose. It is provided with instruments of latest design, and records are regularly and carefully kept and forwarded to the Government of India. The junior Medical Subordinate on duty at the Victoria Hospital is in charge of it, and for which he draws a small monthly allowance from the Government of India. No such institution exists at present at the capitals of the two other States in this Agency.\nAverage Monthly and Yearly Rainfall from 1890 to 1899 for each Tehsil and for the whole Bharatpur State

columns are marked thus X.\nFAMINE.\n\nThe most severe famine that has affected this part of the country, and which is still remembered by the present generation, was that of Sambat 1934 (A.D. 1877). Very little appears to have been done to succour the people in that famine, and great distress and depopulation occurred.\n\nAgain Bharatpur was affected by serious scarcity in 1896-97, when relief works were opened both under the management of P.W.D. and Revenue authorities, by which means all distressed people requiring help were relieved. The maximum daily number attending works in that famine amounted to 15,000, in itself not being exorbitant. Those weak and unfit for hard labour were fed in the poorhouses opened both by State and public charities, and some were given food gratuitously on the relief works also. This distress lasted for nine months, when the monsoon of 1897 set in and enabled the people to resume agricultural operations for the Rabi crop. The State afforded timely aid by distributing Rs. 24,000 as Taccavi advances to needy and resourceless cultivators at the advent of rains, and thus enabled the tenantry, as a body, to take to sowing their crops.\n\nThe famine of 1899-1900 showed itself in unusually high prices, which were owing to generally deficient rainfall. The rains in that year were unnecessarily copious in the month of Asarh (at the Kharif sowings), which caused a considerable area to remain unsown owing to unusual moisture, and the seed which was sown afterwards either did not germinate or was totally dried up later, as the rains practically ceased unusually early, the few standing crops remaining stunted for the same reason. The defective rains caused a decrease of water in bunds and wells, and thus indirectly much affected the irrigation and Chahi cultivation, which would otherwise have been much better in the event of sufficient rains. Another indirect result of the defective rains on crops was that the water of many wells was thereby rendered so salty as to be detrimental to the valuable crops.\n\nThe following statement shows the rainfall and area\nunder cultivation in the year of famine, as compared with the previous year's corresponding figures:\n\n| Crop   | Average Rainfall | Total Cultivated Area |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1898 Kharif | 18.50           | 1,327,933             |\n| 1899 Rabi    | 55              | 546,124               |\n| **Total**    | **19.05**       | **1,874,057**         |\n| 1899 Kharif | 18.54           | 1,383,562             |\n| 1900 Rabi    | 12\u00bd             | 3,40,242              |\n| **Total**    | **18.66\u00bd**      | **17,23,805**         |\n\nLooking to these figures, it will be noticed that the rains in the year 1899-1900 were not much below the corresponding figures in the past year, and it appears that the rains in the Kharif season 1899 were more by 4 per cent. than in Kharif 1898, the reason being found in the unnecessarily copious rains at the outset of Kharif 1899, and then a practical cessation of the showers which should protect the crops from drought. The winter rains, too, in the Rabi of 1899 were less by about half an inch than in the Rabi of 1898. This bad distribution and deficiency of rainfall are the factors mainly accountable for the famine under report.\n\nTable showing the Price of Food Grains sold in Bharatpur City from 1890 to 1899.\n\n| Year | Barley | Gram. | Rice. | Dal of | Remarks |\n|------|--------|-------|-------|--------|---------|\n|      | Sr. Ch.| Sr. Ch.| Sr. Ch.| Sr. Ch.| Sr. Ch.| Sr. Ch.|\n| 1890 | 21     | 20    | 4     | 8      | 4      | 14     | 0      | 13     | 0      | 15     | 0      |\n| 1891 | 22     | 20    | 6     | 8      | 0      | 16     | 0      | 15     | 0      | 14     | 8      |\n| 1892 | 25     | 25    | 0     | 7      | 10     | 16     | 4      | 14     | 6      | 15     | 0      |\n| 1893 | 27     | 26    | 13    | 7      | 8      | 20     | 12     | 18     | 2      | 14     | 0      |\n| 1894 | 31     | 11    | 29    | 0      | 8      | 4      | 22     | 7      | 21     | 14     | 16     | 0      |\n| 1895 | 25     | 9     | 23    | 0      | 8      | 0      | 20     | 3      | 14     | 13     | 15     | 8      |\n| 1896 | 18     | 1     | 16    | 1      | 6      | 10     | 9      | 13     | 10     | 12     | 11     | 4      |\n| 1897 | 14     | 0     | 10    | 1      | 5      | 8      | 7      | 8      | 7      | 10     | 6      | 15     |\n| 1898 | 28     | 4     | 23    | 0      | 7      | 6      | 10     | 1      | 14     | 2      | 11     | 12     |\n| 1899 | 20     | 15    | 17    | 2      | 5      | 4      | 11     | 4      | 16     | 2      | 11     | 5      |\n| **Total**, ... | **234** | **6** | **210** | **11** | **82** | **6** | **148** | **6** | **145** | **13** | **131** | **4** |\n| **Average**, ... | **93** | **7** | **21** | **11** | **7** | **3** | **14** | **13** | **14** | **9** | **13** | **2** |\nTable showing the Average Price of Food Grains sold in Bharatpur City from 1890 to 1899, and its relation to the Deathrate of the Population shown in Seers and Chittacks per Rupee.\n\n| Year | Wheat | Moth | Bajra or Millet | Remarks |\n|------|-------|------|-----------------|---------|\n|      | Sr. Ch. | Sr. Ch. | Sr. Ch. | Comparative rates | Death rate | Condition of year as to general health | Rainfall |\n| 1890 | 15 10 | 15 12 | 18 4 | Average Moth, dear | ... | ... | Little below average |\n| 1891 | 16 9 | 19 11 | 17 2 | Average | ... | ... | Above |\n| 1892 | 17 6 | 19 3 | 16 10 | Average, cheap, Moth and Bajra | Very high | Unhealthy | Above average |\n| 1893 | 16 12 | 24 8 | 27 0 | Very cheap | Low | Healthy | Average |\n| 1894 | 21 3 | 30 5 | 23 7 | Average Wheat, cheap, and Moth very cheap | High | Fairly healthy | do |\n| 1895 | 18 13 | 24 6 | 19 0 | Dear | Low | Healthy | Little below average |\n| 1896 | 13 12 | 16 4 | 16 1 | Very dear | Do. | Small |\n| 1897 | 11 8 | 9 1 | 10 1 | Average Bajra very cheap | Highest | Average |\n| 1898 | 17 11 | 19 13 | 22 1 | Very cheap | High | Fairly healthy | do |\n| 1899 | 14 8 | 19 14 | 19 2 | Dear, average Moth and Bajra | Low | Healthy | Small |\n\nTotal: 163 12 198 13 183 12\n\n16 6 19 14 18 14\nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE.\n\nNote on the Irrigation and Drainage System of the Bharatpur State.\n\n1. Sources of Irrigation.\u2014There are no perennial streams in the Bharatpur State.\n\nInundation or irrigation is obtained from the sources and by the means described below, viz.:\n\n(a) from torrential streams, either by natural spill or by means of inundation canals and training banks.\n\n(b) from local drainage intercepted by \u201cBunds\u201d or embankments.\n\n(c) from wells.\n\n2. Torrential Streams.\u2014Three large torrential streams enter the State across its western border, the Ruparel at the northern end, having about 1,000 square miles of drainage area in Alwar territory, the Banganga River in the southern part, having more than 1,000 square miles of drainage area in Jaipur territory, and the Gambhir River at the southern extremity, having about 500 square miles of catchment in Jaipur and Karauli. These streams flow only during the monsoon season, the floods generally lasting two or three days at a time. Both the Ruparel and the Banganga River flow between low banks, over which they spill when in flood, this peculiarity combined with the fall of the country affording great facility for irrigation.\n\n3. The Ruparel River.\u2014The Ruparel floods as they enter the State are diverted by the Sikri Bund, a fine embankment which extends for 12 miles along the western boundary, so that they do not follow the old river valley (marked in the map by a chain of swamps extending through the Pahari and Biana pergunnahs towards the Muttra districts) but are distributed through sluices at intervals, mainly in an easterly direction over the pergunnahs of Pahari, Gopalgarh and Nagar, the distribution of the water being effected by a system of distributary channels from the sluices and shallow subsidiary reservoirs fed by these channels. The Bharatpur State has a formal right by treaty to the use of the unimpeded flow of the Ruparel floods during the monsoon season. The irrigation derived from these floods is a valuable source of prosperity, the area of crop irrigated in good years amounting to 30,000 acres or more.\n4. **System of Irrigation.**\u2014The system of irrigation from the Ruparel River and throughout the Bharatpur State is to utilize the floods for inundating the land during the rainy season, when the soil becomes thoroughly saturated, a slight deposit of silt, which possesses highly fertilizing properties being also left on the surface by the floods.\n\nAfter the termination of the rainy season in October, the water is drained off, and the flooded fields are ploughed and sown for the winter crop. The sub-soil retains the moisture sufficiently and at such a depth as to nourish the growing plant with the need of future irrigation. The winter rains assist in producing a heavy crop, and if they fail the crops are light; or well irrigation is resorted to in order to feed them sufficiently.\n\n5. **Banganga River.**\u2014The Banganga River spills freely over its northern bank as it passes through the State, and about midway in its course eastwards the river has left its old channel and now flows in a northerly direction towards Uchain along the Biana-Uchain road. The diversion of the river has been encouraged artificially by the use of the Byana-Uchain road as a training bank. This road is carried on a raised embankment from Nekpur to Sewar, with flood regulators discharging in an easterly direction. The flood water so discharged is again impounded and distributed by other works, the largest of which is the Ajan Bund, a fine embankment extending for 12 miles across the direction of flow. The Ajan Bund, which commands the whole vicinity of the Bharatpur city, contains a number of sluices and weirs through which the flood water can be released to irrigate the land in rear during flood time, and the sluices are also employed to empty the basin of the bund, which has a contour area of 14 square miles.\n\nThe system of irrigation is the same as that described for the Ruparel. The Ajan Bund and other reservoirs are emptied at the end of October, and the flooded land on both sides is then ploughed and sown. The influence of the Banganga floods is specially valuable in freshening the water in wells and in saturating the soil for agricultural purposes.\n\n6. **Recent Improvement of the Irrigation System.**\u2014The Banganga inundations until recent years were uncontrolled, and were thus a cause of much loss to the State, instead of\nbeing, as now, a valuable source of prosperity. The old works had been abandoned in a breached condition, immoderate flooding took place in natural depressions, which became thereby uncultivable while the higher land on the margin remained unirrigated. The main principle of the irrigation system introduced since 1895 has been to spread the water out over high land and to protect the depressions from swamping by embankments and drains.\n\n7. *The Keladeo Jhil.*\u2014The Keladeo Jhil, 3 miles south of the Bharatpur city, is a notable depression flooded annually from the Banganga River, via the Ajan Bund. The Jhil is now drained so that water can be stored in it to any desired depth, and it is partitioned by small embankments into pockets which can be flooded separately. The Jhil is flooded partly for the sake of sport and partly to induce a growth of grass for the wild cattle and game confined in the forest enclosure.\n\n8. *Cut or Channels from the Banganga River.*\u2014In addition to the Uchain Canal there are other cuts or inundation canals recently taken out from the Banganga River, one near Pathena on the north bank, one at Halena 50 feet wide also on the north bank, and 50 feet wide on the south bank nearly opposite the latter, which feeds the large reservoir known as the Lalpur Bund. The flood water taken out of the river by cuts is either held up in shallow reservoirs or pockets, or is spread out over the land. By means of these cuts and reservoir nearly the whole flow of the river is utilized and absorbed within the State territory. In 1900 the total area of crop irrigated from the Banganga River amounted to 32,000 acres.\n\n9. *The Gambhir River.*\u2014The Gambhir River has well-defined banks, and does not spill largely until it enters the old Banganga River bed. The silt of this stream is said to be highly fertile, and crops are commonly grown in the river bed after the rainy season. The Gambhir River is made to spill largely into the Rupbas pergunnah at the eastern extremity of the State by means of natural and artificial channels at Dhana Ghata, Bakholi and Shekhpur, all taking out from the southern banks. There is also a considerable natural spill from the northern bank. This irrigation is valuable, the crops grown in the flooded land being remarkably good; but of late years the floods have\nbeen slight, and the area flooded not extensive. There have been excellent floods in July 1901. In 1900 about 1,500 acres were benefited by natural or artificial spill from the Gambhir. Irrigation works to develop the system are in progress, and in 1901 several thousand acres have been flooded.\n\n10. Local Catchments.\u2014It remains to describe the irrigation from local catchments. This system of irrigation is very complete in the Bharatpur State, nearly all the available catchment being impounded, so that only a small proportion of the local rainfall escapes beyond the State territory, and that only in the sparsely inhabited ravine tracts in the southern extremity. The catchments impounded vary in size from $\\frac{1}{2}$ square mile to 10 square miles, but the typical size may be said to be about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles intercepted by a low earthen bank more than a mile in length. These embankments, as well as the sheets of water impounded by them, are termed \"bunds.\" The main characteristics of the Bharatpur bunds are their length and sinuosity; they wind sometimes for two miles or more across a shallow depression, the depth of which does not usually exceed 7 ft. at a maximum.\n\nThe bunds are generally thickly planted with trees, which protect and consolidate the banks. During recent years the old bunds, nearly all of which had been breached and abandoned, have been restored and improved, the necessary escape weirs or bye-washes having been provided to prevent their destruction in flood time.\n\n11. Number, value, locality and average of village Bunds.\u2014There are more than a hundred of these bunds, not counting the training banks (also termed bunds) of the river inundation system before described.\n\nThe local catchment bunds are numerous in the Weir, Biana and Rupbas districts, there are few in the Dig and Kama pergunnahs, and very few in the remaining parts of the State.\n\nIn 1900 the area of crop irrigated by village bunds having catchment areas less than 12 square miles in area amounted to 19,000 acres, from which figures it will be seen that the extent of cultivation depending upon the small bunds appears to be unimportant when compared with the widespread inundation from the larger streams. The influence, however, of the small bunds in contributing to the\ncontentment and prosperity of the villages, is a sufficient reason for the present policy of the State in carefully improving and maintaining these works, which are more valuable to the villagers than the mere figures of acreage would imply. The bund protects the best land in the villages and keeps up the well level. There are still some twenty small bunds to be restored.\n\n12. The Bareta Bund.\u2014There is only one large storage reservoir in the State. This is the Bareta Bund, a large work commenced in 1867, abandoned on the late Maharajah's accession and completed in 1897 during the political administration of the State. This reservoir, which is situated 6 miles west of Biana, has a catchment area of 70 square miles, a storage basin of 1,500 million cubic feet capacity, a waterspread when full of 4 square miles, and a maximum depth of 40 feet below escape level. Since its completion in 1897 the bund has always received an ample supply, the basin overflowing in 1898 and being nearly filled in the other years. There are three ducts or distributary channels leading from the sluices to arable ground in rear, by means of which in 1899 some 3,000 acres were under irrigation. The influence of this large reservoir on the surrounding country has been remarkable, a considerable tract of waste land having come into occupation. The presence of a large sheet of water throughout the year has also attracted large game to the ravines bordering the lake. Irrigation from this bund takes place continually throughout the year for both the rabi and kharif crops.\n\n13. Season of Irrigation.\u2014From the foregoing description, it will be gathered that with slight exceptions the irrigation from canals and bunds in the Bharatpur State takes place in the rainy season, for the prospective benefit of the winter crop. Most of the kharif crops would be damaged by irrigation except in years of drought, though in the case of the Sikri and Bareta Bunds some of the intermediate crops, such as rice, sugar and cotton, are watered during growth. It is interesting to note that the loss of kharif or rain crops by flooding is not considered a misfortune, as it enables the more valuable rabi or winter crop to be grown in its place. The kharif is commonly sown on the chance of the floods being deficient on land which is liable to flooding. The winter crops, excepting the case\nof the Bareta Bund, are either not watered artificially during growth, or they depend on wells.\n\n14. **Irrigation by Wells.**\u2014There is a great deal of irrigation done by wells throughout the State. The depth of water surface in the wells in the dry season is about 35 ft. below ground level on an average. Many of the wells, especially those in the central pergunnahs of the State, are bitter. According to the new Settlement Report there are 106,000 acres of land irrigated by wells, 11,610 sweet wells and 5,852 bitter wells in the State. Though the bitter wells can be used partially for irrigating growing crops under certain conditions, the sweet wells, which are largely used in the \"Chahi\" land, are the more valuable. The wells are used mainly for the winter crops, both at the time of sowing and for subsequent waterings. They are also used to revive the kharif crops if the rains are deficient.\n\nWater is drawn from the wells by the ancient method of the \"charas\" or leather bag drawn up over a pulley by bullocks driven down a slope. One pair of bullocks can water six acres, and the wells are sometimes wide enough for two or three charas to be worked at the same time. The quality and quantity of water in the wells are much improved by yearly inundations in the neighbourhood, the deep sources being generally bitter owing to lime and salts in the soil.\n\n15. **Drainage Lines.**\u2014Regarding the drainage of the State, reference is invited to the attached map, in which the drainage courses are indicated by arrows. Omitting the hilly tracts, there is a slight gradual fall from the north of the city to Bharatpur, and a fall of about 2 ft. in a mile from the south towards the city, so that the Capital of the State is situated where these opposite drainage slopes meet.\n\nThe main fall of the country is, however, easterly towards the junction of the Jumna and Champal Rivers, the fall in this direction being about 5 ft. in a mile.\n\nThe environs of Bharatpur city, which may be easily flooded by the accumulation of floods chiefly from the south, is thus nevertheless readily drainable by cuts bending in a south-easterly direction towards the Khari Naddi, a tributary of the Chambal River, which river is the destina-\ntion of all the drainage escaping from the State territory. Owing, however, to the natural drainage courses by canals and bunds very little drainage water now leaves the State except by the Gambhir River in times of heavy floods.\n\n16. **Swamps in the North.**\u2014The chain of swamps marked on the map in the extreme north are land-locked and undrainable except easterly towards the Muttra district. An artificial cut would be required for this purpose, as the natural outlet is blocked in British territory, the old Ruparel valley, along which swamps lie, having become silted up owing to the diversion of the stream.\n\nThe swamping of the valley has, however, been obviated recently by the restoration of the Sikri Bund, which now intercepts the Ruparel floods, so that the swamps which used to be fed by floods escaping through breaches in the bund do not now exist permanently.\n\n17. **Drainage and protection of low-lying land from swamping.**\u2014The other parts of the Bharatpur State which formerly suffered from excessive flooding, have now been relieved by diversion of the floods or by drainage. Unless the floods are controlled, the environs of the Bharatpur city may lie in swamp throughout the greater part of the year, but it is now possible to keep the flooding in control, so that only a moderate inundation of the low-lying land to the south-west of the city is allowed, from which source the Fort Moat is filled annually, as soon as the flood water has become fairly clear.\n\nIf there is any surplus water in the depression after filling the Fort Moat the same can be drained off in a south-west direction by means of an underground masonry channel passing through the city.\n\n18. **Former swamping of the environs of the Bharatpur City.**\u2014In former times, especially in time of war, the outskirts of the city used to be flooded from the north by means of the neighbouring Moti Jhil Bund, as well as from the south-west, the object being defence. The ditch outside the ramparts was then filled with water, thus rendering an assault extremely difficult.\n\n19. **The City Ditch.**\u2014The Fort drains into the Moat surrounding it, and the city is mostly drained into the outer ditch surrounding the earth-works, which is itself undrainable except by pumping. The amount of storm water dis-\ncharged into the ditch is, however, comparatively small, so that the ditch soon dries up and is not offensive, provided that no flood water is admitted into it from outside; in the latter case the water in the ditch would remain throughout the year, and, becoming putrid by contamination with sewage, would become a serious nuisance and a menace to the public health.\n\nSteps have been taken of recent years to keep the ditch dry, but in 1900, during the Executive Engineer's absence on leave, it was unfortunately filled with water from outside, with the result that a considerable nuisance was created, and pumping was ultimately resorted to in order to get rid of the foul water.\n\n20. The Fort Moat.\u2014The Moat round the Fort is revetted by masonry walls. It is about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circumference, 200 wide and 30 ft. deep when full. The Moat has only once been dry in the memory of the present generation, and then probably owing to a prolonged failure of floods during successive years.\n\nIn June 1900 the water in the Moat was 20 ft. deep, having been reduced by only 10 ft. in depth at the end of the hot season, although there is some drain on it for the irrigation of gardens in addition to the loss by percolation and evaporation.\n\nOwing to the large concentrated volume of the water in the Moat, it does not at any time become sufficiently impure to become a nuisance. Fish thrive in it, and it is a feature of great utility and interest to the city.\n\n21. Sanitation drainage near the City.\u2014During recent years considerable attention has been paid to the drainage of streets and low-lying ground outside the city, and storm water passes off with fair rapidity. A good deal has been done towards the filling up of small undrainable hollows in which stagnant water accumulates, but owing to the method formerly prevalent of building mud huts from soil dug in pits here and there, according to the convenience of the builders, there remain a large number of insanitary excavations which can only be filled up gradually as funds are available. The dismantling of ruined or insanitary congeries of huts and the restoration of the mud in the walls to the pits from which it was dug, is especially desirable whenever it is possible to arrange for acquirement of the huts.\nGAME AND GRASS PRESERVES.\n\n(Fauna-Avifauna.)\n\nIn the Bharatpur State there are numbers of large tracts of grass land covered with scrub jungle, locally known as \"ghunnas,\" or in some places \"roonds,\" preserved for the purpose of growing grass for fodder, chiefly for use of mounted troops, in the jungles of which are usually found a large quantity of game of all kinds. The most extensive of these preserves is that situated at Kevlodeo close to Bharatpur city, in which at present all the captured wild cattle are enclosed, the enclosed area being about sixteen miles round; other smaller ones exist at Helak, Dig, Rupbas and Rarah. There are again in addition to these many others, however, of smaller extent. That at Rupbas forms part at any rate of what used to be, hundreds of years ago, the shooting grounds of the Emperor Akbar, when his head-quarters were at Fatehpur-Sikri; and there exist to this day in this \"roond\" remains of chabootras which were used as machans during drives of game for the purpose of sport by him and his followers. In both the other States of this Agency, there exist similar places on a smaller scale, also stocked with small game of all kinds, whereas in both Karauli and Dholpur among the hilly tracts very extensive jungles exist, in which is to be found big game in plenty, such as tiger and panther, and in some places even bear, sam-bhur, cheetal, &c.\n\nFauna, &c.\u2014In considering the distribution of wild animals over these States, it will be as well to stick to the Natural History classification of them, and to that end, I shall commence with the natural order, Bimana. There are as far as I know only two members of this order which inhabit this State, and they are firstly Presbytes Entellus, usually known as the common Bengal Langur, and the variety Macacus Rhesus or common Bengal Monkey, the former inhabiting the hilly tracts generally about all three States, and the latter usually to be found in the vicinity of, or actually within, most of the large towns in these States, though they appear to throng to places where population is largest, as such places afford greater opportunities for pilfering food, &c. The Langur on the other hand lives upon flower buds and berries usually to be found in the hilly regions named.\nAs regards wild animals of all kinds, these are to be found in fair abundance in all three States of this Agency. Amongst the carnivora are to be found tiger, panther, hy\u00e6na, bear, wolves, jackals, wild dogs (only in Karauli) wild cats; and along the banks of the River Chambal in both Dholpur and Karauli are to be found others in abundance.\n\n3. *Felis Tigris.*\u2014Tigers are to be found in all three States. In Bharatpur territory they are to be found chiefly confined to the tehsils of Biana and Weir, also in Bullubghar, a Jagir held by Faujdar Debi Singh, the leading Sirdar of the State. The country in these tehsils is hilly and intersected by ravines, with occasional tanks or bunds where water is usually available throughout the year. Large numbers of cattl are grazed in these parts, there is little opportunity for agriculture, and so facilities for the well-being of tigers are provided thereby. It is a curious fact that since the construction of a large bund at Bareta, a village in the \"Dang\" country, about six miles to the east of the town of Biana, a good many tigers have come and taken up their permanent abode in these regions, which are provided with plenty of water all the year round without any chance of drought for them, as well as being a cool neighbourhood. There is little doubt that numbers of them have migrated from Karauli territory across the border in late years, owing to the above cause and have remained, as in a drive recently held in this region no less than six came out of one nullah!\n\nIn both the States of Dholpur and Karauli there are numbers of them, especially in the Dang country, the Ruling Chief of the latter State being a keen sportsman and accounts for a great many every year, I myself having had the pleasure of being at the death of a few. These animals in this part of India do not, as a rule, run to such large dimensions as those found in parts of Bengal, but are stouter and more thick-set animals, and hence probably better adapted to tackle the hilly country which they inhabit. Of late years these animals have actually found their way up to the \"ghunnah\" close to Bharatpur city, and where I myself shot one, as also a panther in this neighbourhood within the wild cattle enclosure at Kevlodeo.\n\n4. *Felis Pardus.*\u2014This species is found generally throughout the three States, but chiefly among the hilly\ncountry called the \"Dang,\" where they are found to inhabit caves and holes in the many quarries which abound in this region in the Bharatpur State. I have, however, found them in the region of bunds, but these having probably come in search of prey, as a rule do not stray far from hilly ground, but live under rocks, where they usually make their lairs, and deposit their cubs. One frequently comes upon one of these animals where one would least expect them, and one day while walking down the main road of the large Ghunnah at Kevlodeo with my wife, we encountered one on the road. This individual I went next morning and tracked, finding he went to drink at a spring close by, and sat up over it the next evening and shot him.\n\nThey are very destructive animals, and, like tiger, usually kill every third day. It can thus be estimated, in places where can they can get no game but only cattle, what destruction they are guilty of.\n\n5. *Felis Torquata.*\u2014This animal, the spotted wild cat (Jeardon), is a very handsome little creature, to be found either or rocky ground, or as far as my experience goes, in the grass abounding in the many \"roonds\" or grass preserves in the three States. It is usually very fierce and destructive to all small game, and does not altogether confine its dietary to the jerboa-rat, as some naturalists would lead one to suppose, as I have caught them sometimes in *flagrante delicto* stalking other game; and shot them while so doing. The above are the only representatives of the Felidae present in these States which I am aware of, except the Felis Caracal (Red Lynx-Jerdon) which is said to inhabit parts of the hilly country in the Karauli State along the River Chambal.\n\n6. *Ursus Labiatus.*\u2014This bear, the common Indian Sloth Bear, is not to be found in Bharatpur, but is occasionally come across in the hilly country bordering on the River Chambal in the Karauli and Dholpur States.\n\n7. *Hyena Striata.*\u2014This carnivorous animal forms a link between the Felidae and Viverridae, and though resembling the dog, strictly speaking, is not of that genus at all, hence the reason for my taking it separately. These animals are to be found well distributed all over the three States, in almost any kind of country, in which they are very destructive to goat, sheep, and pariah dogs. Their\nhabits are absolutely nocturnal, and during the day they usually sleep heavily, so much so that I have on one or two occasions with difficulty startled them up, and they have shown no indecent haste to be off! Though these animals are as a rule harmless to man, I know of a case which came under my notice medically in which a sepoy of the I. S. Infantry here was attacked at night and severely mauled by one in a jungle to the north of the city of Bharatpur, and the animal being killed afterwards (partly by him in the struggle) absolutely vouches for the veracity of the story. The animal was shortly afterwards inspected by me at the scene of the encounter, the next morning, and turned out to be a very large female hy\u00e6na, very advanced in pregnancy. It was in miserable condition and appeared half starved, which perhaps would account for its boldness. The sepoy narrowly escaped amputation of his forearm, but thanks to rigorous antiseptic treatment the wounds; which were severe and resulted in two fingers being bitten off, healed up very shortly afterwards. The only other important members of the carnivora which are to be found in this State remaining to be described, are animals belonging to the family Cynoidea, consisting of wolves, jackals, foxes and wild dogs.\n\nIn the genus Canis we have two representatives, the wolf and jackal.\n\n8. *Canis Pallipes.*\u2014This animal, the common Indian wolf (Jerdon), is to be found generally distributed over the country in the three States, being most abundant where ravines exist, in which they usually make holes and live, prowling out at nights to make their depredations, though this is by no means the rule, as I have seen in open daylight in a jungle a wolf rush into a flock of goats and carry off one under the very nose of the shepherd tending them!\n\n9. *Canis Aureus.*\u2014The common jackal is to be found everywhere, generally distributed over the country, lying up in a cool place during the day usually among the crops, or in very hot weather in holes, and prowling about all night in quest of food, fruit, berries growing in the jungles of every kind, even crops in the fields they will destroy and eat; in fact, I do not think there is anything that a jackal will not eat when he is put to a pinch. Of the genus Cuon we have only one representative, and that is the wild dog.\n10. *Canis Rutilans.*\u2014The Indian wild dog is not a very significant looking animal, but for ferocity and boldness it takes first place; wherever it is found it becomes the terror of the neighbourhood as regards game of every kind. I have even known tigers to leave a jungle when these beasts appear, which they usually do in packs, in which state they hunt, and as before mentioned, if not stopped they will clear a jungle in no time of every living animal. They are to be found, as regards this Agency, only in the hilly country and forests in the Karauli State in the vicinity of the River Chambal. Of the genus Vulpes we have one only in these States.\n\n11. *Vulpes Bengalensis.*\u2014The common Indian fox is to be found generally distributed over the State; it is a very pretty little animal, whose fur varies in colour greatly at different times of the year. I once came across a whole family amongst some sand-hills along the bed of the Banganga River, whose members I nearly succeeded in capturing; they were all, mother and cubs, of a light grey silvery colour. This statement bears out what Jerdon and other naturalists mention as to the variety of colours the fur takes according to the season of the year. This animal, like the jackal, is capable of eating almost anything, from vermin to fruit.\n\nThis, I think, disposes of members of the land carnivora which frequent these States. We have yet to consider any members of aquatic carnivora which inhabit this part of the country. As far as I have been able to judge, the only representative of this kind we have is one belonging to the Lutridae.\n\n12. *Lutra Nair.*\u2014The common Indian otter is, as far as I am aware, only to be found in the River Chambal, which comprises the southern boundary of both the States of Dholpur and Karauli. I have myself shot a pair of these animals in this river not far from Dholpur. They are very pretty little creatures, possessed of beautiful fur, very fierce and plucky, and live on fish, which they usually play havoc with if left undisturbed. I have known them, however, come down with heavy floods to the Keolddeo Jheel near Bharatpur and even into the Fort moat!\n\nThe only other members of the carnivora worth mention which are left to describe, belong to the genus Herpes-\ntid\u00e6, and consist of the mongoose, two varieties of which class are to be found in these States, viz: *Herperties Pallidus*, usually known as the common grey mongoose, and the *Herperties Jerdonsi* or long-tailed mongoose (Jerdon), both of which are so familiar to the ordinary observer as to require no description.\n\nOf the Rodentia the only members requiring notice are *Sciurus Polmarumor*, the common Indian ground squirrel, and *Gerbillus Indicus* or the Indian jerboa-rat, also called the kangaroo-rat owing to the curious posture it adopts when eating; another variety of the jerboa-rat called *Garbillus Hurrianae* is sometimes to be seen inhabiting sandy tracts and is known as the desert variety; it is fairly common over Rajputana.\n\nOf animals of the order *Ungulata* inhabiting these States we have the wild-boar, and under the *Ruminantia* we find antelope and gazelles as well, while under the *Cervidae* we find sambhur and spotted deer.\n\n13. *Lus Indicus.*\u2014The Indian wild-boar is to be found in great numbers throughout all three States in every kind of country, and is so well-known as to need no further description here. In the State of Dholpur it abounds, and the country being rideable, is resorted to by sportsmen for the purpose of pig-sticking. The late Maharaj Rana was in his time the finest living exponent of this sport.\n\n14. *Gazella Bennetti.*\u2014This graceful little animal, commonly known as the chikara or ravine deer, is to be found on all the rocky hilly ground in most parts of the three States. They usually roam about in twos and threes, but in some places are to be found in distinct herds; their horns seldom exceed 12 inches, though in this species both sexes are provided with horns.\n\n15. *Antelopa Bezoartica.*\u2014The common Indian antelope or \"black buck\" is to be found in large herds all over the three States, where plains and cultivated land exist. They are handsome animals and in places afford good sport. The horns, as far as I know, do not run to any very great length in these parts, though I have myself once shot an animal with horns of 26 inches in length. Most of the \"roonds\" in the Bharatpur State contain large numbers of them.\n\n16. *Portax Pictus.*\u2014This animal generally known as the nilgai or \"blue bull\" is to be found in the thick jungles\nin all three States and along the River Chambal and neighbourhood. In the plains they afford no real sport, but are shot down as they are so destructive to crops, but in forest and thick jungle this animal is often as shy as possible, and requires a good deal of stalking to get within shot of.\n\nThe sambhur (*Rusa Aristotelis*) and spotted deer (*Axis Maculatus*) are both very rare in these States; a few, however, may be found in the jungles on the hilly ground bordering on the banks of the Chambal River, on the southern limits of the States of Dholpur and Karauli, there being none so far north as Bharatpur territory, except near Bareta.\n\nWith the above description ends an account of the Fauna. I shall now give a brief description of the Avifauna, but confine my description to the more important game-birds found in these States, among which the following are the most important:\n\n17. *Eupodotis Edwardsi.*\u2014The Indian bustard is said to have been seen here, but I have not myself ever seen or shot one in these parts; it is possible that it would occur more frequently in the States of Dholpur and Karauli than in Bharatpur, as there is country more suitable for them in those States.\n\n18. *Syphoetides Auritus.*\u2014The lesser florikin is occasionally to be found in these States, but is not abundant by any means; it is a handsome bird, and its flesh is considered a great delicacy. They are decidedly more prevalent in the rainy season.\n\nThere are many kinds of plover to be found, few or any of which are considered sport, and I need not enter more into detail about them here, except to mention two varieties which are very common, viz., *Cursorius Coromans Delicus*, or courier plover, the *Oedicnemus Crepitans* or stone plover, with, in the winter months, the *Charadrius Fulvus*, or golden plover, the two latter being very delicate for the table.\n\nThere are three varieties of sand grouse which are to be found in these States, one the *Pterocles Exustus* or common variety on every open sandy plain existing, another *Pterocles Alchata* or pin-tailed variety, also to be found on similar ground, and a third variety the *Pterocles Fasciatus*, a somewhat smaller bird found inhabiting dry ground on low rocky hilly country, which makes a curious noise when startled, and could in the dark be easily mistaken for the\ncommon night jar, a species of goat sucker. All the above varieties of sand grouse afford excellent sport and good eating for the table. The large or Imperial variety of this species is not to be found in these parts.\n\nAmongst the genus *Crocopus* we have one variety prevalent in most parts, viz., the *Crocopus Phoenicopterus* or \"green pigeon.\" This bird is to be found in great numbers in most parts, especially where pipal trees are to be seen, whose fruit, especially in the spring, they eagerly devour; they are excellent shooting, and often display their presence by a very sweet whistle while feeding, and are usually to be found in pipal trees.\n\n19. *Columba Lintermedia.*\u2014This bird, commonly known as the \"blue rock,\" is to be found almost everywhere in these States, and in particularly large numbers frequenting the forts situated near the large towns of these States; in some places there is provision for them to be fed by the State, and there they are, of course never shot, and are held as semi-sacred. Of the class *Tetraonidae* we have in these States three representatives, viz., *Francolinus Vulgaris*, the *Francolinus Pictus*, and the *Ortygornis Gronticeriana*. The variety known usually as the \"black partridge\" is fairly common in most parts of Bharatpur and Dholpur, but not in Karauli; it usually frequents thick grass, and is found, in consequence, during the rains everywhere, but on their drying up it disappears, but will be found if searched for about all the various bunds throughout the State in the grass there and also in the \"roonds.\" It is a very handsome bird, and affords excellent sport.\n\n20. *Francolinus Pictus.*\u2014This variety known as the \"painted partridge\" is occasionally to be found in these parts, and usually in the same kind of ground as the black variety. I have often shot them together in covies in the same ground.\n\n21. *Ortygornis Ponticeriana* (commonly known as the \"grey partridge\").\u2014This variety is prevalent everywhere, and around almost every village it will be found in the adjacent fields, where I fear it does not hesitate to devour offal of all kinds; it is for this reason, I fear, by large numbers of sportsmen not shot or considered sport. Of the family *Coturnicinae*, or quail order there are only three varieties in these parts which call for notice and\nare *Coturnix Communis* or common or large grey quail, *Coturnix Coromandelica* or black-breasted rain-quail, and the *Coturnix Joudera* or \"button\" variety, all of which are common at certain seasons of the year, and to be found in the grass \"roonds\" or in the crops when these latter are standing. They all afford excellent sport, and are delicate for the table.\n\nThe above complete the description of land game birds. I will now briefly detail the water birds most common in these States, which consist of *Koolan*, geese, wild-fowl, including duck of different kinds, snipe, curlew and coot.\n\n*Koolan* and wild-geese are to be found in great flocks about the States, during the cold weather frequenting tanks and jheels, the latter having two common varieties, *viz.*; *Anser Cinereus* or grey variety, and *Anser Indicus* or \"bar headed\" variety, both of which are fairly numerous and associate freely together. Amongst the wild-fowl we have a variety of ducks, of which the following are the most commonly met with, *viz.*, mallard (*Anas Boscas*), gadwall (*Chaulelasmus Streperus*), the spotted billed duck (*Anas Paecilorrhyncha*), pin-tail duck (*Dafila Acuta*) widgeon (*Mareca Penelope*), common teal (*Querquedula Crecca*), garganey teal (*Querquendela Circia*), shovellar duck (*Spalula Clypeata*). Whistling teal (*Dendrocygna Javanica*), brahminy duck (*Casarca Rutia*), cotton teal (*Neltapus Doromandelienus*), pochard (*Fuligula Ferina*). There are other varieties of duck and teal occasionally met with, but have not been included in this list, not being common.\n\nOf the water hen class there are many varieties, into which I need not enter here, as they are not usually included in, strictly speaking, game bird category. The only other bird worth mentioning here is the *Numenius Arquatus* or what is more commonly known as the common curlew, whose presence is usually betrayed by the curious plaintive cry of the bird while flying, and heard so often over jheels towards evening time in the cold weather months. All the above water birds are to be found in the same kind of place\u2014tanks, jheels; in fact any portion of water around whose banks there is slimy mud and in which there is plenty of weed, &c.\n\nThe only remaining game water-bird of importance is the snipe, of which there are to be found in these States,\nthree varieties, viz., *Gallinago Scolopacina* or the common snipe, *Gallinago Gallinula* or usually known as the \"Jack\" snipe or jud-cock, and *Rhyncha Capensis* or \"painted snipe.\" The first-named affords the best sport, as its flight is swift and it often requires careful shooting to bring the bird down; the two latter are sluggish flyers and do not afford good sport as a rule, except on a windy day; all three varieties select the same kind of ground, viz., a little water with fair amount of cover and a fair proportion of slimy mud redolent with animalcul\u00e6 and micro-organism of all kinds. There are few good spots in these States which are frequented by these birds. I regret to say, occasionally, however, they are to be found in the fields near bunds or other irrigated lands especially when the cold is severe.\n\nI have, in the above description, only included game birds found in these regions as being, perhaps, more of interest to the general reader than others, of which there are plenty, and which it would be outside the scope of this work to detail here.\nNature and extent of the duties performed by the Agency Surgeon of the Eastern Rajputana States, comprising the Native States of Bharatpur, Dholpur and Karauli.\n\nThe nature of the duties performed by the Agency Surgeon in these States is very extensive, in that besides actual medical and professional work at his head-quarters (Bharatpur) there are many other duties connected with those of a Medical Officer which are, owing to the absolute want hitherto of any proper supervision and organization in these States, performed actually or superintended by the Agency Surgeon himself, a brief detail of which is here given.\n\nAt his head-quarters at Bharatpur he has the immediate performance of surgical operations as well as supervision and superintendence of the Victoria Hospital, with beds for about 72 in-patients, attached to which is the Female Hospital (zenana), and including a laboratory where water and other analysis are made. At a distance of 3\u00bd miles away are the two Imperial Service Regiments, one a Transport Corps situated at Mandholi, the other a regiment of Infantry located at Khanjoli, the latter also about three miles distant. In addition to these there is the Central Prison situated at Sewar, of which hitherto he has had executive as well as medical charge; this he has held since the reorganization of the Jail Department, and institution of the new District Jail at Dig.\n\nBesides the above he has had, till recently, the superintendence and chairmanship of a Municipal Board with a Sanitary Committee, which is carried on under his direct orders. Lastly, he has charge of plague preventive operations within Municipal limits as well as all over the State, and is in medical charge of the young Chief, yet a minor, for which duty a special monthly allowance is granted by the Durbar.\n\nIn addition to the above duties at head-quarters he has the general superintendence over and administration of the Medical department at the head-quarters, as well as of all mofussil dispensaries in the three States of Bharatpur, Dholpur and Karauli, the latter numbering 26 in all, as\nwell as the prisons at the capitals of Dholpur and Karauli, and a Central and District Jail at Bharatpur and Dig respectively, in Bharatpur territory. Finally, he has the general superintendence of Sanitation and Vaccination operations over these three States, comprising 4,388 square miles of territory (over the greater portion of which he has to travel during his cold weather tour), with a population of over one million souls.\nMEDICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE.\n\nAs far as can be ascertained no proper annual reports appear to have been ever made or submitted till the year 1866. Fictitious returns appear to have been submitted by native doctors in the department, which, of course, are worthless. In the annexed list showing the Medical Officers who have held charge, it would appear that Dr. Harvey seems to have been the first Agency Surgeon of the Eastern Rajputana States comprising Bharatpur, Karauli and Dholpur, an appointment created in the year 1869, though he appears previously to have been in medical charge of both the Alwar and Bharatpur States up to that time since 1866; in the year 1869, however, Alwar was created an independent Medical charge.\n\nDholpur was also made an independent political charge in 1873, but the medical institutions of that State continued to remain under the charge of the Agency Surgeon of the Eastern Rajputana States. Hakims and Baids appear to have been universally employed in the medical department of this Agency till recent years, and since the absence of an European Medical Officer in charge, grave abuses have crept in, into which I need not enter here. Most of these officials have been gradually now got rid of and pensioned off in accordance with orders received from the Local Government (vide Foreign Department letter No. 714, dated 25th February 1894.) To show the state of the department as late as 1894, the then State Surgeon in his Annual Report remarks about the degraded condition of the chief hospital in the State, \"that charoqhs are used in the hospital instead of lamps, clothing not provided for patients, and sufficient food is not distributed. Instruments in unserviceable condition.\" This state of affairs appears to have ensued in the time of Babu Bhola Nath Dass in the reign of the Maharajah Jaswant Singh, who certainly appeared to take little interest in anything in his State except its army!\n\nDr. R. K. Tandan, M.B., was appointed State Surgeon in 1894, but owing to an unfortunate occurrence with regard to his administration of the Jail here, his services were dispensed with in 1896 by order of Government. The state of the Maharajah's health in 1896 (Maharajah Ram\nSingh, afterwards deposed by order of Government in 1900) necessitated his being placed under medical surveillance, and he left his State under charge of a Medical Officer, (Captain H. E. Drake-Brockman, I.M.S., then Civil Surgeon of Muttra), living in the hills at intervals for some years till his recovery. During this interval, there being no Medical Officer in the State, the Government of India requested the Officer on special duty (Captain H. E. Drake-Brockman, I.M.S.) to utilize his spare time and commence the re-organization of all the institutions pertaining to the work of a Medical Officer. About that time a Dewan was appointed to take over the administration of the State, and during his tenure of office, the Jail and Medical departments were thoroughly re-organized by the above Medical Officer and rescued from the state of chaos into which they had slowly drifted, showing a state of things reflecting great discredit on the State. Beside complete re-organization of these departments, a Sanitary Board was started in 1895, which was taken over by the same officer and thoroughly reconstituted, and has continued to do good work ever since.\n\nThe condition of the several departments reported on by the Medical Officer on special duty with H. H. the Maharajah at the time, showed such a discreditable state of affairs that the question of resuscitating the appointment of an Agency Surgeon for the States in the Agency, came up for consideration seriously again, which, after considerable delay on the part of the different States, was at last settled, through the energy of the then Political Agent, Lt.-Colonel Herbert, and submitted for the orders of the Government of India and Secretary of State, to which formal sanction was received in the spring of 1899; and the appointment of a whole-time Agency Surgeon became an established fact on April 1st 1899, Captain (now Major) H. E Drake-Brockman, I.M.S., being appointed to the charge. His health, however, at the time broke down, and he was obliged to take furlough on medical certificate at once, and proceed to Europe. During his absence Captain V. G. Drake-Brockman, I.M.S., officiated, followed by Lt.-Col. Harington, I.M.S., for two months on the former's departure on Field Service and the return of Major H. E. Drake-Brockman at the beginning of November 1900, the present Agency Surgeon of the Eastern Rajputana States.\n| No. | Name of Medical Officer | In what Capacity | Period from | Period to | Remarks |\n|-----|------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|---------|\n| 1   | Dr. Mathias Babu Bhola Nath Das | Not known | Not known | 1854 | Karnali Bharatpur |\n| 2   | Assistant Surgeon Steward, I.M.S. | Assistant Surgeon | 1860 | 1860 | Appointed to take charge of the Anah Hospital when built.

Harvey, C.B., D.S.O., I.M.S., formerly Director-General of I.M.S.\n\n\u2020 Now L. D. Spencer, C.B., I.M.S., late Surgeon-General of the Punjab Army Corps.\nHISTORY OF THE MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE.\n\nThe available records of the Medical department of this State are exceedingly few, and those that exist are so meagre that little or no information is obtainable from them; the task therefore of giving a fair and correct description of the origin of the several Medical Institutions of this State is not an easy one, and has involved a vast amount of careful and personal enquiry, with, at times, inspection in order to verify data. I will endeavour, however, to take the several institutions and describe them in the order in which they appear to have originated.\n\nIt seems that about the year 1849 Maharajah Balwant Singh was in Agra on a visit; the Civil Surgeon (whose name cannot be traced) showed His Highness over the dispensary there, and talked about the benefits such an institution conferred upon the people. His Highness thereupon decided that he would have an hospital at Bharatpur. Immediately after his return a dispensary was opened in the city of Bharatpur, over which two Hakims and Baisds were placed in charge. A large number of patients seemed to have frequented this institution. Thus it would appear that the City Dispensary was the first Medical Institution to be made in the State, and was formally opened by Maharajah Bulwant Singh in the year 1849.\n\nThough several mofussil dispensaries were opened in the State during this interval, nothing more was done at Bharatpur in this respect until the year 1855, when, during the minority of the late Maharajah Juswant Singh, Colonel Morrison, the Political Agent at the time, applied to Government for the services of an Assistant Surgeon, upon which Assistant Surgeon Bhola Nath Dass was transferred to the State for duty, and in the same year the Anah Hospital (so named after its being situated near to the village of that name, half way between the city and Sewar) was built by the Durbar near Sewar and the old Residency. Arrangements were then made according to requirements for the treatment, and accommodation of the sick therein. In the year 1873 female wards were also opened in connection with this hospital. The Anah Hospital continued in existence till 1897, but never adequately administered to\nthe wants of the sick and suffering poor of the city, owing to various causes, chief amongst which were, firstly, its unfortunate and unsuitable location, and secondly, on account of the entire absence of efficient European skill and supervision. The above causes affected its popularity so seriously that for many years little or really no serious surgical or medical work appears to have been done in this institution, so much so, that it was considered at last imperative to construct a hospital on a more suitable site. With this object in view, in the year 1895, a site at Charbagh was eventually selected by the A. M. O. in Rajputana, and a building on modern lines suited to the treatment and accommodation of the sick was commenced, which now goes by the name of the Victoria Hospital; it was ultimately completed for occupation in the year 1900. A detailed description of this institution will be given later on. A small hospital in connection with the Jail at Sewar (now the Central Prison, Bharatpur) was opened in the year 1856 and placed under the charge of Assistant Surgeon Bhola Nath Dass.\n\nA small out-door dispensary called the Agency Dispensary appears also to have been maintained at the Agency Surgeon's bungalow till the abolition of the latter appointment in 1879, and the departure of Surgeon Spencer, I.M.S.; this has never been re-opened.\n\nDig.\u2014In the year 1856 a dispensary was opened at this place by Colonel Morrison, the Political Agent. This dispensary has been much enlarged and improved, and has been provided with accommodation for 12 beds, with a small operation room, the latter being necessary, as I am able to do a large amount of surgical work here at my inspection visits.\n\nGopalgarh.\u2014In the early part of the year 1860 in the time of Major Bouverie, when Assistant Surgeon Bhola Nath Dass was also made tutor to His Highness the young Maharajah, and Dr. Stewart held the appointment of Agency Surgeon, a dispensary was opened at Gopalgarh. In the middle of the year 1861, Dr. Stewart died, and Assistant Surgeon Bhola Nath Dass held temporary charge for a few months till Dr. Mott's arrival as Agency Surgeon. This dispensary was, however, transferred to Nagar in 1899, when the Tehsil was removed to the latter place on completion of the new Settlement.\nBiana and Rupbas.\u2014In the year 1861 dispensaries were opened in both these towns in the time of Major Walter, as Political Agent and Dr. Mott, as Agency Surgeon.\n\nKamah.\u2014A dispensary was opened here in the year 1862, during the tenure of office of Major Walter and Dr. Mott.\n\nAkheygarh.\u2014In the year 1866 a dispensary was opened here, in the time of Major Walter as Political Agent, and at a time when Assistant Surgeon Bholanath Dass was temporarily in medical charge.\n\nOochain.\u2014In the year 1867 a dispensary was opened here, during the tenure of office of Major Walter as Political Agent and Dr. Harvey, as Agency Surgeon.\n\nBhusawar.\u2014In the year 1880 a dispensary was opened by the Durbar in this town, there being no Agency Surgeon at the time, the appointment having been done away with.\n\nKumher.\u2014A dispensary was started in this town in the year 1894, in the time of Dr. R. K. Tandan, the State Surgeon at that time, and when Col. Martelli was Political Officer here.\n\nBharatpur Female Hospital.\u2014On the 7th October 1894 this hospital was opened by H. H. the Maji Sahiba (grandmother of the present Chief) and named after herself, which, until its affiliation to the Victoria Hospital used to be known as the Maji Sahiba Darya Kuars Female Hospital. It is connected with the Dufferin Association, and has a competent Female Hospital Assistant in charge. Its chief work is amongst the pardahnashin women of the city, and affords extensive medical relief to a class of patients which cannot be got at by the ordinary out-patient department of a general hospital. This hospital was first located in a large building in the very heart of the city, with a separate establishment, &c. In the year 1899, however, on completion of the Victoria Hospital, appropriate quarters were allotted to it in connection with the above institution, to which for administrative reasons it was transferred, and where it now continues to work on the same lines. A class for instruction of dhais (native midwives) in elementary obstetrics has recently been started under my direc-\nSITE PLAN\nOF THE\nVICTORIA HOSPITAL & GROUNDS\nBHARATPUR\nSCALE 120 FT 1 INCH\n\nREFERENCES\n1 Main Administrative Block\n2,2 Wards for Male Patients\n(12 beds in each)\n3 Cottage Hospital containing\n5 Cubicles 12 beds in each\n4 Eye Ward containing\n5 Cubicles 2 beds in each\n5 The Charbagh Kothi\nLower storey ward for female patients 12 beds\nUpper storey female hospital Assistants' Qrs.\n6 Store\n7 Hospital Kitchen\n8,8 Wards for Noxious cases\n9 Assistant Surgeon's Quarters\n10 Hospital Assistant's Quarters\n11 Stables\n12 Latrines (Temporary)\n13 Sweeper's Huts\n14 Female Hospital Followers Qrs.\n15 Plant House\nTurfed Lawns\n222 Plantations\nO Wells\n\nExe.

This was carried out during the tenure of appointment of Captain H. E. Drake-Brockman, I.M.S.\n\nP. W. D. Dispensaries.\u2014Three small dispensaries in this State were started in connection with extensive Engineering works which were being carried on by the P. W. D. of the State, at Bareta, Sikri and Paharpur, at the two former of which large irrigation projects are in existence, which necessitate the maintenance of a large establishment for their upkeep. At the latter place a large number of quarries are to be found, at which there are large numbers of men employed by the P. W. D. to cope with the large traffic in stone which is carried on by the State, and from which it enjoys a fair amount of profit, as there is a royalty on this product, which all goes into the State coffers.\n\nThough only subsidiary dispensaries and in charge of a first grade Compounder, subservient to the nearest Medical subordinate on whom they call for assistance in case of need, these little institutions have been the means of affording an immense amount of relief, not only to the subordinates, &c., employed by the P. W. D., but to all the villagers around, and are greatly appreciated.\n\nThe dispensaries at Bareta and Sikri were opened in 1897, and that at Paharpur in 1901, all in the tenure of office of Major H. E. Drake-Brockman, I.M.S., as Agency Surgeon. The cost of their maintenance has been hitherto altogether borne by the P. W. D. of the State.\n\nNadbai.\u2014As soon as arrangements can be made for the location of a dispensary at this place, and on transfer of the Tehsil from Akheygarh, the dispensary at present at Akheygarh will also be removed here. It is contemplated to erect a completely new building for a dispensary here, the site for which I have already selected.\n\nVictoria Hospital.\u2014This hospital stands in a more or less picturesque position along the banks of the Fort Moat, in the city of Bharatpur, in extensive grounds and a well laid-\nout garden, intersected by public roads communicating with the main thoroughfares in the city by many gates. The grounds are, as opportunity affords, gradually being extended, and form a recreation ground for the city residents, besides being a natural lung in the centre of the city, which can now never be built over\u2014a fact of much importance from a sanitary point of view\u2014as it has done away with a large number of over-crowded, ill-ventilated and extremely insanitary busties, which formerly existed there to the detriment of the public health. The close proximity of the hospital buildings to the mass of water contained in the Moat may at first sight be considered to be prejudicial on account of damp, &c. This, however, has been allowed for, and any such completely mitigated by the insertion of a \"damp course\" into every foundation wall in the several buildings with most gratifying results.\n\nThe buildings themselves are of exceedingly handsome design, constructed of stone of different qualities obtained from quarries in the State, the plans being made originally by Colonel Sir Swinton Jacob of Jaipur. There is a central block entirely utilized and constructed for administrative purposes, possessing, besides a male and female dispensary with attached dressers' rooms, offices and laboratory for the Agency Surgeon, consulting and waiting rooms, a medical store, operation room with sterilizing and instrument rooms attached, with a lavatory; also an X-ray laboratory with all the necessary appliances and the apparatus for working the Finsen-light treatment, and a dark room for eye, throat and nose examinations, &c.\n\nUnderneath this building is an extensive system of godowns, practically damp-proof, and which provides useful storage room for perishable articles; there is also a soda water factory situated in them and an ice room. The equipment of this block, though necessarily a slow process for financial reasons, has been a labour of love to me, and carried on over a period of some years, till now it can boast of being practically up-to-date, in being possessed of all the most necessary and modern appliances for the treatment of suffering humanity on the latest European principles, and has in consequence been productive of relieving much suffering, patients coming from long distances to avail themselves of X-ray and Finsen-light treatment, for which a complete installation\nexists, and which has afforded me personally, not only great pleasure, but many pleasant hours to think out, have constructed, and finally to fix up. Judging by the number of distinguished visitors, both professional and non-professional who have from time to time visited this institution, its fame has spread far, and brought great keudos to the State, and though it has been a great undertaking, watching and looking after its progress from the first foundation onwards, the results, however, have quite repaid me.\n\nThe operating room in this building is situated on the north side, is replete with almost every modern device to render European surgery successful and minimise pain and suffering to the sick, is supplied with water, hot and cold, with irrigators capable of use at any moment in any position, with sterilizers for instruments, also electric light and all the usual glass and metal aseptic furniture usually found in European operating theatres, but at the same time nothing extravagant or unnecessary. The X-ray laboratory contains all the necessary switch-boards for working not only Roentgen rays, but also the Finsen light, as well as galvanocauteries, surgical lights, motors, seismotherapy, &c., with a continuous current direct from a small shuntwound dynamo which I have fixed up, and which latter is worked in connection with a steam engine utilized by the P. W. D. for pumping water into the public gardens some distance away, so that all such work carried on in the hospital is without any additional expense to the State! In the consulting room also exists a switch-board for utilizing the current for galvanism, faradism, electrolysis, &c., which is a most useful and inexpensive apparatus for the application of electrotherapeutics generally. There also exist in the grounds close by four handsome stone buildings of similar pattern, in the way of general, medical and surgical male wards, a block of eye wards, and a cottage hospital block. Besides these, there are two cool, airy thatched semi-pukka general wards and a zenana hospital in its separate compound together with buildings for the Medical staff, and a small meteorological observatory in an enclosure, which is kept up by the Imperial Government. This hospital has from time to time been inspected by many distinguished visitors, amongst whom have been H. E. Lord Curzon and Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cannought in 1903.\nMEDICAL AND SURGICAL WORK IN THE EASTERN RAJPUTANA STATES.\n\nOwing to the absence, till recently, of any European skill or supervision, the amount and quality of surgical work done in these States for many years has been practically of no importance, and, especially as regards Bharatpur, where the superintendence of its medical institutions has been left practically to the tender mercies of inferiorly-qualified medical subordinates, chiefly of the quack class, it is no matter for surprise. The few records that remain show that during the incumbency of Assistant Surgeon Bhola Nath Dass (who seems to have diverted his attention to everything else but medical work, as he appears to have been tutor to the late Maharajah Jaswant Singh for many years, holding medical charge as well) little or no surgical work was done, or in fact medical work of any kind, so much so that the whole department fell into disrepute amongst the people, and European medical treatment was carried out only in name, for as a matter of fact, dispensaries seem to have been in charge of baidas and hakims. On the death of the above-named official, Mr. R. K. Tandan, M.B., was appointed State Surgeon at Bharatpur, and he tried to do something in the way of reviving medical work, and appears to have performed a few surgical operations with success. He, however, was not encouraged in the work, and appears to have had great disadvantages to contend with in the way of surgical appliances, &c., and it was not until the appointment of an Agency Surgeon was revived in these States, that any appreciable change in this respect was apparent. During the long period of inaction which resulted from the above causes, the faith of the people in the State Medical Department naturally lapsed, and they resorted to places over the border in British territory\u2014Muttra, Agra, &c.\u2014for surgical relief, as I know from having been myself Civil Surgeon of Muttra, where I used to have large numbers of patients from this State come for relief. Since the erection of the Victoria Hospital and re-organization of the Medical Department of this State, matters have looked much brighter, and the people are slowly beginning to realize the benefits of European skill, both medical and surgical, which they have been denied for so many years,\nand though it will be uphill work trying to re-popularize, in fact re-introduce it amongst the people of this State, I have no doubt that in a very short time a very marked improvement, in this hitherto much-neglected department, will ensue.\n\nBy reason of extended tours in the cold weather by the Agency Surgeon through the district in the States of this Agency (in fact already at my visits to the other States), I have had the opportunity of performing surgical operations at the places I visit. The numbers attending on these occasions I have no doubt will materially increase as the visits of the Agency Surgeon become known. The chief blame for the state of things existing lay with the medical subordinates of the State, who had hitherto displayed an utter want of interest in their work. Most of them, when I began the task of re-organization, were unqualified and often quacks, so that they usually dispensed treatment with native drugs, and were utterly ignorant of anything European, so much so that the latter methods of treatment were practically little utilized, and as a natural consequence fell into disrepute. All these unqualified men have now been replaced by well-trained men from Medical Schools, the best of whom have been taken on to the Government list, and a great improvement in the out-patient attendance is already apparent, which, as time goes on, must tend to popularize European treatment.\n\nBharatpur unfortunately is placed directly between and close to three very old-established centres of European medical relief, e.g., Muttra to the north, Agra to the east, and Jaipur to the west, so that competition is great, otherwise I feel sure more surgical work would become available at once here; owing, however, to the bad climate of the place the population is more or less stationary and in fact decreasing, which rather militates against this.\n\nFrom available records it would appear that surgical operations have been from time to time performed as per list detailed below:\n\n| Operations on the Eye and its appendages, &c. |\n|---------------------------------------------|\n| \" \" Ear.                                   |\n| \" \" Nose.                                  |\n| \" \" Head and Face (including mouth).        |\n| \" \" Arteries, Veins, &c.                   |\n| \" \" Digestive Organs.                      |\nOperation for Hernia.\n\n\" on the Urinary Organs (including those done for stone).\n\" \" Male Generative Organs (including Hydrocele).\n\" \" Female Generative Organs (including Obstetric Operations).\n\" \" Bones and joints.\n\" \" Limbs (including Amputations).\n\" \" large Abscesses.\n\" \" for removal of Tumours.\n\nSmall-pox.\u2014Reliable statistics are available only for the last eight years, ranging from 1892 to 1899, from which it appears that small-pox has been more or less prevalent in the city of Bharatpur every year till the year 1896, up to which date it seems that 501 deaths had occurred, the largest number occurring in the years 1894 and 1896, being respectively 137 and 185. In the year 1897, the year in which the re-organization of the Vaccination Department of the State was undertaken by Captain (now Major) H. E. Drake-Brockman, the officer on special duty in this State with H. H. the Maharajah, it will be noticed that few, if any, cases were reported. This prominent fact must be directly attributable to the above re-organization of the department, as it was followed the next year (1898) by a still smaller mortality, which has remained more or less at a low figure ever since. It was ascertained, moreover, that the cases which were reported on these occasions occurred in non-vaccinated children, most of whom had been imported from other places, in order, evidently, to evade vaccination. The registration of the occurrence of all epidemic disease is very well carried out in the city of Bharatpur, in that, there is a very efficient system of notification of diseases in vogue under the immediate control of the Sanitary Board at that place. Each occurrence of such is at once verified by a Medical subordinate especially detailed for the purpose, so that within an hour of such occurrence, notice of it is brought to not only the Assistant Health Officer, but also to the President of the Sanitary Board. There is no doubt that this early notification of occurrence of infectious disease is a very important sanitary precaution in the interests of the public health, especially in crowded areas, and one which should prevail in every Municipality or body which controls measures for the maintenance of the public health in any way. I have very good reason to believe\nthat not only as regards outbreaks of small-pox but also of cholera, this city has on different occasions been spared the calamity of an epidemic of either by the early notification and consequent isolation and treatment of such cases occurring, thereby allowing of early tracing out of the causes, &c., which have led to the outbreak, and enabling sanitary precautions to be taken at once for the efficient prevention and spread of disease.\n\nCholera.\u2014In the year 1892, a very severe epidemic of this disease showed itself in the city of Bharatpur, lasting over the months of April, May and June ending, as is often the case, with the advent of the monsoon; this appears to have been part and parcel of a general epidemic of the same disease which raged throughout the State during the greater part of that year, as will be seen from the table appended, amounting in a total mortality for that year of 1,599. The greatest number of deaths seem to have occurred during the months of April, May and June, being coincident with the period at which the greatest mortality occurred in the city of Bharatpur. Again in the year 1897 the city seems to have been visited by a severe epidemic of the same disease, resulting in 157 deaths; in the same year cholera in epidemic form prevailed throughout the State, commencing in April and lasting on till November, spreading over a period of seven months and resulting in a total recorded mortality of 340. The years 1898 and 1899 seem to have been remarkable by the absence of a single case, to which I cannot help attributing as an explanation the exertions of the Sanitary Board which was instituted the year before, and by whose energy great strides were made in the sanitation of the city in the way of safeguarding the water supply and in many other ways, aided by constant analysis of the water used for drinking purposes, and disinfection of wells when necessary. As regards the city of Bharatpur, where the water supply is obtained from wells, great advantage has resulted by having all the wells with the most potable water covered in with platforms and supplying them with pumps, which prevents that most insanitary and objectionable practice of lowering private utensils into and fouling the water of wells, a custom which I fear, has a great deal to do with the spread of Cholera in this country. I think a great deal of good has resulted\nin this respect by teaching the people the evil results of such proceedings on their part, by the circulation of sanitary pamphlets on the question, which I have written expressly for the benefit of the rural population of this State. The little book has been translated into both Hindi and Urdu, and a copy circulated to the Lumberdar of each village throughout the State.\n\nIt will be noted that the advent of cholera into this State has been, as is the case usually elsewhere, synchronous with that of the hot weather, and its prevalence is compatible with the presence of the greatest atmospheric heat, which occurs usually from April to July, in which months about 80 per cent. of the total mortality from this disease usually has occurred, the cold weather months being noticeable for their almost entire freedom from it.\n\nThis disease, being in almost every case usually traceable to the pollution of food or drink supply, is a distinctly preventable one, and one which is and can be made directly subservient to sanitary measures, if properly applied, to its ultimate abolition from our midst; we may then look forward with confidence at some future date, when by the aid of education the people may come to see, that \"cleanliness is next to godliness,\" and carry out its precepts to the letter in their everyday life; until, however, the powerful civilizing factor of education (by whose aid only the elements of sanitation can be diffused amongst the people) is more generally introduced and brought within the reach of the rural population, I fear we can expect very little initiative in this matter to be shown on the part of the bulk of the population, who in some parts at any rate look upon any sanitary measures as the grossest interference with their caste and religious prejudices, and accordingly offer resistance to such, both in a passive as well as, unfortunately, sometimes in an active manner!\n\nAltogether during the eight years under review, the mortality from Cholera amounted to 701 deaths in the city of Bharatpur, and that for the whole State 2,265.\n\nMalaria.\u2014The mortality from fevers of malarial origin is and has been very high in this State, more especially so in the city of Bharatpur, which latter, from its unfortunate situation from a sanitary point of view, in great measure accounts for such, in that it is situated\nin lowlying ground, to which gravitate all the flood waters of the river Banganga, which till quite lately were allowed to come in large volume and inundate the surrounding country for miles about Bharatpur. The site for the city was doubtless selected originally for strategic reasons, in order to collect water to fill the Fort Moat as well as the earthworks' ditch around the city. This causes waterlogging of the soil to such an extent as to render any drainage for its remedy almost useless; still, as regards surface drainage, a great deal has been accomplished, resulting in marked benefit to the public health, and, by the gradual filling up of low-lying and otherwise insanitary sites (thereby doing away with facilities for the breeding of Culicidae,) has resulted in a diminution of malaria. Owing, however, to local circumstances, I fear little more can be done without actually removing the city to a healthier and more sanitary site, which of course is impossible. In the year 1900, after the famine, which was followed by an unusually heavy rainfall, there was a marked increase of malarial fevers all over the province, resulting in an appalling mortality never equalled, which has decimated the population. The severity of the type of fever, no doubt aided materially by the devitalizing effects of the previous scarcity, accounted for the havoc that followed in the autumn months of that year, regarding which a special report was prepared and submitted by the Agency Surgeon for the information of the Local Government, though this State, as a matter of fact, suffered least of any almost in Rajputana, doubtless owing to the fact that scarcity and famine were not so evident as in the other parts of Rajputana. The extent of the ravages committed by this scourge on the population of the city of Bharatpur almost yearly during the autumn months may be gauged on reference to the appended table, which gives the total number of deaths from this disease alone for the last eight years to be 7,749; this number forms about 40 per cent. of the total mortality from all causes, and by no means indicates the enormous amount of suffering which it entails, the number of seizures far eclipsing that percentage; in fact I have known in my own experience that few, if any, inhabitants escape attacks of fever of this origin during this period, which must inevitably have a most deteriorating effect on the public health of this place and its residents. The fever\nprevalent here during these months is of a very virulent type sometimes, associated with rapid and early engorgement of the lungs and usually resulting in speedy death. To give some idea of the suffering entailed, the returns of the dispensaries in the city for the years 1900 and 1902 show the total number of patients treated under this head to be respectively 4,562 and 9,182 for the autumn months, making about 33 and 58 per cent. of the total number of the patients treated for all diseases during this period. The total number of patients treated under this head in the whole State for similar periods in 1900 and 1902 respectively, amounted to the large number of 4,220 and 22,969. Further remarks regarding the measures which have been adopted in order to cope with this scourge in the light of recent science will be found under the section Sanitation. I have, however, appended tables hereto showing the above facts, which will also serve to illustrate the havoc played by this scourge, malaria, upon not only the population of the city of Bharatpur, where it is most marked, but generally upon that of the whole State.

After this a few cases were operated upon yearly, but no systematic attempts to introduce vaccination into this State appear to have been made till the year 1861.\n\nPrevious to this period two or three vaccinators came from time to time to perform operations, but they were not under the control of the Agency Surgeon. Attempts to introduce the practice into this State seem to have been made by Dr. Stewart, but it was not till the year 1861, when Dr. Mott was Agency Surgeon, that any serious effort was made in this direction, and one may say that the real introduction of vaccination into the State dates from that time.\n\nDuring the cold season of 1861, Dr. Mott applied for and obtained the services of two vaccinators from Dr. Christison (the then Superintendent of Vaccination of the Agra Division). These men worked under Dr. Mott's direction, but their work was also supervised by Dr. Christison, who himself visited the district for this purpose, and the results of their labours are reported as \"very successful\" by that officer, to whom all their returns appear to have been sent in, and by whom they were included in the returns for his own district. During that season 2,780 cases were operated upon, of which 1,765 were reported as \"successful,\" showing a percentage of 63\u00b749. During the next season a system of working through native doctors was initiated, the net results of which period, as shown by records at hand, give a total of 7,907 cases, of which 6,679 are returned as \"successful,\" with a percentage of 78\u00b714. It does not appear from the records available whether cases performed by the Agra vaccinators are included in this total. For the next two seasons the same dual system appears to have prevailed, vaccinators being borrowed from the Agra Division, and their returns being included in those of the N.-W. P., leading to some confusion in the State records; for instance in the season 1863-64 the Agra returns show that 3,404 operations were performed in Bharatpur territory, 2,595 or 76\u00b723 per cent. of which seem to have\nbeen \"successful,\" while the Bharatpur returns show a total of 10,212 with 8,015 or 78.48 per cent. as successful cases! There is good reason to infer that the cases recorded by the Agra vaccinators are included in the Bharatpur returns for both the seasons referred to, as on the formation of the Agra and Meerut Vaccination Circles on November 1st 1864, all connection between the superintendents of that circle, and vaccination operations in this State appear to have ceased, as there is no further record of any such cases in subsequent reports which are available. During the season 1864-1865 vaccinations were performed by native doctors and compounders detailed for the purpose, there being no special vaccinators.\n\nOn his arrival as Agency Surgeon, Dr. Harvey (late D.I.G., I.M.S.) condemned the prevailing system of removing the scabs from the arms of the vaccinated in order to judge of the vaccinator's work (a practice which seems to have been in vogue at the time), for frequently as a direct result of this proceeding, a small portion of tender new skin was removed with them, resulting in an ulcer exposed to septic infection of all kinds.\n\nAs would be expected, vaccination operations met with great opposition on their initiation, from the people, but the benefits conferred by such have gradually become to be appreciated by them, so much so that at the present time little or no prejudice exists either among urban or rural population.\n\nThe present scale of establishment consists of one Native Superintendent on a salary of Rs. 22 with Rs. 10 as travelling allowance monthly, and the following grades of vaccinators, of whom there are fifteen:\n\n| Grade of Vaccinator | Number employed | Salary | Remarks |\n|---------------------|-----------------|--------|---------|\n| 1st Grade           | Two             | Rs. 12 |         |\n| 2nd Grade           | Three           | Rs. 10 |         |\n| 3rd Grade           | Five            | Rs. 8  |         |\n| 4th Grade           | Five            | Rs. 7  |         |\nIn addition to these, in order to enhance vaccination operations, all medical subordinates in charge of mofussil dispensaries have orders to, when opportunity affords, vaccinate children at their dispensaries, as well as to inspect vaccination operations within a radius of two miles from their respective head-quarters; this arrangement has had a good effect not only in considerably increasing actual vaccination work amongst the people, but it has had the additional advantage of preventing any harshness on the part of vaccinators, whose work is thereby more efficiently supervised, and in cases where objections have been raised against the operation they have, with tact on the part of the medical subordinate, usually speedily disappeared.\n\nA reference to the tables appended will at once show the marked increase of vaccination from every point of view, as soon as efficient supervision was exercised by a commissioned Medical Officer since the year 1896, and the rapid growth of the department and extension of its work under such regime. Since the appointment of a permanent Agency Surgeon in the State and his proceeding on tour through the State, vaccination operations have extended so rapidly that considering the staff and size of this State it has risen to the first rank in this respect amongst all the other States in Rajputana, as a reference to the report of the Administrative Medical Officer will show.\n\n**Table showing

for Guidance of Subordinates of the Vaccination Department, in the Eastern Rajputana States.\n\n1. Each Vaccinator will be provided with a printed list of villages in his ilaka, together with a map in the vernacular showing such, which he is to use and will be held responsible for. The Agency Surgeon will, while on tour, expect to find the above in possession of each subordinate, if he finds anyone of them without the above, the offender will be severely punished.\n\n2. The map is intended to serve as a guide to them in doing their work systematically, that is to say, beginning at one end of their ilaka and vaccinating children of villages there instead of as hitherto, when there has been no method prevailing in their tours, and resulting in great waste of time and hindrance to their work. The Native Superintendent of Vaccination of each State will be held responsible that each man uses and understands these maps in his possession, and in the event of transfer to another sphere of work, he will see that these lists and maps are duly handed over by Vaccinators on transfer to the relieving subordinate. Each year a report must be sent by the Native Superintendent to the effect that he has examined these maps and village lists, that they are in the possession of each Vaccinator and in good condition. This report should be sent to the Agency Surgeon's office both at the commencement of operations on October 1st as well as at their termination on April 1st, in order that others may be supplied in the event of damage or other necessity.\n\n3. The Native Superintendent will see that each Vaccinator has his registers with him at the time of inspection of any vaccinated children, during the tours of the Agency Surgeon in the cold weather, so as to have them handy if the Agency Surgeon wishes to refer to them; any disobedience of this order on the part of either Native Superintendent or Vaccinators will be severely punished.\n\n4. Each Vaccinator should provide himself with a bottle of pure carbolic from the nearest branch dispensary within his ilaka. The Native Superintendent of Vaccination will be held responsible that each man is in possession of this, as well as a clean towel during the working season; any disobedience of this order will meet with severe punishment.\nNo excuses whatever will be taken by the Agency Surgeon for disobedience and non-compliance of these orders.\n\n5. It is the duty of all vaccinators to use every endeavour to persuade sick and afflicted people in villages which they visit, to come for medical or surgical relief to the head-quarter medical institutions of the State in which they are serving, and they should not take this opportunity of extracting money or threatening village folk in any way; such action on their part will not only bud-num them, but the department in which they are serving. Any cases of such which come to the notice of the Agency Surgeon during his tours, which may be proved to be true on enquiry, will be very severely dealt with departmentally.\n\n6. A copy of the Elementary Sanitary Primer \"Hidayat-i-sehat,\" written by me for the use of village folk, should be in the possession of every Vaccinator in the three States; any not at present possessing such should apply at once for a copy of the same through their immediate Native Superintendent of Vaccination to the office of Agency Surgeon at Bharatpur.\n\nH. E. DRAKE-BROCKMAN, Major, I.M.S.,\nAgency Surgeon, Eastern Rajputana States.\n\nAppended will be found a complete list of all Towns and Villages to be found in the three States of this Agency, with short notes showing any points of interest which may be attached to any. They have been tabulated as far as possible in alphabetical order under their respective Tehsils in order to facilitate reference, and will form a most useful adjunct to Vaccination work, as each Vaccinator should be provided with a list of every village in his respective Tehsil with, if possible, a small map to aid him in his work, which in many cases I have found to be extremely handicapped and much precious time wasted by the Vaccinator owing to the utter lack of any method in his tour, mainly due to want of knowledge of the geography of his particular ilaka. In the Bharatpur State each Vaccinator is provided with a map as well as a list of villages in his ilaka, with the result that vaccination operations are most thoroughly done, and I would recommend the adoption of such a scheme wherever possible.\n## LIST OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES, BHARATPUR STATE.\n\nCompiled for the use of Subordinates of the Vaccination Department.\n\nTahsil Bharatpur or

Harvey, M.D., C.B., D.S.O., Director General of the Indian Medical Service), the Agency Surgeon at the time wrote: \"With the exception of Bharatpur itself, the sanitary condition of the large towns and of the district generally, is one which usually obtains in India, in places where hygienic measures have never been carried out. There is the usual crowding together of houses regardless of ventilation in the villages, the same collections of decaying rubbish, the same carelessness as to the purity of the water, the same mangy pariahs and faecal-eating pigs.\" With one or two marked exceptions the above remarks are, I regret to say, in most instances as true to-day as they were in 1869, especially as regards village sanitation, where, I fear, little improvement can be looked for until education has been spread amongst the rural population, and this State, I regret to note, is most backward in this respect (vide remarks under Educational Department).\n\nAs a means of diffusing elementary sanitary principles amongst the rural folk, a small Sanitary Primer (entitled \"Hidyat Sehat\") was written in 1897 by Captain H. E. Drake-Brockman, I.M.S., (the President of Sanitary Board, which had then just been constituted for the city of Bharatpur), and circulated amongst the villages throughout the State, through the agency of the officials of the Revenue, Police and Vaccination Departments, by whom the lumbardar of each village was furnished with a copy. It treated of the importance of safe-guarding the water supply of a village, vaccination of all newly-born children, and contained a simple description of the agencies by which disease is\nspread in India, and the measures necessary to prevent such, the pamphlet being written in the most simple and popular language in both Urdu and Hindi.\n\nThe staff of the Vaccination Department during their work in the cold weather months, also take the opportunity of instructing ignorant villagers regarding such matters. From personal observation, I am sure that a change in this respect is apparent, and the eyes of the people are gradually being opened as to the necessity for exertion on their part in this most important matter, and I feel sure that this is the only agency by which any appreciable change can ever be effected, and is worthy, I think, of imitation in other districts.\n\nWater Supply.\u2014The water supply of the city of Bharatpur is and has always been a source of anxiety to the P. W. D. and to the Medical Department of the State, as it solely practically depends upon the flood waters of the Banganga River, the water of which is stored up in the Ajan Bund for irrigation purposes, only so much of it as is necessary being allowed to pass through Kevlodeo, &c., into the Atal Bund for the filling of the Fort Moat, via the Kunj Behari Mori, in order to keep up the water level in the wells of the city during the hot months. As long ago as 1869 Dr. Harvey remarked regarding the water supply of Bharatpur, that it is \"chiefly from wells, and in some places from tanks; from superficial examination, I should say, that almost all the water used for drinking purposes is highly charged with various salts, chiefly common salt. The well water is generally brackish, and often so salty as to be utterly unfit for drinking.\"\n\nIn some districts of the State where the ground is free from saline impregnation the water is potable, but in the majority of places the wells all contain brackish water, even in the city of Bharatpur, where there is large suction underground of pure rain water from the Fort Moat, and the water in the wells becomes contaminated and highly charged with saline as well as organic matter in its percolation through the soil. As regards the city of Bharatpur the wells containing the sweetest water are to be found, as one would have expected, in the immediate vicinity of the Fort Moat, but even there chemical analysis shows it to be charged with,\nin some cases, such a large amount of organic matter as to render it prohibitive for drinking purposes.\n\nDuring my tenure as President of the Sanitary Board (recently constituted into a Municipality), I have had regular periodical analyses of the water of all the important wells in the city made and kept for reference in my laboratory, in the Victoria Hospital, from which it would appear that by far the purest and most potable water from a chemical standpoint is to be found in the Hospital well, in the Imperial Service Infantry lines at Khanjoli. By far the majority of the wells in the city contain water unfit for human consumption, certainly both chemically and bacteriologically far below the standard. It is so highly charged with organic matter as to render it unfit, and in some cases actual faecal and urinary contamination have been found by me, bacteriological examination revealing countless myriads of bacteria, the majority of which, though harmless in themselves, tend to show the enormous extent of organic pollution that must exist! There is no doubt that the impurity and scantiness of the water supply of the city of Bharatpur has a very direct baneful effect upon the public health, and renders the mortality high; this latter is materially enhanced by the enormous facilities for the breeding of Anopheles, in the shape of depressions and excavations in the ground which exist at every turn, in such quantities within city limits as to almost render any measures for their remedy impracticable. As regards this most important matter of the dissemination of malaria, the environs of the city have been recently extensively drained, and this has mitigated, in a great measure, this scourge; regarding this point, however, I shall have a word more to say later on. It is contemplated, provided that the funds are forthcoming, to try and arrange for a supply of pure water to the city of Bharatpur, and with that idea in view it has been suggested to bring in the water from the Bareta Bund, at a distance of 25 miles away in the Biana Tehsil, by pipes, and pass the water through filter beds, ultimately supplying the city by hydrants at suitable spots. I have made an official note regarding this most urgent need, and trust that the scheme may assume definite shape in the not distant future. An analysis of the water of some of the more important wells of the city and\nvicinity is given at the end of this section, showing the variations which occur; an accurate and complete record of all these several analysis has been kept in my laboratory at the Victoria Hospital for future reference, from which a number of useful deductions may be made, as regards the presence or absence, increase or decrease of organic matter in relation to the rise and fall of the sub-soil water, into which it is needless for me to enter into any detail here. It is hardly a matter for surprise regarding the brackish nature of the water in the wells in the State, when we consider what a very important industry, the manufacture of salt, used to be in this State in past years, till the monopoly was taken over by the British Government many years ago. The continual abstraction of water from kutcha wells dug for the purpose of withdrawing brine water from the salt-bearing strata, annually removed from the soil tons of brine which now, owing to the suspension of salt manufacture in this State, remains in the soil and contaminates the water with enormous quantity chiefly of chloride of sodium, which mainly table accounts for its brackish nature (vide analysis, page 192, et seq).\n\nThe question of the presence of the Fort Moat and its yearly filling are of vital importance to Bharatpur, in that by so doing the level of the sub-soil water is raised to such an high level within the city, and that too suddenly, as to materially affect the public health. This is borne out by the fact that diseases such as rheumatism, phthisis, &c., are unduly prevalent. The too early filling up of the Fort Moat is to be strongly deprecated on this account; it should not be done before the end of the month of October, by which time all organic silt has been deposited on the flooded lands and the supernatant water is fairly pure, and then only allowed very slowly to run off so as to prevent a quick and sudden rise of the sub-soil water. This is now carried out at my suggestion by the P. W. D.\n\nSanitary Board.\u2014In the year 1895 a Sanitary Committee was formed in Bharatpur to look after the sanitation of the city of Bharatpur, in the time of the late Dewan (Kumar Shri Harbhamji Rawaji). Its scope of work, however, was small, and owing to want of proper supervision and interest on the part of its members, not much was\ndone till I was asked to take over charge and thoroughly re-organize it; this was in the year 1897. A new Board was then constituted, upon which influential residents in the city were asked to sit as members, in order to enlist the sympathy of the local folk. The Board's work increased by leaps and bounds, and from that time it has continued to do excellent work for the public health. It has been instrumental in clearing up many insanitary sites, filling up uneven ground which afforded any chance of Anopheles breeding, protecting the water supply in the way of covering in wells whose water is fit to drink and whose supply is likely to become contaminated by the passing down of private utensils, leather buckets, &c.; to prevent this also hand-pumps have been fixed upon masonry platforms, the wells being provided, with trap-doors to allow of cleansing when necessary, and moreover these wells have been provided with circular drains communicating with some other channel by which all the sullage water may be carried off and prevent accumulations likely to provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes. This is a most important sanitary measure which should always be provided in places where there is a pipe-water supply by hydrants, a sanitary precaution which has been found to be so wanting in some of our large towns as Agra, &c., where the mortality has not shown any signs of diminishing, with reference to fevers, since the introduction of a pipe supply owing to this one defect, which doubtless provides for the sustenance and propagation of all kinds of mosquitoes throughout the year.\n\nAmongst other important measures carried out by the Sanitary Board since its constitution may be mentioned the erection of latrines at suitable spots throughout the city, the cleansing and scavenging of all the roads within Municipal limits, the erection of vegetable markets and slaughter houses at suitable sites in the city, the construction of a sanitary tramway for the removal of excreta to a distance from the city, where all such is incinerated in kilns.\n\nMunicipal Board.\u2014The Sanitary Board has recently been amalgamated into a Municipality, lately constituted by order of the Durbar, at my recommendation, and consists of a Sanitary Sub-Committee composed of six members and a President (who is a qualified medical graduate and acts in\nthe capacity of Health Officer to the city) who control and manage all matters connected with the sanitation of the city and its environs, under the general directions of this Board. The city of Bharatpur is unfortunately situated, being down in a basin more or less, its position being doubtless selected years ago on account of strategic reasons; a more unfortunate selection from a sanitary point of view, could hardly have been made, as all the flood water for miles round during the monsoon is likely to gravitate towards it. Many measures have been taken to prevent this occurring by the State P. W. D. in consultation with the Medical Department, and with the most satisfactory results from every point of view. The city can, however, never be really a healthy one for many reasons; first and foremost is the one above given, which of itself renders the soil water-logged during the greater part of the year, a fact which not only conduces to the incidence and prevalence of phthisis and respiratory diseases, rheumatism, &c., but what is perhaps worse, owing to the large number of mud habitations which exists, and for which ground has had to be excavated in order to build them, allows of so many catchment areas for rain water during the monsoon which become practically Anopheles traps, and so we have a most extensive ever-prevalent and immediate source of propagation and dissemination of malaria amongst the residents of this city, and for which, I fear, it is almost impossible to effect a complete remedy by any prophylactic sanitary measures. The question of the dissemination of malaria and the many facilities afforded locally for the propagation of the genus Anopheles, which is so intimately associated with that problem, is one of great interest to the city of Bharatpur, which, by reason of its unfortunate situation physically, enjoys an unenviable notoriety in the matter of prevalence of fevers of malarial origin, in that these latter cause more than 40 per cent. of the annual mortality. With a view to mitigating this scourge for the last few years, since the institution of a Sanitary Board in the place, many measures have been taken in order to prevent the soil being water-logged, and draining any low-lying areas within or in close proximity to the city; these have resulted in benefit to the public health in many ways. Still much remains to be done, and more still remains regarding which no measures, however drastic, would have\nany effect, owing to the unfortunately low-lying situation of the city, so that I fear the only really feasible method by which this problem can be successfully tackled, is by means of cinchonizing the entire population and destroying the plasmodium primarily, aided and seconded where possible with other means of extinguishing the Anopheles mosquito, such as drainage and filling up of low-lying land, and where this is not possible, by treating the water where these pests are found to breed, by drugs, disinfectants, kerosine oil, &c., according to circumstances.\n\nIt is most important that the geographic distribution of the various species of the genus Anopheles be ascertained, and is a work in which every medical man should be actively interested. I have been making careful observations on this subject in my own particular sphere of work, and have made up a map yearly showing the pools, &c., around the city of Bharatpur where I have found the ova, larv\u00e6 or pup\u00e6 of Anopheles, out of which I have hatched out the imago and identified the species chiefly found here as the Anopheles Rossii, an observation which I have since had verified at the Research Laboratory at Bombay; other varieties have been found in small quantities, such as A. Barbirostris, A. Theobaldi, A. Culifacies, &c. The various Anopheles, breeding pools around and within the city of Bharatpur have been indicated in the accompanying map (q.v.), from which it will be noticed that nearly all the pools selected by this insect for breeding purposes are located on the south and east portions of the city, the reason for which it is difficult to account, except perhaps that it may be to avoid the fierce hot west winds which blow during the greater part of the year, and that the west side of the town is very bare and entirely devoid of shade or vegetation, and further that all along the east and south sides of the city outside the ramparts are situated small bustees consisting of collections of mud-walled and thatch-roofed huts in close proximity to stagnant water during the greater part of the year, and inhabited by chamars, sweepers, &c., in the seclusion and darkness of which huts the adult insects of this species lie up in safety during the hot dry months, thus avoiding the hot winds, only to come forth at the advent of the rainy season for the purpose of breeding, the pools for which, as observation has shown, being found in close proximity to these dwellings.\nI have found during my observations that this species of mosquito selects almost any collection of water for laying its eggs, and that no collection of water is necessarily an unlikely place in which to find its ova, larv\u00e6 or pup\u00e6; the most unlikely places often turn out to be the most fertile, and it is curious how often they will select pools of water which collect in the small excavations along the public roads made by coolies, &c., of the Public Works Department employed in the work of repairing roads in India. As far as my experience goes in Bharatpur, such places, especially if adjacent to fields, have afforded certain finds for the larv\u00e6 of this insect. I have written very strongly to the authorities concerned, requesting that such practice may be discontinued as much as possible in future. The first appearance of the ova of this insect in Bharatpur is usually about the middle of August, from which I have successfully reared many adult insects, and identified in my laboratory as belonging to the species before mentioned. The several pools in which larv\u00e6, &c., were found were treated with kerosine oil as soon as the larv\u00e6 had reached to within a few hours of the pup\u00e6 stage (this I consider important in order to ensure hatching out of all the ova present and before appearance of pup\u00e6 stage), and were in all cases destroyed in about five minutes, care being taken to see that a continuous film of the oil was kept up for three days afterwards or until the oil had evaporated. This method is open to a few objections, and having tried coal tar in one or two instances I am inclined to think that this article answers just as well, if not better, is much cheaper, and can be used in much smaller quantities with nearly equally beneficial effect, and moreover does not evaporate like kerosine oil certainly does. By the above means many pools have been treated in which larv\u00e6, &c., of Anopheles have been found by me to exist, and I have been able to account for many crores of these pests, I trust with corresponding benefit to the residents of this unfortunately-placed and fever-stricken city. The institution of a pipe water supply as above mentioned will go far to solve this difficult problem, in that it will do away with the necessity for allowing the filling up of the Fort Moat, at present an urgent need and necessary for keeping up the level of the water in the wells of the city; it is a dangerous source of supply at the best, but under present circumstances is the only feasible one.\nThe Municipal Board consists at present of the following:\n\nA President, who is a legally-qualified medical man and acts in the capacity also of Health Officer.\n\nThe present establishment entertained by the Board to carry on the sanitary duties of the city consists of Secretary (paid), English clerk, vernacular clerk, draftsman, hindi clerk, cashier, daftri. These comprise the office establishment.\n\nThe establishment for supervision of the sanitary work of the city is composed of one sanitary inspector, one assistant sanitary inspector, jemadar peons, peons, bhishties, one carpenter, one blacksmith, and sweepers.\n\nThe city is marked off into districts for purposes of sanitary administration, to which a Jemadar peon with so many peons and a sufficient number of sweepers is allotted, together with bhishties according to the dimensions and needs of the particular ward; these are again under the general superintendence of a member of the Municipal Board, under whose orders the above officials act, the Sanitary Inspector and his assistant exercising a general supervision over the whole lot; by this means responsibility is shared, and I feel sure greater individual interest is taken in his ilaka by each member of the Board having his own ward to look after.\n\nThe godowns of the Board are situated within the Fort to be in as central part as possible, where all the rubbish and conservancy carts are stored, and where godowns for storage of disinfectants, &c., are located.\n\nDig.\u2014In the year 1898, at my recommendation, a Sanitary Board was instituted at Dig on the same lines as at Bharatpur, which consists of a Board composed of local residents taking an interest in the matter, and presided over by the Tehsildar of the district. Though at present in its infancy a great deal of useful work has been done by this Board, and the town presents a very different appearance to what it did a short time ago. As this town is frequented annually by lakhs of pilgrims from all parts of the\ncountry, it is distinctly advisable to have an organization such as this, capable of coping with out breaks of epidemic disease in an independent manner, and relying on its own resources.\n\n**Square Mile Densities of 1881 and 1891 Compared.**\n\n| Serial No. | Unit       | Area in square miles | Population | Square

of births in the mofussil, like other vital statistics, is extremely faulty, and consequently very unreliable from any scientific standpoint. In the city of Bharatpur, however, supervision is exercised over it by the Sanitary Board, which though far from being perfect is more or less reliable. Tables showing birth rate per month for the last few years are appended. It is interesting to note that the actual birth rate is greatest in the month of September, showing that conception takes place more frequently about the month of January. This fact is what one would expect, as the vitality of the people is probably greater in the middle of the cold weather, with attendant increase of sexual activity, together with the fact that at such season, owing to the inclemency of the weather, as well as the fact that the bulk of the population owing to the cessation from harvesting operations, &c., are living together at their homes, so that greater opportunities for cohabitation are afforded, with the result noted. A reference to the appended tables will show that the honours are shared by the autumn months of the year in this matter. The birth rate of the city of Bharatpur is, I regret to say, not what it should be, though allowing for faulty registration, for if compared with the mortality, it will be noted that the latter is usually at a higher rate per mille than the former, and this, from my intimate acquaintance and the knowledge of the place, I believe to be actually the case! For this alarming state of affairs there are probably good reasons, foremost amongst which is the fact that a very large mortality occurs annually during the latter end of each year from malarial fevers, which latter are directly attributable to the low-lying position of the city and its environs, so much so that when I first came to the place they were inundated for miles, and remained so for many months of the year, practically the whole of the cold weather, affording endless facilities doubtless for the propagation of Anopheles, with resultant dissemination of malarial fevers, most of which are of a very severe type. During my residence here I have been able with the co-operation of the Public Works Department of the State to so arrange\nby drainage and judicious treatment of the flood waters of\nthe Banganga (which were chiefly answerable for the ex-\ncessive inundation of the environs of the city in former\ntimes) to prevent this, so that little or no flooding now\ntakes place, with a marked beneficial effect on the general\nhealth of the population of the city. A glance at the\ntable appended will help to show the marked benefit\nwhich has occurred to the public health since the\nintroduction of suitable and efficient drainage of water-\nlogged localities in the vicinity of the city, in that since\nthe year 1896, that in which the Sanitary Board was\ninstituted, the mortality from fevers, which are nearly all\nof malarial origin in this city, has markedly decreased, and\nthis too notwithstanding the fact that the population of the\ncity from immigration has increased greatly every year since\nthen.\n\nMortality.\u2014The registration of deaths like that of\nbirths in the districts of the State is extremely faulty, and\nmostly unreliable; the returns for the city of Bharatpur\nbeing under the supervision of the Sanitary Board are,\nhowever, fairly reliable.\n\nA reference to the table appended shows forcibly what\nhavoc malarial fevers have played amongst the population\nof the city of Bharatpur, the mortality under the head far\nout-balancing the totals from all other causes put together!\nIt will be noticed too on reference to the tables that by far\nthe greater portion of the general mortality takes place as\none would expect at the latter end of the year, showing\nthat the greater bulk of the people suffer from malarial\nfevers during the autumn months and appear to succumb\nto it a month or two later, that is about November. This\nfact may be also verified by a reference to dispensary statistics,\nwhere it will be seen that by far the larger number of cases\nof fever commence in the month of September. This\nexcessive mortality seems to be more or less shared by the\nthree last months of the year. The mortality from this\ncause has, however, been much decreased (vide Note on\nBirths) by the efficient drainage of the environs of the city,\n&c., and filling up of, where possible, low-lying spots in and\naround the city, for reasons above stated. In the year\n1892 a very severe epidemic of cholera swelled the death\nroll, but both small-pox and cholera, owing to efficient vaccination operations within the city and the institution of sanitary measures, protection of the water supply, &c., and measures taken for early notification of disease respectively, have in recent years been more or less conspicuous by their absence (vide table attached). I fear that little or nothing more can be done in the way of improving the public health of this city owing to its very unfortunate situation, around which all the flood water for miles collects, rendering the soil water-logged to a degree, the remedy for which, I fear, would be nothing short of removing the entire city, which of course is impossible. There is no doubt that were a proper and efficient supply of drinking water brought into this city by any means it would be a most powerful factor in benefiting the health of its inhabitants, who at present labour under great and grave disadvantages in the present bad as well as unprotected water supply from the wells. It is hoped, however, that something may shortly be done to remedy this great want, as I have on many occasions brought the urgency of this matter before the notice of the Darbar, it being one of vital importance to the capital of the State and its inhabitants.\n| Months | 1892 | 1893 | 1894 | 1895 | 1896 | 1897 | 1898 | 1899 | Total | Average

sanitary operations were properly inaugurated and set on foot, vide Year 1898-99 as result.*\nAnalysis of Water of the Most Important Wells in the Bharatpur State, Made in My Laboratory in the Victoria Hospital, Bharatpur.\n\nThe water in the wells throughout the State, with the exception of one or two, or those in close proximity to the Bareta Lake, is from a hygienic standpoint unpotable, as the soil itself, quite apart from the large chances present of organic contamination, is so impregnated with inorganic matter of all kinds, especially Chloride of Sodium, &c., that it is for man and beast not only extremely unpalatable but undrinkable. Such large amounts of inorganic contamination must, and undoubtedly do, have a most deleterious effect upon the digestive organs of those drinking it, which in time must result in mal-assimilation, and thereby great deterioration in health. To anyone having the least knowledge of the people in this State, it is exactly the state of affairs which presents itself, and in the large towns of course this is most marked, so much so, especially as regards Bharatpur, that it has become imperative on the administration to most seriously consider the subject of introducing a pure water supply into that city without delay, as the want of such at present is working havoc on the people. It is a factor which will have to be faced in the near future, and there is no source within the State which can compare with that of the Bareta Lake, not only as regards efficiency, but sufficiency of supply to a large community, moreover its catchment area, all upland surface, leaves little or nothing to be desired, and has few, if any, villages in it, a most important point. The analyses speak for themselves and require little comment from me!\n## Analysis of Water from Different Wells in the Bharatpur State\n\n| Serial Number | Name                        | Colour          | Turbidity | Odour | Free Ammonia | Chlorine | Equivalent of Common Salt | Nitrites | Nitrates | Hardness | Permanent | Temporary | Total | Lead | Zinc, Iron & Copper | Oxygen absorbed in 15 Min. at 24\u00b0 C |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|----------|---------------------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|------|---------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1             | Ikran well                  | Transparent clear | NIL       | Nil   | 49\u00b72 gr.     | NIL      | 13\u00b72 gr.                  | 22\u00b72 gr. | Faint traces | NIL      | 8         | NIL       | 0\u00b71    |      |                     |                                   |\n| 2             | Tarwalla well (Agency Compound) |                 |           |       | 215\u00b70 gr.    | Considerable amount | Very faint traces | Distinct |          |          | 6         |           | 0\u00b72   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 3             | A well at Pahari (sweet water well) |                 |           |       |              | Faint traces |                          |          |          |          | 3         |           | 0\u00b72   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 4             | A well at Pahari (alkaline water well) |                 |           |       |              | NIL       | Excessive                  |          |          |          | 4         |           | 0\u00b73   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 5             | Sirsai well (Kumher)        |                 |           |       |              | 259\u00b70 gr. | Faint traces               | 8\u00b73 gr.  | 18\u00b78 gr. |          | 3         |           | 0\u00b72   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 6             | Mahadeo well (Biana)        |                 |           |       |              | 8\u00b73 gr.   | 13\u00b78 gr.                  |          |          |          | 4         |           | 0\u00b71   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 7             | Gandorja well do.           |                 |           |       |              | 6\u00b70 gr.   | 11\u00b70 gr.                  |          |          |          | 5         |           | 0\u00b71   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 8             | Dood do. do.                |                 |           |       |              | 2\u00b75 gr.   | 42\u00b70 gr.                  |          |          |          | 6         |           | 0\u00b72   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 9             | Kadam Khandi well           |                 |           |       |              | NIL       | 10\u00b70 gr.                  | 16\u00b73 gr. |          |          | 3         |           | 0\u00b71   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 10            | Charbagh Pump do.           |                 |           |       |              | 43\u00b73 gr.  | 72\u00b72 gr.                  |          |          |          | Trace of Iron | 0\u00b72   |      |                     |                                   |\n| 11            | Jaghina Gate do.            |                 |           |       |              | 137\u00b79 gr. | Very faint traces         | 3\u00b73 gr.  | 5\u00b75 gr. |          | 2         | 1         | 3     | NIL |                     |                                   |\n| 12            | Hospital well Kanjauli Lines |                 |           |       |              | 3\u00b73 gr.   | 5\u00b75 gr.                   |          |          |          | 2         | 1         | 3     | NIL |                     |                                   |\n| No. | Description                                                                 | Result |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 13  | Left wing well do.                                                          |        |\n| 14  | Right do.                                                                   |        |\n| 15  | Hospital well, Mandalai Lines II.

No records are available showing what changes took place after his incumbency, but it is apparent that the superintendence has passed through many hands at different times. In 1895, when I came first to the State on special duty with its Chief, I recollect the prison a dirty insanitary place, the outer enclosure of which was surrounded with dilapidated chuppars infested with rats, barracks over-crowded with prisoners, chiefly long term and lifers, amongst whom there was not the least vestige of discipline, frequently shown by assaults of a serious nature upon the officials in charge. This state of affairs went on till 1897, when, upon the occasion of an official visit from the then Agent Governor-General, Sir Robert Crosthwaite, who was so displeased with the disgraceful state of affairs then prevailing, into which I need not enter here, I was asked to utilize any spare time I had to superintend and thoroughly re-organize the Prison. This matter I took in hand at once and after months of hard work and obstruction, both passive and active, the prison was placed upon lines similar to those in vogue in British territory, and has been in consequence a credit to the State ever since, instead of the reverse. As overcrowding was serious and the number of convicts daily increasing, I recommended that the State Ghaoshalas on the opposite side of the Sewar road, which had lately been vacated, might with advantage be converted into a subsidiary Jail, providing accommodation for factories, female ward, Jail hospital, lunatic asylum, and warder's quarters, for which no provision existed in the old Prison across the road. The matter was taken in hand by the Durbar and speedily accomplished, so that there is now ample accommodation in this Prison; in order, however, to render the site a sanitary one, 3 feet of earth had to be removed and completely new soil substituted to that depth. A Printing Press in connection with the Prison has also been started,\nwhich pays handsomely, and will increase its profits considerably on the advent of a larger and more modern type of machine, which will shortly be obtained from England. The factories started also bring in considerable profit yearly to the State revenues, and the Prison is now a paying concern instead of as formerly a dead loss. The establishment originally maintained for the upkeep of this Prison was enormous, and there being a total absence of discipline in any form within its walls, rendered such perhaps necessary; it amounted to considerably over one hundred sepoys drawn from Raj regiments! Upon my taking over the re-organization, this number was at once reduced to 40, exclusive of executive staff, jailor, &c., which, when thoroughly drilled and taught their duties, I found to be ample for the work, both for night as well as day duty in the Prison. The Prison is now managed on lines exactly similar to those on which the Jails in the United Provinces are run, and the Jail Manual of that province is strictly adhered to here in the management of both Prisons of this State.\n\nDistrict Jail, Dig.\n\nOwing to the difficulties and expenses attendant upon the constant transfer of prisoners from the State hawalat at Dig to the Central Prison at Bharatpur, which is situated about 25 miles distant from Dig, it was deemed advisable to establish a small Jail there in the year 1897. At my suggestion an old building within the Fort was selected and put into a state of repair and security, and a prison for the accommodation of about sixty prisoners was established there. Only light sentence prisoners are allowed to undergo their terms of imprisonment there, all long-term prisoners are at once transferred to the Central Prison at Bharatpur. This Jail is conducted on similar lines to those prevailing at Bharatpur Central Prison, and beside other advantages forms a useful sanatorium to which to send sickly prisoners from the Central Prison if their health demands it, as Bharatpur is a notoriously unhealthy place.\nThis Jail was opened on the 1st of April 1897, a competent jailor and menial staff appointed, subsequently a jail garden was made, and factory erected, so that prisoners should find employment and not eat the bread of idleness. This institution also returns profits to the State, which may increase from time to time as circumstances admit.\n\n*Statement of Strength, Admission into Hospital, Deaths, &c., at the Bharatpur

administration. Before that period there was only one \"Sadar Madarsa,\" in which Hindi, Arabic and Persian were taught on the old \"maktab\" system. In 1856 Major Morrison, the then Political Agent, appointed two teachers from the Agra Normal School to teach Vernacular, and in 1858 an English class was opened in the Sadar School. In June 1862 Colonel (then Captain) Walter appointed Babu Bhola Nath Dass, the then Medical Officer, to be Superintendent of Schools also. The Sanskrit branch of the Sadar School was also opened for the first time in the year 1867; students were not prepared for any University examinations.\n\nNo actual change was made in the general administration of this department during the reign of the late Maharaja Jeswant Singh, and apparently no proper supervision was exercised over it. In his Report for 1895-96 the Dewan writes, \"Education is very much neglected and is consequently backward in the State.\" Again in the Report for 1896-97, he writes, \"There seemed no properly fixed standard for the schools, and the masters taught any book they liked, and have classes arranged according to their fancies.\" To give an idea as to the state of the teachers employed, the following remark made by the Dewan may be quoted: \"Of the Moffussil School Teachers, I can safely say that many of them cannot write a common letter without blunders, cannot work out sums in rule of three, and their knowledge of geography is so limited that they do not even know the difference as to whether Asia is a continent or an animal!\" Their pay was five or six rupees a month, and under the circumstances perhaps more could hardly be expected of them. Such was the condition of the department when the late Dewan undertook the task of re-organizing it. In January 1897 an Inspector of Schools was appointed, and in July 1897 a competent Head Master, first standard, and a Deputy Inspector for the Moffussil Schools were appointed. At the present time the working of the department is carried out on the same lines as the Educational\nDepartment of the adjacent British districts of Mathura and Agra. The same curriculum of studies is adhered to as is prescribed by the Director of Public Instruction of N.-W. P. and Oudh. Scholarships and prizes are awarded to deserving candidates, the annual expenditure on Scholarships being Rs. 2,304.\n\nTeachers who have passed the Middle Class or Normal School Examinations are now appointed, and are paid at the rate of Rs. 8 and 10 respectively, as a minimum salary. Constant inspection has effected a marked improvement in the department, but it will take expenditure of money and time to bring it up to a higher state of efficiency. At present the Sadar School is divided into three departments namely:\n\nI. English, which prepares students for the Entrance Examination of the University of Allahabad and is affiliated thereto.\n\nII.

They were opened by the late Dewan in 1896. At present they are in a rudimentary stage. The annexed Statement A. shows the working of the department on 31st March 1900. Statement B. shows the number of Hindus, Mohamedans and others receiving education in the State.\n\nTo encourage education among the Kothri Band Thakurs, the Dewan awarded from the State, Scholarships of Rs. 5 each to the Thakur boys who were willing to receive education in the Sadar School. Eight such Scholarships are now given; schools are also started in villages for the benefit of the Thakurs in their villages. In 1897 a gymnastic master was appointed to teach gymnastic exercises to the boys of the Sadar School, the staff of which appear to take great interest in the welfare of its boys, who are encouraged to play cricket and football on the State Recreation Club ground recently made. Students are sent up to compete at the Annual School Tournament at Ajmer. Drill is taught in many of the mofussil schools.\n\nRecreation Club.\u2014A Club in order to encourage manly sports was started in 1898, at my suggestion, by the gift on the part of His Highness the Maharaja Ram Singh of a cricket ground. Since then a pavilion and racquet court have been built and tennis courts and a football field laid out. The Club receives financial support from the State yearly, and is much patronized and appreciated by the people, who also contribute towards its maintenance. This club as regards cricket has made a name for itself in India, and can hold its own against most clubs, and has been the means of fostering friendly intercourse amongst the inhabitants as well as contributing materially towards their physical development and health.\n\nKothi Khas.\u2014Kothi Khas is one of the four branches of the Shagird Pesha Department. Its functions are to look after the State guests and State property, i.e., palaces, bungalows and furniture. To this end it keeps a\ngood number of menial servants, such as khansamas, cooks, khidmatgars and farrashes permanently employed. It keeps also a large stock of furniture and stores, &c., for the supply of the various other departments of the State, and for the State officers going on tour in the district.\n\nThe other three branches of the Shagird Pesha are the kahars, chaprasis and farrashkhana. Kahars are water-bearers and chaprasis do duty as office peons for all the State departments.\n\nThe farrashkhana contains a large number of farrashes, and tents, &c., ready for the use of State guests and State officials.\nIMPERIAL SERVICE TRANSPORT CORPS.\n\nBRIEF HISTORY.\n\nDuring Sambat 1895 (1888) Major Beatson (now Brigadier-General S. Beatson, C.B., Inspector General of Imperial Service Troops in India), then Inspecting Officer of Imperial Service Troops with the late Maharaja Jaswant Singh, G.C.S.I., selected nearly 600 men with horses from the 1st and 2nd regiment of Raj Cavalry, and established a regiment of Imperial Service Lancers, calling it the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. It was composed of the following:\n\n| Establishment       | Number |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| Horses              | 600    |\n| Colonel             | 1      |\n| Captains            | 4      |\n| Rassaldars          | 8      |\n| Jamadars            | 8      |\n| K.

Major J. G. Turner, the then Inspecting Officer of Cavalry and Transport, prepared a scheme for the formation of this corps, and estimated the total cost of maintaining it at Rs. 1,50,000 a year, and an initial cost of Rs. 2,08,475, which were approved of by the Government of India.\nThe strength of the Transport Corps is as follows:\n\n| Rank                  | Proposed |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Superintendent        | 1        |\n| Assistant Superintendent | 1       |\n| Jamadars              | 4        |\n| Kote Daffadars        | 4        |\n| Daffadars             | 16       |\n| Lance Daffadars       | 32       |\n| Trumpeters            | 2        |\n| Drivers               | 320      |\n| Salootry              | 1        |\n| Assistant Salootry    | 1        |\n| Major (Farrier)       | 1        |\n| Farriers              | 4        |\n| Hospital Assistant    | 2        |\n| Clerks                | 2        |\n| Munshies              | 2        |\n| Cashier               | 1        |\n| Weighman              | 1        |\n| Daftri                | 1        |\n| Artificers            | 14       |\n| Followers             | 104      |\n| Transport Carts       | 300      |\n| Ponies                | 7        |\n| Mules                 | 600      |\n| Tongas                | 7        |\n\nThe services of Rai Sahib Ghamandi Lal, Commissariat Transport Agent were lent to the State by the Government of India for the organization of the corps in November 1899, and it is hoped that the corps will be complete by the end of the present year. Nearly 100 transport carts are employed daily on State work or duties which in time of peace save the State a great deal of expense and in time of war will afford valuable aid to the Imperial Government should necessity arise for their employment on Field Service.\n\nThe corps is located at Mandholi, about 4 miles from Bharatpur, in the lines formerly used by the Imperial Service Lancers. They are provided with workshops, &c., and a regimental hospital replete with equipment, which would do credit to any British corps.\n\nAttached will be found maps showing disposition of barracks, &c., at Mandholi.\nSITE PLAN\nOF THE\nBHARATPUR IMPERIAL SERVICE INFANTRY LINES\nAT\nKANJOLI NEAR BHARATPUR\nSCALE 800 FT. 1 INCH\n\nREFERENCES\n1 Hospital\n2 Hospital Assistant's Quarters\n3 Hospital Kitchen\n4 Hospital Followers Quarters\n5 Sweepers' hut\n6 Infections Diseases ward (Temporary)\n7 Half Company Barracks (12 Nos.)\n8 Do.

Bharatpur State\nIMPERIAL SERVICE INFANTRY REGIMENT.\n\nBRIEF HISTORY.\n\nThis regiment was first enlisted by Dhaq Gulab Singh, the then Mukhtyar of this State, during the dark days of the Mutiny in the year 1857, with a view to increase the forces of the State in order to protect Bharatpur territory from the mutineers, being called the Maharaj Paltan. The command of the regiment has been held successively by Bakhshi Ganga Ram, Chowdry Ganga Bakhsh, Faujdar Mukand Singh, Pandit Kirta Kishen, Azim-ud-din Khan, Sardar Mukand Singh, and Sardar Girdar Singh Bahadur, which latter is the present Commanding Officer.\n\nTowards the close of the year 1889, 800 sepoys were selected from this and other Raj regiments by Captain E. A. Kettlewell, the officer nominated by Government for the purpose, and formed into a regiment for Imperial service, the pay of the sepoy being raised to Rs. 7 per mensem. Captain Kettlewell was then appointed by Government as Inspecting Officer, and the whole regiment was armed with the Snider rifle from the Allahabad Arsenal; these were, in 1894, replaced by the Martini Henry rifle supplied by order of Government.\n\nThe regiment was reduced from 8 to 6 Companies after the death of the late Maharaja Jaswant Singh, which took place in December 1893, and is now constituted as follows:\n\n| No. | Company |\n|-----|---------|\n| 1   | Jats    |\n| 2   | Brahmans|\n| 3   | Gujars  |\n| 4   | Mussalmans|\n| 5   | Miscellaneous castes|\n\nThe following officers have at different periods served with the Imperial Service Infantry as Inspecting and Assistant Inspecting Officers, viz., Majors Cox and Conran, Captains Kettlewell, Crawford, Watson, Drake-Brockman, MacLachlan, Walker and Burke.\nThe present strength of the regiment is as follows:\n\n| Detail                  | Number in 1901 |\n|-------------------------|---------------|\n| Commandant              | 1             |\n| Assistant Commandant    | 6             |\n| Adjutant                | 1             |\n| Subadars                | 6             |\n| Jemadars                | 6             |\n| Havaldar-Major          | 1             |\n| Kote Havaldars          | 6             |\n| Havaldars               | 24            |\n| Naiks                   | 24            |\n| Lance Naiks             | 30            |\n| Armour Havaldar         |               |\n| Naik                    |               |\n| Quarter-Master Havaldar |               |\n| Bugler-Havaldar         |               |\n| Naik                    |               |\n| Lance Naik              |               |\n| Buglers                 |               |\n| Drummers                |               |\n| Sepoys                  |               |\n| Hospital Assistants     |               |\n\nBesides the above there are followers, Regimental and Transport, as well as Hospital establishment attached to the regiment.\n\nIn 1897 the Companies were re-organized according to the castes as under:\n\n1st Company\n2nd \"\n3rd \"\n4th Company, Mohamedans.\n5th \" Brahmins, but now Brahmins are not being taken in service but Jats in the 5th Company.\n6th Company, Gujars.\n\nThe regiment was detailed for garrison duty to Poona in the spring of the year 1901, owing to pressing needs on the part of Government, upon whose army a good deal of extra work, in connection with the war in South Africa and China, was thrown at the time.\n\nThis corps has excellent barracks situated on the most sanitary site about Bharatpur, and is provided with a most excellently-situated and equipped regimental hospital, which would do credit to any corps in an Indian Cantonment. A great want is felt for a set of married sepoy lines, which I trust, in the interest of the corps, will shortly be provided by the State (vide Plan attached).\nDISPENSARY STATISTICS.\n### Return of

S. Lancers.*\nDHOLPUR STATE.\nDHOLPUR STATE.\n\nGEOGRAPHY:\n\n1. The Dholpur State is an irregular wedge-shaped territory, situated between $26^\\circ 22'$ and $26^\\circ 57'$ North Latitude and $77^\\circ 26'$ and $78^\\circ 19'$ East Longitude; it is bounded on the north by the British District of Agra, on the east and south by Gwalior, on the west by Karauli, Bharatpur and the outlying Pergunnah Kheragarh of Agra. The Chambal River forms the southern boundary along its whole length. The greatest length of the State is 76 miles from east to west, i.e., from the Agra to the Karauli borders; its greatest breadth is 30 miles from north to south, or from the Agra boundary to the Chambal. Its superficial area is 1,193 square miles.\n\n2. Physical Features.\u2014Rising from the alluvial plain near the town of Dholpur, which is about 600 feet above mean sea level, a range of hills runs westward parallel to, and from 3 to 5 miles distant from the River Chambal, meeting another range which passes along the western border; between these ranges there are many spurs and isolated groups of hills.\n\nThe formation of the rock, which dates from the pre-Cambrian Geological Era, is sedimentary red and white sandstone, in some places hard and crystalline, in others soft and laminated (these latter make an excellent stone for building and decorative purposes), overlying and interspersed with shales of the same period. The highest point of the range, within the borders of the State, is 1,075 feet above mean sea level.\n\nAnother feature of the State is the vast number of ravines due to the friable nature of the alluvial portion of the soil, the depth of the river beds below the natural surface of the ground, the quick drainage caused by the heavy slope of the drainage area and the arid character of the hills, which are practically devoid of vegetation. These ravines are especially developed on the banks of the Chambal, whose low summer level is 150 feet below surface level and\nliable to very heavy and violent floods; the record flood is said to have been 112 feet in the year 1857, but the highest of late years was 88 feet in the year 1900. These ravines, except where prevented from cutting further by the range of hills, extend for some miles inland and are yearly extending. Ravines also border the Parbati River, which rises in the Sir Muttra Talooka and flows through the Bari, Baseri, and Kolari Pergunnahs into Agra, where it is called the Banganga; these are nothing like so extensive as those of the Chambal.\n\n3. Communications.\u2014The Indian Midland Railway portion of the G. I. P. System runs across the State from north to south, parallel to the Grand Trunk Road from Agra to Bombay. A siding runs up to the quarries at Chandpur, a distance of five miles. There is a proposal before the Durbar to extend this siding to the Tehsil town of Bari.\n\nWith the exception of a short length of metalled road connecting the Munia Station with the Grand Trunk Road, and the Grand Trunk Road which runs across the State, the only other pucca roads are in the immediate vicinity of Dholpur. Good \"fair-weather\" cutcha roads connect all the Tehsils; these roads are more or less impassable after heavy rain, owing to floods in the numerous nullahs crossing them. In the hill tracts mule, and in a few cases, cart tracks are the only means of communication.\nADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE.\n\nThe administration of the State has been usually carried out by a Council composed of men of influence in the State, under the guidance of the Ruling Chief, which for the last fifty years has been shared, in the first instance, by His Highness the Maharaj Rana Bhugwant Singh, and from the year 1873 by the present ruler, Maharaj Rana Nihal Singh, the grandson of the former. During the minority, however, of the late Chief the administration of the State was carried on from the years 1874 to 1883 by Colonel Dennehy, on whose departure a Council was superceded by the appointment of a Dewan, who until recently carried on the administration under the guidance of the late Maharaj Rana. Owing, however, to the death in July 1901 of His Highness, the late Maharaj Rana Nihal Singh, changes in the administration are likely to ensue until such time as his son is considered fit by the Government of India to be entrusted with executive authority.\n\nThe State is divided into six Pergunnahs or Tehsils: (i) Gird or the home Pergunnah in which Dholpur is situated, (ii) Munia, (iii) Kolari, (iv) Bari, (v) Baseri, and (vi) Rajakhera. Rajakhera lies due east; more west come Munia, and, south of this, Gird. West of Munia is Kolari, still further west and south-west are Baseri and Bari. Beyond this to the south-west are the Talookas of Sir Muttra and Rajhauni, which pay a quit-rent to the State, but are independent of the State as far as administration is concerned. Each Tehsil has a Tehsildar in charge, with the exception of Munia, which has only a Naib working under the Tehsildar of Gird.\nAPPROXIMATE INCOME AND EXPENDITURE OF DHOLPUR STATE BY AVERAGE OF FIVE YEARS FROM SAMBAT 1952.\n\n| Income | Expenditure |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Principal Heads | Amount | Principal Heads | Amount |\n| 1 Land Revenue | 6,87,841 | 3 | 1 Religious and Charitable | 30,735 |\n| 2 Salt | 60,000 | 0 | 2 Deorhi or household expenses | 1,87,200 |\n| 3 Customs | 20,301 | 4 | 3 Civil Administration | 92,203 |\n| 4 Administration | 40,557 | 15 | 4 Army and Police | 2,62,141 |\n| 5 P.

Revenue.\u2014The total revenue from all sources is approximately Rs. 10,00,000, of which about Rs. 8,00,000 are derived from land revenue and Rs. 60,000 from the Salt compensation paid by the Government of India. The rest is derived from miscellaneous sources.\n\n6. Chief Towns and population:\u2014\n\n(i) Dhrolpur, the capital of the State, is situated on the Indian Midland Railway, about 34 miles from Agra and Gwalior. The Grand Trunk Road also runs close to the town. It consists of four detached portions: (a) Shergarh and Sagapara or old Dhrolpur, of which very little now remains except the old fortified Serai, the rest having disappeared into the Chambal ravines; (b) The Shere or city, which is now being encroached on; (c) the Kothi or present Civil station, which contains the Cutcherry Hospital, the Agency, and the old Palace, and (d) Purana Chhowni, four miles distant, which contains a large Palace, part of which has hitherto been utilized as the Jail. Kesar Bagh, the residence built by the late Maharana, is situated on the crest of the hills, is about seven miles from Dhrolpur and three from Purani Chhowni.\nThree miles from Dholpur is the sacred tank of Much Kund, said to have been made by the god Krishna. The tank, which is surrounded by temples, lies in a valley surrounded by hills. The population of Dholpur is 19,230.\n\n(ii) **Munia** is a village with a population of 1,796, and is situated on the Grand Trunk Road towards Agra, 10 miles from Dholpur.\n\n(iii) **Kolari** is 13 miles from Dholpur; its population is 907.\n\n(iv) **Bari**. Next in importance to Dholpur, and situated about 18 miles to the west, is the town of Bari. Built in the time of the Moghuls, it is composed mostly of large and pucca houses, which gives it the appearance of a large and flourishing town. On the western boundary of the town is a large pucca-built Fort, which contains a fine Palace in a good state of preservation, in which the Tehsil is at present situated. The population is 11,603. Three miles to the south-east is the Khanpur tank, the largest lake in the State, which was built by order of Akbar; three large Palaces stand on the edge of it, which are all more or less in a ruined state, with the exception of one lately repaired. It contains the usual State departmental offices and a branch dispensary.\n\n(v) **Baseri** is a town of 2,735 inhabitants, situated 29 miles from Dholpur; it contains a mud Fort or Ghari, inside of which is the Tehsil and Cutcherry.\n\n(vi) **Rajakhera** is the third largest town in the State, with a population of 6,609: it has a mud Fort the same as Baseri. It is the head-quarters of a Tehsil, and contains a branch dispensary.\n\nSir Muttra, as has been before mentioned, is administratively independent of the State. The principal town of the same name has a population of 4,819. I hope that a branch dispensary may be started here shortly, financial reasons having hitherto precluded the realization of such; but times have changed, and it is to be hoped that the interest of the local Thakur will be enlisted in the matter and his active sympathy and accord obtained to the scheme, as at present his subjects are far removed from any chance of obtaining medical and surgical relief within his territory.\n### Census of Dholpur State in 1901 as Compared with that of 1891.\n\n|                        | Total Population in 1891 | Total Population in 1901 | Total Increase in

The compounder came, bringing with him a supply of medicines. He was at first located in the Travellers' Bungalow at Dholpur, where medicines were dispensed and provided for the benefit of European travellers, but were not, it appears, given to residents of the place. This arrangement seems to have lasted for a year and a half.\n\nIn July 1867 a latter was addressed by Colonel Eden, the Agent Governor-General in Rajputana at the time, to Major Walter, the Political Agent, advising the establishment of dispensaries in the State, to which suggestion the Chief willingly agreed; accordingly in the year 1869 a hospital was opened on proper lines, and establishment, &c., sanctioned in the time of Dr. Harvey, the Agency Surgeon. The original scheme provided for the institution of dispensaries at Dholpur, Bari, Rajakhera, and Sir Muttra. These were all eventually opened with the exception of that at Sir Muttra, where it was deemed undesirable to do so, owing to the pecuniary difficulties of the local Thakur.\n\nI will briefly describe the present institutions in order of their origin as far as possible.\n\nSadar Dispensary Dholpur.\u2014The old dispensary building was situated on the city road, just opposite the Gird Tehsil Court, and which, as before stated, was opened in the year 1869. The present building is comparatively modern in structure, and was erected in the year 1894, in the time of Colonel N. C. Martelli, Political Agent. It appears to have been only partly completed then, in that no subordinate quarters or even compound wall were erected at the time, and the whole building seems to have been allowed to get into a state of disrepair, for want of completion and the entertainment of a staff sufficient for its upkeep. On my advent as Agency Surgeon I represented this state of\naffairs to the Durbar, showing what a false policy it was to have a building unoccupied and drifting into disrepair, simply for want of a little expenditure in the way of establishment, fixtures, or appliances necessary for the efficient treatment of the sick. My suggestions were at once taken up seriously, and upon them extensive alterations and additions for this purpose were sanctioned and have now been completed. They consisted of the following:\n\n(1.) Erection of a compound wall. (2.) Completion of quarters for medical subordinates and menial staff. (3.) A mortuary and ward for infectious cases. (5.) A latrine for in-patients. (6.) An operating room. (7.) The supply of beds and bedding for accommodation of 12 in-patients, with the entertainment of an extra establishment, such as cook, kahar, &c., necessary for such, and the supply of some much-needed surgical appliances, such as operating table, and a few urgently-required instruments.\n\nThese latter have now not only all been sanctioned, but supplied, and I have the gratification of being able to perform a few operations at my visits, which I trust will open up a new era of usefulness for this institution. A more highly qualified medical subordinate was much required for the charge of this institution, which has since been provided and will, I feel sure, materially enhance its popularity with the residents, and be also of great help to the Agency Surgeon in the work of popularizing European medical skill and treatment in this State, which, I fear, has dwindled to a low ebb, owing to the inferior class of subordinates hitherto employed, who, for want of inspection for years, had lapsed into a very retrograde condition. A few words about the present hospital building will not be out of place here, for exact details of which I must, however, refer the reader to the excellent plan attached.\n\nThe Sadar Dispensary is situated on a metalled road midway between the old city and the Nai Chhaoni, on a piece of ground at the junction of two roads, the main building being to the west and the subordinates' quarters, &c., on the opposite side of the road to the east, but facing the main building.\nThe hospital building consists of a central dispensary with two wards on the south aspect allotted to male patients, and those on the north to female patients, the verandahs of which are all protected from public view by erection of wire gauze screens. Accommodation is at present provided for 8 males and 4 females, but this is capable of extension, if necessity arises. At the extreme north, by itself, is the operating room, lately adapted and done up and provided with a supply of both hot and cold water from outside, thereby doing away with the necessity for the ingress of any insanitary menials, such as sweepers and bhishties! Attached to it is a small room provided with cupboards for storage of surgical instruments, the verandahs surrounding the operating room being provided with wire gauze screens to ensure privacy, as well as at the same time to provide for a free supply of fresh air during the performance of surgical operations.\n\nThe main building also contains, besides those above-mentioned, a medical store room, a dark room for ophthalmic examination purposes, &c., and a consulting room, as well as an office, the two latter communicating with the main building, many alterations having made it suitable for the purpose of a dispensary, that one would hardly know it to be the same building as originally arranged!\n\nRajakhera is situated about 28 miles to the north-west of Dholpur, and is connected therewith by a kutcha road. It is the head-quarters of a tehsil, and contains a police thana as well as a dispensary. This latter is a kutcha-pucca building, and has a ward or shed for in-patients and was opened in June 1871. It is unsuited to its purpose, and I have recommended, when funds permit, to have an entirely new building erected for a dispensary, with accommodation for in-patients, which is necessary owing to its long distance from the Sadar and the difficulty and at times even impossibility of transit of the connecting roads at certain seasons of the year.\n\nBari.\u2014A dispensary was opened here in June 1872, the delay occasioned being due to the fact that the services of a native doctor could not be obtained before. The town is situated about 19 miles due west of Dholpur. The dis-\npensary is located in a pucca building, formerly a private dwelling, with the usual courtyard, which renders it so dark as to be unsuitable for this purpose, I hope here, too, that later on a more suitable building, for the purposes of a dispensary may either be built or another one allotted.\n\nPurani Chhaoni.\u2014Owing to the distance of this place from Dholpur and for the convenience of the inhabitants, it was decided to open a small out-door relief dispensary here in the year 1899. The State Jail being located here, the Medical Subordinate in charge of it was also in charge of the dispensary, as owing to the light nature of his work he was capable of the discharging the dual duties. Since, however, the erection of the new State Prison in 1903 near the city of Dholpur, it was decided to close this dispensary.\nThe hospital building consists of a central dispensary with two wards on the south aspect allotted to male patients, and those on the north to female patients, the verandahs of which are all protected from public view by erection of wire gauze screens. Accommodation is at present provided for 8 males and 4 females, but this is capable of extension, if necessity arises.

of rainfall.\n\nRaingauges exist at the towns of Dholpur, Rajakhera, Bari, Baseri, and Kolari, the three former of which are under the superintendence of the Medical Subordinates stationed there, who record all observations and forward the same to the Agency Surgeon's Office monthly, and by which officer the instruments are yearly inspected. The average annual rainfall in this State is about 30 inches, but of late years this average has not been maintained, resulting in the recent famines of 1897 and 1900.\n\nAppended are tables showing the amounts registered at the recording stations of Dholpur, Rajakhera, and Bari, the gauges at the other stations named not being under the Medical department but under that of Revenue, the records of which are not available.\n| Months       | 1890 | 1891 | 1892 | 1893 | 1894 | 1895 | 1896 | 1897 | 1898 | 1899 | Total |\n|--------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|\n| January      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| February     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| March        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| April        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| May          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| June         |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| July         |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| August       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| September    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| October      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| November     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| December     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| Total        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n\nRainfall as recorded at the Sadar Dispensary, Dholpur, from 1890 to 1899.\n\nAverage:\n\n- Inches:\n  - January: 0.38\n  - February: 0.10\n  - March: 0.3\n  - April: 0.25\n  - May: 0.43\n  - June: 0.8\n  - July: 0.28\n  - August: 0.83\n  - September: 0.55\n  - October: 0.24\n  - November: 0.11\n  - December: 0.72\n\n- Cents:\n  - January: 0.38\n  - February: 0.10\n  - March: 0.3\n  - April: 0.25\n  - May: 0.43\n  - June: 0.8\n  - July: 0.28\n  - August: 0.83\n  - September: 0.55\n  - October: 0.24\n  - November: 0.11\n  - December: 0.72\n| Months       | Inches | Cents | Total |\n|--------------|--------|-------|-------|\n| January      |        |       |       |\n| February     |        |       |       |\n| March        |        |       |       |\n| April        |        |       |       |\n| May          |        |       |       |\n| June         |        |       |       |\n| July         |        |       |       |\n| August       |        |       |       |\n| September    |        |       |       |\n| October      |        |       |       |\n| November     |        |       |       |\n| December     |        |       |       |\n\n* No record is available for these years.\n| Months | 1890 | 1891 | 1892 | 1893 | 1894 | 1895 | 1896 | 1897 | 1898 | 1899 | Total |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|\n| January |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| February|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| March   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| April   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| May     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| June    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| July    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| August  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| September|     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| October |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| November|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| December|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n| Total   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |\n\n*No record is available for these years.*\nVACCINATION.\n\nVaccination operations were introduced into this State by Assistant Surgeon Harvey in 1869, the year in which he took over charge of the appointment of the Agency Surgeoncy of the Eastern Rajputana States. At the commencement the operations of the department seem to have met with a great deal of obstruction and resistance on the part of, not only the people generally, but from all accounts by the late reigning Chief's father. To accentuate this I may quote a few lines from reports made by Assistant Surgeon Harvey (Indian Medical Service) at the time, in which he says, \"great difficulty has been experienced in attempting to introduce vaccination, which has never been tried until this year. Their supplies of lymph failed in consequence of the Native doctor being unable, as he says, to use it for ten days after it reached him, and the result to the end of the year is as nil.\" In the year 1874, during the time of Assistant Surgeon Spencer, Indian Medical Service, who vaccinated the late Chief (Maharaj Rana Nihal Singh) when a child, vaccination seems to have begun to make progress in the State, as four Vaccinators, as well as a Native Superintendent of Vaccination for the whole State, were appointed to the department. Since then their number has been increased to six, which is a very fair percentage to the population existing, and the work should now improve. Vaccination is still very backward in this State, not due to lack of establishment, but of efficient supervision. It is hoped that with the recent appointment of an Agency Surgeon greater stimulus will be given to the work, with resulting increased popularity and credit, so as to be more on a par with the other two States in this Agency, whose records, especially those of the Bharatpur State, are far more creditable in this respect.\n| Season | Successful | Unsuccessful | Unknown | Total | Percentage of

Purana Chaoni. The buildings utilised for this purpose, however, were cramped, low, ill-ventilated and totally unsuited for the accommodation of prisoners, there being no facilities for exercising them, and resulting in an abnormally high mortality amongst the convicts, so that altogether the condition of this prison was by no means creditable to the State. At my urgent representation of the state of affairs to the Administration three years ago, during the time of the late Chief, it was decided to construct an entirely new prison on an approved site and upon the latest modern and hygienic principles. I was then requested to draw up a plan and project for the same, and with the skilled aid of the State Engineer this was speedily done, a good site selected, and at the present moment the Dholpur State possesses a prison for accommodation of its convicts which would do credit to the most enlightened administration, in fact I am sure in all its details it has no equal at any rate in this Province. It is located on a healthy raised site on the other side of the railway line to the south of the Agency residence, is provided with factories, printing press, hospital, women's ward and solitary cells, and an extensive outer enclosure in which a large garden has been laid out. This prison was completed for occupation in 1903. The old State prison at Purani Chaoni, as before mentioned, appears to have been instituted in the year 1874, but beyond this fact I have not been able to ascertain much or anything regarding its history. As is usual in State institutions of this kind, as large numbers of raj sepoys from different corps were employed in the maintenance of discipline and control over prisoners, their ideas of such were, however, crude, and in the new prison a properly trained guard of warders for both inner and outside duties has been enlisted, showing a very marked improvement already in every way in the management and behaviour of the convicts. This\nprison should shortly become a model institution of its kind, and besides affording plentiful and necessary employment for its inmates should ultimately prove a source of income to the State instead of, as heretofore, a dead loss.

This, however, includes Sir Muttra, which, though dependent on Dholpur, is self-administrative, having an area of 286 square miles, or 185,467 acres; of this area no figures are available.\n\nIn Dholpur itself the land is classified as follows:\n\n| Cultivated arable | ... | 256,985 acres. |\n|-------------------|-----|---------------|\n| Uncultivated arable | ... | 88,923 ,, |\n| Waste | ... | 234,862 ,, |\n| **Total** | ... | **580,770 acres.** |\n\nFrom these figures it will be seen that nearly half the State is waste land, consisting mostly of the range of hills in the south-west portion of the State, and the ravines bordering the Chambal and other rivers. This wasteland affords good grazing for cattle, and has some tanks for watering purposes, although no irrigation is done from them.\n\nThe total cultivated area amounts to 42\u00b78 per cent., and is classified as follows:\n\n| Irrigated by wells | ... | ... | 83,521 acres. |\n|--------------------|-----|-----|---------------|\n| Irrigated by tanks and other sources | ... | 8,443 ,, |\n| Unirrigated | ... | ... | 165,021 ,, |\n| **Total** | ... | **256,985 acres.** |\n\n(Irrigated from \"other sources\" includes beds of rivers, jhils, etc.)\n\nIrrigation by wells is rapidly increasing: the Zemindars sinking them at their own cost, being helped by the Durbar by means of \"Taccavi\" advances.\n\nOwing to financial difficulties, tank irrigation has not been much developed up to the present, but the Durbar is taking measures to push this as soon as the debt is paid off.\n\nThe tanks at present in existence are mostly old ones, which have been repaired and improved, and those constructed during the 1897 famine.\nEDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT.\n\n1.

It stretches for 40 miles along the left bank of the river Chambal, which flows in a northeasterly direction. From the southernmost point of the State the border line runs irregularly 28 miles to the north-west, and is partly formed by the river Morel. The line, still irregular and ill-defined, then turns to the north-east and runs nearly parallel to the southern boundary for 75 miles, and bending southwards, becoming more sinuous than ever, returns to the bank of the Chambal. Jaipur territory lies along the western and northern boundaries, except at the northernmost point, which Bharatpur touches, Dholpur is on the east, while Gwalior territory on the south is separated from Karauli by the Chambal. A topographical survey of the State on a scale of one inch to the mile has been completed, and the maps are available.\n\nHills and broken ground characterize almost the whole country. Most of the tract in which it lies is locally termed the \"Dang,\" being the name given to the rugged region which lies above the narrow valley of the Chambal, and par excellence that part which lies nearest the valley.\n\nThe most prominent and continuous hills in the State are those on the northern border, where several ranges exist, running along parallel to the frontier line for a few miles uninterruptedly and form formidable barriers; but there are no high peaks, the highest being less than 1,400 feet above the level of the sea. There is little beauty in these hills, but the military advantages they present caused the selection of one of their eminences as the seat of Jadon rule in times past.\n\n*This computation is a third less than the area of the State has hitherto been reckoned. The boundary line in the maps of the Topographical Survey is not quite complete, but it is sufficiently so for an approximate measurement of the area, and the figures given have been raised on such a measurement.*\nAlong the valley of the Chambal an irregular and lofty wall of rock separates the lands on the river bank from the uplands, of which, the border of the river excepted, the southern part of the State consists. From the summits of the passes to the high ground, fine views are often obtainable, for the rocks stand out in striking contrast to the comparatively rich and undulating plain below, through which flows the winding and glittering river. For some miles the country north of these passes is high and too rocky to be much cut up into ravines, or to be pierced for water, and the few inhabitants have to depend upon tanks and dams for water, but further north the country is lower lying, the alluvial deposit is deeper, level ground is more frequent, and hills stand out more markedly, while in the vicinity of the city of Karauli, the low ground is cut up into labyrinths of ravines, which though often during the rains converted by jessamines, spider worts and cucurbitaceous plants into pretty lanes, are usually most monotonous and wearying to a traveller.\n\nIn the rocky country where streams falling over rocks occasionally wear their way until deep and broad ravines are formed, with a soil composed of the detritus, pleasing spots are often found, the natural attractions of which are increased in the eyes of the neighbouring population by temples and tanks.\n\nRivers.\u2014The river Chambal, sometimes deep and slow, sometimes too rocky and rapid to admit of the safe passage of a boat, receives during the rains numerous contributions to its volume from Karauli; but no considerable perennial stream flows into it within the boundaries of this State. The short nala from the neighbouring hills are locally called \"Sauts,\" and become dry as soon as the rains are over. None are deserving of special mention. The Banas and Morel rivers belong more properly to Jaipur than to Karauli. The Panchana is the only river which rises in Karauli and does not flow into the Chambal. It is so called from its being formed of five streams which unite two miles north of the city. All these five rivulets rise in Karauli territory, and all but one do not cease to flow in dry weather, though often but a few inches in depth and never navigable. That most useful and important to the city is called the Badraoti. It winds up from the south,\nand flows past the two eastern gates of the town, and about two miles north of it receives the Machi from the north-east. A few hundred yards beyond it unites with the Barkhera, which, within the last two miles of its course, receives the Rampur Nadi from the west, and from the south the Mendkhi, a mere rain drain, which flows past the Gur gate of the city, and the bed of which is famous for its limestone.\n\nThe Panchana winds away to the north and joins the Banganga. The Kalisar or Danger and the Jerota Nadi drain the country to the south-west of the city. Both are insignificant streams, dry or nearly so during the greater part of the year. They flow into the Morel or the Jaipur border.\n\nThe sub-surface water throughout the territory is for the most part good; that of the tanks in the high rocky country above the passes to the valley of the Chambal, becomes unwholesome in the hot weather, and the inhabitants with their cattle are often driven down into the valleys, where abundance of sweet water exists throughout the year. Wells also in some parts afford the source of supply, which is usually of good quality and easily obtainable.\n\nMATERIAL CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE.\n\nThe Thakurs, or aristocracy of the State, are as a rule poor, though there are a very few exceptions. Nor are there believed to be amongst the Mahajans any extremely rich men. However, in the city half-a-dozen houses may perhaps be found who are possessed of as much as from 10,000 to a lakh of rupees. These are, with few exceptions, Saraogis and Aggarwalas. Money is constantly flowing into the city in consequence of the officials living there, who are in a position to make and to spend it. In several of the villages, Moholi and Kursai of the Huzur tehsil, Naroli, Jerota and Machilpur, for instance, there are one or two officials, or Brahman or Nandwani traders who are said to be wealthy, and Patwaris or village accountants of four or five villages are reputed to be men of substance. Every well-to-do trader lives in a masonry house built\nexternally with the fine sandstone slabs described elsewhere. These face the walls and cover the roofs. Their inmates lead a simple life, varied by an occasional \"picnic\" (g\u00f4t) in favourable weather to some pleasing spot in the neighbourhood, where dancing and singing men and women attend to amuse the pleasure-seekers, or perhaps they join a party of Thakurs, who sit shooting at a dead mark, and with whom there is genial intercourse, notwithstanding that the refreshments have to be kept separate. Sometimes they refresh themselves by an evening stroll with a party of friends to visit some saint in a neighbouring ravine, whose austerities have excited interest. The petty traders and heads of villages, and a few other agriculturists in most villages, may be said to possess a competence.\n\nThe heads of the villages live well, eating three meals a day, in which milk and ghee, especially in the case of Gujars, are largely consumed. A Gujar headman begins the day by swallowing a pound of butter-milk (dahi). At 12 o'clock he makes his chief meal, consuming a pound and a half of flour, some vegetables, and half a pound of ghee. In the evening he eats a little bread and takes a little more ghee, or perhaps takes the ghee alone. A Mina headman has not the same appetite for ghee, and at his principal meal in the middle of the day probably substitutes d\u00e2l for it, and in the evening will eat butter-milk porridge (rabri) or some meat, unless he has sworn not to eat meat. None would think of killing or eating the sacred animal of Karauli\u2014the sheep. In the Dang the abundance of cattle and goats enables the people generally to live well, and the scale of diet above-mentioned would ordinarily apply to many others besides headmen. The poorest classes depend to an extent little known upon wild grass seed. The \"bharut,\" so plentiful and valuable to the poor in the sandy tract to the north-west, is not abundant in Karauli, but \"Makra\" and \"Sawak,\" especially the latter, is collected in maunds; a household will sometimes collect and store as much as six maunds after the rains. The abodes of the poor are, where stone is plentiful, of that material, the roof being formed of slabs as described elsewhere. This is preferred to thatch, as being safer from fire and needing fewer repairs.\nThe following table shows the population as estimated at the Census of 1901:\n\n| Tehsils          | No. of Villages | Area in Square Miles | Number of Houses | Male | Female | Total Population |\n|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|------|--------|-----------------|\n| Huzur Tehsil     | 127             |                      |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Jerota           | 80              |                      |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Mahilpur         | 84              |                      |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Mandrail         | 68              |                      |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Udgir            | 86              |                      |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Town of Karauli  | 1               |                      |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Total            |                 |                      |                  |      |        |                 |\n\n| Sexes            |                |                    |                  |      |        |                 |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------|--------|-----------------|\n| Male             |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Female           |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Total            |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n\n| Religion         |                |                    |                  |      |        |                 |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------|--------|-----------------|\n| Muslims          |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Jains            |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Christians       |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Total            |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n\n| District         |                |                    |                  |      |        |                 |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------|--------|-----------------|\n| Karauli          |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\n| Total            |                |                     |                  |      |        |                 |\nRELIGION.\n\nThe worship of Sri Krishna, in various forms, is naturally the prevalent religion of Karauli, the aristocracy of which believe themselves to be descended from that deity. Accordingly we find 300 temples of Vishnu in the form of Sri Krishna throughout the State, and only 20 or thereabouts to Siva and eight to Devi. The red figures of Balaji or Hanuman are common enough at the corners of streets or under trees, and the other deities are not altogether neglected.\n\nCHIEF TOWNS.\n\nKarauli, the capital of this State, has a population of 28,000. It is surrounded with a red stone wall, and contains the Palace of the Maharajah.\n\nMachilpur, 16 miles north-east of the city, has a population of 1,935. It is chiefly noted for its betel-leaf cultivation, and possesses a branch Dispensary.\n\nMandrail, 20 miles south-east of the city, is best known for its Fort. It has a population of 2,825, and possesses a branch Dispensary.\n\nNaroli, 30 miles south-west of the city, has a population of 1,953.\n\nSapotra, in Jerota Tehsil, has a population of 1,576, and possesses a branch Dispensary.\n\nCITY OF KARAOULI.\n\nThe city of Karauli is nearly equidistant, i.e., 70 miles from Mattra, Gwalior, Agra, Alwar, Jaipur, and Tonk. It is said to have derived its name from Kalianji, a temple built by Arjun Deo, who likewise founded the city, Sambat 1405 (A.D. 1348); but it did not prosper owing to the depredations of a class of Minas until these were put down by Raja Gopal Dass, in whose time Karauli became a considerable town, and fine buildings began to spring up. It has now a population of 28,000, and viewed from some points, whence the Palace is seen to advantage, has a strik-\ning appearance. The city, which is surrounded by a wall of sandstone, is also protected on the north and east by the remarkable ravines of which I have written. These, if defended by men who know them well, would form an obstacle such as would probably prove insuperable to any unscientific invaders. To the south and west the ground is comparatively level, but advantage has skilfully been taken of a conveniently-situated nallah to form a moat for the city, while an outer wall and ditch defended by bastions has been carried along the other bank, so forming the double line of defence. These fortifications are due to Raja Gopal Dass, and though too much for the desultory attacks of the Marhattas, would be far less formidable to regular troops than were the mud walls of Bharatpur. The sandstone wall of Karauli, in spite of its handsome appearance, is unsubstantially built, being composed of ill-cemented stones, faced by thin slabs after the fashion which prevails throughout the State, wherever sandstone is abundant and buildings of any pretension are erected. The distance round is something under $2\\frac{1}{4}$ miles, and there are six gates besides eleven posterns, all of which are clearly shown in the map of the city of Karauli prepared by the Government Survey Department. Brahmans and Mahajans are the only numerous classes. The streets of Karauli are narrow and irregular, impossible for carriages, and difficult for any wheeled conveyance. To a new comer the most striking characteristic is the superabundance of sandstone, of which the poorest constructs his dwelling-place without the aid of thatch. The roofs of the poorer houses are formed of slabs, sloping and overlapping one another very roughly, but not ineffectively arranged and supported by logs of wood or long triangular pieces of stone. The principal bazar stretches east from the westernmost gate towards the Palace, and is about half a mile in length; it is irregular and ill-paved, and altogether wanting in neatness. There is no better street, but many fine and costly houses and handsome temples.\n\nThe Palace is about 200 yards from the eastern wall of the city, and occupies a space of about 150 yards square. It was founded by Arjun Deo, but little or nothing of the original building can now be traced. Within the \"Raola,\" or residence of the ladies, however, a \"Khirni\" and \"Imli\"\ntree still exist, which are said to have been part of Arjun Deo's Palace garden. The Palace in its present state was erected by Raja Gopal Dass, who adopted the Delhi style of architecture, with which his residence in the imperial city had made him acquainted. The abundance of red sandstone similar to that of Delhi rendered imitation easy. The whole block of buildings is surrounded by a lofty bastioned wall, in which there are five gates. One, called the \"Bich Darwaza,\" is beautifully sculptured, but has been lamentably disfigured by paints. The flowers cut on it are evidently by an Agra artist. Over this gate is an elegant triple \"Chhatri\" or pavilion. Within the Palace painting has been applied more successfully, and the \"Rang Mahal\" and \"Dewani Am,\" with their mirrors and bright colours, are beautiful specimens of their kind. Indeed, Colonel Keatinge, Governor-General's Agent, spoke of the Palace as \"in some respects the finest building of the sort\" he had seen in India.\n\nIt may be useful to note the names of the principal streets and quarters, although they are not marked on the city map, but it would be easy to enter them, and the record might prove useful. There are \"Tin Nimri-ka-Bazar,\" where \"Sarrafis\" or pawnbrokers, bankers, and money-lenders live; \"Anaj Mandi,\" or grain market; \"Phutai Darwaza-ka-Bazar,\" so called from a ruin which is a relic of Raja Arjun Pal and five hundred years old (Pathans chiefly dwell here); \"Chalikna Bazar,\" which is occupied chiefly by sadus, Brahmans, and banias; \"Parrasa mahalla,\" where Brahmans predominate; \"Jat-ki-Jori,\" where, however, scarcely any Jats live; \"Kayathpura,\" which is Shah Inayat's Khirki or postern, and is occupied by Kayasths; \"Chaudripura\" and \"Gosainpura,\" where the hereditary chaudris of the Durbar and Gosains respectively reside; \"Tamba-ki-Tari,\" Brahman quarters mostly; \"Chobepura,\" occupied by Brahmans; \"Doli Khat\" and \"Kuwa Kor,\" where Musalmans and low-caste people dwell.\n\nJerota Tehsil or Collectorate.\n\nThe Jerota Tehsil lies west of Karauli. It is chiefly\nformed of the estates of the great Thakurs descended from Chiefs of Karauli. The people of the district are locally termed \"Pakrata,\" but I have not been able to trace the origin of the term. It is very hilly and rocky. Minas are the principal tillers of the soil, but Brahmans and baniyas cultivate to some extent. The poor Rajputs depend much upon Raj service. The depth of wells varies very much; in some villages it is as much as 60 cubits, in others not more than 20. The population is about 24,000.\n\nThis town of Jerota, if it may be termed such, consists of 300 houses, a bazar of about 15 shops, and is the headquarters of a tehsil, and contains also a thana, and is situated 28 miles south-west of Karauli city. Here, as in the Huzur Tehsil villages, the Lodhis formerly owned the land, but Minas supplanted them four hundred years ago. Water is to be found from 30 to 45 feet from the surface.\n\nA considerable Raj Fort is here garrisoned by 50 men, Sapotra, Jerota and possesses a good water tank. It is seven miles east of Jerota. This is one of the largest and most prosperous villages in the tehsil, having 400 houses; the poorer ones often have the \"pathor\" roof of \"chura\" or yellow sandstone. Havelis, or houses entirely of masonry, are many. There are 50 shops in the bazar and a weekly market. Chhipis, or cloth printers, are numerous, and gunpowder is manufactured here by Jogis and exported to Kotah and Bundi; water is 25 cubits from the surface; Minas hold the Zamindari; the fort was built 200 years back by Ude Pal, son of Ratan Pal, and till about 75 years ago, the village, which up to that period had remained in the hands of his descendants, was escheated to the Raja as lord paramount. A branch Dispensary exists here also.\n\nThese villages adjoin one another; they have iron smelting furnaces to which the Hindaun ore is brought as it is to Langara, in consequence of the abundance of fuel. A mile south of Gurda there is a temple of Devi situated near a spring, and beside the pathway between Karauli and Sir Mattrra. On Bhadon Sudi 5th there is a Fair held here, which is sometimes attended by the Maharajah. Maharajah Partab Pal invariably went, it is said. Berdha is said to be the oldest village in the Dang.\nMACHILPUR TEHSIL OR COLLECTORATE.\n\nThis lies to the north-east of the city of Karauli. It has two pergunnahs: the first, called Chaurasi, contains 86 parent villages and 81 hamlets, or 167 in all; the second, Sairni, which lies on the Dholpur border, has but eight. The population is about 254,200. When held by the Mohamedans the first pergunnah was considered a district of 84 villages and got the name Chaurasa, a favorite number with the Musalmans. It was granted to Raja Gopal Dass by the Emperor Akbar for his services in the Dakhan, and for laying the foundation of the Agra Fort, and Gopal Dass thus recovered the territory which had been lost by his ancestor five hundred years before. In A.D. 1812 Dundai Khan and Ranmast Khan, of the family now represented by Nawab Faizali Khan, a late minister of Jaipur, plundered Machilpur. In those days, the people say, the district was visited by marauding bands every six months. For some twenty years previous to the treaty between Karauli and the British Government in A.D. 1817 the Marhattas under Scindia held Machilpur and twelve other villages of the pergunnah as security for tribute (nalbandi) imposed. The principal land-holders of the district were formerly the Gonj Thakurs who abandoned their chief, Kawar Pal, after his expulsion from Tamangarh in the 12th century, and accepted the yoke of the Musalmans in order to retain their own lands. They were driven out in their turn by Maharajah Gopal Dass, and now have no \"bapoti.\" The district has but one valley of any width, and speaking generally that lies between the chain of hills on which Fatehpur is situated, and which marks the north-western border of Karauli and the hills from two to five miles east of it, which sometimes form short parallel ranges and sometimes are spurs of irregular ranges. This valley is far from being interrupted, and the rest of the district is very hilly and rocky. At many points the altitude of the hills is between 1,000 and 1,300 feet. Gujars hold the Zamindari of most of the villages, but Minas have many; Jats one. Machilpur used to have one hereditary official of position called a \"Pardhan,\" who discharged the duties of a Kanungo, or accountant, and received Rs. 250 a year.\nA town of more than 1,000 houses and a bazar of 60 shops; but 20 of them are unoccupied at present. It is sixteen miles north-east of Karauli. There are 20 temples, 19 of them Vishnu and one Shiva, and a pandit named Chatr Dass Bairagi had a reputation for Sanskrit learning. Good houses of masonry are numerous and belong to the Borars and banias, who in Machilpur form a large class, and some of whom are well off, though none very wealthy. Of the other classes two or three may be especially mentioned, namely the 15 old Musalman families who were called \"Kasbati\" (or especially belonging to the town), and were employed as tehsil sepoys and measurers of land, for which they got a monthly lump sum of Rs. 26, and the 140 families of \"barahis\" or \"tambolis,\" who cultivate and sell betel. The betel vine gardens are called \"barejas,\" and are numerous. Forty tanks have been dug to supply them with water, and the trade in betel is considerable. In the barejas some excellent vegetables are produced, such as magnificent yams, \"palwals, kanduras.\" The barejas are described under \"Agriculture.\" The neighbourhood of Machilpur is very rocky. The valuable red sandstone abounds, and all the houses are consequently built of stone. Elegant little arcades are commonly seen, and how little costly they are may be judged of from the fact that the total cost of the prepared materials for the common-toothed arch, six feet three inches high and seven feet wide, is, including some simple ornament, but three rupees. There are many old buildings in and near the town. Amongst them may be noticed the ruins of Maharajah Gopal Dass' Palace, with a garden attached. Near the Palace is a temple of Mahadeo, with a pyramidal dome, and a Madan Mohan temple of the same period. A twelve-pillared tomb of the Pathan period stands on a little hill north of the town, and there is another tomb reverenced by the Saiyads. A mile north is an old well called \"Chor-ki-Baoli,\" a favourite rendezvous for thieves. Temples are many and north of the town; there are several gardens, one of which is called the \"Dakhinis' Gardens,\" having been made by the Marhattas when they held possession of Machilpur. \"Keora or screw-pine trees, from which the rich Durbar perfume is made, grow in the gardens. In the tank singharas grow, and fish abound. The latter\nare easily caught with a rod and line. Tamarind, bair, and mango trees are plentiful. They are the property of the State, and their fruit is sold by contract. Minas are the proprietors. Water is but 20 cubits from the surface, and there is fine wheat land near the town paying Rs. 5 a bigha to the State, or about Rs. 14 an acre. A branch Dispensary exists here also.\n\nOn the Karauli and Machilpur road, about six miles from the former, is the village of Chainpur; it is a Hari Dass Thakur village of some size and note, for there are more than 200 houses in it and seven bunias' shops. Much hemp is produced here, and \"tat\" manufactured. On the high ground above the village stands the Thakurs' Fort, and in the village is a fine handsome well built by Thakur Samir Singh about thirty years ago. Water is from 40 to 45 cubits below the surface. \"Thakurs Chhatris\" stand in two gardens near the village. Iron is smelted from ore brought from Hindaun, where wood is scarce. The Raj grass and game preserve of Ata adjoins this village, and the shooting tower is within its boundary.\n\nA place of much interest already mentioned in the historical section as having been founded by Maharajah Jaman Pal, who here established himself after the expulsion of his family from Biana. The fort stands on a hill difficult of approach, but it and all the old buildings are now in ruins. A gate called the Jagan Pal is the most complete portion of the remains. Near it is a mosque and dargah, and there are traces of many other tombs and mosques, but they are now the haunts of panthers and of a solitary Hindu hermit of the Sat Nath order. A large tank covered with singharas and abounding in fish and wild fowl lies below the fort. A stream from this piece of water irrigates the village of Bhojpura, and joins the Jambura Nala mentioned above. On Jeth Sudi 10th (June) a Fair takes place on the banks of the tank, and 10,000 people assemble there usually.\n\nLittle trading is done, the business of the day being to bathe in the tank. A good road now passes through this tehsil into Bharatpur territory, via Bajna, connecting up the two States.\nUtgirh Collectorate or Tehsil.\n\nThis district occupies the south-west corner of the State, but villages belonging to it are within three miles of the city of Karauli. It comprises 94 parent villages and 32 hamlets, and has about 9,690 inhabitants. Its two normal divisions are, as in Mandrail, the tract above the \"ground scarp,\" and the tract below it upon the banks of the Chambal. The country was anciently held by Lodhis, who probably paid tribute to the Imperial officials at Mandrail and Utgirh. \"Bands\" and tanks still exist which are attributed to them, though they have ceased to hold the land for four hundred years. It is rumoured that treasure has often been dug up in their old haunts, though special search for it has produced nothing but disappointment. Raja Arjun Deo, about A.D. 1340, is said to have brought the Dang under his authority, and to have exacted a land revenue from the Lodhis, whose expulsion he commenced; but the present Zamindars say that they derived their title from Maharajah Gopal Dass, and there is little doubt that previous to the time of the latter, the authority of the Jadon Raja was weak and precarious. Now Gujars predominate in the Dang, Minas in the valley below. In the Dang wells are impossible, but by means of \"bands\" built across drainage lines, where two or three feet of earth lie upon the rock, crops are produced. In the hot weather but few tanks retain any water, and the struggle for what remains often leads to bloody affrays. In unusually dry seasons the people have to retreat with their cattle to the banks of the Chambal, but the unhappy wild animals, deprived of their usual supply of water, and ignorant where to search for more, perish by hundreds on the banks of the tanks they have been accustomed to frequent. Nor as regards water are the villages of the lower ground altogether well off. Near the \"sauts,\" or short water courses, which form deep ravines, and carry off drainage of the hills, water is indeed found at a depth of 20 or 25 cubits, but in other places, even on the river banks, wells have to be sunk to a depth of 70 or 80 cubits, and often access to water at all is barred by rocks. In dry weather the residents of some villages situated at a distance of two miles from the Chambal\nhave to procure their water supply from the river, which, however, is not accounted wholesome. Dropsy is a common disease at some points on the river bank. It is locally attributed to the deep holes of stagnant water which have a thin surface of running water, and which receive and retain all kinds of impurities! In the same way the water of the tanks is often pernicious; the sepoys in the fort, it is said, suffer from guinea-worm from this source. The ground, however, is generally rich and good, crops are raised, but except on the very verge of the water, fertility, such as that of the British districts on the great rivers to the east, is never met with. Tigers, bears and other large animals abound amid the thick brushwood which covers the glens and passes, where the \"dan\" and \"chabeni\" shrubs are the most abundant, but trees of all the common kinds are met with. The fort of Utgirh is the most remarkable place in the district; it forms a striking object in the view of the traveller many miles lower down the Chambal, and it has been looked upon as a safe retreat to which the Karauli Chief might securely send his treasure and his family in times of peril. There is not a single place deserving of being called a town throughout the whole tract, and no villages have three hundred houses, while in the Dang they often do not contain more than three or four. Where the sandstone is abundant, it of course forms the entire material for the houses; where it is wanting, unmortared stones form the walls; and the roof consists of \"dhak\" leaves pressed between poles fastened together; more artistic thatching is hardly ever resorted to. There are five Ghats over the Chambal, within the limits of the Utgirh Tehsil\u2014Gota, Gusai, Toda, Siwara, Kaseru.\n\nMandrail Tehsil or Collectorate.\n\nThis division is situated south of Karauli. It has 65 villages and 74 hamlets, or 139 in all. There are two talukas, the \"Tarrara\" and the \"Dang.\" The population is about 19,665.\nThe first of these two divisions lies along the Chambal, what Mr. Hacket terms \"the grand scarp\" on the left bank of that river. It is undulating or broken by the beds of nalas, and water is often too far below the surface for practical use. The bed of the river is, in the cold weather, cultivated down to the water's edge, so that an emerald fringe marks the course of the stream. The two most remarkable \"khos\" or glens, which open on to the Tarrara are those of Ninda and Ghotoli; a small stream runs down each, and there is fine cover for large game\u2014bears, tigers, panthers, &c., which abound. These glens are Raj preserves, and the grass is the property of the State.\n\nThe \"Dang\" taluka comprises the elevated country above the scarp, and extends northwards to within 5 miles of the city of Karauli. The people are entirely dependent on tanks for water, and cultivation is scanty. All the villages of the pergunnah are Mina, with the exception of two, which are Gujars. Cattle abound, and even in the Tarrara fodder is so abundant that the stalks of the jawar are often left after the heads have been cut.\n\nFamous chiefly for its large old fort described elsewhere. This was the first important stronghold acquired in modern times by the Karauli family; but it is said to have been originally built in pre-historic times by a Jadon.\n\nThe town contains 1,000 houses and 70 shops; about 40 families of Musalmans, chiefly in the service of the Durbar, live in Mandrail. Boras and baniyas prosper here, especially the latter. They have a trade with Sambhar in salt, which they export, cloth goods from Agra, and ghee, across the Chambal to Sabalgarh and Shopur Baroda. Brahmins have the Zamindari, and have held it for more than a century; formerly it was in the possession of Minas.\n\nWater is 70 cubits below the surface, and in the hot weather there is often difficulty about drinking water, which is sometimes brought from the Chambal, 2\u00bd miles off.\n\nThe land consequently produces only one crop of grain regularly, the rain or kharif, but one is good. Gram is\nsometimes raised in the rabi. The principal officials who live here are a Tehsildar, Killadar, a Kotwal and Customs official and a Medical subordinate. The notable buildings are a rampart round the town, built by Maharajah Harbaksh Pal, a Dargah of a Mohamedan relation, Bahadurji (who after his perversion became a saint of repute), a Chhattari, temples and two tombs. On the hill which rises from the plain about 1,500 yards west of the fort, is another Dargah called \"Mardan Ghaib.\" A branch Dispensary exists here also.\n\nAdjoining the town is the village of Rampura, where lives a Thakur and a bania of some note. It is considered distinct from Mandrail, but in the estimate of houses in the town those of Rampura are included.\n\n**Approximate Income and Expenditure of Karauli State by Average of Five Years, from Sambat 1952.**\n\n| Income | Expenditure |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Principal Heads.** | **Amount.** | **Principal Heads.** | **Amount.** |\n| Rs.

Some records, however, do exist, but are scant and quite unreliable, and in some instances are altogether absent, so that it is difficult to trace the history of this important department back to any very remote date. No proper \"jamabandi,\" or rent roll, of past periods is forthcoming. Land appears to have never been properly measured, and different varieties of \"bighas\" obtained in different parts of the same State! There existed no accurate records of \"muafi\" lands, nor of any new land brought under cultivation, and owing to such circumstances as well as the want of maps and survey records, the State has fared badly in the settlement of boundary disputes with neighbouring States from time to time.\n\nAs a result of the above-mentioned state of affairs the condition of the ryots became deplorable, and with a system of ever-shifting rents, they received no incentive for improvement of their holdings. To put an end to this state of affairs, the present Ruler was persuaded into introducing a Revenue Settlement for his State; accordingly, one Assistant Settlement officer, one Sadar Munsarim, &c., with a full staff of Ameens, under control of the Deputy Collector, subject to direct supervision by the State Council, were thereupon appointed, and operations were commenced in January 1891.\n\nIn this way regular Settlement work in this State commenced, and continued with steady progress for four or five years, till the close of the year 1895-1896, when the ardour of the Chief unfortunately cooled in the matter, and in place of regular Settlement operations, only surveying and mapping of villages were kept up, the establishment being simultaneously likewise reduced to the lowest working margin possible, only one officer and two or three surveyors being kept on, who carried on the work in a leisurely fashion till the close of the year 1902, when it was ultimately put a stop to, and all operations in this connection ceased.\n\nFrom the above history of the Settlement in this State, it will be evident that there has never been any regular\nor complete revenue Settlement, and that although such was taken up at one time in real earnest, it was unfortunately never carried through to a successful conclusion.\n\nUp to the end of the Sambat year 1955 (A.D. 1899) the \"ryotwari\" system prevailed in this State, as will be mentioned later on, in which assessments were made directly with the ryots of each village through Tehsildars. At the close of the year 1899 the system of collecting revenue directly from the ryots was changed, and the \"Lumberdari\" system or farming out of revenue under contracts to headmen of villages was introduced shortly afterwards, under which system contracts were given for periods of five years to Lumberdars. This latter system was not altogether an innovation, for it was in vogue in this State during the early eighties, when the administration was carried on under the supervision of the Political Officer. When, however, the present Ruler was invested with full administrative powers in 1899, the old method of collecting the revenue directly from the ryots was revived. The recent change in the system of revenue collection above alluded to was introduced with a view to ascertain whether such could be permanently adopted. The revenue accruing from the above-mentioned quinquennial contract at a fixed assessment amounted to about three lakhs of rupees, but the actual collections, it appears, never quite reached that figure. This quinquennial contract, however, ceased at the close of the last financial year, and the State has now entered into a decennial one, which gives an amount slightly less even than the last, so that on comparing the two there is clear indication of a fall in the total revenue of the State. The reason for such is not, I think, difficult to find.\n\nDuring the first year of the quinquennial contract the period was marked by the occurrence of the greatest calamity to which any State can fall a victim, viz., famine, which pressed severely, especially upon two Tehsils in this State, viz., Mandrail and Utgirh, these practically comprising the \"Dang\" area of the country. The people in these parts suffered greatly, not, however, so much actually for want of food grains as they did from a water famine. From facts previously mentioned under section Geography, it will be noted that the physical features and configuration of\nthis part of the country are chiefly rocky hills and nallahs, where wells and tanks too are by no means numerous, and consequently owing to defective rainfall the distress was more acute here than in other parts of the State, resulting in extensive migration of its inhabitants across the Chambal into Gwalior territory. Many of the villages in the Utgirh Tehsil especially have thus been entirely deserted, and the cultivators have not as yet returned to their old homes. For the above reasons the agricultural population of these two Tehsils have not hitherto shown much indication of recuperation from the baneful effects of the period alluded to, and this factor has undoubtedly tended, in great measure, towards reducing the revenue of this State, which during recent years, instead of showing signs of expansion, has evidently diminished!\n\nThere was till the above-mentioned period no attempt at any real Settlement in Karauli State, the assessments being annually made by the Tehsildar, the village headman and the village \"shena.\"\n\nThe office of headman, giving the holder or joint-holders, as it did, a part in fixing the annual assessment, as well as the duty and responsibility of collecting the land revenue with their attendant powers, was much coveted, and in many respects placed the possessor in the position of the landlord of the village. Amongst Minas and Gujars the headmen are called \"Mihtars,\" amongst Jats \"Chaudhris.\" In both fiscal and rent-free villages they got two per cent. on the revenue and a turban.\n\nThe \"shena\" is the paid servant and representative of the Durbar in the villages, all of which, except the smallest, have one of these functionaries.\n\nExcept in the Sairi taluka of Machilpur where the \"Kanungo,\" or pergunnah accountant, kept the village accounts, a \"patwari\" was connected with all the villages. He got one per cent. on the collections, and this allowance, called \"dami,\" being insufficient for his maintenance he was usually a \"bania\" glad to supplement the income of his business. In two villages of Utgirh and one of Machilpur Gujars were \"patwaris,\" and\nhere and there a Mina \"patwari\" was to be met with. \"Patwaris\" sometimes got rewards from the Durbar for furthering the increase of the revenue.\n\nIn the month of Asarh (June) the headman and \"shena\" of a village determined what the revenue should be, after which they went to the Tehsildar, who came to convenient spots for communicating with surrounding villages, and usually confirmed the proposed assessments, and granted \"parwanas,\" or deeds, which practically were subject to modification in Kartik (October), when the Tehsildar visited the villages to observe the state of the crops. When grain was cheap the revenue was exacted in money at crop rates, but when grain was dear, \"butai,\" or share in the crop, was taken, and it was always taken on the \"burda,\" or alluvial land, on the verge of the Chambal. This share varied from a fourth to a half, and it was usually collected in kind, but its value was exacted at market price. The \"Kists,\" or instalments of the revenue, were collected usually in the month of Kartik and Chet (October and March).\nADMINISTRATION OF KARAUli STATE DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS.\n\nMaharajah Narsing Pal died in 1852 without an heir, so the question arose whether the State was to be considered to have lapsed to the British Government, there being no heir to the Gaddi, or it should be given to either of the rival claimants, Bharat Pal and Madan Pal, who were not direct heirs to the deceased Prince. This question was debated in the Council of the Governor-General, and finally it was decided to appoint Maharajah Madan Pal as Ruler of Karauli.\n\nThus in 1854, Sir Henry Lawrence brought Maharajah Madan Pal from Jaipur and installed him on the Karauli Gaddi. He ruled over this State for fifteen years and died on 17th August 1869. He left no sons; only one daughter survived him.\n\nMaharajah Lachhman Pal succeeded him, but he survived only a few weeks, after which Maharajah Jai Singh Pal succeeded. This Prince ruled over the State for nearly five years, and died in 1875.\n\nHe was succeeded by Maharajah Arjun Pal, who was called upon to rule this State when he was over fifty. He died in August 1886. His nephew and adopted son, Maharaja Bhanwar Pal, the present Ruler, then succeeded him.\n\nMethod of Administration.\u2014Though a Council was appointed in the time of Maharajah Madan Pal, yet it was only in name. To a great extent Maharajah Madan Pal was his own Minister. The rule was entirely arbitrary. Diwans, too, were every now and then appointed and were changed several times during his reign. The following are the names of some of the prominent Diwans of his time:\n\n- Ballu Ram held office for some years under Maharajah Madan Pal, who eventually disgraced him for his collusion with the Dakaits.\n- Pardhan Sita Ram succeeded Ballu Ram for a time. His family is known here as the hereditary \"Kanungoes\" or accountants. However, he failed to satisfy Maharajah Madan Pal, who threw him into prison for some time.\nHe was succeeded by Thakur Brighbhan Singh, who had little real authority. He only kept the seals of State. He gave his daughters in marriage to the Maharajah Madan Pal.\n\nBaldeo, son of Sewa Ram, was in high favour, and was constantly about the person of the Maharajah, but he never acted as Diwan. Bihari, Diwan, succeeded his father Baldeo after the death of the latter and held the title and acted as such during the time of the Maharajah Arjun Pal. Much confusion arose during the late reign, and the Administration of the State was taken over by the Political Agent who reconstituted a new Council and appointed five members in January 1882.\n\nSince that date the administration of this State has been carried on by a Council consisting of five members, and after the death of Diwan Bihari Singh, which took place in 1889, no one has acted as Diwan in this State.\n\nFISCAL DIVISIONS.\n\nThe fiscal divisions are as follows:\n\n| Division          | Rs.   |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Karauli or Huzur Tehsil, land revenue about | 44,000 |\n| Chief villages    | Kurgoan. |\n| Utgirh, land revenue about | 57,000 |\n| Chief village     | Bhadurpur. |\n| Machilpur, land revenue about | 90,000 |\n| Chief villages    | Mozah Baori. |\n| Mandrail, land revenue about | 79,000 |\n| Chief villages    | Ninda. |\n| Jerota, land revenue about | 43,000 |\n| Chief villages    | Naroli. |\n|                   | Hadoti. |\n|                   | Amargarh. |\n|                   | Sapotra. |\n\nTotal ... 3,13,000\n\nThe exact areas cannot be stated. For the names, number, and population of villages of each tehsil see page 343.\nARMY.\n\nThe Karauli forces organized in their present form by the late Maharajah Madan Pal, amount to 250 Cavalry and 1,500 Infantry, and 32 Artillery, with about 40 light guns, none of which are probably fit for much use. They are only fired a few times once or twice a year.\n\nThe peculiarity of the Karauli force is that it is composed for the most part of natives of Karauli. A large proportion are Jadons, especially in the risalas. Of the others the most remarkable class are the Pathans. The mounted portion of them are the remains of the Trans-Chambal Pathans, whose lot was cast with Imam-ud-din of Nurabad and his successors (vide chapter on Official Classes). But the Pathans of the Gol have by their own account another history. Their ancestors wore of the Emperor Alla-ud-din\u2019s army, which took Ranthambhor in A.D. 1290. After its fall Cantonments were established at Kurgaon and Jerota under the Subah of Madhopur. These remained till the anarchical period of Mohammad Shah, when Maharajah Kawar Pal of Karauli brought over the Pathans, who are now in the service of the Durbar or the Thakurs, or otherwise established in the city. The \u201cGol\u201d is looked upon as the most reliable portion of the infantry, and to it is entrusted the guardianship of the Palace and duty in the thanas and tehsils, where experience has shown that Jadon sepoys are not to be trusted. Except a few in the city specified above as \u201cGashti\u201d there is no body of police in the State.\nBesides the various families of Jadons there is no other important Rajput party settled in Karauli. Many a Jadon from Sabalgarh across the Chambal pressed by a tax-gatherer comes to Karauli for a loan or a grant of money, which is not unfrequently granted. The Jadon, like other Rajputs, is a brave soldier but a bad agriculturist, and that those of Rajputana would seem to be worse than their brethren to the east, for wherever he has to compete with cultivators of other castes on equal terms, he manifests his inferiority, and this is remarkably illustrated by the position of the Gonj and Khichri and Pir Thakurs in Karauli, who, being out of the caste, are not allowed the advantages enjoyed by respectable Jadons, and are consequently on a lower level than Minas and Gujars. The present position of the Thakurs of the village named Mina-Khera exhibit the estimation in which Karauli Jadons are held by Rajputs in the east. The Thakur who held Mina-Khera was persuaded to give his daughter in marriage to a Raja of the Chandel race, who lived at village Khera in the Gidar pergunnah of Monghair. The Thakur was not a person of special consideration, and yet the Raja, who has a large estate, offered him great advantages if he would not only give his daughter in marriage, but also emigrate to Monghair. The temptations held out were so great, that the Thakur was induced to go with all his family, although he knew he would have to give up his estate in Karauli, which was accordingly sequestrated by the Durbar, for it would have no absentee landlord. Twice they have pretended to return and have received back the village, but they soon turned back to their new home in the east, leaving a Kamdar or agent to represent him, whereupon the village was again confiscated by the State.\n\nMany of the sons of the Jadon Rajas founded clans which bear peculiar names, the origin of some of which is curious and interesting. The Karauli Thakurs are very illiterate; very few can read and write; and this is not to be wondered at, considering the backward state of education in this State.\nIt will be noticed that most Jadons' names have the affix \"Pal,\" instead of \"Singh.\" It has been preferred because Singh means lion, which, with all its noble qualities is no respector of cows, whereas \"Pal\" signifies \"protector of cows,\" and is thought a more befitting designation for the children of Sri Krishna. Another derivation of the word Pal is considered by Tod, a great authority on such matters, to signify pastoral or nomadic.\n\nThe origin of the section of the Thakur caste to which the family of the ruling Chief of this State is related, is somewhat obscure, but legend has it that there was a Raja resident in Bengal in Orissa, Jujad by name, who had five sons, the eldest of whom, Jad, years after became Raja of Mathura. This man had sons, one of whom, Jindra Pal, became Raja of Biana in the Bharatpur State. History does not say how Jindra Pal had progeny; it is said eleven sons, the eldest of whom, Stya Pal, succeeded him, who again had a son, Bija Pal, who succeeded his father. The latter had a son of the name of Ten Pal, who eventually came to the Gaddi, and had a son of the name of Dhurram Pal, who became Raja of Biana, but afterwards transferred his capital to Karauli, becoming Raja of Karauli; it is from him that the present Chiefs of Karauli are descended. It would appear that Ten Pal had a number of sons, of whom Dhurram Pal above mentioned was the eldest; this latter had a pitched battle with Abu Bakar, a Mohamedan Chief of some note, probably a warrior belonging to the Mohammedan dynasty at that time prevailing at Delhi and elsewhere. In this battle Dhurram Pal was defeated, and for this reason fled south to Karauli, making that his future capital.\n\nA younger brother of Dhurram Pal's, Madan Pal by name, after the defeat of his brother, also fled, but to the north, eventually coming to a village near Sinsini, in Bharatpur territory, and thence ultimately to the latter village itself, where he appears to have died. Madan Pal had a family of five sons, the eldest of which, Suai Thakur, became a dakait and lived in this fashion for years. Generations passed in which the members of this family followed these pursuits, until one of them, Balchand Thakur, in one of his predatory excursions, came across a man of the Sohrat section of the Jat caste, whom he murdered, taking his wife as a concu-\nbine. This woman it appears extracted a promise from Balchand at the time, that should a son ever be born to them at any time, it should be called a Jat and not a Thakur. As a result of their marriage two sons were born, by name Surd and Burd; these latter became fairly wealthy, probably on account of the loot which their family, for generations, had accumulated as a result of their depredations. They owned considerable land also, which was possibly acquired in the same predatory fashion. It is in this way that the two families of the Ruling Chiefs of Bharatpur and Karauli are probably connected, for a further description of which I must refer the reader to page 29.\nGenealogical Tree of the Ruling House of Karauli.\n\nMaharajah Dharam Pal.\n\nRao Kirat Pal.\n\nMaharajah Ratan Pal.\n\nMaharajah Kunwar Pal.\n\nMaharajah Gopal Singh.\n\nSon Pal.\n\nTursam Pal.\n\nKhub Pal.\n\nRao Bejey Pal.\n\nRao Jodh Pal.\n\nRao Jorawar Pal.\n\nBhum Pal.\n\nMaharajah Tursam Pal.\n\nMaharajah Manick Pal.\n\nNehal Pal.\n\nRao Pepe Pal.\n\nPepe Pal.\n\nShitab Pal.\n\nRao Jawahir Pal.\n\nMaharajah Harbakhsh Pal.\n\nGrandson Rao Nar-singh Pal, A.\n\nGobardhan Pal.\n\nSunder Pal.\n\nAmeer Pal.\n\nPertap Pal.\n\nMaharajah Pertap Pal.\n\nMaharajah Nar-singh Pal.\n\nMaharajah Madan Pal, G.C.S.I.\n\nMaharajah Lachhman Pal.\n\nMaharajah Joysingh Pal.\n\nMaharajah Arjun Pal.\n\nMaharajah Bhanwar Pal, G.C.I.E.\n\nRao Madan Pal, B.\n\nMadan Pal B.\n\nBishen Pal.\n\nKishan Pal.\n\nLachhman Pal, C.\n\nRao Kishen Pal, succeeded by his nephew.\n\nRao Lachhman Pal, C.\n\nRao Joysingh Pal, D.\n\nRao Arjun Pal, E.\n\nRao Dhanwar Pal, F.\n\nRao Bhum Pal.\n\nChain Pal.\n\nBhairo Pal.\n\nMangal Pal.\n\nGovind Pal.\n\nPadam Pal.\n\nNarain Pal.\n\nMaharaja Joysingh Pal, D.\n\nRatan Pal.\n\nJatan Pal.\n\nKanwar Surjan Pal, Member of Council.\n\nSurjan Pal.\n\nDurjan Pal.\n\nMaharajah Arjun Pal, E.\n\nMaharajah Bhanwar Pal, G.C.I.E., F.\n\n(Present Chief.)\n\nBhum Pal\n\nThakur Moti Pal,\n\nHeir-Presumptive to the Karauli Gaddi.\n\nReferences.\u2014Names in black type are those who have ascended on the Karauli Gaddi.\n\nNames having the title \"Rao\" prefixed are those who have become the Raos of Hadoti.

The first treaty of alliance with the British Government was negotiated and concluded in his time, dated 9th November 1817, and State received British protection.\n\nHis daughter was married to the Chief of Kotah. There was dissension within the State in his time.\n\nHe was a child, and disturbance again broke out. Lieutenant Monck Mason, with the help of a detachment of the old Kotah contingent, put down the disturbance and restored order.\n\nAfter the death of Narsingh Pal, there being no direct successor, a question arose whether the Gaddi should be held to be without an heir, and the State to have lapsed to the British Government. Finally it was determined to preserve the State. Hence Maharajah Madan Pal succeeded two years after the death of Maharajah Narsingh Pal. During his time the Sepoy Mutiny broke out, and he evinced a thoroughly loyal spirit, and sent out a body of troops against the Kotah Mutineers. For his services he was created a G. C. S. I. He survived only a few weeks.\n\nThe present ruler ascended the Gaddi in 1886, after the demise of the late Maharajah Arjun Pal, by whom he was adopted. He was made a K.C.I.E. in 1894 and a G.C.I.E. on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress of India in 1897.\nANTHROPOMETRY.\n\nThe following series of anthropometrical measurements of the Thakur caste were taken by me during the Ethnographical survey of the North-West Provinces and Oudh, and comprise a series of four hundred and twenty adult males of a number of sections of the caste, which were too numerous to detail. The measurements appended have been copied from the table in Mr. Crooke's book on the \"Tribes and Castes of the North-West Province and Oudh,\" to be obtained at the Government Press, Allahabad.\n| Name of Caste or Tribe\u2014Thakur | No of Adults Examined | Height of Vertex | Height of Trunk | Span | Left Foot | I.M.

appended *in extenso*; in which it will be seen that the measurements slightly vary from those above, the average facial angle being about the same, *viz.*, 64\u00b05, but that of the nasal index considerably larger, *viz.*, 72\u00b091, indicating the presence of rather a less leptorrhine nose than is apparently existant amongst the members of the same caste in the adjacent province.\n\n|

seems that the first medical institution to be opened in this State was the Sadar Dispensary in 1854, at the time when Dr. Mathias was Medical Officer, apparently of this State only, and when Captain Monck Mason was Political Officer. At that time there does not appear to have been any Chief actually on the Gaddi, and the institution seems to have been established solely at the suggestion of Dr. Mathias, who appears to have been a great favourite amongst the people, and well spoken of to this day. The Dispensary when opened seems to have been very popular, and was well patronized by the people, who appear to have had about as great faith in his powers as a Surgeon as they had in him as a Shikari.\n\nThe Eastern Rajputana States remained without an Agency Surgeon for many years till the year 1899, when the appointment was resuscitated, and the writer was selected for the charge. Previous to that year the Medical Department of this State had not been directly under the charge of any European Medical Officer. The Administrative Medical Officer of Rajputana in his annual cold weather tour used to visit some of the Medical Institutions of this State at irregular intervals, but these visits were usually confined to the Sadar Dispensary. So, to that extent, the department was under the charge of that officer in that he used to check and countersign the pay-bills, &c., of these Institutions, as is now done by the Agency Surgeon.\n\nThere was no Municipality at Karauli before the year 1884. In 1882 the political administration of this State was taken over by the Political Officer of this Agency owing to mal-administration. Col. Sir Euan Smith was appointed Political Agent two years after, and it was during his incumbency that a Municipal Board was set up to look into the sanitary arrangements of the town.\n\nThe first Municipal Board was started in this way. In the month of September 1884, cholera broke out in an epidemic form, and the want of a Municipality was keenly felt. Sir Euan at once took up the question in right ear-\nnest and a Municipal Board on a small scale was soon established. To meet the immediate expenses for the upkeep of the Board a small fund was raised by means of subscriptions at the rate of 10 per cent. from the salaries of the high officials of this State. The then Secretary Agra Municipality was invited here for a few days, and with his active co-operation and valuable advice and ripe experience of Municipal Administration, a set of bye-laws was drawn up. In this way this institution was launched, and after it had worked fairly for a few months, and had passed through the initial stage, steps were taken to make it a permanent institution of this State. In consultation with the principal citizens of the capital to whom Sir Euan Smith explained the advantages of Municipal Administration, an Octroi duty on cereals was introduced, and began to be levied at the following rates:\n\n| Class     | Rs. | A. | P. |\n|-----------|-----|----|----|\n| First Class Grain | ... | 0  | 1  | 3  |\n| Second \"   | ... | 0  | 1  | 0  |\n| Third \"    | ... | 0  | 0  | 9  |\n\nWheat, gram, &c., constitute first class grains, bejhar i.e., wheat and gram mixed, form second class grain, whereas mung, moth, juar, &c., are considered third class grains. Rice and paddy are exempted from Octroi, but customs dues are levied on them.\n\nIn this way permanency was imparted to Karauli Municipality, and carts and sweepers were engaged for the sanitation and proper cleansing of the town.\n\nA regular Municipal Board was then formed, consisting of the eleven principal citizens of the town, a selected number of whom formed themselves into a Bench of Honorary Magistrates. They work by rotation, and decide all cases pertaining to the breach of Municipal laws.\n\nDr. Bhawani Singh, first class Hospital Assistant (now on the retired list), was brought down from Abu and put in charge of the Municipality. He still holds the same charge in his dual capacity as Secretary and Health Officer, Karauli Municipality. Kunwar Surjan Pal is the President, and Bhola Nath Chatterji is the Vice-President of the Board.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting of the Board, the Budget estimate of the Municipality is discussed and passed. Its funds, arising from Octroi and other sources, are kept quite\nseparate from the income and expenditure of the State, and this of course is as it should be.\n\nIn the year 1883, in the time of Colonel Euan Smith as Political Officer in this Agency, dispensaries were opened at Mandrail, Machilpur and Sapotra, the most important towns in this State, during the reign of Maharajah Arjun Pal. Beyond this information there appears to be little or nothing on record.\n\nIn the year 1891 at the wish of His Highness the Maharajah (Bhanwar Pal) a female Zenana hospital was opened for affording medical relief to women in connection with the Dufferin Association. A female medical practitioner (Bibi Ashrafi) was placed in charge, and the institution, though it has been unfortunate in having many changes of its staff during recent years, has since done good work nevertheless. A brief description of each institution will now be given in order of importance.\n\nSadar Dispensary, Karauli City.\u2014This dispensary is situated outside the city, though within the earthworks on the southern side, in close proximity to the State Prison, which practically adjoins it. It was founded by Maharajah Madan Pal, G.C.S.I., in January 1854, and was placed in charge of a native doctor on a monthly salary of Rs. 35, who retired in 1879, when Hospital Assistant, T. Romare, was appointed, who still continues to hold charge. It is composed of pukka stone-built buildings, formed more or less into a square, in centre of which is the dispensary. On the west are the medical subordinates\u2019 quarters, and on the east the wards, composed of four small rooms and an upper and lower story, providing accommodation for a few patients only, which, however, is hardly sufficient for the needs of an head-quarters hospital, and I hope by degrees to get it extended. Till recently there was no room for the performance of surgical operations, &c., or even a proper dispensary, and an element of chaos existed. I have, however, persuaded the Durbar to erect a suitable room for performance of surgical operations on the east side of the building, and to make a proper dispensary room. The dispensary has been provided with a proper operating table, and with other suitable instruments and appliances, which I hope will greatly extend the usefulness of this institution, as under present circumstances little or no surgical aid is nor can be afforded to the people,\nexcept at the visits of the Agency Surgeon, owing to the absence of some of the most ordinary surgical appliances and instruments, and sufficient accommodation for surgical cases.\n\nMachilpur.\u2014At a distance of about 17 miles from Karauli is situated this town, connected by a kuchha road passing for the first few miles through endless ravines passable only to foot traffic, but easily rideable for the whole distance. The dispensary is situated on the outskirts of the town, composed of a pukka building facing south, which at present is hardly suitable for its purpose. I hope shortly that a more suitable building will be erected for its location. A further description of this town will be found at page 303.\n\nMandrail.\u2014This town is situated about 19 miles from Karauli, being connected with it by a track, suitable only for horse or pony traffic, and passing through hilly country till within about five miles of Mandrail, when thick forest is entered, and the traveller suddenly, after passing down a very steep ghat, over which it is impossible to do anything but walk for some distance, enters into the valley of the Chambal, when the town, with its fort crowning a hill, comes at once into view. The dispensary is situated just within the western gate of the town at the foot of the hill, it consists of a few unsuitable low buildings, with accommodation for two or three patients, which I hope will be enlarged at some future date. For a further description of the town, fort and environs, see page 307.\n\nSapotra.\u2014This town is situated in very hilly country due south of the capital, and connected therewith by a kuchha road in some places impassable for cart traffic, at a distance of about 25 miles.\n\nIt is situated in the Jerota Tehsil, of which it is the most important town, though owing to administrative reasons the tehsil offices are not located here, but at Jerota, about seven miles away.\n\nThe dispensary is situated in the centre of the town, and consists of pukka stone buildings in the form of a square, in which the dispensary, wards, &c., such as they are, are located. A considerable fort exists here, regarding which and any other facts I must refer the reader to page 301.\nFemale Hospital, Karauli.\u2014This is located in a pukka building within the town, and consists of a double-storied edifice, the lower portion of which is utilized as a ward and the upper storey for residence of the medical subordinate and location of the dispensary. The building is not, to my mind, altogether suited to its purpose, being dark and ill-ventilated, as well as draughty; it could however, I feel sure, be made suitable were money spent judiciously upon certain alterations and additions. This hospital appears to be popular with the residents, and affords a large amount of medical relief to that class of patient for which it is intended. It has, however, of late years, owing to many reasons, been very unfortunate in frequent and constant changes of its medical subordinates, which have somewhat handicapped its utility at times.\n\nThe Municipality of Karauli was one of the first to take advantage of the Countess of Dufferin's Fund and scheme for affording female medical aid to the women of India. From 1st June 1886 the Board offered a scholarship of Rs. 10 a month for the medical education of a lady pupil at the Agra Medical School. Bibi Asharfi, a Brahmin lady and a native of Moradabad accepted the scholarship. After obtaining her diploma she came down here and took charge of the Female Dispensary on 18th October 1891. She was an intelligent lady, who worked very satisfactorily for nearly three years, when, owing to domestic reasons, it was considered prudent by the State to effect her transfer from the place. Accordingly, she left this place under orders from the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer, Rajputana, on 6th September 1894. No other female medical practitioner being available at that time, His Highness the Maharaja was reluctantly obliged to close the Female Dispensary for some time.\n\nThe institution remained in this moribund condition for nearly a year, when in August 1895 one Anandi Bai sent in a petition applying for the vacant post. She did not hold any diploma, nor had she attended the full course of lectures in any of the Government Medical Schools either in the N.-W. P. or Punjab, so the Municipal Board at first appointed her on six months' probation.\n\nDuring this period her abilities were found very poor, and she proved herself utterly incapable of discharging her\nduties efficiently. Therefore her services were dispensed with in February 1896.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Anandi Bai the institution was again allowed to remain closed for a pretty long time, there being no fresh hands available. The Administrative Medical Officer of Rajputana was several times communicated with, but he replied that owing to plague and other causes medical subordinates were in unusual request, and were not available for the salary offered by the State.\n\nThus passed away the whole of the years 1896 and 1897. Early in 1898 Mrs. E. Bose, a Bengalee Christian, and a passed female medical practitioner of Hardoi (Oudh) was secured; she came down here and took charge of the dispensary, and work went on regularly for some months. During the summer of 1898 she found that her children could not bear the heat of this part of the country, and being in affluent circumstances, she threw up the appointment of her own accord, and left the station abruptly. Mrs. Samuels was soon after appointed in her place.\n\nThis lady worked on smoothly for over a year, when unhappily friction took place between her and the State officials, resulting in her transfer in November 1900.\n\nThe institution was again threatened with extinction. Happily in December 1900, Mrs. George came here and instilled new life into the dispensary. Since then, I regret to add, that another interval occurred on the departure of Mrs. George. The appointment has now been filled up I hope permanently by the advent of another qualified medical subordinate, who seems popular and inclined to stay.\n### Table Showing When Each Hospital was Established in the Karauli State.\n\n| Name of Hospital | When opened | Name of Raja | Name of A.G.-G., Rajputana | Name of Political Agent | Name of Medical Officer | Remarks |\n|------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Karauli          | 1st January 1854 | Madan Pal (Minor) | Sir H.M.

29.1\nVaccination.\u2014The exact date of commencement of vaccination operations in this State cannot be ascertained, as few records exist; there is, however, some record of such having been carried out from the time during which Assistant Surgeon Harvey, I.M.S., was Agency Surgeon of these States. From existing records it would appear that at the commencement vaccination operations were carried on for some years in the district by one vaccinator, and at Karauli itself by the native doctor in charge of the dispensary there. Assistant Surgeon Spencer, I.M.S., the Agency Surgeon in 1873, writes that \"Vaccination is slowly making progress.\" In the year 1886 a Municipal Board was established at Karauli, from which time a separate vaccinator has been employed to carry on this duty within Municipal limits. Since that time three more vaccinators have been entertained for district work as permanent subordinates of the department, whereas in former days these men's services were enlisted only for work during the season, and were dispensed with on cessation of vaccination operations in the spring.\n\nNo satisfactory arrangements for the supervision of the working of this department existed till recently, when upon my urgent recommendation a native Superintendent has been appointed for the whole State, whose duty it is to supervise all operations within its limits, under the direction of the Agency Surgeon. There are four vaccinators employed at present for district work, allotted to each Tehsil as far as possible, the native Superintendent for the present taking the work at head-quarters in addition to his other duties, which are not likely to be very onerous, and for which he will find plenty of time. Vaccination has till recently been backward in this State, but has taken a turn for the better, owing to the interest displayed in the matter by the Durbar, so that we may hope for better results in the future.\n### Table of Vaccination performed in the Karauli State, from 1869 to 1876.\n\n| Season | Successful | Unsuccessful | Unknown | Total | Percentage of successful, excluding unknown | Average cost of each case |\n|--------|------------|--------------|---------|-------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1869   | 237        | 204          |         | 441   | 53\u00b774                                       |                          |\n| 1870   |            |              |         | 174   | 59\u00b719                                       |                          |\n| 1871   |            |              |         | 951   | 78\u00b761                                       |                          |\n| 1872   |            |              |         | 2,190 | 90\u00b78                                        |                          |\n| 1873   | 2,102      | 186          | 166     | 2,454 | 91\u00b78                                        |                          |\n| 1874   | 3,029      | 253          | 226     | 3,508 | 29\u00b72                                        | 2 annas                  |\n| 1875   | Figures for this year not available. | | | | | |\n| 1876   | 2,099      | 622          |         | 2,721 | 77\u00b714                                       |                          |\n\n**Statement (No. 1) showing Vaccination inspected by the Supdt.

in hand along with that of the Sadar Dispensary, i.e., in 1854. Before this there was no regular building for purposes of a prison. Convicts loaded with heavy shackles were generally lodged at a place within the precincts of the city called \"Brikat-ka-bagh.\" The word brikat is, I understand, perhaps a corruption of \"brigade.\"\n\nHowever, the late Maharajah Madan Pal caused the present jail building to be erected, but no regular jailor appears to have been placed in charge of the prison. From time to time officials of the State have been specially deputed to look after the jail in addition to their other duties.\n\nThis was the practice followed up to the early eighties, when, owing to internal mal-administration in the State, the executive authority of the latter passed into the hands of the Political Agent. It was during this period that the first jailor, named Abdul Lateef, a retired Government servant, who had pretty considerable experience of jail management, was brought from British territory and appointed to take charge, the date of his appointment being 24th March 1884.\n\nAbdul Lateef left the service of this State in 1889, and for a period the old order of affairs again asserted itself. Gobind Singh, a Subadar of the State Forces, was told off temporarily to discharge the work of a jailor in addition to his own duties. He continued to discharge this dual work for over a year, when on 3rd March 1890, Haridai Narain, a Mohurrir of the Rawalpindi Jail, was appointed jailor. He left the service of this State on 28th September 1897, when again Gobind Singh was appointed jailor. On 19th May 1898 Moulvi Abdul Karim, a near relative of the late Civil and Criminal Officer of this State, was appointed jailor. In November 1900, some mis-appropriation of jail money was discovered, and the Moulvi made himself scarce, and has not since been heard of, although a warrant for his arrest was issued!\nPrabhu Lal, the Thanadar of Gurla, who has a fair experience of criminal work, was then appointed jailor in place of Moulvi Abdul Karim. He has since been holding this post.\n\nThis jail though excellently looked after in most ways, requires re-organization in minor details. These have been brought by me prominently before the notice of the Durbar, who have shown much interest in the matter and issued orders for their introduction at once, and with that end in view directed the jailor to proceed to Bharatpur to learn all details of jail discipline and work in the Central Prison there. I hope very soon to have this jail on a par with those in the Bharatpur State.\n| Years | Average Strength | Admission into Hospital | Admissions per mille of Strength | Average Daily Sick | Deaths |

Powlett in his Gazetteer on Karauli says:\n\n\"An English and Persian school was established in May 1864. In July 1871 there were 16 boys studying English, thirty-one Persian, thirty-nine Hindi and five English and Persian. The English teacher is a Bengalee related to the Gosain of one of the temples. He has taken trouble with the school, though none of his pupils have as yet attained to any proficiency, and most are very inattentive.\"\n\nThe above had been the condition of the school down to the year 1886, when its wretchedness first attracted the attention of Col. Sir Euan Smith, the then Political Agent of this State. He caused a new Head Master (University graduate) to be placed in charge of the school, with instructions to re-organise it on a sound basis. His efforts at re-organization have been so far successful that during the course of the last ten years it has been raised from an indigenous primary school to a high class school, where now instruction up to the Matriculation Standard of the Allahabad University is imparted. There is an Oriental Department in connection with the school, which is affiliated with the Punjab University. Students from this department have sometimes attained the highest places in the Punjab University Examination in Sanskrit and Persian.\n\nIn 1888-89 when the present Ruler of this State was not yet invested with full administrative powers, Col. Martelli, the Political Agent, caused five new primary schools to be set up at the head-quarters of each Tehsil, and thus placed education within easy reach of even the humblest peasant.\n\nReading, writing and arithmetic are taught in these Mofussil schools, which are under the direct control of the Head Master of the Sadar School at Karauli. Lately an Inspector has also been appointed from among the teachers of the Sadar School, who, in addition to his usual duty of teaching, inspects these Mofussil schools from time to\ntime, and reports their progress or otherwise to the Head Master. There are nearly 150 boys who receive their education in these village schools.\n\nThe present strength of the Sadar school is the following:\n\n| Names of Departments | Present | Absent | Leave | Sick | Total |\n|----------------------|---------|--------|-------|------|-------|\n| English              | 28\u00b772   | 11\u00b761  | 3\u00b749  | \u00b718  | 44    |\n| Hindi and Sanskrit   | 195\u00b727  | 26\u00b734  | 11\u00b725 | 1\u00b714 | 234   |\n| Persian              | 51\u00b738   | 42\u00b709  | 9\u00b713  | \u00b740  | 103   |\n| Patwari Class        | 6\u00b796    | 4\u00b704   |       |      | 11    |\n| **Total**            | **282\u00b733** | **84\u00b708** | **23\u00b787** | **1\u00b772** | **392** |\n\nA new feature has been added to the Maharajah's School, Karauli, in the matter of education of Patwaris since January 1893, and a Patwari class has now been opened. In January 1887 the late Col. Walter, Agent to the Governor-General, Rajputana, during his annual tour in this State, visited the school, and in his remarks in the inspection book of the school, threw out a suggestion to open a Patwari class. In 1891 settlement operations in this State were taken up, and as a matter of course the necessity for well-trained Patwaris arose. His Highness the Maharajah then most gladly gave effect to the valued suggestion of Col. Walter. Old and illiterate Patwaris are now being replaced by new ones passing out of the school, after going through a course of regular instruction. The entire Khalsa State has been divided into 53 Patwari circles, of which nearly 35 have been filled up by trained Patwaris. Their status has also been improved. Their salary now ranges from Rs. 8 to Rs. 12 a month, according to the area of the circle.\n\nEducation in this State, as elsewhere in Rajputana, is imparted free. No tuition fees are levied.\nIRRIGATION.\n\nBesides the rainfall there are three different means of irrigation, that from tanks, that from wells, and from the rise of the Chambal river.\n\nThe number of wells is reported in the different Tehsils as follows:\n\n| Tehsil       | Masonry | Kachch\u0101 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|\n| Huzur        | 1,092   | 880     |\n| Jerota       | 505     | 270     |\n| Mandrail     | 269     | 116     |\n| Utgirh       | 221     | 24      |\n| Machilpur    | 771     | 591     |\n| **Total**    | **2,858** | **1,881** |\n\nA detailed account, showing amongst other things the wells of each village, is amongst the records of the Eastern States Agency. The well channels are said never to be lined with dung or other material to prevent loss by absorption of the water.\n\nIt is only on the very verge of the receded water that a crop is produced, through the influence of the river Chambal. The banks are usually so high that the river cannot place the water line within the reach of irrigating wells, and the country from the river to the abrupt rise of the Dang scarp, from three to five miles distant, is often no better off for water than the dry parts of the Dang.\n\nTanks formed by \"bunds\" or dams thrown across the course of a line of rain drainage are the principle means of irrigation in the rocky and hilly portion of Karauli. In the beds of these tanks rice is grown in the rainy season, and the stored water often renders a grain crop in the Rabi possible. Great care in selecting the sites of tanks is necessary, as if the ground is too light the water permeates under the \"bunds\" and it is useless; or if there is a flaw in the rocks the water escapes in like manner. But whereas\nthe former evil is irremediable, the latter can often be obviated. An expert by observing the bubbling and eddying of the water determines the point where the leakage takes place, or charcoal thrown in is drawn towards and indicates the position of the leak, which is then excavated and the place filled in with cattle\u2019s horn, which swell and so render the spot water-tight, or else the leak is stopped with lime. The wall of the \u201cbund\u201d has to be built very carefully. If it is made with earth and uncut stones it does not effectually prevent percolation.\n\nSystem of Irrigation in Karauli.\u2014The river Chambal which separates this state from Gwalior, receives during the rains numerous contributions to its volume of water. It passes by two Tehsils in Karauli, namely Mandrail and Utgirh.\n\nAlthough it is a big river, yet for purposes of irrigation it is of small advantage to this State, for its banks are usually so high that the water line never comes within the reach of irrigating wells, and the intervening portion of the country from the banks to the abrupt rise of the Dang portion is not much better than the \u201cDang\u201d itself.\n\nMandrail.\u2014Having regard to the physical aspect of the country, it can be divided into two main divisions, the \u201cDang\u201d portion and the \u201cJareti\u201d portion. The latter lies along the Chambal on its left bank. It is undulating and broken by \u201cn\u0101l\u0101s.\u201d\n\nThe bed of the river is, in the cold weather, cultivated down to the water\u2019s edge, but at other seasons the water is often too far below the surface to be of any practical use.\n\nThe \u201cDang\u201d portion comprises the elevated hilly country which extends northward to within five miles of the city of Karauli. People living in this portion are entirely dependent on tanks for water, and cultivation is consequently scanty. Owing to the rocky nature of this portion of the country, wells are very few and far between. Some of the most noted tanks are the Nidar, Urpura and Khubnagar.\nUtgirh.\u2014The Tehsil Utgirh, like that of Mandrail, has two natural divisions, a rocky and elevated tract and the tract below it, extending down to the Chambal. In the \u201cDang\u201d wells are impossible, but by means of \u201cbunds\u201d built across drainage sources, two or three feet of earth are deposited, which produce crops. There are tanks, too, in this Tehsil, but water in most of them fail during the hot season, when people with their cattle retreat to the banks of the Chambal. But the villages on the lower ground by the banks of the river are not entirely well-off, for even here, in many spots, wells have to be sunk to a depth of 70 or 80 cubits before water can be found, and often such herculean efforts at reaching the underground water are rendered futile by the sudden appearance of some protruding rock.\n\nThe Banas and Morel belong more properly to Jaipur. The Panchna is the only river which rises in Karauli, and does not flow into the Chambal. That most useful and important to the city is the Bhadraoti; it unites with the Barkhera, and the united water then discharges into the Panchna. As none of these rivers are navigable at any season of the year, the extent of help that is actually derived from these small rivers for purposes of irrigation can be easily imagined.\n\nTo sum up, this State derives very little help from the rivers in the irrigation of land. Besides the rainfall, there are three different modes of irrigation\u2014from tanks, from wells, and from the rise of the Chambal\u2014but the last mode is only resorted to on the very verge of the receded water, and to this extent only a crop is produced through the influence of the Chambal.\n\nTanks formed by \u201cbunds\u201d or dams thrown across the course of a line of rain drainage are the principal means of irrigation in the rocky and hilly portion of Karauli. In the beds of these tanks rice is grown.\n\nWells are the principal source of irrigation in the level portion of the territory. The average depth of these wells is from 30 to 40 cubits. In the hilly portion of the country the water-line descends to a depth of 70 or 80 cubits from the surface. The following is the number of masonry and kachcha wells in each Tehsil of this State:\u2014\n### Names of Tehsils\n\n| Masonry | Kachcha | Total |\n|---------|---------|-------|\n| Huzur Tehsil | 624 | 520 | 1,144 |\n| Mandrail | 195 | 113 | 308 |\n| Jerota | 172 | 190 | 362 |\n| Machilpur | 547 | 327 | 874 |\n| Utgirh | 107 | 18 | 125 |\n\n**Total**: 1,845 | 1,168 | 2,813\n\nThe following is the number of tanks in each Tehsil of this State:\n\n### Names of Tehsils\n\n| Masonry | Kachcha | Total |\n|---------|---------|-------|\n| Huzur Tehsil | | | |\n| Mandrail | 13 | 100 | 113 |\n| Jerota | 1 | 5 | 6 |\n| Machilpur | 7 | 67 | 74 |\n| Utgirh | 28 | 79 | 107 |\n\n**Total**: 49 | 260 | 309\n\nThe following is the number of bunds in each Tehsil of the State:\n\n### Names of Tehsils\n\n| Masonry | Kachcha | Total |\n|---------|---------|-------|\n| Huzur Tehsil | 6 | 19 | 25 |\n| Mandrail | 17 | 2 | 19 |\n| Jerota | 2 | 10 | 12 |\n| Machilpur | 3 | 1 | 4 |\n| Utgirh | 4 | 6 | 10 |\n\n**Total**: 32 | 38 | 70\nFAMINES.\n\nBRIEF ACCOUNT OF PREVIOUS FAMINES.\n\nIn 1897 the State was under the shadow of this calamity, but not of the worst type. It was a year of scarcity but not of actual famine. The case would have been very bad indeed had the winter rains failed, but the calamity was averted by the timely fall of winter rains, though in very light showers.\n\nSuch had also been the case with the famine of 1876, which is still locally known as the famine of Sambat 1934. The only famine known here, within the memory of men still living, which bears a close resemblance to the one of 1899, was the famine of Sambat 1925 or A.D. 1868. It was in those days, pre-railway days, when the Rajputana-Malwa Railway system was still uncompleted. The cause of this famine was the entire failure of the monsoon. There is no connected report in the State with reference to the famine of the year 1868; but so far we are sure that the transport of grain in those days was not so easy as it is now, and therefore it can be easily imagined that the famine of the sixties pressed more severely upon the people of this State. Maharajah Madan Pal started relief works in different parts of the country, and the bunds at Dabra and Malpura stand to this day as monuments of the generous efforts of the ruling Chief to mitigate the sufferings of his numerous subjects. He also did his best to mitigate the sufferings of the poor. Kitchens for the distribution of food were established, and irrigation works begun as above stated, to meet the expense of which the Durbar received a loan of two lakhs of rupees from the British Government.\n\nThe prices current of grain went up to a rupee for seven Karauli seers, or between eight and nine British seers. In the highlands of the Dang nine-tenths of the cattle died.\nBrief Account of the Famine of the Year 1899-1900.\n\nIn normal years the rains usually set in about the second week of June, and fall intermittently till about the middle of July, when heavy rains set in and last till the close of August. In September the showers are less frequent, and in the first half of October, after a shower or two for the sowing of gram and other early spring crops, it ceases to rain except in the shape of light cold-weather showers.\n\nIt was in June 1899 that the monsoon burst over the little State of Karauli, earlier than in ordinary years. The total rainfall recorded during the rainy season of 1899 was 19 inches, of which ten inches were recorded for the month of June only. At the close of July the monsoon current suddenly failed, and with it the rainfall utterly ceased in the State, and not a drop fell with the exception of a light shower or two in the Machilpur Tehsil in the month of August.\n\nAs the result of this unequal distribution of rain the early autumn crops, excepting the Indian corn (Bajra), suffered to a marked extent, and the rice was a complete failure.\n\nFrom the experience of the past it has been observed that failure of rainfall during the month of June is not so prejudicial to the crops here as it is in the month of August or beginning of September. The latter rains are very valuable, as the crops of Moth, Til, &c., entirely depend upon them.\n\nHowever, wholesale failure of autumn crops was restricted to the \"Dang\" area, where rice is extensively sown, and the distress was thus confined to narrow limits. With the failure of autumn crops, people rested their hopes on the Rabi out-turn, and therefore tried their utmost to bring as much land under the plough for Rabi cultivation as possible, but the winter rains failed as well, and the out-turn of Rabi was only an eight anna one.\n\nThus in this State, out of a total population of 1,56,000 in round numbers in an area of 1,242 square miles, the area affected was about 254 square miles, with a population of about ten thousand souls. And this tract was entirely limited to that portion of this State known as the \"Dang\" area. Throughout the whole territory there was severe\npressure on all the poor classes owing to the high price of all food grains; but in the area actually affected, the distress was due to the utter failure of the autumn crops following on a succession of two inferior harvests.\n\nThe peculiar feature of the \"Dang\" area is rock and ravine. In a country full of rocks and jungles the proportion of irrigated area can never be large. Communications are here carried on \"over high vales and down dales,\" through zig-zag paths. To some places grain, &c., can be transported by camels and other beasts of burden, and in other cases this even can be done with difficulty, notably in some obscure corners of the Utgirh Tehsil.\n\nWhen the winter rains failed, the necessity arose to open some relief works on a small scale; for among the chamar classes distress to some extent began to be felt. This relief at first took the shape of grass-cutting, and in this work some three or four hundred chamars were employed. Gradually, as summer advanced, relief works in the shape of excavation of tanks, or bund construction, or sinking of wells began to be taken up one after another in the \"Dang\" portion of the territory.\n\nTo mitigate the general distress at the time, a remission of nearly Rs. 50,000 in the land revenue was allowed to the ryots, and Takkavi advances, amounting to nearly Rs. 25,000, were made. During the month of March, people numbering one thousand were employed in the relief works, and as summer advanced this number increased to two thousand.\n\nThe bunds and tanks were generally constructed at such spots where they were likely to bring more land under irrigation, and allow the people living in the surrounding villages a sufficient supply of water.\n\nIn the \"Dang\" area works were invariably started on the system of task piece-work, because this system had the advantage of supporting a large number of people. In the level portion of the country, works in some places were given out on contract, in order to help a little knot of people comprising a few families locally resident there, who were mostly in need of such help.\n\nWages were always paid in cash, sometimes daily and sometimes weekly. In villages, in ordinary times, day labourers generally earn 2 to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ annas per day, and that\nwas the scale of wages allowed to men on the relief works.\n\nPoor-houses, owing to famine, were not opened at any place. There are certain poor-houses here which are maintained by the State. The fixed quantity of grain and flour that are allowed to be distributed in these poor-houses in ordinary times was supplemented by additional grants to meet the exigencies of hard times.\n\nThe famine of 1899-1900 was peculiar in this respect, in that it was not a famine brought on by the scarcity of food grains only, but it was a famine in which water and fodder were almost unobtainable either for love or money, in many parts of the country. The consequence was a heavy mortality also among the cattle, the loss being estimated at 20 per cent. all round. Utgirh Tehsil alone reported 33 per cent.\n\nVery few deaths among natives from actual starvation were reported.\n\nThe famine of the year 1899-1900 has, however, left its mark on the general condition of the people, which will take some time to obliterate.\nGAME AND GRASS PRESERVES.\n\nThe game and grass preserves, called \"runds,\" are at present under the management of a Jamadar, who belongs to the band of trusted attendants of the Maharajah, called orderlies, distinguished by a \"kantha\" or gold necklace.\n\nThe department is known by the name of \"bagar,\" or rick, and under the Jamadar there are three mutsadis or writers to keep accounts, and 60 rundias or foresters. These last, though their pay is very small, have facilities for keeping cattle, which makes their position a desirable one. The object of the department is, firstly, to provide stocks of grass for the Raj elephants and cattle; secondly, to preserve and find game for the *Chief and his followers; and thirdly, to provide a revenue by exacting grazing dues.\n\nAlthough in ordinary years the supply of grass is very plentiful, the stock in store would be insufficient to meet a famine, as, indeed, during the last great famine was found to be the case in nearly every State in Rajputana. Notwithstanding the means of securing an ample store possessed by all, the amount of grass annually stored is calculated at something under a hundred lakhs of \"pulis,\" or small bundles, scarcely more than a handful each.\n\nThe description of grass most valued is that called \"ganthil,\" so much perhaps from its conspicuous top knot. It is a low fine grass. Those next in repute are \"jarga\" and \"mujena.\" The first is a bright green running grass, with a soft ciliated short broad blade; the second is a long slender bent, dark-coloured fine-looking grass. The commonest kinds are the \"edo\" and \"lamp.\" \"Edo\" makes a useful though not first-rate fodder. \"Lamp\" has a bad name, and the inferiority of the Karauli cattle breed is attributed to its predominance and abundance. It is a fine unsubstantial-looking grass.\n\n* The present Chief, Sir Bhanwar Pal, G.C.I.E., is a renowned shikaree. I have had the good fortune of enjoying his hospitality in this line on a few occasions, and can testify to the excellence of all arrangements connected with tiger shooting, which, from considerable experience elsewhere, I am sure is better done in Karauli, owing to the great personal interest displayed in this sport by its Chief.\nThe \"runds\" mostly resorted to for game are those within a few miles of the city, but, as before stated, Utgirh is the best hunting ground for tigers, and perhaps sambhur too.\n\nFauna.\u2014Tigers and panthers are to be found within most parts of this State, especially the latter, who inhabit caves and holes, which exist in such abundance in most of the rocky hills to be found almost everywhere in this State. Hyenas and bears are also met with, as also occasionally wild dogs. Chinkara (ravine deer) as well as black buck (in some places) are to be found in fairly large numbers.\n\nSambhur also exist in the forests along the banks of the river Chambal. Wild fowl exist in large numbers in the tanks, as also do sand grouse on most of the rocky hills in abundance. The common grey partridge and in some places, where high grass is in abundance, black partridges are to be found, but the latter are not plentiful.\nTRADE ROUTES.\n\nThe principal trade routes are:\n\n(1) North-east, from Karauli to Agra, via Machilpur.\n(2) West, to Khushalgarh and Madhopur in Jaipur.\n(3) South-west, to Shopur Baroda. By this route merchandize intended for Kotah is carried.\n(4) South to Gwalior and Indore. To the latter place the route is either by Mandrail or Jhiri, according as the Gwalior \"Sayar\" contractors fix their dues.\n(5) North to Hindaun.\n(6) North Biana.\n(7) East, Sir Muttra and Dholpur.\n(8) South, from Naroli to Sholpur, Baroda, via Raontra, Anargarh, Daulatpura, Maharajpura and across the Gota Ghat, near Utgirh. Of these routes that to Hindaun is by a circuitous road passable for carts. The direct road to Madhopur and Khushalgarh is passable for carts, those to Machilpur and Sir Muttra are barely passable, while the rest can only be traversed by bullocks and camels. Indeed, the latter progress with so much difficulty that the bulk of the goods are carried on bullocks. The routes to Hindaun and Khushalgarh are apt to be often closed during the rains by floods, and travellers are sometimes detained on the nala banks for days.\nCommercial Fairs.\u2014The only Commercial Fair of any importance which is held here is the one known as the Sheoratri Fair. It is generally held in the beginning of March. It takes place on a piece of ground outside the city called \"Calcutta,\" lasting fifteen days. For the first three or four days it is almost entirely a cattle fair. Bullocks and buffaloes numbering from fifteen to twenty thousand change hands. Customs dues at the rate of 4 annas per bullock and 4 annas per buffalo are levied; hence the number of cattle sold annually in the fair can be accurately known.\n\nFor the remaining period it is exclusively a fair for the grain merchants and baniyas, food grains, and all commodities for daily consumption of the people of the town for the whole year. As during these fifteen days of the fair no customs dues are levied, it is difficult to give accurate figures regarding the amount of sale and purchase effected. It must not be less than forty to fifty thousand, even more. The gathering must be one of four or five thousand men. The Maharajah rides out to the fair in procession for two or three days, and on the last day of his visit orders the baniyas for weighment, when wholesale purchases are made.\n\nReligious Fairs.\u2014A considerable fair is held at the shrine of Kaila Devi in April. It commences from Chait Badi 11th and lasts about a fortnight. The celebrated temple of the goddess is situated about 12 miles south-west of Karauli, on the way to Utgirh Fort, on a hill surrounded with nala. His Highness the Maharajah annually visits the shrine during the fair. People from the neighbouring States and the districts of Agra and Etawah attend this annual fair and present offerings to the shrine, which during the fair amount to from six to eight thousand rupees. Sacrifices of goats and buffaloes take place. Wheeled conveyances such as bullock-carts can pass from Karauli to Kaila. The shrine is visited during the fair by people numbering from fifteen to twenty thousand, and sometimes even more.\nAt the temple of Anjani at Birwas, close to Karauli, near Panchna, a fair of some note is held in the month of October. This fair is also visited by His Highness the Maharajah, who drives there with all his attendants and Sardars, and takes his bath. The probable gathering is from three to four thousand men, all usually natives of this State.\n\nAt Timangarh in the Machilpur Tehsil, renowned for its fort, a fair is held called the \"Sagar\" Fair, in the month of June. It is not visited by His Highness the Maharajah. There is a large tank amidst the ruins of Timangarh where people, mostly Gujars of the Machilpur Dang and the neighbouring States of Bharatpur and Jaipur, take their bath. The gathering is from four to five thousand men.\n\nFestivals.\u2014There are certain festivals on which the Maharajah either proceeds in State to some point or holds a Durbar. These are:\n\n1. The Rakhi or Salono festival. It takes place on Sanwan Sudi Punawa (August). On this occasion a Durbar is held in the palace, and the Brahmins and court minstrels, commonly known here as the Raos, tie pieces of silk called the rakhi round the sword hilt of the Chief instead of round the wrist, as is done with others.\n\n2. The Jaljatra, or water festival on Bhadon Sudi 11th (September). On this occasion the Maharajah walks with his followers with flags in hand to the Bhadraoti. There the procession stops and cocoa nuts and green vegetables are thrown in the stream as a sort of offering to the river.\n\n3. The Dusserah festival on Asoj Sudi 10th (October.) This festival is held throughout India in some shape or other to commemorate the slaying of the demon Rawan by the mythological hero, Rana. On the day of the festival, His Highness the Maharajah rides outside the town with all the paraphernalia of State, to hold a review of his troops, and to see the common shots fired at the effigy of Rawan.\n(4) The Sard-ka-Durbar, held to celebrate the going out of autumn and the coming in of the cold season. The Durbar is held in October in the palace, and every man puts on white dress.\n\n(5) Go-dhul-ki-Sawari or Go-raj-ki-Sawari, or Cow-dust festival\u2014Go-dhul (cow-dust) and Go-dhuli twilight\u2014for it is just in the evening when the cattle return from the grazing field kicking up a cloud of dust. As the names of the festival indicates, it is held in the evening of Katik Sudi 8th (October), when the cattle return from the jungle. The Maharajah on this occasion goes down in the evening outside the Mendki Gate of the town, and stands in the dust raised up by the returning cattle. This festival is held in remembrance of Sree-Krishna, who was a cow-keeper, and the Jadavas of Karauli claim to be his direct descendants.\n\n(6) Nagar-Parikrama, on Katik Sudi 9th (October). On the occasion of this festival the Maharajah makes the circuit of the city in State. The origin of this festival is shrouded in obscurity. Some say that it originated in honour of the building of the walls round the city, while others assert, with some degree of rational explanation, that in old predatory times, when war and looting were the order of the day, the Princes thought it their duty to take circuit round the town at least once in a year, to see with their own eyes that the walls were not falling into disrepair, and thus ensure the safety of their capital. In course of time, a degree of sanctity was attached to this practice, and it has now become an annual festival.\n\n(7) Kans-marne-ki-Sawari, the festival of slaying Kans, the maternal uncle of Sree-Krishnaji of Muttra, on Katik Sudi 10th (October). The Chief on this occasion rides out to see the image of Kans destroyed by cannon, after which\nthe boys of the town scramble for the fragments of the image. As Jadavas, or direct descendants of Sree-Krishnaji, the Chief and his clansmen are bound to celebrate this festival, which is nothing more than to commemorate the war which Sree-Krishnaji carried on against his uncle, and ultimately slew him in a duel. The gathering is from two to three thousand.\n\n(8) Basant-Panchmi, the spring festival, is Magh Sudi Panchmi (February.) It is held in honour of the coming in of the spring season and the going out of the winter. A Durbar is held in the palace, and the palace and the people generally wear magenta-coloured garments on the day of the festival; winter clothing is also generally discarded from this day.\n\n(9) Holi festival on Phagun Sudi Punaw (March). This great Hindu festival is celebrated at Karauli with the eclat and obscenity customary elsewhere. On the previous day of the festival the Maharajah proceeds to a place called Nila Dongar for boar hunting. On the day of the festival a grand procession is formed, and His Highness rides out to a spot outside the town called Sadya Ghata. There a feast is held, in which the hunt of the previous day forms the chief bill of fare, to which the Rajputs do full justice. Sweetmeats are distributed to the troops and to those who have a repugnance to meat. The gathering must be five or six thousand.\n\n(10) Gangor or Chait Sudi Teej (March). It is exclusively a festival pertaining to the females, and especially to those whose husbands are living. But it is held on a grand scale, and males most cordially take part in it. In this festival the Maharanis worship the image of Goura Parbati, the consort of god Siva, one of the trinity of the Hindu creed. In the evening the Maharajah issues from the Nadi Gate of the town to proceed to the Sukh Bilas\nGarden, where the images are taken in procession and placed, and the nautch girls dance before it in the presence of His Highness. The gathering in this festival outside the Nadi Gate must not be less than five or six thousand.\n\n(11) The birthday festival of the ruling Chief is the one when the biggest Durbar is held, and all the Sardars and State servants are called upon to present \"nazars\" to the ruling Chief. Goods and coins are given away to Brahmins, and a knot is tied to the Chief's string of life.\n\n(12) The Janam Ashtami, or birth of Sree-Krishnaji, is perhaps the greatest religious festival of this State, owing to the fact that the Chief and his clansmen are the direct descendants of god Sree-Krishna, who was born at Muttra at dead of night on Bhadon Badi 8th (September). The religious ceremonies are held at midnight, and hence no Durbar is held, and the day is passed in comparative quiet.\n| Map Description                                                                 | Page |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Map of the Bharatpur State, showing Tehsil Towns and Dispensaries                | 1    |\n| Map of the Dholpur State, showing Tehsil Towns and Dispensaries                  | 227  |\n| Map of the Karauli State, showing Tehsil Towns and Dispensaries                  | 293  |\n| Plan of Environs of Bharatpur City, showing details                              | 6    |\n| Plan of Dig City, showing details and Palaces, Buildings, Fort, etc.             | 10   |\n| Plan of Chhatris at Goberdhan erected to memory of Bharatpur Chiefs              | 13   |\n| Plan of Kushm Sirowar Tank and Chhatri at Goberdhan in memory of Suraj Mal        | 14   |\n| Plan of Victoria Hospital at Bharatpur, showing Grounds and Buildings            | 95   |\n| Plan of Victoria Hospital at Bharatpur, showing Administrative Block              | 96   |\n| Plan of Victoria Hospital at Bharatpur, showing Wards and Cottage Hospital       | 97   |\n| Plan of Central and Subsidiary Jails at Sewar                                    | 194  |\n| Plan of Bharatpur Recreation Club and Grounds                                     | 201  |\n| Plan of Regimental Lines of the Imperial Service Transport Corps                  | 203  |\n| Plan of Regimental Lines of the Imperial Service Infantry Regiment                | 205  |\n| Plan of Sadar Dispensary at Dholpur                                              | 237  |\n| Plan of State Prison at Dholpur                                                   | 277  |\nERRATA.\n\nOn page 51 in line 5\u2014erase the word \"was.\"\n\n,, 56 in the heading for \"Kumher\" read \"Roopbas.\"\n,, 57 ,, ,, ,, \"Kumher\" read \"Biana.\"\n,, 59 ,, ,, ,, \"Bharatpur\" read \"Bhusawur.\"\n,, 60 ,, ,, ,, \"Oochain\" read \"Akheygurh.\"\n,, 61 ,, ,, ,, \"Gopalgurh\" read \"Nagar.\"\n,, 74 ,, line 36, for the word \"Champal\" read \"Chambal.\"\n,, 78 ,, 15 ,, ,, \"cattl\" read \"cattle.\"\n,, 79 ,, 19 ,, ,, \"Jeardon\" read \"Jerdon.\"\n,, 81 ,, 39 ,, ,, \"Keolddeo\" read \"Keolodeo.\"\n,, 86 ,, 10 ,, ,, \"Micro-organism\" read \"Micro-organisms.\"\n,, 87 ,, 14 ,, ,, \"Analysis\" read \"Analyses.\"\n,, 107 ,, 15 ,, ,, \"D.
