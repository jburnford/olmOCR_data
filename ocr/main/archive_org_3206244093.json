From the evidence of the mother, it appeared that the boy went to school on the Wednesday afternoon at two o'clock quite well, but on returning at four o'clock he was very ill, and said \"a big boy had kicked him in the stomach.\" On Thursday a doctor was sent for, who attended him till his death, which occurred on Saturday last. Nothing could be ascertained as to what boy had committed the assault. The coroner summed up, and the jury, after 15 minutes' deliberation, returned a verdict \"That the deceased died through violence received at the schools, but there is not sufficient evidence to show by whom caused.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206244093.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1844, "total-output-tokens": 257, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 976, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
