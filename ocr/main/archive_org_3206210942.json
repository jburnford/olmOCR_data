One day, however, the mother of the prisoner happened accidentally to put her hand into a box in the prisoner's bedroom, and she there found the dead body of a child, of which the prisoner had, no doubt, been delivered about a fortnight before.\u2014The jury found the prisoner \"Guilty,\" and she was sentenced to be imprisoned, without hard labour, for two months.\n\nFELONIOUS ASSAULT.\u2014Robert Pearl, seventeen, was charged with committing a felonious assault upon Sarah Patty, a girl under ten years of age.\u2014The jury found the prisoner \"Guilty\" of the attempt only, and he was sentenced to be imprisoned and kept to hard labour for one year.\n\nROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE.\u2014George Chambers, twenty-two, labourer, was charged with committing a robbery, accompanied with violence, upon George Steer.\u2014The prosecutor is one of the city police, and on the evening of the 9th of January, he was on his way home in plain clothes, when on passing through Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields, he was assaulted by four men, one of whom seized him round the throat, and forced him down, and while upon the ground he was robbed of all the money in his pockets, a sovereign and 6s. in silver. All the men got away, and the prisoner was not apprehended until the 25th of March. The prosecutor swore positively to his being one of the party by whom the robbery was effected, but he admitted that he had a very slight opportunity of observing the persons of the men who attacked him.\u2014Mr. Cooper urged that the evidence as to his identity was inconclusive, and the jury returned a verdict of \"Not guilty.\"\n\nEMBEZZLEMENT.\u2014John Robert Gibson, forty-six, solicitor, was indicted for embezzling 60l. 11s., 3\u00bds., and 10\u00bds., the property of the Eastern Counties railway, his masters. The jury retired, and after an absence of about an hour, returned a verdict of \"Guilty,\" and at the same time recommended him to mercy on account of his previous position and good character, and the lax manner in which the accounts were kept.\u2014Sentence, eighteen months' hard labour.\n\nTHE EXTENSIVE SILK ROBBERY.\u2014George Blackmore, twenty-eight, paper-stainer, and George Haddon, thirty-eight, packer, were indicted, Haddon for stealing 20lbs. weight of silk, value 53\u00bds., and other goods, the property of Henry Fandel and another, his masters, and Blackmore with feloniously receiving the same, knowing it to be stolen. The prisoner Haddon had been for many years servant to the prosecutor, Messrs. Fandel and Phillips, the well-known silk and Berlin wool merchants, Newgate-street, and had, it appeared, for a long period been plundering his employers of silk braid and heads of great value. A man named Freak was originally charged with the other prisoners, and whilst under remand in the cell he committed suicide.\u2014The prosecutor had lost above 100lbs. weight of silk, varying in value from 51s. 6d. to 70s. per lb., which it appears was sold at prices varying from 12s. to 22s. 6d. per lb.\u2014The jury found the prisoners \"Guilty,\" and Blackmore was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment with hard labour, and Haddon to seven years' penal servitude.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206210942.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 786, "total-output-tokens": 886, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3639, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
