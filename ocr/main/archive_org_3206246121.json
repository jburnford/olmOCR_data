There were also fresh witnesses examined, and one of them, a baker, named Henry Limmer, of Wellington-road, Holloway, swore that he saw the deceased in the passage of her house in flames, and also saw a man throw a pail of water over her, and another pitch her violently to the ground. The deceased then said she had burnt herself, and that she would die.\n\nMr. Hosack said as a public prosecutor had been appointed, he had better be communicated with with a view to ascertaining if he would go on with the case, and for that purpose the inspector would be supplied with a copy of the depositions. The prisoner would be remanded for a week, and in the meantime he could communicate with his solicitor.\n\nThe prisoner, who treated the matter with indifference, was then removed.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206246121.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1154, "total-output-tokens": 546, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2267, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
