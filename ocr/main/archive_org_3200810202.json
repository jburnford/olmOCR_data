Mr. St. John Wontner, solicitor, prosecuted. Detective-sergeant Lowe, of Scotland-yard, deposed that at about half-past five on Wednesday afternoon he and Sergeant Nash went to a house in Harewood-square. The prisoner opened the door, and on the witness asking if he were Mr. Melville (a name which Peach's companion is alleged to have assumed), replied in the negative, and said that his name was W. Selwyn. When the warrant was read to him he exclaimed, \"So help me God I am innocent. I am having a life-sized photograph taken to show to witnesses who have sworn to me. I have just come to town for the purpose of going to the court at the trial as a witness.\" While they were on their way to the Vine-street Police-station he added, \"I called at Peach's house on the night of his arrest, and if I had known there were any bonds there you can take your oath they would not have been found. If I had liked I could have been at Buenos Ayres.\" Among the papers in his rooms the witness found a bundle of documents relating to California and a letter from Peach's son, similar to drafts found in Peach's possession. As they were leaving the house they saw the solicitor who defended Peach approaching, whereupon Selwyn exclaimed, \"I have been reading through the depositions in Peach's case with Peach's solicitor.\" About the prisoner's person and in a hat-box was found altogether about \u00a390. From letters he had it appeared that Selwyn was living in Harewood-square under the name of \"F. Daldren.\" A portion of the depositions taken in Peach's case having been read over, Mr. Newton re-manded the prisoner till Monday, refusing bail.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810202.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1430, "total-output-tokens": 523, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2168, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
