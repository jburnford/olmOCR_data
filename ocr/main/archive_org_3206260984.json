A. Schanfelbirgn, of Fitzroy-square, and a young man named Dagenkolb, were to have been called as witnesses, but refusing to take the oath were not heard.\u2014Inspector A. Pritchard, of the Thames police, deposed that he had made inquiries about the affair, and found that the deceased answered the description of a young man who had been circulated in police informations as having been missing from Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square, since last Sunday night, and the man Schanfelbirgn identified the body as that of Johan De Wilde, an instrument maker, who had for the past few weeks lodged with him. On searching the body a couple of keys, a purse containing 1s. 5\u00bdd., and other articles were found upon him together with pieces of paper with several addresses written upon them, but inquiring at these addresses witness could get no information concerning the deceased, as he was not known. Deceased was last seen alive on Saturday night, when he was in company with the man Dagenkolb at a club in Tottenham-court-road, and as he did not come home on Sunday his landlord reported the fact to the police, and he was circulated as missing.\u2014By the Coroner: He understood that the deceased came to London in search of employment. His parents resided at 48, Garard Doustraat, Amsterdam.\u2014Dr. W. A. Fitz-Rayne stated that he examined the body, and found the skull fractured. Death was certainly not due to drowning, as there was no water in the stomach. He was positive that when deceased received the injury to the head he was alive.\u2014The coroner said he should adjourn the case.\u2014A Juror: I think an eye should be kept upon the man Dagenkolb in the meantime.\u2014The Coroner: The police will take all the necessary steps you suggest.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206260984.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 878, "total-output-tokens": 524, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2143, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
