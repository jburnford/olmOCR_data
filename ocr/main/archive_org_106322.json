By Mr. William Roxburgh, Assistant-surgeon to the Hospital at the said Fort. Communicated by Sir John Pringle, Bart. P. R. S.\n\nRead Jan. 29, 1777.\n\nTHE manner in which I keep my meteorological observations is as follows:\n\nA thermometer without doors; a barometer and thermometer within doors: the barometer and thermometer within doors are kept close together, for the sake of correcting the barometer if required. I observe them three times a day, as per diary. I also set down the direction and strength of the wind, and the state of the weather. I distinguish four degrees of strength of the wind; namely, gentle, brisk, stormy, and what we call a tufoon in India, which you will find marked with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, besides no sensible wind, which is marked with a cypher.\n\nI am ashamed to say, that the rain-gage I had during the rainy season was so indifferent, that I could not with any degree of certainty measure the quantity of rain that fell\nfell here. I have now got a tin cylinder, $5\\frac{2}{10}$ths inches in diameter, or $16\\frac{4}{10}$ths inches in circumference, and 30 inches deep: the quantity of rain that falls I intend to measure with a scale divided into inches and twentieths of an inch; the depth shall be set down every morning if it has rained. I have it placed on the roof of my house, which is about twenty-five feet high; at a considerable distance from any other building, &c. except the hospital, which is distant about one hundred yards, and of the same height; no trees above twelve feet high within many hundred yards.\n\nThe thermometer without doors I have placed under a small shady tree, through which the Sun cannot penetrate, at the same time it is well exposed to air and wind. Every inch on the scale of the barometer I use is divided into twenty equal parts; it is a portable one, made by RAMSDEN.\n\nThe tube of the thermometer without doors is twelve inches long, placed upon a plain open box-wood scale, made by NAIRNE and BLUNT.\n| Hour from Noon | Therm. without | Therm. within | Barom. | Winds Str.
