Mr. Duerdin Dutton appeared for the prosecution and Mr. Bernard Abrahams defended. Ellen Lewis, the prosecutrix, said:\u2014On December 8th last I left home and stayed with my married sister, Mrs. Manning, until April 6th, on which day I entered the service of Mrs. Postlethwaite, of 75, Warwick-street. The defendant afterwards came and took the top front bedroom and afterwards removed to the back room, in which the bed was in the corner. On Sunday, June 4th, I was in the kitchen between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. The bell rang, and I took a candle and tumbler to the defendant's room by direction of my mistress. I put the candle into the candlestick and the tumbler by the side. As I was in the act of doing that the defendant came, and, taking hold of me by the arms, pulled me backwards upon the bed. Mrs. Postlethwaite came in. Cross-examined by Mr. Abrahams: I am nearly seventeen years of age. I am quite sure I have never been into any court before. Mrs. Kate Edith Postlethwaite, wife of John Postlethwaite, brass finisher, 75, Warwick-street, said when she reached the drawing-room door she removed her slippers. When she got to Mr. Deasy's room she saw him standing by the bedside holding complainant by both her hands. The girl was lying across the bed. She ordered him out of the house. Mr. John Deasy, having been duly cautioned by the magistrate, deposed that for the last nine years he had been in Parliament, and had travelled all over the world on behalf of his party. He first heard that a summons had been issued against him on the 19th, when he read of it in a newspaper in Fleet-street. In consequence of this he attended the court voluntarily, having in fact never received the summons. Defendant contended: The girl stepped back to leave the room, and struck against one of my legs\u2014either the right or the left, I don't know which\u2014fell over my knees and on to the bed. I jumped up and said, \"I beg your pardon. I am very sorry. It's my fault.\" While I was saying this I caught her left arm with one hand and by the left wrist with the other. I said, \"It is well you did not fall on the floor, for you would have been hurt.\" I then said, \"Get up. Don't be nervous. Won't you give me a kiss?\" I was pulling her up from the bed when Mrs. Postlethwaite came into the room. I did not assault her in any shape or form. Do you consider it was gentlemanly behaviour to offer to kiss the girl?\" Mr. Abrahams objected. The Magistrate: There is no kind of objection to the question. The question was repeated. Witness: I asked the girl to kiss me, Mr. Dutton: Do you consider that was right conduct on your part? I do not. Mr. De Rutzen said the case was essentially one for a jury and he committed the prisoner for trial at the North London Sessions on Monday next. The defendant was allowed on bail in his own recognisances of \u00a3100.\n\nAt Cheshire adjourned Quarter Sessions on Wednesday, Noah Edwards Porter, thirty-one, pleaded guilty to obtaining various sums by false pretences, representing that he was collecting for treats to poor children at the seaside, and for several bo gus missions. He was caught in Altrincham masquerading as a Church Army officer. He had also a Salvation Army uniform. Porter's books, which showed that he had netted a considerable amount, contained texts and heads of sermons. He said he used to preach and conduct missions at Dronfield, Derbyshire, but had been collecting since March. He was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200811809.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 832, "total-output-tokens": 941, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3790, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
