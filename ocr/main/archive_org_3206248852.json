The prisoner went to the house on Saturday night, and asked to be supplied with drink. Upon being refused, he produced a barrel of gunpowder, and said, \"You will all be in \u2014\u2014 in one minute,\" and attempted to throw the powder on the fire, but was prevented from doing so by his mother, who seized the barrel and threw it into the canal.\n\nKENT.\u2014HOMICIDE IN SELF-DEFENCE.\u2014A man named Thomas Thorner, formerly living at Tovil, near Maidstone, is in custody at Maidstone on a charge of murder at Chillicothe, Ohio, U.S. His defence is that the act was committed in self-defence. The American authorities have directed inquiries to be made as to the man's past character, and the Mayor of Maidstone yesterday held a court to receive evidence on that point. Witnesses spoke of the accused as a quiet and peaceable man, and this evidence will be transmitted to the American authorities in due course.\n\nLANCASHIRE.\u2014EXTRAORDINARY OUTRAGE BY IRISHMEN.\u2014At Haslingden, on Monday, four Irishmen were charged with cutting and wounding a number of Englishmen. On the evening of the Monday previous the prisoners rushed into a beerhouse at Haslingden, and without any provocation attacked the company in the kitchen. They shouted, \"Boycott the English,\" and struck right and left with knives and other instruments. Several of the company were stabbed, and one of them was dangerously injured. Four or five received wounds on the head and were so badly treated that they were unable to follow their employment. The prisoners were committed for trial.\n\nOBJECTING TO THE INCOME-TAX.\u2014At Liverpool, on Monday, a man named Bernard Barlow was charged with threatening Frederick Bustin, cashier to the Income-tax Commissioners at Liverpool. The commissioners had issued a distress warrant upon the prisoner for income-tax, and he was \"sold up,\" since which time the prisoner had annoyed complainant by calling at his office and using abusive language. On Saturday prisoner went to the complainant, and said he would not get home that night, as he (prisoner) had something in his pocket that would \"do\" for him. In consequence of that conduct a warrant was applied for to arrest the prisoner, and in executing it the detective was assaulted by the prisoner's wife. The prisoner was now ordered to find sureties to keep the peace, and his wife, who also appeared in the dock, was sent to gaol for two months, with hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206248852.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 786, "total-output-tokens": 610, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2581, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
