He went out shortly after twelve o'clock, in company with Mr. C. A. Finzel and Mr. N. Poyntz, with the intention of going to Eynsham. At Medley Mr. Moore hired a Rob Roy canoe, whilst his companions engaged a Canadian. The weather was delightfully fine, and all of them partook of luncheon in their boats. Mr. Finzel and Mr. Poyntz were a short distance in front, and as they approached King's Weir they heard the lock-keeper shouting to them. At first they failed to understand what he said, but on looking round they noticed that Mr. Moore's canoe had capsized. They returned to the spot, but he was nowhere to be seen, and at a late hour on Friday night the body had not been recovered. A strong stream was running at the time, and the accident occurred in an awkward bend of the river. Mr. Moore was about nineteen years of age, and came from Uppingham School at the commencement of last October term.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200812702.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2028, "total-output-tokens": 296, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1097, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
