She was seen to put a number of Christmas cards and other articles in a bag she carried, and at her house 114 new books were found, most of which were identified as belonging to the prosecutors, as they had not been sold. Medical evidence was called on her behalf, to show that she was suffering from an internal disease which would seriously affect her mental capacity. She was committed for trial.\n\nALLEGED DOUBLE MURDER.\u2014At Liverpool, on Thursday, a coroner's jury returned a verdict of \"Wilful murder\" against a domestic servant named M'Donald. From the evidence it appeared that last month the body of a child, which had evidently been concealed for some months, was found in a box in an attic of an hotel where M'Donald was employed; but the body was in such an advanced state of decomposition that it was impossible to hold an inquest. Soon afterwards suspicions were aroused, and a search resulted in the finding, in a coal cellar of the hotel, of the body of another child recently born which had been strangled with a handkerchief. The prisoner, on being arrested, acknowledged that both children were hers.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206260927.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2028, "total-output-tokens": 313, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1300, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
