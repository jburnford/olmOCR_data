The lines on which the revision of District Gazetteers is to be undertaken are there laid down as follows:\n\n\"The chief difficulty which stands in the way of the periodical revision of the existing Gazetteers, and that reason which has caused so large a portion of their contents to become obsolete, is that they contain a mixture of permanent matter, such as that relating to the history, physical characteristics, religion, ethnography, &c., of the district; of matter which changes gradually but, as a rule, slowly, such as that dealing with the agricultural and economic conditions and of ephemeral matter, mainly statistical, which soon becomes out of date. For this reason, when a new District Gazetteer is issued it should consist of two volumes, A and B, compiled on the following lines:\n\n\"(1) In the first edition all descriptive matter should go into the A volume; but the volume should contain only such general figures (incorporated in the letter-press) as are necessary to give point to remarks in the text. All detailed statistics should be relegated to the B volume, which would, at first, consist only of these and of such notes as may be necessary to elucidate them.\n\n\"(2) On the occasion of the next revision the statistics in the B volume should be re-compiled, and this volume should be expanded by adding to it any matter that might be required to correct or supplement the A volume. Thus if there had been a famine since A was published, if a new railway had been opened, and so forth, information on these points would appear in B as supplementary to the appropriate chapters in A.\n\n\"(3) This process would go on till the time had come for revising the A volume. Then all the supplementary text matter should be incorporated in the new A volume, and B would revert to its original form as a statistical appendix with explanatory notes.\n\n\"(4) A new edition of the B volume should be brought out after each census. The revision of the A volume must be left to the discretion of the Local Governments. The occurrence of a new settlement will ordinarily be the best time for such revision.*\n\n*In the Punjab the Settlement Officer is generally entrusted with the revision of the District Gazetteer, and this plan is commended for adoption in other Provinces.\nbut it may well happen that plenty of copies of the original A volume are still available, and that the settlement and lapse of time have not wrought any important change in the conditions of the district. In that case the revision of A should stand over till the stock of it no longer suffices for the demand; but a brief account of the settlement operations and of the changes which they have produced or disclosed in the state of affairs described in the A volume, should be prepared by the Settlement Officer before he is relieved of his duties for inclusion in the next decennial B volume.\n\n\"(5) The statistical part of the B volume should be issued with interleaved blank pages, so that those who use it can have the figures of later years written in. The tables included in the B volume should be drawn up on uniform lines, and should contain the main administrative statistics of the district and its tahsils or other sub-divisions. * * * It is thought that including the explanatory notes they should not ordinarily exceed a maximum limit of 50 pages.\"\n\nInstead of issuing the tables with interleaved blank pages as suggested in para. (5) above, it has been found convenient to print the tables themselves with blank spaces in which to insert the figures of future years. The pages occupied by the statistical matter thus include the space which in the original scheme would have been appropriated by the interleaved pages, and consequently are in excess of the maximum fixed in para. (5).\n## INDEX TO STATISTICAL TABLES.\n\n| Table No. | Subject | Page |\n|-----------|---------|------|\n| **CHAPTER I.\u2014DESCRIPTIVE.** |\n| **Section A.\u2014Physical Aspects Including
