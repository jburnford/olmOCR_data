Mr. Kyd prosecuted. This was a most daring robbery, as it took place outside the police-station in Commercial-street, and was witnessed by some constables who were in the tea-room at the time. The prosecutor, who was not sober, was surrounded by several men, one of whom took his watch and pin, whilst the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and took out 7s. 6d. The prosecutor shouted out that he had been robbed, and Police-constable Simmonds advised him to go to the station, and he and the prisoner went in the company of Police-constable Barnes. The prisoner was found guilty. Warder Humphreys proved that the prisoner was convicted twice in 1857, three times in 1858, twice in 1859, once in 1860, twice in 1861, twice in 1863, was sentenced to six years' hard labour in 1864, eighteen months in 1870, four months in 1873, ten years in 1876, was convicted twice in 1888, four times in 1889, three times in 1890, four times in 1891, three times in 1892. Mr. Warry said that such people could not be allowed to prey on the public. The sentence would be one of ten years' penal servitude.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810644.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1798, "total-output-tokens": 397, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1290, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
