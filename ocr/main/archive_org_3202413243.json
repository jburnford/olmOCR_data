Mrs. Mary Margaret Fitton, of Clifton-row, Old Kent-road, said: Yesterday, between two and three o'clock, I went into one of the Old Kent-road omnibuses, for the purpose of coming into the City. Soon afterwards the prisoner came into the omnibus, and sat next to me. I had ascertained that my purse was in my pocket after she took her seat. In the course of the journey I felt a pull at my dress, and on looking down saw the prisoner's hand hanging down. I got off at the end of King William-street, and the prisoner got off at the same time. She confessed to me that the crossing was a very dangerous one, and I immediately missed my purse, and putting my hand on her arm I accused her of having taken it. It contained a cheque upon the Bank for \u00a3217s. 6d. and a sovereign. She said that I had better search the omnibus, and I gave her in charge to a policeman. The purse and cheque produced by the police are those I was robbed of. Hannah Curtain, a milkwoman, said: I went this morning, at twenty minutes before eight, to the King's Head, Southwark, and met a woman with a child in the conveyance. I saw behind the outer door of the passage on the corner something which I picked up, and found to be this purse and piece of paper (the cheque). They were lying down apart from each other. The prisoner protested that she knew nothing whatever of the purse or the cheque. The Lord Mayor committed her to Newgate for trial.\n\nGUILDHALL.\n\nRobbery of Children.\u2014On Wednesday Elizabeth Sokalska, a young girl about fourteen years of age, was brought up before Alderman Lawrence, for further examination, relative to a variety of charges of robbing little children of portions of their wearing apparel. The court was thronged with children of all ages, who were in attendance to identify the prisoner, against whom there were from twenty to thirty distinct charges of felony. The system pursued by the prisoner was that of following children, and so ascertaining their Christian names, by which she immediately addressed them, and, by making the most amiable overtures, after the health of their persons, would offer to sell them that her mother had just brought over from France a quantity of dolls and other toys, and offered to give some to the children if they would give her something to carry them in, and, under such pretences, she deprived them of various articles of their wearing apparel. In one instance, she took the gold ear-rings from the ears of a child, and in a great many others she contented herself with cloaks, bonnets, shawls, and boots. The prisoner cried very bitterly during the examination, and stated in her defence that her father was a Pole, and had been abroad for four years, and that she had seen three years in the College at St. Francis, which she left just before Christmas; but, unfortunately, she fell into bad company, and was induced to commit the wicked acts she was charged with. An officer who was present said he knew the prisoner and her parents, and they were a bad lot all altogether, the father being still alive and convicted, if not already transported. The prisoner said her real name was Fetan, and that Sokalska was only her father-in-law. Alderman Lawrence said he should not send her for trial, as was at first intended, but would commit her to the House of Correction for three months.\n\nWORSHIP-STREET.\n\nBrutal Robbery.\u2014On Tuesday, a middle-aged man, named James Fletcher, was charged with having been concerned with a number of other men who have escaped apprehension, in the following scandalous robbery.\u2014An infirm and aged man named John Dove, by trade a weaver, had contrived for a number of years past to save a small portion of his scanty earnings, and, for better security, deposited the amount in the Whitechapel Savings-bank. Thinking it better, however, on Tuesday, to invest his money in another way, he went to the bank at four o'clock and withdrew the whole of it, receiving two bank-notes for \u00a35 and \u00a310 each, a number of sovereigns and a small quantity of silver, with which he was on his way home to Mile-end-road, Hackney, when he went into a public-house. Before he could drink what he had ordered the prisoner and three other men, who, he felt satisfied, had been watching him, suddenly entered and invited him to drink with them; this he declined to do, and, after pressing him uselessly for some time, one of them called for a glass of spirits, put it to his lips, and forced a portion of the contents into his mouth. He jerked his head aside to avoid it, and while doing so saw one of the other men pouring something out of another glass into his; this convinced him that it was a premeditated attempt to stupefy and rob him, and he therefore refused to drink any more. He hurried out of the house, but he had not gone five yards when he was overtaken by those four men and several others, two of whom laid hold of each of his arms, under pretence of assisting him, and \"helped\" him along till they got to a beer-shop, into which they thrust him, in spite of his efforts to disengage himself, and, notwithstanding his positive refusal to drink anything, called for some ale, and compelled him to swallow a small portion of it. This he had no sooner drank than he became so", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3202413243.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 694, "total-output-tokens": 1260, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 5476, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
