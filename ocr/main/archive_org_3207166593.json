Consols have scarcely shown a variation, except that they terminate $\\frac{1}{8}$ higher than yesterday.\n\nThe transactions in the Foreign Funds have been unimportant, except in so far as concerns Spanish and Portuguese Bonds; the former have been quoted at $55\\frac{1}{2}$, and have closed within $\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent. of that quotation; the latter have closed at $86\\frac{1}{2}$ to $\\frac{3}{8}$, after having touched upon 87.\n\nIt now appears that the meeting called for tomorrow of those disposed to manifest their loyal attachment to the King, will not be made up exclusively of persons who measure their loyalty by the strength of their adhesion to an Administration dictated by the Duke of Wellington; there is good reason to believe that a considerable number of influential citizens, honestly disposed to manifest the truest loyalty to their Sovereign, will avail themselves of the opportunity which this meeting gives them of conveying to the ear of the King more wholesome lessons than would be derived from the Winchester school.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3207166593.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2074, "total-output-tokens": 277, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1182, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
