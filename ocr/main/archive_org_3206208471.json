The calendar contained the names of 54 prisoners for trial; 47 were charged with felony and 7 with misdemeanour.\n\nTHE ROBBERY AT SIR C. NAPIER'S.\u2014Elizabeth Jenkins, fifty-four, a matronly-looking woman, was indicted for stealing the sum of \u00a367, 11s., 7\u00bdd., and other sums, the moneys of Sir Charles Napier, her master. The prisoner entered Sir Charles's service as housekeeper before he went out in command of the Baltic fleet in 1854, and was discharged by him in February last, when about 5\u00bd was due to her for her wages, for which she was to call the next day, but she did not trouble herself about it. Sir Charles appeared to have been very precise in keeping his accounts with the prisoner, and paid her regularly every month money with which she was to pay tradesmen's bills, but she appropriated the money to her own use, and allowed the accounts to run on in the tradesmen's books. In some instances the tradesmen wrote to Sir Charles requesting payment, but the letters never reached his hands, for the prisoner used to intercept them, and destroyed all those containing bills, or relating to matters of account which she had received money to settle, and sometimes she even prevented official letters addressed to him coming into his possession. She did this in collusion with another servant, the butler, it was suggested, with whom she was living, at 24, Clifton-street, Shepherd's-bush, when she was taken into custody, by applying the steam from the spout of a kettle of boiling water to the gummed back of the envelopes, and those which they did not object to Sir Charles having were again gummed down, dried, and put on his table. After the prisoner left, some of Sir Charles's tradesmen's letters came to his hands direct and untampered with, and then the prisoner's system of fraud was made apparent. When the prisoner was apprehended she said the prosecutor was an old vagabond, expressed her surprise that he should have the daring hardihood and impudence to follow her, and said the receipts for the money would be found in an old hair trunk she had left behind her. This Sir Charles told her had been searched, and no such receipts found. The total amount of which she had plundered her master was about \u00a3200. The jury found prisoner \"Guilty.\"\n\nThe learned judge said a worse case could not be conceived, and not only as a punishment to her, but as an example and warning to others, the unanimous judgment of the court was that the prisoner be kept in penal servitude for five years. The prisoner seemed astounded, and said she did not deserve it. \u2014The learned judge: Indeed you do, most richly a worse case I never heard of.\n\nROBBERY BY A SERVANT.\u2014Charles Dyer, twenty-seven, warehouseman, in the employment of Messrs. H. J. and Donald Nicoll, was indicted for stealing six yards of cloth and other articles, value 7l., the property of his masters. He pleaded guilty, and the learned judge sentenced him to twelve months' hard labour, remarking that robberies by servants were the worst cases of larceny a court of justice had to deal with.\n\nA LUCKY ESCAPE.\u2014James Gill, nineteen, was indicted for feloniously stealing three brass weights, value 4s. 6d., a quantity of brass chain, and a portion of a scale, the property of Benjamin Greenhill, a scale-maker, of High Holborn, his master; and John Silpess, thirty-one, a marine store dealer, in White Lion-street, Seven Dials, was indicted for feloniously receiving the same. Gill pleaded guilty, and was called as a witness for the prosecution. The other prisoner bought the weights, which were manufactured and stamped, at less than the price of old brass, but the jury found out a doubt, of which they gave him the benefit, and acquitted him. \u2014The Judge: The jury have acquitted you, and the verdict is theirs, not mine; had you been found guilty I should have given you a very exemplary punishment, for this is not the first time you have stood in that dock for receiving stolen goods. It is such as you who make the thieves, and you are very lucky that you have escaped again. \u2014The prisoner Gill was sentenced to three months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206208471.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 694, "total-output-tokens": 985, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4206, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
