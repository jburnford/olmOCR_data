Chief Inspector Phillips said there were a number of charges against the prisoner, all the robberies alleged being under similar circumstances. The prisoner was taken into custody, it appeared, on a charge of stealing a watch, and other articles, value \u00a312, from the residence of Miss Keene, 8 Belgrave-terrace, Lee. The prisoner called at the house and represented that he had been sent by the landlord to see to the blinds. He was given access to the bedrooms, and after he had gone a watch, two rings, and two lockets were missed. His statement of having been sent to the house was found to be false. The prisoner was ultimately arrested on this charge, and he was subsequently charged with the robbery from Sir R. Cunliffe's upon information given by a young woman charged before the magistrate with the unlawful possession of a diamond ring. Robert Woollam, footman to Sir Robert, deposed that on March 23 the prisoner came to the house and said he had come to measure the blinds. Witness said new blinds were not required, whereupon prisoner said he had been sent to put some new springs. He was permitted to go upstairs, and witness afterwards let him out at the front door. The house was being painted. Sir Robert Cunliffe was sworn, and said a quantity of jewellery was missed on the evening of March 23 by Lady Cunliffe, with whom he had been out during the day. It was taken from the drawers in her dressing-table. He had since identified a pair of paste buckles, gold locket, emerald ring, two diamond rings, pair of crystal studs, Normandy cross, single paste buckle, carbuncle locket, pair of earrings, and two other rings. Other articles of jewellery and a purse containing \u00a34 in gold and a \u00a35 note were stolen. Jane Pring, mother of the prisoner, proved pledging several of the articles at her son's request. The prisoner was further remanded for a week.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200797029.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1292, "total-output-tokens": 521, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2127, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
