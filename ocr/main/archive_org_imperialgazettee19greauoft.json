Nor has it been thought necessary to mark vowels as long in cases where mistakes in pronunciation were not likely to be made.\n\nConsonants\n\nMost Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, &c., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics. As the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation, it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic \u1e05, a strong guttural, has been represented by \u1e05 instead of q, which is often used. Secondly, it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and \u1e6dh (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in 'this' or 'thin,' but should be pronounced as in 'woodhouse' and 'boathook.'\nBurmese Words\n\nBurmese and some of the languages on the frontier of China have the following special sounds:\n\n- aw has the vowel-sound in 'law.'\n- \u014d and \u016b are pronounced as in German.\n- gy is pronounced almost like j in 'jewel.'\n- ky is pronounced almost like ch in 'church.'\n- th is pronounced in some cases as in 'this,' in some cases as in 'thin.'\n- w after a consonant has the force of uw. Thus, ywa and pwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written yuwa and puwe.\n\nIt should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe names of some places\u2014e.g. Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore\u2014have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribed for others. Names of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spelling has been generally adopted in English books.\n\nNotes on Money, Prices, Weights and Measures\n\nAs the currency of India is based upon the rupee, all statements with regard to money throughout the Gazetteer have necessarily been expressed in rupees, nor has it been found possible to add generally a conversion into sterling. Down to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee (containing 165 grains of pure silver) was approximately equal to 2s., or one-tenth of a \u00a3; and for that period it is easy to convert rupees into sterling by striking off the final cipher (Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100). But after 1873, owing to the depreciation of silver as compared with gold throughout the world, there came a serious and progressive fall in the exchange, until at one time the gold value of the rupee dropped as low as 1s. In order to provide a remedy for the heavy loss caused to the Government of India in respect of its gold payments to be made in England, and also to relieve foreign trade and finance from the inconvenience due to constant and unforeseen fluctuations in exchange, it was resolved in 1893 to close the mints to the free coinage of silver, and thus force up the value of the rupee by restricting the circulation. The intention was to raise\nthe exchange value of the rupee to 1s. 4d., and then introduce a gold standard (though not necessarily a gold currency) at the rate of Rs. 15 = \u00a31. This policy has been completely successful. From 1899 onwards the value of the rupee has been maintained, with insignificant fluctuations, at the proposed rate of 1s. 4d.; and consequently since that date three rupees have been equivalent to two rupees before 1873.\n\nFor the intermediate period, between 1873 and 1899, it is manifestly impossible to adopt any fixed sterling value for a constantly changing rupee. But since 1899, if it is desired to convert rupees into sterling, not only must the final cipher be struck off (as before 1873), but also one-third must be subtracted from the result. Thus Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100 - $\\frac{1}{3}$ = (about) \u00a367.\n\nAnother matter in connexion with the expression of money statements in terms of rupees requires to be explained. The method of numerical notation in India differs from that which prevails throughout Europe. Large numbers are not punctuated in hundreds of thousands and millions, but in lakhs and crores. A lakh is one hundred thousand (written out as 1,00,000), and a crore is one hundred lakhs or ten millions (written out as 1,00,00,000). Consequently, according to the exchange value of the rupee, a lakh of rupees (Rs. 1,00,000) may be read as the equivalent of \u00a310,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a36,667 after 1899; while a crore of rupees (Rs. 1,00,00,000) may similarly be read as the equivalent of \u00a31,000,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a3666,667 after 1899.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the rupee is divided into 16 annas, a fraction commonly used for many purposes by both natives and Europeans. The anna was formerly reckoned as 1$\\frac{1}{2}$d.; it may now be considered as exactly corresponding to 1d. The anna is again subdivided into 12 pies.\n\nThe various systems of weights used in India combine uniformity of scale with immense variations in the weight of units. The scale used generally throughout Northern India, and less commonly in Madras and Bombay, may be thus expressed: one maund = 40 seers; one seer = 16 chittaks or 80 tolas. The actual weight of a seer varies greatly from District to District, and even from village to village; but in the standard system the tola is 180 grains Troy (the exact weight of the rupee), and the seer thus weighs 2\u00b7057 lb., and the maund 82\u00b728 lb. This standard is used in official reports and throughout the Gazetteer.\n\nFor calculating retail prices, the universal custom in India is to express them in terms of seers to the rupee. Thus, when prices change, what varies is not the amount of money to be paid for the\nsame quantity, but the quantity to be obtained for the same amount of money. In other words, prices in India are quantity prices, not money prices. When the figure of quantity goes up, this of course means that the price has gone down, which is at first sight perplexing to an English reader. It may, however, be mentioned that quantity prices are not altogether unknown in England, especially at small shops, where pennyworths of many groceries can be bought. Eggs, likewise, are commonly sold at a varying number for the shilling.\n\nIf it be desired to convert quantity prices from Indian into English denominations without having recourse to money prices (which would often be misleading), the following scale may be adopted\u2014based upon the assumptions that a seer is exactly 2 lb., and that the value of the rupee remains constant at 1s. 4d.: 1 seer per rupee = (about) 3 lb. for 2s.; 2 seers per rupee = (about) 6 lb. for 2s.; and so on.\n\nThe name of the unit for square measurement in India generally is the bigha, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. But areas have always been expressed throughout the Gazetteer either in square miles or in acres.\n\nMAPS\n\nNepal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . to face p. 42\n\nNorth-West Frontier Province . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , 218\nN\u0101yakanhatti.\u2014Town in the Challakere taluk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, situated in $14^\\circ 28' N.$ and $76^\\circ 33' E.$, 14 miles north-west of Challakere town. Population (1901), 2,858. The name was formerly Hatti. It was founded by a Naik, who came here with large droves of superior cattle from near Sr\u012bsailam in Kurnool District in search of pasture. He was recognized as a polig\u0101r by Vijayanagar, and exchanged some of his cattle for Molak\u0101lmuru. The territory was captured by the chiefs of Chitaldroog, and was held by them till subdued by Haidar Ali. At N\u0101yakanhatti is a tomb and temple dedicated to a Mah\u0101purusha or saint of the Ling\u0101yats, to which sect most of the people belong. The municipality, formed in 1899, became a Union in 1904. The receipts and expenditure for two years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 500. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 1,100 and Rs. 3,300.\n\nNay\u0101nagar.\u2014Town in Merw\u0101ra, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See Be\u0101war.\n\nNazareth.\u2014Village in the Srivaikuntam taluk of Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in $8^\\circ 34' N.$ and $77^\\circ 59' E.$, 22 miles from P\u0101kamcottah. Population (1901), 4,351, of whom 2,690 were Christians. As its name shows, Nazareth is a missionary village; and it contains a high school for girls, an art industrial school (one of the most prominent in the Madras Presidency), an orphan asylum, and a mission hospital. It is the head-quarters of a Christian mission, which numbers 12,000 adherents and includes 2,000 school-children. Good hand-made lace is manufactured at the art school.\n\nN\u0101zir\u0101 (or Gargaon).\u2014Village in Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 56' N.$ and $94^\\circ 45' E.$, on the left bank of the Dikho river, about 9 miles south-east of Sibs\u0101gar town. It was the capital of the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101s from the middle of the sixteenth to the end of the seventeenth century, but was twice captured, once by the Koch king Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan and once by M\u012br Jumla, Naw\u0101b of Dacca. The Muhammadan historian states that the town had four gates, each about 3 kos distant from the R\u0101j\u0101\u2019s palace. The palace itself was a magnificent structure, the building of which had afforded occupation to 12,000\nworkmen for a year, and the ornaments and curiosities with which the whole woodwork was filled defied all description. Robinson, writing in 1844, describes the ruins as follows:\n\n'The royal palace was surrounded by a brick wall about 2 miles in circumference; but the whole town and its suburbs appear to have extended over many square miles of country. The ruins of gateways, built chiefly of masonry, are still to be seen within the fortified circumvallations which surrounded the town. One of the gateways is composed principally of large blocks of stone, bearing marks of iron crampings, which evidently show that they once belonged to far more ancient edifices.'\n\nN\u0101zir\u0101 is now the head-quarters of the Assam Tea Company, and a considerable bazar has sprung up on the banks of the river, to which N\u0101g\u0101s bring down chillies, betel-leaf, rubber, and bamboo mats. Salt, grain, piece-goods, and oil are imported in large quantities to meet the demands of the cooly population. The place is connected by rail with Gauh\u0101ti and Dibrugarh, and contains a high school with an average attendance in 1903\u20134 of 164 boys.\n\nNeddiavattam.\u2014Village in Nilgiri District, Madras. See Naduvattam.\n\nNeemuch.\u2014Town and British cantonment in Central India. See Nimach.\n\nNegapatam Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Tanjore District, Madras, consisting of the Negapatam and Nannilam taluks.\n\nNegapatam Taluk.\u2014Coast taluk of Tanjore District, Madras, lying between 10\u00b0 32' and 10\u00b0 50' N. and 79\u00b0 34' and 79\u00b0 51' E., with an area of 240 square miles. The population fell from 220,165 in 1891 to 217,607 in 1901; but the taluk still stands second in the District and fifth in the Presidency in regard to density, which is 907 persons per square mile. The taluk contains proportionately more educated people than any other in the District; and it owes this characteristic and its general importance to Negapatam Town (population, 57,190), the headquarters, which is a large municipality and seaport. The only other considerable town is Tiruval\u016br (15,436), noted for its temple and the idol car belonging thereto. The number of villages is 189. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 5,75,000. Although it lies within the Cauvery delta, the south-easternmost portions are beyond the irrigation system which depends upon that river. It contains no alluvial soil and the land is not of a very high class.\n\nNegapatam Town (Ptolemy's Nigamos and Rashid-ud-din's Mali-fattn).\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name and seaport in Tanjore District, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 46' N. and 79\u00b0 51' E., 212 miles from Madras by the South Indian Railway and its branch, the District board line. The population in 1871 was 48,525; in 1881,\n53,855; in 1891, 59,221; and in 1901, 57,190. It now ranks as the ninth largest town in the Presidency. In 1901 Hindus formed nearly 68 per cent. of the population, Musalmans 22 per cent., and Christians 10 per cent. Nagore, within municipal limits to the north, is a stronghold of the Marakkayan traders, a mixed class of Muhammadans.\n\nNegapatam was in very ancient times the capital city of the little-known N\u0101ga people, from whom its name (N\u0101gapattanam) is apparently derived. Later it became one of the earliest settlements of the Portuguese on the east coast, and was called by them the city of Choramandel. It was also one of the earliest centres of the Portuguese Christian missions. It was captured by the Dutch in 1660, and was the chief of their Indian possessions till 1781. Meanwhile Nagore had been sold to the Dutch by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Tanjore in 1773, but was soon afterwards wrested from them by the Naw\u0101b of the Carnatic with the aid of the English. It was afterwards restored to the R\u0101j\u0101, who made a grant of it to the Company in 1776. During the war of 1780-1 Haidar Ali of Mysore ceded the place to the Dutch, with the result that an expedition from Madras under Sir Hector Munro captured both Nagore and Negapatam in November, 1781. When in 1799 the Tanjore kingdom came into British hands by treaty, Negapatam was made the District head-quarters and remained so until 1845. A divisional officer, an Executive Engineer, a Sub-Judge, an Assistant Commissioner of Separate Revenue, an Assistant Superintendent of police, and a Port officer are still stationed here. There are also a branch of the Bank of Madras and an agent for emigration to the Straits Settlements. The South Indian Railway has extensive workshops in the town, and two companies of their volunteer corps have their headquarters here. The place contains three high schools for boys, two of them being maintained by missionary bodies. Nagore possesses two Arabic schools, and there is a third at Negapatam. Of the many temples only one is ancient. It is dedicated to K\u0101y\u0101rohanasw\u0101mi, and is called K\u0101ronam and occasionally Cholakulavallipattinam in the inscriptions of R\u0101j\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 and other Chola kings. A stone tablet at a small temple records in Dutch that this pagoda was built in A.D. 1777 under the auspices of the Governor Reynier van Vlissingen. The Nagore darg\u0101h, whose white minarets (one of them 90 feet high) are one of the best-known landmarks along the coast, was built over the tomb of the saint M\u012br\u0101n S\u0101hib Makhan. The inscriptions on the tomb relate that it was built in eleven days by Prat\u0101p Singh of Tanjore in Hijra 1171 (A.D. 1757). The Kandiri festival, one of the greatest Muhammadan festivals in Southern India, is celebrated here on the anniversary of the saint\u2019s death.\n\nNegapatam and Nagore were incorporated as a single municipality in 1866. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending\n1902-3 averaged Rs. 77,000 and Rs. 78,000 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 76,000, the principal receipts being the house and land taxes (Rs. 27,000), the profession tax (Rs. 9,500), tolls (Rs. 8,000), and scavenging and other fees (Rs. 8,000). The total expenditure of Rs. 75,000 included conservancy (Rs. 29,000), hospitals and dispensaries (Rs. 7,000), and roads and buildings (Rs. 10,500). The municipal hospital, originally built by private subscription, contains 46 beds. Schemes for drainage and water-supply have been framed at an estimated cost of Rs. 4,13,000 and Rs. 2,32,000 respectively. The latter project has had to be dropped for want of funds.\n\nUntil 1845 Negapatam was the chief port south of Madras; thereafter its trade declined for some time owing to the superior advantages of Tranquebar, which in that year had become a British possession by purchase from Denmark. But the opening of the South Indian Railway to Negapatam in 1861 restored its trade. A lighthouse 80 feet high, which has recently been fitted with a revolving light, was erected in 1869. In 1876, however, the railway brought Tuticorin into touch with Madras city, and since then Negapatam has again declined in importance. The opening of the line to K\u0101rik\u0101l and up the northeastern coast has still further contributed towards this result. The trade of Negapatam is now chiefly with Ceylon, Burma, and the Straits Settlements, and also to a very small extent with the United Kingdom and Spain. Excluding coasting trade, the total imports in 1903-4 were valued at 12.3 lakhs, and the total exports at 65.7 lakhs. The chief imports were areca-nuts (8.3 lakhs), gunny-bags, camphor, cotton piece-goods, and apparel. Among lesser imports may be mentioned skins, tobacco, miscellaneous provisions, sugar, wrought metals, gums and resins, wood and furniture. The principal exports were rice (22.3 lakhs), cotton piece-goods (6.8), live-stock, ghi, tobacco, cigars, turmeric, and skins. The minor exports were fruits and vegetables, chillies, sugar, and oil-cake. In 1903-4 the coasting trade consisted of imports to the value of 23.6 lakhs and exports to the value of 9.1 lakhs. Negapatam is an important centre of emigration to the Straits Settlements and Natal.\n\nNekmard.\u2014A long-established fair till recently held annually for a week in the middle of April in the village of Bhaw\u0101nandpur in the Th\u0101kurgaon subdivision of Din\u0101jpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam (25\u00b0 59' N. and 88\u00b0 16' E.), near the tomb of a Muhammadan saint from which it takes its name. It is one of the largest cattle fairs in the Province, being attended by about 150,000 people from all parts of the country. Bullocks, principally from Bih\u0101r, are bought up by agents from Mymensingh and adjacent Districts; ponies from the Bhutan hills, country-bred horses from Bih\u0101r, elephants and camels are also sold in large numbers; and traders frequent the fair with\nmiscellaneous articles of every description from the farthest corners of India. In recent years Government has prohibited the holding of this fair as a precaution against plague.\n\n**Nelamangala.**\u2014Northern taluk of Bangalore District, Mysore, lying between 12\u00b0 58' and 13\u00b0 26' N. and 77\u00b0 11' and 77\u00b0 32' E., with an area of 272 square miles. The population in 1901 was 71,952, compared with 63,119 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, Ty\u0101magondal (population, 4,099) and Nelamangala (4,025), the headquarters; and 337 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,37,000. The Ark\u0101vati runs through the east, and the west has a chain of hills, of which Sivaganga (4,559 feet) is the highest point. The west is broken and jungly, while the other parts are open and contain some large valleys with fine tanks. The soil is chiefly a red mould, shallow and gravelly. Iron ore is found in some parts.\n\n**Nelliampathi.**\u2014Range of hills in Cochin State, Madras, forming a section of the Western Gh\u0101ts. They lie 20 miles to the south of P\u0101lgh\u0101t, which is the nearest railway station, between 10\u00b0 26' and 10\u00b0 42' N. and 76\u00b0 31' and 76\u00b0 52' E.\n\nThe range varies in height from 1,500 to 5,000 feet above the sea, and consists of a succession of ridges cut off from one another by valleys containing dark evergreen forests. In the centre of the range is an extensive plateau, the average elevation of which is over 3,000 feet. The highest peak in the range is Nellikkotta or Padagiri, 5,200 feet above sea-level. Karimalagopuram, Vell\u0101chimudi, Valiyavana Ridge, My\u0101nmudi, and V\u0101lavach\u0101n are other peaks, each over 4,000 feet in height. The climate of the range is cool and pleasant during the greater part of the year, but is malarious in March, April, and May. The monsoon rains are heavy, the average annual fall being 155 inches. In 1903 the thermometer ranged from 60\u00b0 in December to 84\u00b0 in April, the mean temperature being 72\u00b0.\n\nThroughout the Nelliampathi and the adjoining country of Parambikolam, the hills are densely covered with teak and other trees which grow in this generous soil to very large dimensions. Until recently, these forests had never been worked for want of a suitable outlet to the plains. A tramway and timber slide have now, however, been constructed, which will render accessible the valuable produce of this range. On the plateau above referred to, land was opened out for coffee-growing in 1864. There are now eighteen estates, of which seventeen are owned by Europeans. The total area assigned for coffee cultivation is 8,502 acres, of which 3,177 acres are under mature plants. The yield in 1903-4 was 2,885 cwt., or an average of 91 lb. per acre of mature plants. From 800 to 1,000 labourers are employed on the plantations, and the annual quit-rent amounts to Rs. 13,000. The State has constructed a gh\u0101t road to the estates, the length of\nwhich from the foot of the gh\u0101\u1e6d to the plateau is 23 miles and the steepest gradient 1 in 6. About 15 miles of road on the plateau connect the estates with one another. The State maintains a dispensary and a police station. The population of the range is 3,018, of whom 310 are K\u0101dans, the only jungle folk found in these hills.\n\nNellikuppam.\u2014Town in the Cuddalore t\u0101luk of South Arcot District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 46' N. and 79\u00b0 41' E., on the South Indian Railway. The population in 1901 was 13,137. It is a Union under the Local Boards Act (V of 1884). Next to Porto Novo, it contains more Musalm\u0101ns than any other town in the District. A large distillery and sugar factory close to the railway station afford employment to about 1,000 hands. In and about the town considerable areas are cultivated with sugar-cane to supply the factory; and the betel-vine is largely grown, the leaves being exported to Madras and other places.\n\nNellore District (Nelluru, perhaps meaning 'rice-town').\u2014District on the east coast of the Madras Presidency, north of Madras City, lying between 13\u00b0 29' and 16\u00b0 1' N. and 79\u00b0 5' and 80\u00b0 16' E. After Vizagapatam it is the largest in the Presidency, its area being 8,761 square miles. It forms part of the plains of the Carnatic, and is bounded on the east by the Bay of Bengal; on the south by the Districts of Chingleput and North Arcot; on the west by the Eastern Gh\u0101\u1e6ds; and on the north by the District of Gunt\u016br. The country rises very gradually till it reaches the foot of the Gh\u0101\u1e6ds on the west. The outer range of these, known locally as the Velikondas ('outside hills'), separates Nellore from Cuddapah and Kurnool along nearly the whole of its western side. In the north-west, however, the range breaks up and recedes much more to the west, and in this region it lacks the bold and rugged aspect which distinguishes it in the south. It is the only range of hills in the District of any importance. The soil of Nellore is not naturally fertile, and large portions of it are either rocky wastes or covered with scrub jungle. A narrow belt of alluvial and backwater deposits, varying in width from 2 to 1.4 miles, runs close to, and parallel with, the sea. The best known of the backwaters is the Pulicat Lake, which lies partly within this District and almost cuts off the Sriharikota Island from the mainland. The scenery of Nellore is uninteresting, its distinguishing feature being wide extents of scrub jungle. Fine groves are occasionally found in the neighbourhood of villages and tanks, and in places stretches of bright green rice contrasting with dark clumps of trees form pretty pictures. Inland the\n\n1 While this work was passing through the press, the Ongole t\u0101luk of this District was transferred to the newly-formed Collectorate of Gunt\u016br. The present article, as a rule, deals with the District as it stood before this alteration.\ncountry is particularly monotonous and dreary, though the line of the Gh\u0101ts is bold and precipitous.\n\nThe principal rivers which drain the District traverse it from west to east and fall into the Bay of Bengal. They are seven in number, and are of the usual South Indian type, dry during the greater portion of the year but carrying heavy floods during the rainy season. None of them is practicable for navigation except the Kandleru, up which boats drawing 2 or 3 feet can proceed for about 25 miles. The southernmost is the Swarnamukhi, which rises in the Chittoor hills, flows for about 30 miles in a north-easterly direction through the District, and falls into the Bay of Bengal 9 miles north of Armagon. North of this is the Kandleru, which bears various names in different parts of its course. Rising in the Velikondas, it flows past Gud\u016br and empties itself into the sea near Kistnapatam. Its water is salt from Gud\u016br downwards. Farther north is the Penner, the most important of all, on which the town of Nellore, the head-quarters of the District, is situated. It rises in the Nandidroog hills in Mysore, and after a course of 285 miles in Anantapur and Cuddapah enters this District through a fine gorge in the Velikondas at Somasila. It flows in a broad and sandy bed for 70 miles in a generally eastern direction through the t\u0101luks of Atmak\u016br and Nellore, and debouches into the sea through several openings 18 miles below Nellore town. The river is useless for navigation, but a very large area is now irrigated from its water. Two anicuts (dams) have been built across it, at Nellore and at Sangam, which supply numerous irrigation channels. The Madras Irrigation Company began a third at Someswaram, but the project was eventually abandoned. Farther north, in the Kanduk\u016br and Ongole t\u0101luks, flow the Manneru, the Paleru, and the M\u00fcsi rivers. These all rise in the Velikondas, and fall into the sea after receiving numerous streamlets on their way. The last river of any importance is the Gundlakamma, which issues from the great Cumbum tank in Kurnool District. After being joined by numerous rivulets it flows past Addanki.\n\nThe backwaters along the coast have already been mentioned. The Kistnapatam backwater contains over 30 feet of water in the hot season at low tide, but a bar with only 5 or 6 feet blocks the entrance. Several small ports had a considerable coasting trade in former times, but the Buckingham Canal and the East Coast Railway have now practically destroyed the whole of it. Of these places the most important, beginning from the north, were Kottapatam, Itamukkula, R\u0101maya-patnam, Iskapalli, Kistnapatam, and Dugar\u0101zapatnam or Armagon. At none of them is access possible to boats of heavy tonnage. Six miles south of Dugar\u0101zapatnam lie the Armagon shoal and lighthouse.\n\nThe central area of Nellore is composed of Archaean, well foliated,\nmixed mica and hornblende schists. To the east of a line drawn from north to south through the middle of these gneisses or schists occur, generally parallel to the foliation, intrusive sheets and lenses of very micaceous pegmatites. Within the last ten years these have given rise to a considerable mica industry. More than 2,000 acres were taken up on leases in 1898. The pegmatites are coarsely intergrown mixtures of felspar, quartz, and muscovite, with tourmaline, garnet, beryl, and columbite as accessory minerals. The largest mica crystals in India, measuring 15 feet at right angles to the folia and 10 feet across, were extracted from Mr. Sargent's mine at Inukurti. The mica is generally coloured grass-green, yellowish green, or a smoky tint. The possibilities of the field are not yet thoroughly known, and there may be a great future for the industry, though at present it is less flourishing than it was a few years ago.\n\nOn the west and south-west of this central area come gneissoid granite and augite and olivine-bearing diabase dikes; and beyond them again, in the same direction, we find the somewhat irregular and shattered edge of the great overlying Cuddapah series of the Pur\u0101\u1e47a group of ancient sedimentary unfossiliferous rocks, which stretches away to the west out of the District. In the other direction, where the gneissic area passes insensibly under the alluvium, are occasional traces of the R\u0101jmah\u0101l plant-bearing sandstones and shales of Jurassic age, lying gently inclined on the gneiss, and a long, almost continuous, narrow belt of Cuddalore sub-recent sandstones, followed by the coastal alluvium, low-level laterite, and areas of blown sand.\n\nLarge trees are not common in the District, being usually found only near villages. Among them may be mentioned the margosa (Melia Azadirachta), which grows even on laterite soil, the various species of Ficus (indica, Tsiela, and religiosa), the tamarind, the acacias (arabica and speciosa), and the mango. The palmyra and the coco-nut palm both grow, the former abundantly, the latter unwillingly, in the coast taluks, and the bastard date (Phoenix sylvestris) is also found. A large part of the District is covered with low scrub jungle, in which the red-sanders tree (Pterocarpus santalinus), the satin-wood (Chloroxylon Swietenia), and a few other useful species occur. At the foot of the Velikondas in the R\u0101pur taluk some fairly large timber trees are found. The casuarina was introduced into the District about forty years ago, and is now largely grown for firewood on the sandy land near the shore.\n\nNellore has but few attractions for the sportsman seeking big game. Tigers occasionally wander across the border from the Cuddapah hills. Bears exist on the Gh\u0101ts and in the Kanigiri and Podili hills, but are not plentiful. Leopards, hunting leopards, s\u0101mbhar, and spotted deer are to be met with; and antelope, gazelle, and wild hog are fairly common. A quarter of a century ago a few bison were to be found.\nSnipe, florican, and other feathered game are tolerably plentiful; and the Indian bustard is occasionally seen.\n\nThe climate is dry and fairly healthy, being subject to no sudden changes of temperature. But the heat is excessive for two or three months of the year, when a scorching westerly wind blows. The sea-breeze makes the tract of country near the coast generally cooler than the inland taluks. The average temperature at Nellore town varies from $77^\\circ$ in January to $94^\\circ$ in May, the thermometer rising on some days to over $112^\\circ$ in the shade. The annual mean for the town is $85^\\circ$, compared with $83^\\circ$ in Madras city. The District is generally regarded as one of the hottest in the Presidency.\n\nNellore is visited by both the north-east and south-west monsoons. The rainfall is lightest in the inland taluks of Kanigiri and Udayagiri. Next come the coast taluks to the north of the Penner. Farther south, at Nellore and in R\u0101pur and G\u016bd\u016br, the fall is above the District average. The supply is heavier, generally speaking, along the coast than in the interior, the average at Tada on Pulicat Lake being as much as 41 inches. The annual fall, based on the statistics from 1870 to 1899, averages 36 inches in the south, 32 in the north-east, and 26 in the north-west. The rainfall is, however, capricious and uncertain. It was only 11 inches in the famine year of 1876, while in 1903\u20134 it amounted to nearly 56 inches, being in many places more than double the average.\n\nNellore has been fortunate in escaping serious natural calamities other than famine. But destructive storms were recorded in 1820 and 1857; and the heavy floods in the Penner and other rivers in 1852, 1874, 1882, and 1893 caused widespread damage. In the flood of 1882 the Penner rose to the extraordinary height of $28\\frac{1}{2}$ feet above its deep bed near the Nellore anicut, while the whole country between G\u016bd\u016br and Manubolu was inundated by the overflow of the Kandleru and Venkatagiri rivers. In 1902 and 1903 there were again heavy floods, which caused a great deal of damage to the railway line, roads, and tanks.\n\nNothing certain is known of the history of Nellore before the times of the Cholas. Tamil inscriptions indicate that it formed part of their kingdom till their decline in the thirteenth century A.D. About the middle of that century it seems to have passed to the P\u0101ndyas of Madura, who had reasserted their independence, and later to the Telugu Choda chiefs, who ruled it as feudatories of the K\u0101katiyas of Warangal, now in the Niz\u0101m's Dominions. In the next century it became part of the rising Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, the capital of which was in the modern Bellary District. Krishna R\u0101ya, the greatest of that dynasty, captured the hill fort of Udayagiri in A.D. 1512, and appointed a governor over it, to\nwhom the rest of the District became subordinate, and who continued to hold it even after the disruption of the Vijayanagar empire by the Muhammadans at the battle of T\u0101likot\u0101 in 1565.\n\nEnglish connexion with Nellore dates from 1625, when, after the massacre of Amboyna, the East India Company's servants, headed by Day, the future founder of Fort St. George, formed a trading establishment at Dugar\u0101zupatnam and called it Armagon or Armeghon, after one Arumuga Mudaliy\u0101r, the chief man of the neighbourhood, who was of much assistance to them. Armagon, however, was given up in 1639 in favour of the new settlement at Fort St. George, Madras. In 1753 Nellore was under the rule of Najib-ullah, the brother of the Naw\u0101b of Arcot. In 1757 he rebelled against the Naw\u0101b's authority, and a large force was sent against him. He successfully defended himself with a body of 3,000 men and some aid received from the French at Masulipatam. Shortly after this Colonel Forde, who commanded the English force which was assisting the Naw\u0101b, was recalled to Madras. Najib-ullah then began to make incursions into the territories of the Naw\u0101b, ending with an attack on the famous Tirupati temple. He was beaten back by an English detachment from Madras, but in 1758 he joined the French under Moracin and succeeded in taking the place. Early in 1759, however, on hearing that the siege of Fort St. George by the French, under Lally, had been raised, he declared for the English and put to death all the French with him, excepting their officer, St. Denys. He was reappointed governor of the District, his annual tribute being fixed at 30,000 pagodas. In the middle of the next year, Bas\u0101lat Jang, the brother of Sal\u0101bat Jang, the S\u016bbahd\u0101r of the Deccan, threatened the District; but on the appearance of a strong English relieving force under Captain More, he beat a hasty retreat north-west to Cuddapah. On the fall of Pondicherry in 1761, the Naw\u0101b sought English aid for the reduction of Nellore, the governor of which he had not, despite his recent submission, forgiven. An army under Colonel Caillaud moved against Najib-ullah early in 1762, took the Nellore fort in February, and soon afterwards made over the District to the Naw\u0101b. During the wars with Haidar (1768-82) Nellore largely escaped the general devastation. On the assignment of the revenues of the Carnatic by the Naw\u0101b to the Company in 1781, Nellore passed for the first time under direct British management. In 1801 it was, with the rest of the Carnatic, ceded in full sovereignty to the Company by the Naw\u0101b Azim-ud-daula.\n\nThere are very few archaeological remains of interest in Nellore. The most interesting are the ruins of the hill fort at Udayagiri. The architecture of the temples and mosques is usually of the most insignificant character. Not a single fine building is found in the District, though a few large gopurams (towers) adorn some of the temples. The large\nmonolithic stambha (pillar) at Sangam is worth noting, and there is a similar one at Chundi.\n\nThe early history of the District is now being worked out from inscriptions, but the details are not yet fully ascertained. Most of the inscriptions are of the period of the Vijayanagar dynasty, but others, going as far back as the Ch\u0101lukyas, have been discovered. The earliest catalogued by Sewell in his List of Antiquities is from a temple in Jummal\u016bru in the Darsi tahsil, and is dated A.D. 1096. Roman coins belonging to the age of Hadrian and Trajan were found in 1786 in a small pot buried under a Hindu shrine. Gold coins of the former emperor were also discovered in 1903 at Tangut\u016br. When the anicut across the Penner was being constructed, a large amount of laterite had to be quarried in the neighbourhood, and in this deposit were found several coffins, made apparently of burnt clay, embedded in quartz. The bodies within were in a good state of preservation. Spearheads and other implements were discovered with them.\n\nThe population of the District in 1871 numbered 1,376,811; in 1881, 1,220,236; in 1891, 1,463,736; and in 1901, 1,496,987. The effect of the famine of 1876\u20138 is noticeable; and the two scarcities which occurred in the decade ending 1901 reduced the rate of increase in that period to a low figure, and caused an actual decline, through emigration, in the taluks along the northern and western borders. An idea of the amount of emigration which took place is given by the fact that in 1901 Kistna contained 62,000 persons who had been born in Nellore.\n\nThere are 1,758 villages in the District and 10 towns. Of the latter, the chief are the two municipalities of Nellore (population, 32,040), the head-quarters, and Ongole (12,864). The District is made up of thirteen taluks and tahsils, statistics of which, according to the Census of 1901, are shown in the table on the next page. The head-quarters of these (except of Pol\u016br, which are at S\u016bl\u016brpet) are at the villages and towns from which they are respectively named.\n\nOf the population, 1,356,246, or 90 per cent., are Hindus: 82,886, or 6 per cent., are Musalm\u0101ns, who are most numerous in the Nellore taluk; and 53,948, or 4 per cent., are Christians, chiefly to be found in Ongole. Nellore is one of seven Districts in the Presidency in which there are fewer females than males. Telugu is the language of 93 per cent. of the total population and is the prevailing vernacular in every taluk.\n\nThe Telugu castes are in an overwhelming majority in the District. The most numerous of them are the K\u0101pu and Kamma cultivators, who number respectively 208,000 and 152,000; the M\u0101la field-labourers, 184,000; and the Gollas, 119,000, who are the shepherds of the Telugu country. Perhaps the most interesting community from\nan ethnological point of view are the Yan\u0101dis, a forest tribe, of whom 66,000, or two-thirds of the total for the Presidency, are found in Nellore. They are a primitive people, living mainly in the south of the District and especially in the jungles of Sriharikota, where they subsist largely by collecting and selling forest produce. They may be described as being still in the hunting-stage of development, and one section of them even now produces fire by friction. In the early years of the last century Government took them under its special protection, and still accords them exceptional treatment in several ways. An interesting account of them, by T. Ranga Rao, will be found in Madras Museum Bulletin, No. 2, vol. iv (Madras, 1901).\n\n| Taluk or Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kandukur       | 787                 | 1              | 161      | 151,417    | 192                       | + 2\u00b70                                           | 6,468                                  |\n| Darsi           | 616                 | ...            | 118      | 82,459     | 134                       | - 2\u00b76                                           | 2,870                                  |\n| Podili          | 564                 | ...            | 111      | 58,937     | 104                       | - 13\u00b79                                          | 2,327                                  |\n| Kanigiri        | 1,014               | 1              | 188      | 110,813    | 109                       | - 15\u00b76                                          | 5,052                                  |\n| Atmakur         | 640                 | ...            | 112      | 110,906    | 173                       | + 9\u00b76                                           | 4,224                                  |\n| Udayagiri       | 871                 | ...            | 134      | 95,173     | 109                       | - 5\u00b70                                           | 3,324                                  |\n| Nellore         | 638                 | 2              | 149      | 226,383    | 355                       | + 14\u00b74                                          | 15,705                                 |\n| Kavali          | 548                 | 1              | 77       | 87,015     | 159                       | + 4\u00b77                                           | 3,614                                  |\n| Gudur           | 910                 | 1              | 144      | 144,209    | 158                       | + 6\u00b70                                           | 5,918                                  |\n| Rapur           | 596                 | ...            | 112      | 70,130     | 118                       | + 14\u00b74                                          | 1,977                                  |\n| Venkatagiri     | 426                 | 1              | 151      | 60,861     | 143                       | + 7\u00b79                                           | 2,817                                  |\n| Polur           | 355                 | ...            | 139      | 74,512     | 210                       | + 7\u00b71                                           | 3,420                                  |\n| Ongole          | 796                 | 3              | 162      | 224,172    | 282                       | - 0\u00b75                                           | 13,351                                 |\n\nDistrict total* 8,761 10 1,758 1,496,987 171 + 2\u00b73 71,067\n\n* The area of the new Nellore District is 7,965 square miles, and the population 1,272,815.\n\nNellore contains fewer people who subsist entirely by agriculture than any Madras District except Malabar and the Nilgiris. The other chief occupations are leather-work and weaving, while petty traders, cattle-breeders, bangle-makers (a clay found in Venkatagiri is particularly suitable for bangles), and beggars are more numerous than elsewhere.\n\nFour Christian missions are established in the District. The first to appear on the field, some time in the beginning of the eighteenth century, was the old Jesuit Mission of the Carnatic. This has passed through several crises and shows but little vitality at present, the Roman Catholics in the District numbering only 1,567. The American Baptist Mission dates from 1840, when the Rev. S. S. Day visited Nellore. The mission has prospered; it has 11 stations in the northern portion of the District and its followers number 49,400. It maintains a second-grade college at Ongole, several industrial schools, and numerous primary schools for boys and girls. The Free Church of Scotland\nMission has been managing a school for boys at Nellore town since 1848. The Hermannsburg Lutheran Mission commenced operations in 1865. It now possesses eight stations and its adherents number 2,000. The total number of Christians in the District is 53,948, of whom all but 500 are natives.\n\nThe coast taluks differ much, both in their scenery and in the nature of their soils, from those in the west of the District. Speaking generally, the soils are poor and gravelly on the western side; but near the sea, where the laterite formation is not found, lie tracts composed of loam and clay of fair quality. From the Pulicat Lake alluvial soil stretches away from Tada nearly to the foot of the Velikonda hills. This range belongs to the well-known Cuddapah formation of quartzite and slate-beds, and along its foot is a narrow strip of land formed from the d\u00e9bris of these rocks and covered with low jungle. The flat plain between it and the sea is underlain for a great width by gneiss and granite with trap, but towards the east the crystalline rocks below consist of schists. A narrow belt of laterite traverses the District from north to south not far from the sea. The coast-line is marked by a drifting mass of loose sand in ridges or dunes, forming two or three parallel lines. Within this, a strip of alluvial soil formed by the deposits of rivers is found till the laterite is reached. Alluvium is also met with in the river valleys, especially in that of the Penner. All along the banks of the latter river, as far as the Someswaram gap, successive accumulations have covered the surface of the country for a distance varying from 5 to 10 miles. This alluvial soil is a mixture of sand and vegetable matter, and, though of poor quality, is well adapted for growing rice. The most fertile portions of the District are the Penner basin in Atmakur and Nellore, the tract irrigated by the Penner canal system in the adjoining taluks of Kavali and Gudur, and the heavy black cotton-soil land in Ongole, which produces excellent 'dry crops' and extends into the Kandukur taluk. The laterite belt gives rise to a poor soil, often covered with scrub jungle, which is found in all the coast taluks. The country bordering on the hills on the west is of a more stony and broken character. The worst taluks in the District are Udayagiri and Kanigiri, where water is met with only at a great depth and the soil is of very inferior character. The District receives rain from both the south-west and north-east monsoons, and there are thus two harvests in the year. With the south-west monsoon rains, the early (punasa) and the chief (pedda) crops are grown; with the north-east monsoon, the late (paira) crops. The punasa crops are generally sown from June to September and reaped between December and March, and the paira crops are sown from October to January and reaped between February and April. The punasa crops comprise the greater variety, but the paira crops cover the larger area.\nThe total area of the District is 8,761 square miles, of which zamind\u0101ri and imim lands occupy 4,604 square miles. The zamind\u0101ris have not been surveyed, and the area for which particulars are on record is only 4,970 square miles. Statistical particulars of this area for 1903\u20134 are given in the following table, in square miles:\n\n| Taluk     | Area shown in accounts | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|-----------|------------------------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Kanduk\u016br  | 546                    | 358        | 34        | 33               | 50      |\n| Kanigiri  | 439                    | 167        | 17        | 78               | 75      |\n| Atmak\u016br   | 598                    | 295        | 53        | 95               | 103     |\n| Udayagiri | 433                    | 139        | 18        | 71               | 149     |\n| Nellore   | 597                    | 338        | 211       | 31               | 57      |\n| K\u0101vali    | 411                    | 214        | 54        | 60               | 55      |\n| G\u016bd\u016br     | 744                    | 328        | 114       | 48               | 85      |\n| R\u0101p\u016br     | 573                    | 245        | 24        | 23               | 185     |\n| Ongole    | 629                    | 482        | 10        | 8                | 8       |\n| **Total** | **4,970**              | **2,566**  | **535**   | **447**          | **747** |\n\nGenerally speaking, \u2018wet crops\u2019 are most cultivated in the south and east, and \u2018dry crops\u2019 in the west and north of the District. The staple food-crops are rice and cholam (Sorghum vulgare), which occupy 497 and 567 square miles respectively, or 28 and 32 per cent. of the net area cropped. Next in importance are cambu (Pennisetum typhoideum), r\u0101gi (Eleusine coracana), and the various pulses. Rice is grown extensively in G\u016bd\u016br and Nellore, and in portions of K\u0101vali and Atmak\u016br. Cholam is cultivated throughout the District, the largest area being in Atmak\u016br, R\u0101p\u016br, and Kanduk\u016br. Variga (Panicum pilosum) is confined to Ongole and Kanduk\u016br, while the greater part of the horse-gram is found in Udayagiri and Kanigiri. Tobacco is raised in small patches here and there throughout the District. Cotton is found chiefly in the four northern taluks. Indigo is grown principally in Ongole and Kanduk\u016br, while castor is an important crop everywhere, except in G\u016bd\u016br and Nellore. Sugar-cane is hardly cultivated at all, but jaggery (coarse sugar) is manufactured from the juice of palmyra and bastard date-palms in R\u0101p\u016br and K\u0101vali.\n\nConsiderable areas of unoccupied arable land are found in all the taluks except Ongole and Kanduk\u016br, the extent being largest in G\u016bd\u016br and R\u0101p\u016br. The area of holdings increased by 7 per cent. during the fifteen years after the famine of 1876\u20138, and since 1891 the increase has been noticeable though slow. No improvements in agricultural practice have taken place during recent years. The ryots do not take much advantage of the provisions of the Land Improvement and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts. During the seventeen years ending 1905 only Rs. 1,40,000 has been advanced under the former Act. The money is generally spent in sinking new wells and repairing old ones.\nThe Nellore breed of heavy cattle is celebrated throughout the Presidency. The chief centres for raising them are in Ongole and Kandukur, and the country northwards as far as the Vinukonda and Bapatla taluks of Kistna District and westward into Kurnool. From this tract the large supplies of draught cattle required for the black cotton soil of the Ceded Districts and Kurnool are drawn. The stock in the southern taluks are of a lighter and inferior breed; but in many of the villages of Nellore, Gudur, and Kavali the ryots maintain large herds, partly for stock purposes and partly for manuring their fields. Sheep and goats are more numerous in the western tracts than along the coast. They belong to the long-legged kind ordinarily met with in Southern India, and are usually reared for their manure and for their skins, as they give very poor meat.\n\nOf the total area of ryotwari and \u2018minor inam\u2019 land under cultivation, 535 square miles, or about 11 per cent., are irrigated in about equal proportions from canals and tanks, wells taking a proportionately small share in the supply. The only considerable area protected from drought is that irrigated by the Penner canal system, which is supplied from the anicuts across that river at Nellore and Sangam. None of the other rivers of the District is of much use for irrigation. A small area of 800 acres in the north of the Ongole taluk is supplied by the Kistna canals. The Neilore anicut feeds three channels which irrigate land on the southern bank of the river, and the Sangam dam supplies the great Kanigiri reservoir from which much land on the north bank is watered. A project to construct a reservoir on the Manneru to irrigate 17,500 acres of \u2018dry\u2019 land has been recently put in hand as a protective work. The District will also benefit from the Tungabhadra Project, if that is sanctioned.\n\nThere are in all 626 tanks and 302 channels in the District, which are partly under the Public Works, and partly under the Revenue department. Of the nine Government taluks, Gudur, Kavali, and Nellore are the only ones at all well supplied with tanks. The largest of these sources are those at Nellore, Buchireddipalem, and Allur in Nellore, at Anantasagaram and Kaluvaya in Atmakur, and at Survepalli in Gudur. Wells, numbering 17,000 in all, are commonest in the northern and western parts, and each irrigates from $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 acres on an average. Water is found only at a great depth in some of the Kanigiri and Udayagiri wells, but these generally irrigate as much as from 4 to 5 acres each.\n\nThe \u2018reserved\u2019 forests and \u2018reserved\u2019 lands cover 747 square miles, divided into six ranges, each under a range officer. They consist roughly of three classes: the western forests, the central belt, and the coast Reserves. In the central belt the growth is, generally speaking, of poor quality, and the areas\n'reserved' usually contain nothing but stunted scrub. In the western hills trees of greater size are met with. The principal forests here lie along the slopes of the Velikonda hills in the taluks of R\u0101p\u016br, Atmak\u016br, Udayagiri, and Kanigiri. They are in blocks alternating with zam\u012bnd\u0101ri land belonging to the Venkatagiri and K\u0101lahasti estates. The Nandavanam Reserve in Kanigiri, the Udayagiri Reserve, and the R\u0101p\u016br, Velikonda, and Yerrakonda Reserves are the principal of these. In them occur the red-sanders tree (Pterocarpus santalinus), the yegi or kino (Pterocarpus Marsupium), yepi (Hardwickia binata), billu or satinwood (Chloroxylon Swietenia), and a few other useful species. The best of the coast forests is in the island of S\u1e5b\u012bharikota. The more valuable timber trees found there are the nercudu (Eugenia Jambolana), solagu (Pterospermum suberifolium), and mushti (Strychnos Nux-vomica). Soap-nut and tamarind trees also occur in great numbers, and a large area has been planted with casuarina. A tramway 13 miles long has been laid down in the island to assist in removing the wood. The minor produce exported from this tract consists of tamarinds, honey, rattan, soap-nuts, sarsaparilla, strychnine seeds, and myrabolams. All along the coast large plantations of casuarina have been made. In many parts of the District palmyra palms abound.\n\nA portion of the forests is closed to grazing, but to the remaining area cattle are admitted on payment of the prescribed fee. Goats are only allowed to browse in specially selected Reserves. Firewood, the royalty on mica (see below), and grazing fees are the chief sources of forest revenue. The total receipts in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 1,50,000.\n\nOf the minerals of the District only mica is at present worked to any large extent. Copper was discovered in 1801 in the villages of Garimena-penta and Yarrapalli in Udayagiri. Iron ore is widely distributed, and used to be smelted in native furnaces in several villages in the middle of the last century. Magnetic iron beds of great size occur near the Gundlakamma river in Ongole. Gypsum, in the form of selenite crystals, is found in the marine clayey beds in the northern parts along the Buckingham Canal. Garnet occurs in the Chundi hills, in Pecherlakonda in Udayagiri, and at Said\u0101puram in R\u0101p\u016br. Large deposits of laterite are found in various localities, such as K\u0101vali, Nellore, and Talamanchi, and are largely used for making roads and building purposes. Greyish-white crystalline limestone can be obtained near Chundi and Ped\u0101rikatla in Kanigiri. A good deal of lime is manufactured from kankar and the shell-beds in the backwater deposits. Sandstone is found near Kov\u016br, north of Nellore, and at Budav\u0101da, R\u0101zpudi, and Vemavaram in Ongole. The stone near R\u0101zpudi is in flaggy beds and is largely quarried for building purposes, being prettily coloured. Greenstone or diorite is found near Jelakap\u0101d, and trap dikes near Peramkonda.\nand Ullapuram. Crude saltpetre is manufactured in many villages by lixiviation. The Salt department also manufactures refined saltpetre in the Kanuparti factory. A large quantity of salt is made yearly in the Government factories along the coast. Diamonds are said to have been found near Chejerla.\n\nThe history of the mica industry can be traced back 60 or 70 years. It flourished greatly for a time, but now a decline has made itself apparent. In 1900-1 more than a million pounds, valued at $7\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs, was extracted, but in 1903-4 the quantity had fallen to 502,000 lb., valued at less than $4\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs. The majority of the mines consist of large open pits, from which the mineral is removed by manual labour. Only a few contain underground tunnels. The mineral is found in R\u0101p\u016br, Atmak\u016br, G\u016bd\u016br, and K\u0101vali, the largest number of mines being in the first-named t\u0101luk. There were 60 mines in the District in 1904, of which 44 are situated on Government land, and the remainder in shrotriems and zamind\u0101ris. Of these, 56 were working in 1904 as against 36 in 1901. The mica obtained is of good quality, and most of it is exported to London. It is of several kinds, and is either clear or stained, the latter being coloured brown or black owing to the presence of iron and manganese between the planes of cleavage.\n\nThe industries of the District, other than agriculture and cattle-breeding, are on a very small scale. Nellore town was once famous for its cotton cloths and textile fabrics. The cloth now made is generally of the commonest description, though a small amount of better quality is still produced. Blue palampores used to be exported in large quantities to the West Indies, but the trade has died out. A small quantity of rough woollen blankets is produced. Brass and copper utensils are manufactured in several localities. At Udayagiri one family turns out fairly good wood-carving. The construction of country carts with stone wheels is a peculiarity of Kanigiri, and in the same village spinning tools, razors and scissors, and excellent slippers are manufactured. Indigo is grown throughout the District, but no factories are working now, and the dye is manufactured in vats according to native methods. Tanning of skins is carried on to a small extent in many localities.\n\nThe extension of railways has affected the trade, which used to come across the Velikondas from the Districts in the interior, but this is almost dead. The principal exports at present are rice, 'dry' grains, indigo, cotton, ghi, salt, oilseeds, condiments, firewood, salted fish, hides, horn, tobacco, lime, palmyra rafters, cloth, and brass and copper vessels. The chief imports are hardware, petroleum in bulk, jaggery, sugar, spices, &c. As already remarked, a large trade is done in cattle. Goats also are a considerable item of commerce in R\u0101p\u016br. Both imports and exports are mainly from and to the neighbouring Districts.\nand Madras city. The chief centres of trade are Nellore, Ongole, Gudur, Kavali, Kandukur, Addanki, Allur, Venkatagiri, and Sulurpet. The only port at which there is any sea-borne trade is Kottapalam. The value of the sea-borne imports during the four years ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 10,000, and of the exports Rs. 19,000.\n\nThe earliest railway to be opened in the District was the extension of the South Indian line from Tirupati to Gudur and Nellore, which was constructed in 1887-8, originally on the metre gauge. It passes through Renigunta, Kalahasti, and Venkatagiri, and so affords communication with North Arcot. The section between Gudur and Nellore was converted to standard gauge in 1899, and now forms a part of the East Coast line of the Madras Railway. This latter, which traverses Nellore from south to north, was opened for traffic in 1898-9. It enters the District near Arambakam, 38 miles north of Madras city, and after running through it roughly parallel to the coast for 153 miles, leaves it a mile north of Ammanabrolu. The Southern Mahratta Railway line from Guntakal to Bezwada, which passes through the north-western corner of the District, was completed in 1894.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is 1,010 miles, and of unmetalled roads 148 miles. All these are maintained from Local funds, and avenues of trees have been planted along 435 miles of them. The great northern road runs from north to south, parallel with the railway almost throughout its whole length. The main lines of communication which cross the District from east to west are the Ongole-Cumbum road through Podili, the road through Kandukur and Kanigiri, that from Kavali to Udayagiri via Vinjamur, that from Nellore to Cuddapah via Atmakur, that from Nellore to the Cuddapah frontier via Podalakur, and that from Gudur to the Rapur pass. The road system of the District is by no means fully developed.\n\nThe Buckingham Canal is the only navigable water-way. It communicates with the fresh-water high-level canals of the Kistna delta system at Pedda Ganjam, and thus affords uninterrupted communication with Cocanada on the north and Merkanam in South Arcot on the south.\n\nNellore, with its scanty rainfall and limited means of irrigation, is always liable to famine. The taluks south of the Penner, which receive a fairly good fall and are well supplied with tanks, are better protected from drought than those in the north and west. The District was visited by famine in 1805-7, 1823-4, 1833, 1876-8, and 1891-2. Relief operations had moreover to be started in 1897-8, and again in 1900. During the famine of 1824, 2,000 people are said to have been fed for three months. The northern taluks suffered terribly during the Guntur famine of 1833, when 10,000 people were being fed daily in Nellore town alone. In\n1876-8 there was an almost entire failure of crops, except in parts of the northern taluks and the Venkatagiri zamindari. At the height of this famine, the average daily number relieved during twelve months amounted to 82,500. In 1891-2 relief works were opened in the southern and north-western taluks, and the average number relieved was 6,300.\n\nThe District comprises nine Government taluks\\(^1\\), each under a tahsildar, and four independent deputy-tahsildars' divisions or zamindari tahsils. The northern portion is generally under a Covenanted Civilian, who administers the taluks of Ongole, Kandukur, and Kanigiri, and the zamindari tahsils of Darsi and Podili. The head-quarters subdivision, which is in charge of a Deputy-Collector, comprises the taluks of Nellore and K\u0101vali. The Atmakur subdivision, which is also under a Deputy-Collector, comprises Udayagiri and Atmakur. The Deputy-Collector at Gudur is in charge of Gudur and R\u0101pur, and the zamindari tahsils of Venkatagiri and Polur or S\u016bl\u016brpet. There are stationary sub-magistrates at Nellore, Gudur, Ongole, Kandukur, and Atmakur; and deputy-tahsildars at Kota in Gudur, All\u016br in Nellore, and Addanki in Ongole.\n\nThe zamindaris occupy no less than 3,700 square miles, and are four in number. The largest is the Venkatagiri Estate, which is described in a separate article. The K\u0101lahasti estate of North Arcot owns 190 villages in Udayagiri, Kanigiri, Atmakur, K\u0101vali, and Kandukur. The peshkash for the portion of the estate situated in this District is Rs. 80,500. The Chundi zamindari consists of 35 villages, and pays a peshkash of Rs. 20,600. The zamindar of Muty\u0101lap\u0101d owns three villages in Kandukur taluk, the peshkash for which is Rs. 2,100.\n\nCivil justice is administered by the District Judge, whose headquarters are at Nellore town, and by District Munsifs at Nellore, K\u0101vali, Kanigiri, and Ongole. There is no Subordinate Judge in the District, and the appeals from the District Munsifs are disposed of by the District Judge. A large number of zamindari revenue suits are instituted every year before the revenue courts. The number of these between 1899 and 1901 averaged 2,200 a year, being in excess of the figures for most other Districts. Criminal justice is dispensed by the Sessions Court, the divisional magistrates, and the usual subordinate magistracy. Yerukalas, Y\u0101n\u0101dis, and the lower castes of the population commit a good deal of theft, and road dacoities are rather common. On the whole, however, the people are quiet and law-abiding.\n\n\\(^1\\) Since the transfer of the Ongole taluk to Gunt\u016br District the subdivisions have been rearranged. The northern (Kandukur) subdivision is now under a Deputy Collector, and the southern (Gudur) under a covenanted Civilian.\nLittle is known of the revenue history of the District under the Hindus. The government share of the crop varied in different localities, and the rates are supposed to have been generally increased by the succeeding Muh\u0101mmadan rulers. \u2018Wet\u2019 lands were usually held on a tenure based on the division of the crop. It is probable, however, that in many cases of occupation of garden and waste lands the tenants paid a fixed customary rent. The collection of revenue was as usual supervised by the village karnam (accountant) and headman, the district accountant (called the sthala karnam), and the deshmukh.\n\nUnder the Naw\u0101bs of Arcot the country was parcelled out into large divisions, and the right of collecting all the demands of the state on each of these was farmed out to the highest bidder. These lessees generally employed sub-renters, who were often the head inhabitants of villages, and the effects of the system were notoriously bad.\n\nBesides the land revenue, the state used to levy a number of indirect taxes, such as salt tax, r\u0101hd\u0101ri (or transit) duties, pullari (or grazing tax), mohtarfa (or profession tax), and various export and import and other duties. The ryots had also to pay the customary fees (merahs and rus\u016bms) to the village officers and the hereditary polig\u0101rs and kavalg\u0101rs, who were originally responsible for the police administration.\n\nThe Company took over the administration of the District temporarily for two years in 1790. Mr. Dighton was appointed the first Collector of Nellore and its dependencies, and Mr. Erskine of Ongole and the Palnad region. The revenue collections at this date never exceeded 3 lakhs of pagodas for Nellore and 85,000 pagodas for Ongole. Neither the Venkatagiri zamind\u0101ri nor the taluk of Kanigiri formed part of the District at that time; they were added subsequently, and it was not till 1863 that the District attained its present shape, Sriharikota Island having been included in it in that year. Nellore was finally handed over to the Company in 1801. Mr. Travers, who was appointed Collector, at once introduced the ryotw\u0101ri system. The settlement effected under the rules then in force differed in many respects from the present system. No attempts were made to calculate the out-turn or survey the fields accurately. The Government demand was fixed at a customary rate of eleven-twentieths of the gross produce, after deducting 6\u00bd per cent. for fees to village officers. The average rate per acre was Rs. 7 for \u2018wet,\u2019 and Rs. 2\u20138 for \u2018dry\u2019 land. The total assessment for the first five years varied from 16 to 20 lakhs of rupees. These rates were too high, and the system broke down under the pressure of bad seasons. The village rent system was introduced in 1809. The ryotw\u0101ri system was, however, reverted to in 1821\u20132, and has continued ever since. Between 1854 and 1858 the rates were reduced by 14 per cent. on \u2018wet\u2019 and 6\u00bd per cent. on \u2018dry\u2019 land. In 1866 garden land not irrigated with Government water was classed as \u2018dry.\u2019 The mohtarfa\nwas abolished in 1861 and the pullari tax in 1867. A regular survey of the District, begun in 1861, added 16\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. to the recorded occupied area. The District was settled according to the present system between 1873 and 1875, the land revenue demand being enhanced by Rs. 1,88,000, or 11 per cent. The average assessment on 'dry' land works out at Rs. 1\u20133\u20136 per acre (maximum Rs. 5, minimum 4 annas), and that on 'wet' land at Rs. 5\u20135\u20137 (maximum Rs. 10\u20138, minimum Rs. 2). The average extent of a holding is 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) acres. The District is now being resurveyed, and it is proposed to revise the settlement immediately.\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 28.46  | 32.25  | 32.17  | 31.61  |\n| Total revenue  | 31.91  | 38.52  | 40.70  | 43.36  |\n\nOwing to the transfer of the Ongole taluk to the new District of Guntur, the land revenue demand has been reduced to Rs. 21,57,000.\n\nThe local affairs of the District are managed by the District board and the four taluk boards of Ongole, Nellore, Gudur, and Atmakur, corresponding to the four administrative subdivisions mentioned above. The total expenditure of these bodies in 1903\u20134 was about 4 lakhs, the chief item being the upkeep of roads and buildings. Of their income, 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lakhs was derived from the land cess. There are fifteen Union panchayats, which look after the sanitary and other needs of their respective villages, besides two municipalities.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police resides at Nellore town and has general control over the force throughout the District. An Assistant Superintendent at Ongole is in immediate charge of the taluks in the north. There are in all 94 police stations, and the force numbers 989 constables, under 18 inspectors. The strength of the reserve is 54 men. The rural police consists of 1,004 talaiyaris, working directly under the village headmen. The District jail at Nellore is under the superintendence of the District Surgeon. It is an old building, with accommodation for 231 males and 14 females, as well as 27 persons in the hospitals. There are 15 subsidiary jails, at the head-quarters of the tahsildars and deputy-tahsildars, with a total accommodation for 255 prisoners.\n\nNellore stands fifteenth among the twenty-two Districts of the Presidency in regard to the literacy of its population, of whom 4.1 per cent. (8.9 males and 0.6 females) were able to read and write in 1901. Education is most advanced in Nellore and Ongole, and most backward in Rapur and Udayagiri. Progress has been considerable in recent years.\nIn 1880 the total number of pupils under instruction was 10,196; by 1890-1 it had risen to 21,836, and by 1900-1 to 26,679; in 1903-4 it was 29,425, including 5,205 girls. In 1904 the District contained 1,117 educational institutions of all kinds. Of the 910 classed as public, 12 were managed by the Educational department, 80 by local boards, 4 by municipalities; 436 received grants-in-aid, and 378 were unaided but conformed to the rules of the department. They included one college, 19 secondary, 883 primary, and 7 training and special schools. Of the male population of school-going age 17 per cent., and of the female population 5 per cent., were in the primary stage of instruction. Among Musalm\u0101ns, the corresponding figures were 32 and 4. Of the M\u0101la and M\u0101diga classes, the two most depressed communities in the District, 2,112 boys and girls were under instruction in 318 schools in 1903-4. The missions have done much to encourage education among these people. The American Baptist Mission maintains a college at Ongole which teaches up to the F.A. standard. Other important institutions are the United Free Church Mission high school and the Venkatagiri R\u0101ja\u2019s high school at Nellore. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,77,000, of which Rs. 51,000 was derived from fees. Of the total, 62 per cent. was devoted to primary schools.\n\nThere are 10 hospitals and 17 dispensaries, which are situated at the principal towns. The medical institutions (four in all) at Nellore and Ongole are managed by the two municipalities at those places. A maternity hospital was built at Nellore to commemorate the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The various Local fund hospitals contain accommodation for 28 in-patients, and there is room for 78 more in the municipal institutions. In 1903 the total number of cases treated was 260,647, of whom 1,112 were in-patients, and 4,123 operations were performed. Local and municipal funds met the greater part of the expenditure, which amounted to Rs. 43,000. Of this sum establishment charges absorbed Rs. 24,000, and Rs. 13,000 was spent on medicines.\n\nThe District is rather backward with respect to vaccination, the number of persons successfully treated in 1903-4 being only 24 per 1,000 of the population, as against a mean of 30 for the Presidency. Vaccination is compulsory in the two municipalities of Nellore and Ongole, and in seven of the Unions.\n\n[For further particulars of Nellore District see the Manual of the Nellore District, by J. A. C. Boswell (1873), and Inscriptions on Copperplates and Stones in the Nellore District, by A. Butterworth and V. Venugop\u0101l Chetti (Madras, 1905).]\n\nNellore Subdivision.- Subdivision of Nellore District, Madras, consisting of the Nellore and K\u0101vali t\u0101luks.\nNellore Taluk. Taluk in the centre of the District of the same name, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 21' and 14\u00b0 46' N. and 79\u00b0 43' and 80\u00b0 11' E., and bounded on the east by the Bay of Bengal. Its area is 638 square miles, and the population in 1901 was 226,383, compared with 197,912 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, Nellore (population, 32,040), the head-quarters of both the District and the taluk, and Allur (7,527); and 149 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 8,55,000. The Penner river separates the taluk into two portions, and the Paideru and the Maldevi drain the northern half. There is an anicut across the Penner at Nellore town, and another at Sangam, built in 1882-6. From the latter three main channels irrigate the southern portion of the taluk; while another channel from the former feeds an immense reservoir, known as the Kanigiri tank, from which several minor irrigation channels supply the northern portion. The taluk is distinguished from other parts of the District by the prevalence of wide alluvial deposits. More than three-fourths is included in the Penner delta, and rice cultivation is extensively carried on there.\n\nNellore Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and taluk of the same name, Madras, situated in 14\u00b0 27' N. and 79\u00b0 59' E., on the right bank of the Penner river, on the great northern road from Madras to Calcutta and on the East Coast Railway, 109 miles from Madras city. The population in 1901 was 32,040, consisting of 25,229 Hindus and Animists, 5,786 Musalmans, and 1,025 Christians.\n\nThe earliest chieftain of the place is said to have been one Mukkanti, who ruled in the eleventh century as a tributary of the Chola kings. The next whose name has been preserved by tradition is Siddhi R\u0101j\u0101, who held it in the twelfth century. Power passed from the Cholas to the Warangal Ganpatis, then to the Muhammadans and local chiefs, till Krishna Deva of Vijayanagar subdued the country about 1512. The town first attained historical importance in the eighteenth century, when the English and the French were contesting the supremacy of Southern India. It formed part of the dominions of the Naw\u0101b of the Carnatic, and possessed strategic importance as commanding the northern high road and the passage of the Penner. Its fort, portions of the wall and ditch of which are still visible, was probably built about this time. In 1753 it was the apanage of Najib-ullah, a brother of the Naw\u0101b Muhammad Ali whom English support had placed on the throne. He was driven out of Nellore in that year by Muhammad Kam\u0101l, a military adventurer. This man threatened to sack the temple at Tirupati, which had been pledged to the English, but was eventually defeated and taken prisoner by them. In 1757 Najib-ullah rebelled against the authority of his brother, the Naw\u0101b. An army of 10,000 men was sent against him, including a European contingent under\nColonel Forde. Najib-ullah left the town to be defended by a garrison of 3,000 men, assisted by 20 French from Masulipatam. After a few days' bombardment, a breach was made in the mud wall, but the storming party, consisting mainly of the British contingent, was repulsed with loss. Najib-ullah remained in arms throughout the following year; but when the French under Lally withdrew from before Madras in 1759, he submitted and was reappointed governor of the country.\n\nDuring the wars with Haidar Ali, Nellore to a great extent escaped the general devastation. In 1790, on the breaking out of the war with Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n, the British resolved to undertake the direct management of the revenues of the Carnatic, which had long been pledged to them by the Naw\u0101b, and Mr. Dighton was appointed the first Collector of Nellore. At the conclusion of the peace with Tip\u016b in 1792 the administration was restored to the Naw\u0101b, but it was permanently assumed by the British in 1801.\n\nBesides the usual administrative offices, Nellore possesses a small District jail, in which the convicts are employed in gardening and weaving. The houses of the European residents are on the south of the native town along the bank of a large tank, on the farther side of which rises the temple-crowned hill of Narasimhakonda. Nellore was constituted a municipality in 1866. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 44,000. In 1903\u20134 the receipts were Rs. 55,000, the chief sources being the house and land taxes (Rs. 17,700) and tax on vehicles and animals (Rs. 6,000); while the main items of expenditure were conservancy (Rs. 14,000), medical needs (Rs. 10,000), and roads and buildings (Rs. 7,000). The municipal hospital contains beds for 40 in-patients. Surveys and levels have been taken for a scheme for supplying the place with water. The average rainfall is about 36 inches. In the hot season, temperatures of 112\u00b0 and over in the shade are not uncommon.\n\nNellore is not of much industrial importance, the only factories or crafts being a rice-husking mill, a private workshop in process of development, and the dyeing of cloths. The chief educational institutions are the United Free Church Mission high school and the Venkatagiri R\u0101j\u0101's high school, both educating up to the matriculation standard. The former was established in 1841 and the latter in 1876. The American Baptist Mission and the Roman Catholic Mission, both of which have been long settled in the town, also maintain several schools.\n\nNem\u0101r.\u2014Zila in Indore State, Central India. See Nim\u0101r Zila.\n\nNem\u0101war.\u2014District of the Indore State, Central India, lying between 22\u00b0 17' and 22\u00b0 55' N. and 76\u00b0 30' and 77\u00b0 11' E., on the north bank of the Narbad\u0101, with an area of 1,059 square miles. The greater part lies in the fertile alluvial plain which forms the valley\nof the Narbad\u0101. To the north it is bounded by the Vindhyan range, on the slopes of which grow forests of considerable economic value. Besides the Narbad\u0101, several tributaries, the Chankeshar, Datuni, Bagdi, and other smaller streams, afford an ample supply of water. The annual rainfall is 29 inches.\n\nNem\u0101war is closely connected historically with the neighbouring British District of Nim\u0101r, south of the river. Albir\u016bn\u012b (A.D. 970\u20131039) mentions travelling from Dh\u0101r to Nem\u0101war. From the tenth to the thirteenth century it was held by the Param\u0101ra kings of M\u0101lw\u0101, in whose time the fine Jain temple at Nem\u0101war village was erected. Under Akbar the district was included in the Hindia sark\u0101r of the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101. Between 1740 and 1745 part of this district fell to the Peshw\u0101, some of its parganas passing in 1782 to Sindhia. In the early years of the nineteenth century the notorious Pind\u0101ri leader Chit\u016b made his head-quarters at Satw\u0101s and Nem\u0101war, and in 1815 collected in this district the largest Pind\u0101ri band ever assembled. In 1844 some parganas were included in the districts assigned for the upkeep of the Gwalior Contingent. After the disturbances of 1857 a portion of Nem\u0101war remained under British management until 1861, when it was made over to Holkar in exchange for certain lands held by him in the Deccan.\n\nThe population decreased from 97,363 in 1891 to 74,568 in 1901, giving a density in the latter year of 70 persons per square mile. There are 337 villages. The district is in charge of a S\u016bbah, whose head-quarters are at Satw\u0101s. It is divided for administrative purposes into three parganas, with head-quarters at Kh\u0101tegaon, K\u0101nt\u0101phor, and Kannod, each in charge of an am\u012bn, who is magistrate and revenue collector of his charge. The total revenue is 3\u00b76 lakhs.\n\nNep\u0101l.\u2014The kingdom of Nep\u0101l, the land of the Gurkhas, is a Native State on the northern frontier of India, extending along the southern slopes of the Him\u0101layas for a length of about 500 miles. Its general direction is from north-west to east, between the 80th and 88th degrees of E. longitude, the most southern and eastern angle reaching as low as the 26th, and its most northern and western corner as high as the 30th degree of N. latitude. In shape, therefore, the country is long and narrow, varying in breadth from 90 to 100 miles, while its area is estimated at 54,000 square miles. Along its northern boundary Nep\u0101l adjoins Tibet; on the east it is bounded by the State of Sikkim and the District of Darjeeling; on the south by Bengal and the United Provinces; and on the west by Kumaun and the river K\u0101li. Nep\u0101l is thus contiguous on three sides to British territory. Very little is known of its northern frontier, which is formed by the eternal snows of the Him\u0101layas; and it is probable that this frontier is not strictly defined, except at the accessible points of the passes leading into\nTibet, where Chinese and Nepalese frontier posts and custom-houses are established.\n\nOrographically the country can best be described as consisting of four zones, running successively upwards from east to west. (1) The Tarai, the lowland at the foot of the hills, is a narrow belt which varies in width from 10 to 30 miles.\n\n(2) The Sandstone range, with its duns or valleys, rises some 600 to 800 feet above the Tarai, and is a continuation of the range known as the Siwaliks. It runs in practical continuity along the whole length of Nepal, the only breaks in the chain being caused by rivers forcing an outlet. The range is covered with thick jungle, as are the valleys lying behind it. These are at an elevation of about 2,500 feet, and connect the Sandstone range with the Himalayas. (3) From the northern extremity of the duns the main range of the Himalayas rises to the north, hill succeeding hill and peak rising above peak, until they culminate in the vast snowy range which runs in majestic grandeur along the northern frontier of Nepal. This hill region, up to an elevation of 10,000 feet, may be taken as the third zone, the fourth being formed by the mountain region above that altitude. The hill country, composed of a series of ranges varying from 5,000 to 10,000 feet, necessarily encloses many valleys. These lie mostly at an elevation of 4,000 feet, and, with the exception of the valley of Kathmandu, or, as it is more frequently called, the Valley of Nepal, are of small size. Being well watered they are highly cultivated, and many of them are thickly populated. (4) Of the mountain region but little is known. The lower slopes are cultivated; but above these the region presents a rugged broken wall of rock, leading up to the magnificent chain of perpetual snow-clad peaks which culminate in Mount Everest (29,002 feet), and others of slightly less altitude.\n\nThe territory of Nepal within the hills is divided into three large natural divisions by lofty ridges which take off from the high peaks of Nanda Devi (25,700 feet), Dhaulagiri (26,826), Gosainthan (26,305), and Kinchinjunga (28,146). These ridges stand out at right angles from the central axis of the Himalayas, and run, parallel to each other, nearly due south towards the plains. Each of the three divisions receives its name from the river by which it is drained: namely, the western division, or mountain basin of the Kauriala (Karnali) or Gogra; the central division, or mountain basin of the Gandak; and the eastern division, or mountain basin of the Kosi.\n\nThe western division is divided into two unequal parts by the Kali or Sarda river, which forms the boundary between Nepal and Kumaun. The territory on the left bank is Nepalese. The most important tributaries of the Kauriala river are the Kali, Babai, and Rapti. They all break through the Sandstone range by different passes, and do not\nunite until they have traversed the plains for some distance, when they flow into the valley of the Ganges.\n\nThe central division has been called by the Nepalese from time immemorial the Sapt Gandak\u012b, or \u2018country of the seven Gandaks,\u2019 from the seven streams which, uniting, form the main river. By these the whole country between Dhaul\u0101giri and Gosainth\u0101n is drained. The most important of them is the most easterly, the Trisulganga. They all unite before breaking through the hills at Tribeni.\n\nThe eastern division is similarly known as the Sapt Kosi, or \u2018country of the seven Kosis,\u2019 of which the most important is the San Kosi. After leaving the hills at Chatra, the Kosi becomes a very broad river. It is said that in places its bed is above the level of the surrounding country, in consequence of which it is constantly overflowing its banks, altering its channel, and causing widespread destruction of crops and property.\n\nBesides these three great geographical divisions, there is a fourth, of comparatively limited extent, but historically and economically the most important, for it contains the Valley of Nep\u0101l proper, with K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, the capital of the kingdom. This district occupies an isolated tract between the basins of the Gandak and the Kosi, and is formed by the bifurcation of the ridge running south from Gosainth\u0101n. It is a gently undulating plain of nearly oval shape, having an average length from north to south of about 20 miles, and an average width of 12 to 14 miles; and it lies 4,700 feet above the level of the sea. It covers about 250 square miles, and is surrounded on all sides by mountains which rise to a height of 7,000 to 9,000 feet. The valley is abundantly watered and drained by a small river, the B\u0101ghmati, which rises on the northern slopes of Sheopuri, the highest mountain forming its northern limit. In its course through the valley the B\u0101ghmati receives innumerable smaller streams, the most important of which is the Vishnumati. The narrow gorge where the united waters leave the valley, Pherping, is the only break in the enclosing circle of mountains. According to ancient Hindu traditions, what is now the Valley of Nep\u0101l was once a large and deep lake, and from a geological point of view this theory is possible. The general surface is broken up into a succession of more or less extensive plateaux.\n\nNep\u0101l generally is devoid of lakes, though it is said that several exist in the province of Pokhra situated to the west of the Nep\u0101l Valley.\n\nThe scenery of Nep\u0101l, as may be gathered from the description of its physical features, is of an exceedingly diversified nature. Skirting the British frontier is the Tarai. This tract, as already stated, lies at the foot of the hills, on a level with the adjoining plains of India. It may be divided into two portions: the open country under cultivation, and primaeval jungle. The latter varies much in character. For the most\npart it consists of dense forests of *s\u0101l* trees (*Shorea robusta*), intermixed with *shisham*, *scmal* or cotton-trees, and nearer the hills *chir* (*Pinus longifolia*). In places it is quite impenetrable, owing to the luxuriant undergrowth and tangle of giant creepers which swing from tree to tree. Here and there the forest is interrupted by stretches of prairie land, whose grass often reaches to a height of 10 to 15 feet; and, where the ground is low-lying and swampy, tracts of *narkat*, or \u2018elephant-grass,\u2019 are found, in some places so dense that not even elephants can work their way through. This grass growth is most marked in the eastern Tarai, where successive floods have swept away the timber. The Tarai is abundantly watered by the various rivers which traverse it to reach the plains. Quicksands, or the still more dreaded *phasan* or bogs, are frequently met with. The latter are waterlogged narrow channels, containing a mass of decaying vegetation, which on the surface appear fordable, but have been known to engulf both men and animals.\n\nLeaving the Tarai, and proceeding inland, the scenery assumes the features of other parts of the Him\u0101layan region, the vegetation varying with the altitude. Here, as elsewhere, the southern faces of the mountains are thickly wooded. Their northern aspects, mostly covered with short grass, lead down to some narrow valley along which runs a mountain torrent. Many of these valleys, as well as the surrounding hillsides, are highly cultivated, rice being grown on the lower and better watered portions of ground, and maize on the higher. A description of the higher ranges resolves itself into the view from the Valley of Nep\u0101l and the mountains overlooking it, for other parts of the interior are jealously closed to Europeans. To the eastern extremity of the long line of snows, a mountain long supposed to be Everest, but which is really Gaur\u012b Sankar, rises with tooth-shaped summit and saddle-back proudly above its fellow peaks. Being more distant, however, it is not so impressive as the nearer masses of Gosainth\u0101n, Dhaul\u0101giri, and Nanda Devi, which together afford one long continuous series of snow peaks, magnificent in beauty and extent.\n\n1 Owing to the jealous exclusion of foreigners, little is known about the geology of Nep\u0101l, though enough to establish the existence of sub-Him\u0101layan and outer Him\u0101layan rocks of the same type as in the United Provinces. The only geological account available is that of Mr. H. B. Medlicott, whose investigations extended to a point a little beyond K\u0101tm\u0101ndu.\n\nThe tract rising out of the Gangetic alluvium and *bh\u0101bar* deposit of coarse gravels presents all the features of the ordinary sub-Him\u0101layan\n\n---\n\n1 This paragraph is based on a note communicated by Mr. C. S. Middlemiss, of the Geological Survey.\n2 \u2018Note on the Geology of Nep\u0101l,\u2019 Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. viii, part iv.\narea. It begins with the Churi\u0101 Gh\u0101ti range, which is the exact equivalent of the typical Siw\u0101lik range south of Dehra D\u016bn, being composed of soft sands and conglomerates of coarse river boulders. The dip is gentle and towards the main range, flattening out in the d\u016bn or mari of Etoundah, which corresponds to the Dehra or Patli d\u016bns. Beyond, harder but still soft sandstones of N\u0101han type form the lower spurs of the main range, and are apparently cut off from the older rocks of the range by a reversed fault, as is the case farther north-west. The whole of this sub-Him\u0101layan series, which aggregates 10,000 feet in thickness, is presumed by analogy to be of Upper Tertiary age. The older rocks of the main range comprise a much-folded sequence of earthy schists, with thin blue limestone beds, black schistose slates, white massive crystalline limestone, quartz-schists, and gneissose granite, the last being porphyritic, and containing mica and schorl. The general strike is with the main Him\u0101layan chain, and the apparent dip is towards the north-east, complicated no doubt by inversion and over-thrust.\n\nThe Valley of Nep\u0101l contains representatives of the karewas of Kashmir and of the b\u0101ngar and kh\u0101dar alluviums of the Ganges valley\u2014all surface deposits laid down in the valley basin within recent or post-pliocene times. With them occur beds of peat and phosphatic blue clays, which are used for fertilizing the fields.\n\nThe flora of Nep\u0101l, throughout the various zones, from the tropical to the sub-alpine and alpine, may be said on the whole to correspond on the east with the species met with in Sikkim and on the west with those of Kumaun and Garhw\u0101l.\n\nIn the thick jungles of the Tarai most of the wild animals known in India are to be found. Though their numbers are probably decreasing, owing to the encroachments of cultivation and the increasing number of sportsmen, there are still tracts of jungle where game abounds. Wild elephants are met with in the eastern Tarai, though not in such large numbers as was formerly the case. They are not allowed to be shot, their capture being one of the great sports of Nep\u0101l as well as a source of revenue. The Nep\u0101lese system of capturing the animals differs from the Khedda operations in other parts of India. It consists of driving the wild herd, by means of tame elephants and an army of beaters, into some well-known narrow valley from which it is difficult for them to escape, an undertaking that often occupies weeks. The big tuskers, who generally remain more or less apart from the herd, are then singled out, and each is separately chased by tame elephants until it is brought to bay, when special fighting elephants are brought up. As soon as these sight and scent the wild elephant they rush with fury upon him, and then ensues a battle of Titans: head down they charge and charge again with a crash as of ironclads colliding, belabour each other with\ntheir trunks, and prod one another with their tusks. When the wild animal can no longer offer any resistance, his hind legs are securely bound together with ropes, and he is hustled into camp or secured to some large tree close by. The females and young are lassoed. In the Tarai the rhinoceros, the tiger, the leopard, and the sloth bear are still plentiful, and the wild buffalo is occasionally seen. In certain grassy tracts hog deer and hog abound, while in the forests and lower hills the s\u0101mbar and chital find shelter. The mountainous districts contain all the game common to such localities.\n\nThe climate of Nep\u0101l varies with the altitude and the rainfall. In the Tarai, where the rainfall is often very heavy, the climate is exceedingly unhealthy between May and December. A very severe type of malaria, called by the natives aul, prevails throughout these lowlands, and is deadly to all except the Th\u0101rus. The last named are aborigines of the Tarai and appear to enjoy immunity from fever there, though it is said that on settling elsewhere they are liable to suffer from malaria. Up to an elevation of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, which would include all the valleys or d\u016bns between the Sandstone range and the Lower Him\u0101layas, the climate during, and just after, the rainy season is also malarious. Above this height, as for example in the Valley of Nep\u0101l, the climate is excellent, resembling that of the South of Europe as regards temperature, though from June to October the moisture of the air is greater. The annual rainfall at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu averages $56\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, of which about half falls in July and August, and the greater part of the rest in May, June, and September. At still higher elevations no observations have been taken, but the rainfall is considerably in excess of that which the valleys receive. In this, as in other respects, the climatic conditions resemble those of other parts of the Eastern Him\u0101layas.\n\nObservations recorded at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu between 1878 and 1901 give the following average temperatures for four representative months: January, $51.9^\\circ$; May, $71.6^\\circ$; July, $77.0^\\circ$; November, $60.2^\\circ$.\n\nAncient chronicles have been kept in Nep\u0101l, as in Kashmir, from which some information of historical value can be drawn. The early history, as usual, is legendary; and we find kings\n\nHistory. from Gaur (Bengal), or from K\u0101nchi (Conjeeveram), reigning alternately with gods and demons. The earliest dynasty named is one of eight Ahirs from Gujar\u0101t, followed by three of the same race from Hindust\u0101n. These were conquered by Kir\u0101tas from the east, of whom twenty-nine reigned. The seventh of these was killed while helping the P\u0101ndavas in the great war recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and in the reign of the fourteenth Asoka visited Nep\u0101l and his daughter married a Kshattriya who founded Deva P\u0101tan. The last Kir\u0101ta was conquered by a Somavansi Kshattriya, whose fourth descendant subdued the whole of India and, being childless, adopted\na S\u016bryavansi. In the time of the eighteenth king Sankarach\u0101rya visited Nep\u0101l and reformed Hinduism. The thirty-first king gave his daughter to Ansu Varman, a Th\u0101kur who was crowned, according to the chronicle, in 101 B.C. At this point the evidence of inscriptions makes it possible to check the absolutely unreliable dates of the chronicler. The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang, who visited India towards the middle of the seventh century A.D., mentions An-chu-fa-mo, who is identified with Ansu Varman, as a king of Nep\u0101l. Inscriptions containing this name are known, and are dated (apparently in the Gupta and Harsha eras) in various years from A.D. 635 to 649 or 650. Ansu Varman and Siva Deva I were apparently both ruling in Nep\u0101l as feudatories of Harshavardhana of Kanauj. On the death of the latter Ansu Varman seems to have become an independent sovereign, and was probably the king of Nep\u0101l who brought 7,000 horsemen to support a Chinese attack on the minister who usurped the throne of Kanauj when Harshavardhana died. One of the successors of Ansu Varman married the daughter of a Maukhari chief, who was also the grand-daughter of a king of Magadha. This dynasty, of eighteen kings, was succeeded by five Th\u0101kurs from Nay\u0101kot, the last of whom was expelled by a collateral descendant of Ansu Varman. The new line consisted of twelve kings, the last two being brothers, one of whom ruled at K\u0101ntipur (K\u0101tm\u0101ndu) and L\u0101lita P\u0101tan, while the other founded Bh\u0101tgaon. They were conquered by N\u0101nya Deva, who came from the Carnatic and seized the whole country. According to the chronicle this happened in the ninth year of the Nep\u0101l era, which was founded by R\u0101ghava Deva in A.D. 879; and N\u0101nya Deva brought in the New\u0101rs, a tribe of Mongolian origin, whose name, in a different form, is preserved in the present 'Nep\u0101l.'\n\nThe reigns allotted to the six kings of this dynasty, as well as to those of the earlier lines, are so long that the chronicler has certainly exaggerated them; and it seems probable that N\u0101nya Deva is the king mentioned in a manuscript as reigning in 1097, and is also the N\u0101nya referred to in an inscription as having been conquered by Vijayasena of Bengal about the end of the eleventh century. The sixth successor of N\u0101nya Deva was dethroned by his own army; and another chief named Mukunda Sena then came from the west, with the Khas and Magars, and conquered the country, but had to fly when a pestilence broke out. Anarchy continued for some years, and petty chiefs ruled the country for a long period. The chronicles now come into line with other historical records which are more reliable, and the lengths assigned to the reigns are reasonable. From 1008 onwards the dates of many rulers are fixed by the colophons of manuscripts as well as by entries in the dynastic lists, but other details of their rule are few. Towards the end of the\nthirteenth century predatory invasions by the Khas from the west began. In 1324 Hari Singh Deva, a Suryavansi who had been driven out of Ajodhya by the Musalmans and had settled in the Tarai at Simraun, conquered the Valley of Nep\u0101l, but does not appear to have maintained any effectual authority over it. Towards the end of the fourteenth century there reigned a king named Jayasthitimalla, who was a patron of literature, a great builder of temples, and a legislator. He regulated the rights of property in houses, lands, and birts (grants), which now became saleable, and reformed the criminal law. Other rules were made regarding dress; and curious details are given of his division of the people into castes, those who had become Buddhists being received back into Hinduism.\n\nMuch of the difficulty in reconciling the chronology arises from the fact that from the earliest times there were often joint rulers, and that sons exercised authority in their father's lifetime. From 1496, or a little earlier, the kingdom was divided between three grandsons of Jayasthitimalla, one of whom ruled at Bh\u0101tgaon, another at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, and a third at Banepa. Little is known of the earlier Bh\u0101tgaon kings beyond their names and dates. Ratnamalla, the first of the K\u0101tm\u0101ndu kings, was a great warrior who subdued the petty Th\u0101kur chiefs and the Bhoti\u0101s of Tibet; and he is said to have introduced a new copper coinage, specimens of which are, however, not known. In his reign the Musalmans first attacked Nep\u0101l, but never had much success. A later king is said to have visited Delhi, and to have obtained permission to strike silver coin of the standard still used. The Banepa line did not last much more than a century, and the tract they ruled then became subject to Bh\u0101tgaon. Early in the seventeenth century the K\u0101tm\u0101ndu territory was divided between two sons of the seventh king, one of whom continued to rule at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, while the other lived at L\u0101lita P\u0101tan. From this period the chronology is firmly established by inscriptions, coins, and chronicles; but the records are not of much interest, chiefly dealing with the foundation of temples and monasteries. About the end of the seventeenth century plague appeared and lasted for two years, the daily mortality being thirty to forty.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century the New\u0101r kingdoms at Bh\u0101tgaon, K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, and P\u0101tan were constantly at variance; and in the course of one of their struggles Ranjit Mal, king of Bh\u0101tgaon, applied for assistance to Prithwi N\u0101r\u0101yan, the crafty and daring king of the Gurkhas. The Gurkhas were at this time in possession of the hilly tracts to the westward of the valley. They are said to have come originally from R\u0101jput\u0101na, whence they fled early in the fourteenth century, after the capture of Chitor by Al\u0101-ud-din Khilji. After passing through the Kumaun hills, they first settled near P\u0101lp\u0101, and thence gradually extended their dominions. Prithwi N\u0101r\u0101yan gladly availed\nhimself of the opportunity thus given of establishing a secure footing in Nep\u0101l. Ranjit Mal, however, soon found out his mistake, and was obliged to come to terms with the neighbouring kings in order to resist the encroachments of the Gurkhas. Nevertheless Prithwi N\u0101r\u0101yan succeeded in taking Kirttipur, a town belonging to the P\u0101tan R\u0101j\u0101, and then proceeded to attack P\u0101tan itself. At this juncture the Nep\u0101lese applied for assistance to the British Government. Aid was granted, and Captain Kinloch was dispatched with a small force in the middle of the rainy season. But his force was quite inadequate for the purpose it had in view, and, being still further weakened by sickness, was repulsed before he had penetrated into the valley. The Gurkhas then returned and attacked K\u0101tm\u0101ndu. Prithwi N\u0101r\u0101yan, having obtained possession of this city by treachery, directed his attention again to P\u0101tan and later on to Bh\u0101tgaon. Both were taken, and in 1769 the conquest of Nep\u0101l by the Gurkhas was complete.\n\nPrithwi N\u0101r\u0101yan did not long hold the country he had so successfully subdued, as he died in 1771. He left two sons, Singh Part\u0101b and Bah\u0101dur Sah, the former of whom succeeded his father. His reign was a short one, for he died in 1775, leaving one legitimate son, Ran Bah\u0101dur Sah, who was an infant. The boy\u2019s uncle, Bah\u0101dur Sah, who had been living in exile at Bettiah, then returned to Nep\u0101l and became regent. The mother of the infant king was, however, opposed to him; and, after a struggle of some years, in which both parties were alternately successful, Bah\u0101dur Sah had to fly to India, where he remained until the death of the R\u0101ni in 1786. He then became regent once more, and so continued until 1795. During his administration the dominions of Nep\u0101l were extended by the annexation of various adjoining principalities, until they reached from Bhut\u0101n to Kashmir, and from Tibet to the borders of the British Provinces.\n\nAfter the failure of Kinloch\u2019s expedition, there was little connexion between British India and Nep\u0101l till the administration of Lord Cornwallis, when negotiations were opened by the Gurkhas, through Jonathan Duncan, then Resident at Benares, which resulted in the commercial treaty of March, 1792. The Gurkhas had previously been extending their conquests in the direction of Tibet, and they finally advanced as far as Digarchi, pillaged the sacred temples, and succeeded in carrying off a large booty. The Emperor of China, as the terrestrial protector and spiritual disciple of the L\u0101mas, dispatched an army of 70,000 men against the Nep\u0101lese, who were overthrown in repeated battles; and the Chinese army advanced to Nay\u0101kot, within 25 miles of K\u0101tm\u0101ndu. It was with a view to arrest their progress that the Gurkha chief formed the commercial treaty with the British, to whom he also applied for military aid. Lord Cornwallis offered to negotiate between Nep\u0101l and China, and a mission under Colonel Kirkpatrick\nreached Nay\u0101kot early in 1792. By this time, however, the Gurkhas had concluded a peace, by which they were compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of China, and to refund the spoil which they had taken from the L\u0101mas. This was the first occasion on which a British officer had entered the valley. Colonel Kirkpatrick had instructions to improve the commercial advantages secured by the treaty; but the Gurkhas evaded all his overtures, and he quitted Nep\u0101l in March, 1793.\n\nIn 1795 Ran Bah\u0101dur Sah removed his uncle from the regency and assumed the reins of government. From this time until 1800 Nep\u0101l was the scene of the most barbarous outrages perpetrated by the king, until at length his conduct became so intolerable that he was driven from the country by D\u0101modar T\u0101nde and other chiefs, who obliged him to abdicate in favour of his illegitimate son. This boy being still an infant, one of the legitimate queens became regent. Ran Bah\u0101dur Sah retired to Benares, where Captain Knox was appointed to attend him as Political Agent. His presence within British territories was deemed a favourable opportunity for the renewal of attempts to form a closer alliance with Nep\u0101l. It was accordingly decided to open negotiations, with the objects of procuring a suitable settlement for the deposed prince, of giving effect to the treaty of 1792, which had become a dead letter, and of arranging for the apprehension and surrender of fugitive dacoits, who had long given trouble on the frontier. These objects, as well as the establishment of a Residency at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, were provided for by treaty in 1801. Captain Knox, who was appointed Resident, reached the capital in April, 1802, and was well received by the R\u0101n\u012b Regent. Arrangements had just been concluded to give full effect to the treaty when Ran Bah\u0101dur's elder R\u0101n\u012b, who had accompanied him to Benares, suddenly returned to K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, overthrew the regency, and herself took charge of the young R\u0101j\u0101 and the government. It now became the policy of the Darb\u0101r to evade fulfilment of their engagements; and their aversion to the presence of the Resident became so marked that in March, 1803, Captain Knox withdrew from Nep\u0101l, and in January, 1804, Lord Wellesley formally dissolved the alliance with the existing government. As a consequence Ran Bah\u0101dur was allowed to return to Nep\u0101l, where he inaugurated his reaccession to power by the murder of the leader of the party opposed to his interests. He was himself killed soon after in a dispute with his brother; and Bh\u012bm Sen Thappa, a young and ambitious man who had accompanied him into exile, obtained possession of the person of the young R\u0101j\u0101, and, being countenanced by Ran Bah\u0101dur's chief R\u0101n\u012b, assumed the direction of affairs.\n\nFrom 1804 to 1812 British relations with Nep\u0101l consisted entirely of unavailing remonstrances against aggressions on the frontier throughout\nits entire length, and of fruitless attempts to induce the Gurkhas to aid in the suppression of frontier dacoities. Commissioners were finally appointed by the British and the Nep\u0101lese to inquire into and adjust all frontier disputes. The result of the investigation was entirely favourable to the British, and in consequence a detachment of regulars was ordered to take possession of the debatable ground. But these being withdrawn during the rainy season, the chief police stations on the frontier were more than once attacked by large bodies of Nep\u0101lese. War was now inevitable, and it was formally declared in November, 1814.\n\nThe invasion of the Gurkha dominions was commenced on the western frontier, beyond the Jumna and near the Sutlej, the country there being considered easier of access than the mountainous barrier on the side of Bengal. But the British troops, in attempting to storm the stockades and hill forts, were repeatedly driven back with serious loss. The most desperate resistance of the enemy was perhaps at Kalanga near Dehra, where General Gillespie fell while encouraging his troops to renew the attack. In 1815 Sir David Ochterlony assumed the chief command. By a series of skilful operations he dislodged the Gurkha troops from the fortified heights of Malaun, and ultimately so hemmed in their renowned commander, Amar Singh, and his son, that they were forced to sign a capitulation, by which they agreed, on being permitted to retreat with their remaining troops, to abandon the whole territory west of the K\u0101li. In Kumaun, also, the British succeeded in driving the enemy before them; and, in consequence of these successes, a definite treaty of peace was concluded in November, 1815. But the signature of the R\u0101j\u0101 being withheld, it was determined to renew the war and strike a decisive blow at the capital. Preparations for this arduous enterprise were made on a great scale, a force being assembled in S\u0101ran which numbered about 13,000 regular troops, of whom 3,000 were Europeans, and a large body of irregulars. This formidable force took the field in the end of January, 1816, and advanced from Bettiah directly on K\u0101tm\u0101ndu. The greatest difficulties were encountered, from the ruggedness of the country, in marching along the dry beds of torrents, through ravines, and on the face of precipices. The Gurkhas made a brave resistance, but they were defeated in several encounters, and the British advanced to within three days' march of K\u0101tm\u0101ndu. Deeming all further resistance vain, and fearing that if the British troops once entered the Valley of Nep\u0101l it might be taken from them, the Nep\u0101lese hurriedly sent an ambassador to the British headquarters to sue for peace; and on March 4, 1816, the unratified treaty of the previous year was duly signed. By this treaty the Nep\u0101lese renounced all claims to the territory in dispute, and ceded their recent conquests west of the K\u0101li, including Kumaun and the sites now occupied by the towns of Dehra D\u016bn, Almor\u0101, and Simla.\nIn November, 1816, the young R\u0101j\u0101 died of small-pox at the age of twenty-one. He was succeeded by his infant son, R\u0101jendra Bikram Sah, under the guardianship of the Minister, Bh\u012bm Sen Thappa. In 1837 this R\u0101j\u0101\u2019s youngest son died suddenly, and the report was spread that he had been poisoned at the instigation of Bh\u012bm Sen or some of his party. Bh\u012bm Sen had to retire, and two years afterwards was forced to commit suicide, while his nephew M\u0101tabar Singh proceeded to the Punjab, where he found service under the Lahore Darb\u0101r. Alternate factions now held sway for some years, and incessant family feuds led to the recall of M\u0101tabar Singh, in 1843, to take up the post of Minister. His sway was short, for within two years he was murdered by his own nephew, Jang Bah\u0101dur, who from this time played a prominent part in the history of Nep\u0101l. Brave, intelligent, and ambitious, he had early attracted attention; and it was at the instigation of Bikram Sah\u2019s R\u0101n\u012b that he murdered his uncle, and in return was appointed to the command of the army. Shortly afterwards, in 1846, Guggan Singh, the new Minister, was assassinated, and the R\u0101n\u012b, with whom he was a favourite, demanded vengeance. Jang Bah\u0101dur undertook the task and executed it with alacrity. An assembly of chiefs and nobles was convened within the palace to inquire into the crime and to punish the culprits. Disputes arose, and a refusal on the part of one of the council to carry out the orders of the indignant R\u0101n\u012b resulted in what is now known as the massacre of the Khot, in which 150 Sard\u0101rs perished. The slaughter was no sooner over than the R\u0101n\u012b invested Jang Bah\u0101dur with the office of Minister. A month later a conspiracy was formed for his destruction, in which the R\u0101n\u012b was implicated, but Jang Bah\u0101dur seized and beheaded all the adherents of the chief conspirator. The R\u0101n\u012b was banished with her two younger sons; and as the R\u0101j\u0101 accompanied them, the heir-apparent, Surendra Bikram Sah, was raised to the throne.\n\nJang Bah\u0101dur proved himself a strong, sagacious, and just ruler. With the complete overthrow of the various parties opposed to him, and with the young R\u0101j\u0101 reduced to a mere cipher, all power became vested in his person. Towards the British he always professed a very friendly feeling, which was heightened by a visit to Europe in 1850. This visit marks an epoch in the history of Nep\u0101l. It proved the strength of Jang Bah\u0101dur\u2019s position, inasmuch as he dared to leave, within four years of his accession to power, a country whose past history was one of continuous intrigue and bloodshed. It is also remarkable that from so remote and little known a State should have come the first of the many Native rulers who have visited England. The visit had a most beneficial effect in many ways. Jang Bah\u0101dur was accompanied by two of his brothers and several of the influential men of the country, who thus had an opportunity of becoming ac-\nquainted with the power and resources of the British nation. Evidence of this was forthcoming in the troublous days of 1857, when Jang Bah\u0101dur's counsel prevailed against those who would have him join the mutineers, and resulted in an offer of assistance to the British. The offer, though made on the outbreak of the Mutiny, was not accepted until after Delhi had been taken and Lucknow relieved. In July and August 4,000 troops had left Nep\u0101l for the plains, and in December Jang Bah\u0101dur himself went down at the head of 8,000 men. They assisted at the recapture of Gorakhpur and Lucknow, and the subsequent operations against rebels who infested the Tarai. The troops employed were paid by the British, and the wounded and relatives of the killed received a liberal donation. Jang Bah\u0101dur, who had previously received the title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 from his own sovereign, was created a G.C.B.; and under a treaty concluded in 1860, a tract of country at the foot of the hills, on the Oudh frontier, which had been ceded to the British in 1816, was restored to Nep\u0101l. In 1854 a rupture had occurred between the Nep\u0101lese and Tibetan governments. After short hostilities and protracted negotiations, a treaty was concluded by which the Tibetans bound themselves to pay an annual tribute of Rs. 10,000 to Nep\u0101l, to encourage trade between the two countries, and to receive a representative of Nep\u0101l at Lh\u0101sa. Jang Bah\u0101dur died, at the age of about sixty, in 1877. Three years earlier he had been made a G.C.S.I., and had been granted a personal salute of 19 guns. Previous to his death he had arranged that the office of Minister should pass to his eldest surviving brother Ranud\u012bp Singh, and thereafter from brother to brother till the death of the last, when it should revert to his own eldest son, Jagat Jang.\n\nIn 1881 the present king of Nep\u0101l, Mah\u0101r\u0101j Dhir\u0101j Prithwi Bir Bikram Sah, then a child of six, succeeded his grandfather, Surendra Bikram Sah. A conspiracy against the Minister Ranud\u012bp Singh, and the Commander-in-Chief, his brother Dh\u012br Shamsher, was detected in January, 1882. Jagat Jang was suspected of complicity and exiled, but was permitted to return in 1885. This was considered inimical to their interests by the sons of Dh\u012br Shamsher, who had died in 1884. Consequently, in November, 1885, they rose against Ranud\u012bp Singh and, having put him to death, seized all power in the State in the name of the sovereign. Jagat Jang and his eldest son were at the same time killed. Bir Shamsher, the eldest son of Dh\u012br Shamsher, assumed the post of Minister, and under his rule the country enjoyed peace and progressive prosperity. He introduced a supply of pipe-water into the towns of K\u0101tm\u0101ndu and Bh\u0101tgaon, inaugurated a drainage system on a large scale, and built hospitals and schools. For himself he erected a magnificent palace modelled on the lines of Government House, Calcutta. The love of building was one of his\nmost marked traits, and his example was followed by his brothers and the leading men of the State. With the British Government he throughout continued to maintain friendly relations, and was conciliatory and helpful in minor matters, such as boundary disputes and dacoity questions, besides affording increased facilities for the recruiting of Gurkhas for the British service. He died in March, 1901, genuinely regretted by his countrymen, to whom he had always been liberal, moderate, and just.\n\nOn Bir Shamsher's death his brother Deb Shamsher succeeded without opposition to the office of Minister, but within three months he was deposed by his next brother, Chandra Shamsher, who is still Minister (1908). In January, 1903, Chandra Shamsher, with one of his brothers and some of the leading men in Nep\u0101l, attended the Coronation Darb\u0101r at Delhi as the guests of the Government of India. With the present Minister at the head of affairs, there is no reason to fear that the relations between Nep\u0101l and the British Government will be of a less friendly nature than heretofore. Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Chandra Shamsher is an able and shrewd man, with an intimate knowledge of English. Fully impressed with the advantages which might accrue to Nep\u0101l from the introduction of the arts and sciences of Western civilization, he yet clings to the traditions of his countrymen, whose jealousy of their independence dictates the policy of isolation which has been systematically carried on for the last hundred years.\n\nThe political status of Nep\u0101l is somewhat difficult to define. It may be said to stand intermediate between Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and the Native States of India. The point of resemblance to Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n is in the complete freedom which Nep\u0101l enjoys in the management of its internal affairs, while in both countries foreign relations are controlled by the Indian Government. The analogy to the Native States is that, by treaty, Nep\u0101l is obliged to receive a British Resident at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, and cannot take Europeans into service without the sanction of the Indian Government. But, for the reasons above given, the functions of the Resident differ from those that are commonly exercised by Residents at Native courts.\n\nNep\u0101l is also brought into relations with China, whose nominal suzerainty she acknowledges. It is an influence that weighs light, and consists in the dispatch, every five years, of a mission with presents to the ruling Emperor. This mission, though it may at one time have carried a certain amount of political significance, has now mainly a trading aspect. Its expenses are paid by the Chinese from the time it crosses the Nep\u0101lese frontier, and a brisk trade is carried on throughout the journey.\n\nFrom the foregoing account of the history of Nep\u0101l it will be seen that the government of the country has generally been in the hands of\nthe Minister of the day. Since the time of Jang Bahadur this system of government has been clearly laid down and defined. The sovereign, or Maharaj Dhiraj as he is called, is but a dignified figure-head, whose position can best be likened to that of the Mikado during the Shogunate. The real ruler of the country is the Minister, who, while enjoying complete monopoly of power, couples with his official rank the exalted title of Maharaja. Next to him comes the Commander-in-Chief, who ordinarily succeeds to the office of Minister.\n\nTo archaeologists Nepal has of late become a country of the deepest interest. Working on the detailed accounts of their pilgrimages which the Chinese pilgrims Fa Hian (A.D. 400-14) and Hiuen Tsiang (A.D. 629-45) have left behind them, important Buddhist discoveries have been made within the last few years. The site of Kapilavastu has now been fixed within a few miles of Paderia in the western Tarai. This was the ancient capital of the Sakyas, from whose royal house Gautama Buddha was descended, and he was born in the Lumbini grove close by. Many of the sites connected with scenes of Buddha's life have been identified by the remains of Asoka pillars bearing various inscriptions. They also mark the stages of Asoka's pilgrimages (257-244 B.C.). Excavations, up to the present, have not been made on an extensive scale. The work, which can only be carried on during the cold season, has hitherto been undertaken by the Nepali Government, under the superintendence of European archaeologists. Authorities differ as to when and how Buddhism penetrated into the Valley of Nepal. Some say that it was a flourishing religion in 300 B.C., while others give the first century of our era as the probable date of its introduction. Innumerable Buddhist stupas and shrines are scattered throughout the valley. Of these the two most renowned are those of Sambhunath and Budnath, within a few miles of Katmandu. The exact dates of erection of these temples are not known; probably some of the smaller and less important stupas are of greater antiquity.\n\nThe most striking feature of the architecture of Nepal is its Chinese character. It is in every way different from that of India, in a great measure owing to the absence of Muhammadan influence on the arts and religion of the country. Nepal has been called 'the land of good houses,' and deservedly so. There is abundant evidence that under the Newars the art of building reached a high stage of perfection, while the profusion of ornamentation in wood- and metal-work attests the liberal encouragement that those arts received. In the building of temples and houses the chief material used is bricks: these are of an excellent quality, of a rose-red colour, and faced with glaze the art of making which is said to have been lost. The temples, of which there are an endless number, are pagoda-shaped, with roofs varying in number from one to five. These are pent-tiled and, in the case of the more\nimportant temples, covered with copper-gilt or brass sheeting. A wealth of wood-carving ornaments the buildings and the eaves of the roofs, mostly taking the form of projecting latticed windows and doorways. In design many of the patterns are exceedingly intricate and beautiful, while others are of a grotesque or obscene nature. Facing many of the temples and palaces are monolithic pillars, crowned with the effigy in copper-gilt of one of the R\u0101j\u0101s or of a winged Garuda. As regards the antiquity of the buildings in the Valley of Nep\u0101l, it is doubtful if any of them, with the exception of the st\u016bpas, date back to a period prior to the fourteenth century. Most of them were probably erected between 1600 and 1700. Since the Gurkha conquest there has been little encouragement of the arts indigenous to the country. Many of the temples and palaces have been allowed to fall into disrepair, while the needs of an ever-increasing population have directed the talents of the people into more utilitarian channels.\n\nIn the absence of any statistics, for a census of Nep\u0101l has never been taken, it is possible to give only a rough estimate of the population of the country. In all probability it does not exceed Population. 4,000,000, of whom at least 500,000 are found in the Valley of Nep\u0101l, inhabiting the three main towns and the surrounding villages and hills. This is the most densely populated district in the country, and of late years a marked increase in the number of its inhabitants has been noticed. The Indian Census of 1901 showed nearly a quarter of a million immigrants from Nep\u0101l in British India. The great majority of these are settlers from the Nep\u0101l frontier tracts, and have been replaced there, in equal or greater amount, by emigrants from the British side.\n\nThe diseases most prevalent throughout the country are rheumatism, chronic dyspepsia, skin diseases, syphilis, and goitre. During the rains malaria and dysentery are common in the low-lying districts and the Tarai. Epidemics of cholera used to be of frequent occurrence in K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, but since the introduction of a pure water-supply cholera has almost entirely disappeared. Small-pox is constantly present in the valley, but the ravages caused by this disease are moderating owing to the spread of vaccination. The plague epidemic from which India has suffered so much of late years has not yet made its appearance in Nep\u0101l.\n\nThe marriage tie is by no means so binding among the New\u0101rs as among the Gurkhas. Every New\u0101r girl when a child is married to a \u2018bael fruit,\u2019 which, after the ceremony, is thrown into some sacred river. On her attaining the age of puberty a husband is selected for her. She is, however, at liberty to claim a divorce if the marriage prove uncongenial; the only intimation necessary before she leaves the house is that she should place two betel-nuts in her bed. She is then\nfree to choose another husband. At the same time, provided she cohabits only with men of her own or a higher caste, she can, whenever she pleases, return to the house of her first husband and resume charge of his family. The Gurkhas punish breaches of conjugal fidelity most severely. An erring wife is imprisoned for life, and the dishonoured husband is expected to cut down the seducer with his kukri the first time he encounters him. Polygamy is not uncommon, and some of the wealthy men have many wives. A widow cannot marry again, but it is not considered disgraceful for her to form part of another man's household.\n\nThe great aboriginal stock of Nep\u0101l is Mongolian. The following are the main tribes or castes into which the people may conveniently be grouped.\n\nThe Khas, Magars, Gurungs, and Th\u0101kurs are the military tribes of the kingdom, from whom the fighting element of the army is drawn. They are the descendants of aboriginal tribes who intermarried with R\u0101jputs and other Hindus, refugees in the hills of Nep\u0101l from Muhammadan invasion in the twelfth century. Since the Gurkha conquest, they have spread throughout the whole country, though their real habitat is to the west of the Valley of Nep\u0101l. It is to these tribes that the often misapplied term 'Gurkha' or 'Gurkhal\u012b' should be confined. The New\u0101rs inhabit the Valley of Nep\u0101l, of which they are the oldest known inhabitants, and constitute the largest section of the population. They are good agriculturists, keen traders, and skilled workers in wood and metal. Then come a number of other tribes of Tibetan stock, known by the generic name of Bhoti\u0101: namely, the Kir\u0101ntis, who inhabit the wilder valleys of Eastern Nep\u0101l, and are more purely Mongoloid and less civilized than the New\u0101rs; the Murmis; and the Limb\u016bs, who are found in the eastern hills adjoining Sikkim and Darjeeling. The Lepch\u0101s also inhabit this tract. The Th\u0101rus and Boks\u0101s are distinct from the dominant Tartar breeds of the mountains, and more akin to the aboriginal tribes of India. They inhabit the Tarai and the low-lying valleys which open into it.\n\nThe Gurkhas as a class have marked Mongolian features; they are of low stature, with good muscular chest and limb development, fair complexions, with little or no hair on face or body. The New\u0101rs, while also possessing Mongolian features, differ from the Gurkhas in being taller, slimmer, and more sallow in complexion.\n\nThe languages spoken in Nep\u0101l belong to the Tibeto-Him\u0101layan branch of the Tibeto-Burman family, and are described as follows by Dr. Grierson in the India Census Report for 1901 (paragraph 400):\n\n'K\u0101mi and Bhr\u0101m\u016b are two dialects of Western Nep\u0101l. . . . Except for vocabularies by Hodgson, nothing is known about them. Padhi, Pahr\u012b, or Pah\u012b has its home in the hills of Central Nep\u0101l. H\u0101yu or\nV\u0101yu is spoken by a tribe inhabiting the basin of the Kosi, east of Nep\u0101l proper, and has been fully described by Hodgson. The Kir\u0101nti group of languages was also first brought to light by that eminent scholar. Under that name he included no less than sixteen different forms of speech. According to native authorities, the name is at the present day, strictly speaking, applied to the languages spoken by the... J\u012bmd\u0101rs and Y\u0101kh\u0101s who inhabit the portion of the present kingdom of Nep\u0101l which lies between the T\u0101mbor river on the east and the D\u016bd Kosi on the west.... \u201cGurung and Mangar [Magar],\u201d says Mr. E. A. Gait, \u201care spoken by the well-known tribes of the same names who form the backbone of our Gurkha regiments. They and the Sunuw\u0101rs have their home in the basin of the Gandak, to the north-west of Nep\u0101l proper; but they have spread eastwards and are now to be found all over Nep\u0101l, and even in Darjeeling and Sikkim. The Gurungs, who in Western Nep\u0101l are Buddhists, following the L\u0101mas of Tibet, show more marked affinities to Tibetan in their vocabulary than do most of the other Nep\u0101l tribes. They are now... giving up their tribal language in favour of Khas.... The Mangars are much more faithful to their mother tongue.... The Sunuw\u0101rs and Th\u0101mis have also, as a rule, preserved their own language. Th\u0101mi is sometimes supposed to be identical with Sunuw\u0101r, but this is a mistake.\u201d New\u0101r\u012b was the ancient state language of Nep\u0101l before the overthrow of the New\u0101r dynasty in 1769.... It is the vernacular of Central and Eastern Nep\u0101l. Hodgson is the only English authority who has given it any study, but it has received considerable attention from scholars in Germany and Russia, who have published a grammar and a dictionary. The Murmis of Eastern Nep\u0101l are also known as Tam\u0101\u1e45g Bhoti\u0101s,... and are said by tradition to have immigrated from Tibet. For this reason their language has often been classed as one of the forms of Bhoti\u0101, but, according to Mr. Gait, without valid reason. Its vocabulary much more closely resembles Gurung than it does Tibetan. M\u0101njh\u012b is said to be the name of two fishing tribes of Nep\u0101l.... The Limb\u016b country proper, or Limb\u016ban, is in Nep\u0101l, east of the Kir\u0101nti tract, and south-east of the Khambu one.... According to Hodgson, it is difficult to assign their language to any known origin. They are said to have a written character of their own. Nearly all these languages of Nep\u0101l are, so far as British territory is concerned, either found in Darjeeling and its neighbourhood, or are the vernaculars of members of our Gurkha regiments.\n\nThe lingua franca of Nep\u0101l is Parbatya (\u2018hill speech\u2019), a language which resembles Hindi and is written in the N\u0101gari character. It forms the medium of communication between the tribes who speak the various tongues above mentioned, and is classified by Dr. Grierson as Eastern Pah\u0101r\u012b. A kindred language, Central Pah\u0101r\u012b, is spoken in Western Nep\u0101l, where the local dialect is known as Palp\u0101, from the town of that name.\n\nThe religion of the ruling dynasty of Nep\u0101l, as of the majority of the Gurkhas, Th\u0101rus, and Boksas, and of a portion of the New\u0101rs, is Hinduism; the other tribes profess Buddhism, and at the present day\nthe two religions are found flourishing side by side and in about equal strength. It has been said that Hinduism is gradually displacing Buddhism throughout Nep\u0101l; but of this there is little evidence. The Buddhists enjoy complete religious liberty, and are a flourishing, contented community. Legend states that when Gautama Buddha visited Nep\u0101l he found that the fundamental principles of his religion had already been introduced among the New\u0101rs by Manj\u016bsri, from China. Be this as it may, the inhabitants readily adopted Buddhism, which has since remained the religion of a large proportion of the population. It is, however, a debased form of the religion that is followed, for it has been modified by the adoption or retention of many Hindu doctrines and practices. In fact, Hindus and Buddhists may often be seen worshipping at the same shrine.\n\n'It is to the indefatigable researches of Brian Hodgson that we owe the discovery of Buddhism as a living religion in Nep\u0101l. While Resident at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu he investigated the subject closely, and the results are embodied in a most interesting paper in the second volume of the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society. He showed how the philosophic agnosticism of Buddha gave way to the theory that the Adi Buddha, by his union with the primordial female energy called Prajna, gave birth to five Buddhas, who each produced from himself by dhy\u0101na (meditation) another being called his Bodhi-satwa or son. The chief of these latter was Avalokita, who, with his Sakti, T\u0101r\u0101, eventually became the key-stone of Northern Buddhism. There arose also numerous other Buddhas, demons, and deities, all of which were objects of worship; and then came the introduction of the Tantrik mysticism, based on the pantheistic idea of Yoga, or the ecstatic union of the soul with the supreme spirit. At this stage, as in Tantrik Hinduism, the Saktis, or female counterparts of the Bodhi-satwas, occupied the most prominent position, and the esoteric cult of these female deities became every whit as obscene as that practised by the Kaula or extreme sect of S\u0101kta Hindus. It was this form of Buddhism which was introduced into Tibet, where it became even more debased by the incorporation of the demon-worship which preceded it, as has been ably described by Colonel Waddell.' (India Census Report, 1901, paragraph 648.)\n\nThe largest community of Buddhists is found among the New\u0101rs, of whom at least two-thirds profess themselves such, while the remainder are Hindus. The other Buddhist tribes are the Bhoti\u0101s, Limb\u016bs, and Lepch\u0101s. Though there are different sects among them, their religious customs and ceremonies are much alike. In their worship they make great use of offerings of flowers and fruit, and also of sacrifices of buffaloes, goats, and cocks. The blood of the victims is sprinkled on the shrine, and the flesh is consumed by the worshippers. The system of vih\u0101ras or monasteries, so conspicuous a religious feature in Tibet, once flourished in Nep\u0101l; but since the Gurkha conquest it has com-\n\n1 The Buddhism of Tibet, or L\u0101maism.\npletely disappeared, and there are now no Buddhist monks in the country. In principle, religious customs and caste rules among the Hindus are the same as in India; but in reality they are far less strict, at least within the confines of their own country.\n\nThe New\u0101rs and Gurkhas are exceedingly superstitious, the most ordinary occurrences of everyday life being imputed by them to supernatural agency. In consequence, the astrologers form a large class of the community and are consulted on all points.\n\nBoth Buddhists and Hindus burn their dead.\n\nPrior to the Gurkha invasion, a Roman Catholic mission had been long established in the Valley of Nep\u0101l, where it had secured many converts and received grants of land from the New\u0101r monarchs. In 1769, when Prithwi N\u0101r\u0101yan made himself master of the valley, permission was granted to the Christians to retire into British territory, and most of the converts settled at Bettiah. Their church at P\u0101tan was in existence up to 1802, but at the present day all traces of the mission have been lost. The Gurkha government, though very tolerant as regards the religious observances of its Buddhist subjects and of such Muhammadan traders as have settled in the country, is strongly opposed to the establishment of any Christian mission. According to a popular saying among the Gurkhas\u2014'With the Bible comes the bayonet; with the merchant comes the musket.'\n\nThe higher Hindu castes live in the same way as their brethren of India, but most of the population consume a great deal more flesh than the natives of the plains of Hindust\u0101n. The Gurkhas eat the flesh of goats, sheep, and ducks, to which the higher classes add deer, wild boar, and pheasants. The sheep used as food are all imported from the hills to the north, sheep from the plains of India being rejected because they have long tails. The New\u0101rs are great consumers of buffaloes, goats, sheep, fowls, and ducks. It is not often, however, that the poorer classes can indulge in flesh; and the greater part of their food consists of rice, maize, potatoes, and vegetables, which are generally plentiful throughout the year. Garlic and red pepper are especial favourites. The New\u0101rs, and most of the lower Hindu castes, consume a considerable quantity of a coarse kind of beer called juar and a spirit called rakshi. These are manufactured from rice and wheat.\n\nIn summer the Gurkhas wear paij\u0101mas, and a jacket or long tunic of white or blue cotton with a voluminous cummerbund, in which is invariably fastened a kukri or large curved knife. In winter they wear similar clothes padded with cotton. The head-dress is generally a small skull-cap, though they often wear a loosely folded pagri.\n\nThe poorer classes of the New\u0101rs wear in general little but a waist-cloth, and a long jacket of coarse cotton or woollen cloth, according\nto the season. Sometimes the dress of the men consists of a long robe like a woman's gown, reaching to the ankles and gathered into numerous pleats from the waist. The head-dress of the New\u0101rs is a small, close-fitting cap of black or white cloth, thinly wadded with cotton and generally turned up for an inch or so at the border. The women of all the races dress much alike, wearing by way of petticoat a cloth gathered into a mass of pleats and almost touching the ground in front, but barely coming below the knees behind. Besides this, they wear a small jacket and a s\u0101r\u012b, which is generally wrapped round the body like a broad cummerbund.\n\nThe women of the upper classes wear a very distinctive and picturesque dress. It consists of very voluminous paj\u0101mas, tight-fitting above the ankles. Over this is worn a false skirt made of thin coloured muslin or tulle, as many as 80 yards of material being employed. The jackets are tight-fitting, while across the shoulders is thrown a wisp of muslin. Every shade of colour, from the most vivid to the most delicate, is utilized, thus greatly adding to the picturesqueness of the dress. Head-dress they have none; but the New\u0101r women may be distinguished from the other races by having their hair gathered into a short thick club on the crown of the head, whereas the Gurkha women have it plaited into a long tail, ornamented at the end with red cotton or silk. All the women wear a profusion of ornaments; and both men and women are very fond of flowers, which they make great use of in adorning their hair.\n\nThe dwelling-houses are mostly of brick, two or three storeys in height, built round a central courtyard.\n\nGurkhas delight in all manly sports, such as shooting and fishing. Their great vice is gambling, to which they are greatly addicted. This is allowed only for a limited number of days at certain festivals, when the whole population engage in it, and groups of gamblers, all busily occupied, day and night, in dice-throwing, render the streets impassable.\n\nAs the shrines of Nep\u0101l are estimated at over 2,700, the religious festivals are naturally numerous. The most important of them are the Machendr\u0101 J\u0101tra, Indr\u0101 J\u0101tra, Dasahra, Dew\u0101li, and Holi. Though these are primarily Hindu festivals, the Buddhist population participate in them freely.\n\nThe soil of the Valley of Nep\u0101l, consisting of the d\u00e9bris washed down from the surrounding hills, may be divided into two classes, the clayey and the sandy. Between the extremes of a dense unproductive clay and a mere bed of micaceous sand, every variety of mixture is found. The soil is remarkable for the absence of any kind of rock formation: even pebbles are hardly ever seen on the surface. Almost every available portion of\nland in the valley is under cultivation. The New\u0101rs, who are the principal agriculturists, employ very primitive tools. For digging they use a kod\u0101li or peculiar-shaped hoe. With this they turn up the soil into ridges, about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ feet broad and 8 inches high. After the ground has been exposed to the air for a longer or shorter period, it is broken up by means of a mallet, shaped somewhat like a heavy wooden rake without the teeth. The only other tools employed are small instruments for weeding, a small hook for reaping, and wooden shovels for turning over the crop when drying.\n\nThe work of cultivation is done almost entirely by hand, and the soil being by no means rich, it is necessary to manure the ground. The manure chiefly used consists of a dark unctuous-looking clay, very tenacious and firm. It is generally found in layers of from 2 to 20 feet in thickness at various depths below the surface. This clay is dug out in the cold season and allowed to dry in heaps on the sides of the fields till the time for sowing, when it is spread over the fields and broken up into a fine powder with the mallet. It appears to consist of silica and alumina in a very fine state of division, and shows no trace of calcareous or vegetable matter. The fields are in general small, partly on account of the number of landowners, but also because irrigation is thus rendered easier. For this reason, too, whenever the soil is not naturally on a dead level it is formed into terraces. As the whole Valley slopes generally from the hills towards the centre, irrigation is as a rule easily effected by means of small ditches or canals. Around each field is a narrow raised ledge, to retain the water while the rice crop is growing. The rotation of crops varies in the different classes of ground. In the marshy lands near the rivers only one crop is grown, namely, transplanted rice. In less easily flooded lands a crop of wheat is grown in the cold season, and in the next spring gya\u1e25 or upland rice, followed by urd or some other kind of pulse. In the moister lands of the upper level the wheat is followed by radishes, mustard, or buckwheat, and these again by transplanted rice. In the best lands the succession of crops is simply transplanted rice followed by wheat, or by mustard, radishes, or garlic. Sometimes, in the \u2018dry\u2019 lands, wheat is followed by maize, or ginger, turmeric, and red pepper are grown.\n\nRice is the most common crop. There are several varieties, but they may be divided into the transplanted and the gya\u1e25. The former is sown in May, is transplanted as soon as the rains have fairly set in, i.e. early in July, and is reaped in November. The gya\u1e25 rice is sown in lands of higher level during the latter half of April, and is ready for cutting by the end of August or beginning of September. The average yield of transplanted rice is 40 bushels, and of gya\u1e25 25 bushels, per acre.\n\nWheat is largely grown in Nep\u0101l, but does not form a favourite\narticle of food with the people, and little attention is bestowed on its cultivation. It is generally used in the manufacture of coarse beer and spirit, which are largely consumed by the New\u0101rs and Bhoti\u0101s. After the rice crop is off the ground in December, the wheat is sown broadcast, and no further care is taken of it. The crop ripens by the middle of May, and the yield is about 14 bushels per acre.\n\nBarley and oats are grown in small quantities, and only in the valley. The latter crop seems to thrive remarkably well, but it is used only for feeding horses. Maize, or makai, is much cultivated on the higher grounds of the valley, and on the hills, where it grows luxuriantly though hardly any care is bestowed upon it. In the valley it is carefully hoed, weeded, and manured. It is sown in the end of May and ripens about the beginning of September. The average yield is 15 bushels per acre. Mar\u016ba is a small millet-like grain, largely grown on the hills and on the sides of the ravines in the valley. It is sown in May or June, and reaped in October or November. It does not require irrigation, and little trouble is taken with it. The average yield is about 15 bushels per acre. Capsicums and red peppers of every variety are much cultivated, and Nep\u0101l pepper is famous for its peculiarly delicate flavour. Potatoes are grown both in the valley and on the adjacent hills. They are planted in January and February, and are dug in May and June. Buckwheat, mustard, garlic, radishes of a large white kind, sugar-cane, ginger, and turmeric are also grown in varying quantities.\n\nFamine is unknown and scarcity infrequent: if it is threatened, the government prohibits the export of grain.\n\nAll kinds of European vegetables can be grown in the Valley of Nep\u0101l, which also produces strawberries, pears, quinces, plums, apples, apricots, peaches, and a few grapes. Oranges and lemons grow most luxuriantly and are of very fine flavour. In the adjacent small hot valleys all the fruits of the plains of India grow freely.\n\nThere are few cattle in the valley, as there is no grazing ground except at the foot of the hills. Buffaloes, sheep, and goats for food are all imported. Ducks and fowls are plentiful and of good quality. Considerable care is bestowed on the rearing of ducks, their eggs being greatly prized as an article of food. They are carried out daily to the rice-fields in large baskets and allowed to feed there, and in the evening are collected and carried home again.\n\nThe Tarai varies considerably in its produce according to the nature of the soil and the amount of cleared lands. The chief products are rice, wheat, and sugar-cane. The soil is a rich alluvium and is well adapted for every kind of crop, including poppy and tobacco. From the Tarai is derived the greater part of the revenue of the country, and much grain is annually exported to British territory. Large herds\nof cattle are also found in the Tarai, owing to the very superior grazing it affords.\n\nMost of the land is held on a simple ryotwari tenure. The rent paid by the cultivator, whether to the State or to a private landlord, varies according to the value of the crop and the situation of the land. Throughout the valley and the Tarai it is roughly calculated at half the value of the crops, and is sometimes paid in cash and sometimes in kind. In the hills the cultivator pays 13 annas a year for as much land as can be cultivated by a pair of bullocks, for the land ploughed by one bullock 6\u00bd annas, and for as much as can be tilled with a hoe 4 annas. The people throughout the country are prosperous and contented, the government being lenient in granting remissions during times of scarcity.\n\nThe forests of Nep\u0101l may be classified, according to the region they occupy, as Tarai, Submontane, and Hill forests. Those of the Tarai stand on the shallower and later alluvial deposits, which consist of low-lying lands bearing the impress of the recent action of flood-water. In the sequence of swamps which are a marked feature of this grass-clad country the former courses of rivers now running in other channels may readily be traced, and in the dry watercourses, lined with boulders and gravel, recent changes in the waterways are evident. In these gently sloping or level areas the most insignificant obstacle\u2014a stranded log, a landslip from the sandy banks\u2014may divert the torrents that burst from the hills during the period of monsoon precipitation or melting snow. Of what was yesterday a forest spreading evenly over the plain there may remain on the morrow only picturesque groups of islands, the shallow soil originally swept from the hills having as suddenly passed away, ultimately no doubt to the benefit of the dwellers on the lower courses of the large Indian rivers. On these islands, and along the low banks of the shifting water-channels, forests of shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) and khair (Acacia Catechu) grow with exceeding rapidity. In such localities the younger classes are represented in densely growing masses, and forests are yearly created from water-borne seed deposited by the subsiding floods. On the higher and more stable ground older specimens of these valuable trees are found, mature and isolated, surrounded by high grasses or by thickets of softer wood. These latter, once established, may, by the gradual raising of the soil and by the stability afforded by their interlacing roots, withstand the influence of all but the highest floods, and so gradually join hands with the Submontane forests which, though bearing a distinctive vegetation, stretch out from the hills long arms into the Tarai formation.\n\nThe Submontane forests are found in the older and more stable alluvium, and in the broken ground formed by the gradual but con-\ntinuous crumbling of the loftier hills. Here flourish the valuable hard woods of s\u0101l (*Shorea robusta*) and *asaina* (*Terminalia tomentosa*), besides various other species, such as *Cedrela*, *Adina*, *Schleichera*, and *Eugenia*, which yield timber or other products of economic value. Here, too, in the foothills of the Him\u0101layas, the well-known *b\u0101bar* grass is found in large quantities, being used locally for fodder and for rope-making and exported for the manufacture of paper, while the bamboo affords fodder for the herds of wild elephants which frequent these regions.\n\nOf the Hill forests little is known save that, where not denuded by irresponsible cultivation, they contain many species which must be invaluable to the inhabitants and would, if exported to the south, command a ready sale. At least three kinds of pine, the Him\u0101layan spruce, two kinds of fir, and the *deod\u0101r* cedar have been reported from these areas, while yew, cypress, and pencil cedar appear to be not uncommon. Four or five kinds of oak are also noted, and in the lower hills the *champa* (*Michelia Champaca*) is frequent. The vegetation of the Hill forests of Nep\u0101l may be taken to approximate to that existing in similar conditions of climate and elevation in British India, but a detailed investigation of the forests would doubtless afford information of the highest botanical and sylvicultural interest.\n\nThe forests of Nep\u0101l are the property of the State, and a Forest department, whose officials appear to enjoy military rank, has been constituted. The collection of revenue seems to form the chief part of the duties of the staff, though no doubt the protection and improvement of the forests receive some attention in restricted and accessible areas. On the whole it may be said that the forests are neglected and undeveloped, and that this is due to the lack of organization and supervision. The timber trade from Nep\u0101l is reported to be decreasing, in spite of the fact that the railways of India now touch the frontier at several places, and of the European supervision employed in saw-mills erected at convenient centres. The timber extracted from the forests is carried by carts to the nearest flowing stream or rail head. The work devolves on the purchasers, who complain of the cupidity of the lower officials, asserting that, though royalty rates are low, the uncertainty with regard to incidental charges renders the timber trade with Nep\u0101l more speculative than a merchant of moderate means can afford to enter upon. The timber extracted is, however, of excellent quality, and the thousands of poles which are removed from new clearances for cultivation find a ready sale in British India.\n\nIn regard to minor forest produce much might be done to increase the export trade\u2014that in *b\u0101bar* grass has been fostered by the State, baling presses having been erected at many places along the frontier\u2014but the harassing export duties appear largely to stifle the collection\nof jungle products which should in more favourable circumstances employ the frequent leisure enjoyed by the dwellers in forest regions. Cinnamon, pepper from the hill clearings, and *ban charas* from the wild hemp may be found in quantities in any of the frontier bazars, which also contain stores of wax, honey, and other forest products.\n\nOf the people inhabiting the Tarai and part of the Submontane forests, the Th\u0101rus are the most interesting. In the neighbouring forests of British India this race has come under the influence of the West and is losing its individuality. In Nep\u0101l, however, the roving spirit survives, and shifting cultivation is still practised. The Forest officer, in his friendly intercourse with the Th\u0101rus, will be reminded of other primitive jungle people, such as the K\u0101chins of North-Eastern Burma. Both tribes make their dwellings in large houses common to the community, and resemble one another in their diet of game, fish, and rice, and in the propitiation of demons by the sacrifice of fowls and other animals. The resemblance extends also to the type of feature, which is distinctly Mongolian, to the custom of tattooing the lower limbs, and even to the mode of attire and adornment. The Th\u0101ru is an inveterate hunter, but also displays great ability as a cultivator, especially in irrigation.\n\nThe more settled portion of the Nep\u0101l Tarai is sparsely cultivated, chiefly by immigrants from British India, and its vast grazing grounds maintain large herds of cattle utilized for breeding purposes or for the manufacture of *gh\u012b*. They provide also, especially in times of famine, grazing for the herds from over the border, thus relieving the strain on the \u2018reserved\u2019 forests of British India which are situated in the vicinity. It may be imagined that a population whose customs and interests are so inimical to the continuance of forest growth must, in the absence of efficient control, slowly yet effectually succeed in diminishing the forest wealth which is at the disposal of the Nep\u0101l State. When the attention of the rulers of that country has been directed to the waste of material that is now proceeding, remedial action will no doubt be taken, to the benefit of the country and of its finances.\n\nThe mineral wealth of Nep\u0101l has always been supposed to be great. But this, like other sources of revenue, has never been developed. The absence of coal, the situation of the minerals, and the lack of roads and cheap transit are largely responsible for this want of enterprise. Copper is found quite near the surface of the earth, the ore being dug from open trenches. Iron ore and sulphur are also obtained in large quantities.\n\nThe manufactures of the country are few, consisting chiefly of coarse cotton cloth which the women of the household weave for domestic use. The Bhoti\u0101s weave woollen blankets. A stout kind\nof paper is manufactured from the inner bark of several species of *Daphne*. All the mechanics of the country are New\u0101rs, who are skilful workers in gold, silver, and brass, as also good carpenters and wood-carvers. In olden days they were celebrated for their artistic productions in brassware, and the delicacy and variety of their wood-carving; but since the Gurkha conquest these industries have been allowed to languish.\n\nThe external trade of Nep\u0101l falls under two heads\u2014that which is carried on across the Him\u0101layas with Tibet, and that conducted along the extensive line of the British frontier. Of the extent of the former trade, very little is known; and since the opening of the Darjeeling route it has considerably diminished, although it still yields the Nep\u0101lese government a revenue of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 lakhs of rupees annually. The chief route, north-east from K\u0101tm\u0101ndu following up a tributary of the Kosi, passes the trans-frontier station of K\u016bti at an elevation of about 14,000 feet above sea-level; another route, also starting from K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, follows the main eastern stream of the Gandak, crosses the frontier near the station of Kirang (9,000 feet), and ultimately reaches the Tsan-po river at Tadam. Both these routes are extremely difficult. The only beasts of burden available are sheep and goats, and practically everything but grain and salt is carried by men and women. The principal imports from Tibet are *pashmina* or shawl wool, coarse woollen cloth, salt, borax, musk, yak tails, yellow arsenic, quicksilver, gold dust, antimony, *manjit* or madder, *charas* (an intoxicating preparation of hemp), various medicinal drugs, and dried fruits. The exports into Tibet include utensils of copper, bell-metal, and iron, manufactured by the New\u0101rs; European piece-goods and hardware; Indian cotton-goods, spices, tobacco, coco-nuts, and betel-leaf.\n\nThe trade with British India is conducted at various centres along the frontier, of which the chief are Birganj, Nep\u0101lganj, Butw\u0101l, Hanum\u0101nnagar, and Dhulab\u0101ri. The principal route for through traffic is that direct to K\u0101tm\u0101ndu from British territory. Starting at the terminus of the railway on the Nep\u0101lese frontier, this route passes through Birganj, Hataura, Bh\u012bmjedi, and Th\u0101nkot, the total length being about 76 miles. Carts can be taken as far as Bh\u012bmjedi, except during the rainy season; beyond that coolies, mostly Bhoti\u0101s and New\u0101rs, are the only means of carriage available. The Bhoti\u0101s carry enormous loads. It is by no means uncommon for a man to take two maunds, though one maund (82 lb.) is the regular load, and this has to be carried over hills several thousand feet in height where the paths are of the most primitive construction. The Bhoti\u0101s always carry loads on their backs supported by a strap.\nacross the forehead, whereas the New\u0101rs invariably carry theirs in baskets with a pole balanced on the shoulder. What has been said of the K\u0101tm\u0101ndu route applies to other means of communication with Nep\u0101l. There is scarcely a made road in the country, but carts and pack-bullocks from British territory pass freely to and fro during the dry season.\n\nThe principal articles of export from Nep\u0101l into British India are rice, husked and unhusked; food-grains; mustard, rape, and other oilseeds; ponies, cattle, sheep, and goats; hides and skins; ghi or clarified butter; timber; cardamoms, red pepper, turmeric, and other spices; opium; musk, borax, madder, turpentine, catechu, and chiretta. The chief imports are cotton piece-goods, cotton yarn, woollen cloth, shawls, flannel, silk, salt, spices, sheet copper and other metals, tobacco, petroleum, provisions (including sugar), indigo and other dyes. Of the aggregate value of this trade it is difficult to form an accurate estimate, owing to the many channels by which it passes and the imperfect methods of registration, but the following are figures compiled by the Director-General of Statistics:\n\n|                      | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Imports from India to Nep\u0101l | 1,29   | 1,63   | 1,34   |\n| Exports from Nep\u0101l to India | 1,72   | 2,36   | 2,61   |\n\nSome articles of trade, such as timber, salt, cardamoms, and tobacco, are State monopolies: otherwise trade is free, subject to import and export duties, which are sometimes charged ad valorem, but more commonly by load, weight, or number of articles. The chief traders in Nep\u0101l are the New\u0101rs, while many natives of India, both Hindu and Muhammadan, have settled in the country and carry on a brisk commerce.\n\nCommunications throughout Nep\u0101l are, as already observed, very primitive. The Nep\u0101lese have always set their faces against improvement in this direction, trusting to the natural inaccessibility of the country as the best means of preventing invasion and annexation. In pursuance of this policy they have always kept the country strictly closed to Europeans, the only route open to them being that from Raxaul to K\u0101tm\u0101ndu via Hataura. No railway or telegraph system has been introduced into Nep\u0101l, although branches of the Bengal and North-Western Railway touch the frontier at various points, the chief of which are Nep\u0101lganj, Raxaul, Bairagni\u0101, and Anchera Gh\u0101t. A good postal service, under the control of the British Postal department, has been in existence for some years between K\u0101tm\u0101ndu and the plains of India, and is largely utilized by the Nep\u0101lese for the transmission of money and goods, while the Nep\u0101l State has postal services of its own.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the government of the country is entirely\nin the hands of the Minister, although he is nominally assisted by a council the members of which are selected by himself. All written and verbal communications relative to political, fiscal, and judicial affairs are submitted to the Minister, Administration, who generally issues his orders thereon without consulting either the king or the council. No public money is expended without his knowledge and sanction; all appointments, civil or military, are conferred by him; and all complaints regarding the conduct of public officials are brought to his notice and invariably meet with attention.\n\nFor administrative purposes the country is divided into various districts. The most important of these are Ilam, Dhankuta, Gurkha, Palp\u0101, and Doti in the Hills; and Nay\u0101 Mulk, Butw\u0101l, Chitawan, and Murang in the Tarai. There are four governors for the Tarai, and two for the Hills, whose duties resemble more or less those of Commissioners in British India: they have under them various officials, of whom the S\u016bbahs are the most important, each of these being in charge of a district.\n\nThere are separate civil and criminal courts, but the distinction is not well marked, as disputed and difficult cases are sometimes transferred from the one to the other. The country is divided into judicial circles, lamini kacheris, of which there are sixteen for the Tarai and twenty-four for the Hills: each of these is in charge of a Deputy-Magistrate, called Bich\u0101ri, while jurisdiction over several districts is exercised by Dithas or Magistrates. All cases of serious crime must be submitted for the decision of the higher tribunals at the capital, and a final appeal can be made to the council over which the Minister presides. The old savage code of punishments, involving mutilations, &c., has long since been abolished. Crimes are divided into three classes, according as they affect the state, private persons or property, and caste. Murder and the killing of cows are punishable by death, but Br\u0101hmans and women are never punished capitally. The severest sentence for women is imprisonment for life with hard labour, and for Br\u0101hmans the same, with degradation from caste. There is singularly little crime in the country, for the Nep\u0101lese are very law-abiding.\n\nOf the revenue of Nep\u0101l it is impossible to speak with any degree of accuracy, as the finances are entirely controlled by the Minister and his chief treasurer. There can be no doubt, however, that during late years the revenue has considerably increased, and cannot now be far short of 2 crores of rupees per annum. But the sums actually realized at the public treasury cannot be taken as representing the real revenue of the country, since the greater portion of the civil and military establishments are paid by grants of land. The chief sources from which the revenue is obtained are the land revenue, customs dues, mines, forests, and the monopolies above mentioned.\nThe current silver coin in Nep\u0101l is the mohar, two of which go to the Mohri rupee. The intrinsic value of the mohar is 6 annas 8 pies of British Indian currency. The Mohri rupee is chiefly used as a matter of account, its minor denominations being as follows:\u20144 d\u0101ms = 1 pice; 4 pice = 1 anna; 16 annas = 1 Mohri rupee.\n\nThe copper coins in common use are pice, which are struck at the mint in K\u0101tm\u0101ndu. These are circular and fairly well stamped: 117 go to the Indian rupee. In addition, there are the Butw\u0101li or Gorakh-puri, and the Lohiya, pice: these are squarish lumps of purified copper, roughly cut by hand, of which about 75 go to the Indian rupee. In K\u0101tm\u0101ndu Indian currency notes are highly prized as a means of remittance, usually fetching a premium varying from 3 to 5 per cent. Indian coinage is accepted throughout the country.\n\nThe standing army of Nep\u0101l is estimated at about 45,000 men, including 2,500 artillery. The rest are infantry, composed of regulars and militia, but there is also a large reserve force. The original period of service, which is voluntary, extends to three years, after which the men can either elect to serve on or enter the reserve. The army is chiefly recruited from the Th\u0101kurs, Khas, Magars, Gurungs, and Limb\u016bs. The New\u0101rs are not allowed to bear arms, though many are enlisted in the cooly corps attached to each regiment and included among the non-combatants. In times of danger every able-bodied man is liable to be called out for service. The troops are armed with a certain number of Martini-Henry rifles, many of them of local manufacture, but chiefly with old Snider and Enfield rifles. The Commander-in-Chief of the army is always the next eldest brother of the Minister. In the same way the other high posts are filled, not by men who have risen in the army or who are selected for their military knowledge, but by brothers and sons of the Minister, many of whom are mere youths. An arsenal has been constructed a few miles to the east of K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, which has largely or entirely supplanted the former arsenal at Nikkoo. Reliable statistics are unobtainable regarding the work carried out in the arsenal, nor is it open to ordinary inspection. But from the size of the buildings, the abundant water-power, and the facilities for importing skilled labour, there is no reason why the manufacture of modern armaments should not be carried on to a considerable degree, although this would of course be regulated by the general understanding existing between the Nep\u0101l State and the Government of India.\n\nThe State offers no educational advantages to the masses. Only one school is maintained, which is affiliated to the Calcutta University and exists chiefly for the sons of well-to-do parents. Students are, however, sent by the State from time to time to receive a course of instruction at one of the Engineering colleges in India.\nK\u0101tm\u0101ndu possesses two hospitals, one for women and one for men, which are under the superintendence of qualified natives of India. Another has recently been opened at Bh\u0101tgaon. Vaccination is optional, but is spreading owing to the free supply of lymph and the employment of perambulating vaccinators, and the people are beginning to appreciate its benefits as compared with those of inoculation.\n\n[W.

Population (1901), 5,408. On a hill near by is a temple of Pinglai Dev\u012b, from which the town is generally known as Ner Pinglai, to distinguish it from Ner Parsopant, in the D\u0101rw\u0101h\u0101 t\u0101luk of Yeotm\u0101l District, formerly a more important place, and mentioned in the *Ain-i-Akbar\u012b* as a pargana town.\n\n*Nerbudda Division* (*Narbad\u0101*).\u2014Western Division of the Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 5'$ and $23^\\circ 15'$ N. and $75^\\circ 57'$ and $79^\\circ 38'$ E., with an area of 18,382 square miles. It embraces a section of the valley of the Narbad\u0101 river, from which the Division takes its name, and some tracts on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau to the south of the valley. The head-quarters of the Commissioner are at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d Town. The Division includes five Districts, as shown in the table on the next page.\n\nOf these, Narsinghpur, Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, and Nim\u0101r extend from east to west along the southern bank of the Narbad\u0101 river, while Bet\u016bl and Chhindw\u0101ra lie on the hills to the south of the valley. The population of the Division was 1,763,105 in 1881, from which it increased in 1891 to 1,881,147, or by 6 per cent. This increase was considerably less than the Provincial average, the explanation being that the fertile tracts\nof the Narbad\u0101 valley were already so closely cultivated as to leave little room for further expansion. During the last decade the population decreased to 1,783,441, or by 5 per cent., as a result of a succession of disastrous failures of crops. Since the Census of 1901 a small transfer of territory has taken place, and the adjusted population in 1904 was 1,785,008. The Nerbudda Division is the smallest in the Province in both area and population. In 1901 Hindus numbered 70 per cent. of the total, and Animists 18 per cent. There were 84,122 Musalm\u0101ns, 9,522 Jains, and 5,355 Christians, of whom 709 were Europeans or Eurasians. The density of population is 97 persons per square mile, compared with 112 for the British Districts of the Province. The Division contains 17 towns and 6,164 villages. Burh\u0101npur (33,341) is the only town with more than 20,000 inhabitants.\n\nOn the large block of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, known as the Mah\u0101deo hills, in the south of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District, is situated the sanitarium of Pachmarh\u012b, which is the summer head-quarters of the Local Government. The small State of Makrai in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d is under the supervision of the Commissioner.\n\n| District       | Area in square miles.* | Population, 1901.* | Land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees. |\n|---------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Narsinghpur   | 1,976                  | 315,518            | 6,92                                                     |\n| Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d   | 3,676                  | 449,585            | 7,72                                                     |\n| Nimar         | 4,273                  | 329,615            | 4,61                                                     |\n| Bet\u016bl         | 3,826                  | 285,363            | 2,94                                                     |\n| Chhindw\u0101ra    | 4,631                  | 497,927            | 3,41                                                     |\n| Total         | 18,382                 | 1,785,008          | 25,60                                                    |\n\n* The District figures of area and population have been adjusted, to allow for some small transfers of territory which have taken place since the Census of 1901.\n\nNerbudda.\u2014River in the Central Provinces, Central India, and Bombay. See Narbad\u0101.\n\nNerla.\u2014Village in the V\u0101lva t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 5' N. and 74\u00b0 16' E., 44 miles south-by-east of S\u0101t\u0101ra town. Population (1901), 7,524.\n\nNetrakon\u0101 Subdivision.\u2014North-eastern subdivision of Mymensingh District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 24\u00b0 35' and 25\u00b0 11' N. and 90\u00b0 29' and 91\u00b0 15' E., with an area of 1,148 square miles. With the exception of a hilly tract in the north-east, where the Durg\u0101pur th\u0101na borders on the G\u0101ro Hills, the subdivision is a flat alluvial plain. The population was 574,771 in 1901, compared with 536,568 in 1891. It contains one town, Netrakon\u0101 (population, 11,402), the head-quarters; and 1,965 villages. The density is 501 persons per square mile, against an average of 618 for the whole District;\nthe most sparsely populated part is the Durg\u0101pur th\u0101na, which has only 299 inhabitants per square mile.\n\n**Netrakon\u0101 Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Mymensingh District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $24^\\circ 53'$ N. and $90^\\circ 45'$ E. Population (1901), 11,402. Netrakon\u0101 was constituted a municipality in 1887. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 5,700, and the expenditure Rs. 5,200. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 9,000, mainly derived from a property tax and a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 7,000. The town possesses the usual public buildings; the sub-jail has accommodation for 22 prisoners.\n\n**Nev\u0101sa.**\u2014T\u012bluka of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay, lying between $19^\\circ 14'$ and $19^\\circ 43'$ N. and $74^\\circ 41'$ and $75^\\circ 13'$ E., with an area of 621 square miles. It contains 147 villages, including Sonai (population, 5,393). The head-quarters are at Nev\u0101sa. The population in 1901 was 65,503, compared with 88,149 in 1891. The decrease was due to famine and migration to relief works. The people also availed themselves of the demand for labour created by a good harvest in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s territory. The density, 105 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 1.7 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 14,000. The general character of Nev\u0101sa is a flat plain, sloping gently northwards towards the God\u0101vari river. In the south and south-east the country has a more decided slope upwards to the Nagar range of hills and is deeply fissured by ravines, down which, during heavy rains, the water rushes with great violence. The drainage is wholly towards the God\u0101vari, which forms the boundary of the t\u012bluka on the north. One village belonging to the Niz\u0101m lies south of the river, thus breaking the continuous boundary for 3 miles. The area under rabi or late crops is double that under kharif or early crops. The area of irrigated land is small.\n\n**New Dihing.**\u2014River in Lakhimpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See DIHING, No\u0101.\n\n**Ngape.**\u2014South-western township of Minbu District, Upper Burma, drained by the upper reaches of the Man river, and lying between $19^\\circ 50'$ and $20^\\circ 10'$ N. and $94^\\circ 17'$ and $94^\\circ 40'$ E., with an area of 362 square miles. The population, which consists largely of Chins, was 13,146 in 1891, and 16,033 in 1901, distributed in 144 villages. Ngape (population, 1,042), a village on the Man river, some 30 miles west of Minbu, is the head-quarters. The township, a large portion of which is covered by the forests of the Arakan Yoma, is sparsely populated, and the cultivable area is small. The area actually cultivated in 1903\u20134 was only 9 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 33,000.\n\n**Ngaputaw.**\u2014Southern township of Bassein District, Lower Burma,\nlying at the extreme south-west corner of the Irrawaddy delta, between \n15\u00b0 50' and 16\u00b0 37' N. and 94\u00b0 11' and 94\u00b0 47' E., with an area of \n1,439 square miles. Its southern and western borders skirt the sea, \nand the uplands of the Arakan Yoma render its western areas useless \nfor cultivation. The population was 29,810 in 1891, and 37,126 in \n1901, distributed over 244 villages, the density being only 26 persons \nper square mile. The head-quarters are at Ngaputaw (population, \n1,338), on the eastern bank of the Bassein river, about 16 miles due \nsouth of Bassein town. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was \n107 square miles (an increase of over 70 per cent. in ten years), paying \na land revenue of Rs. 1,03,000. One of the main industries of the \ntownship is the manufacture of salt.\n\nNgathainggyaung Subdivision.\u2014Northern subdivision of Bassein \nDistrict, Lower Burma, consisting of the townships of NGATHAING-\nGYAUNG, KYONPYAW, and KYAUNGGON.\n\nNgathainggyaung Township (Yegyi).\u2014North-western township \nof the Ngathainggyaung subdivision of Bassein District, Lower Burma, \nlying between 17\u00b0 6' and 17\u00b0 29' N. and 94\u00b0 47' and 95\u00b0 13' E., with \nan area of 345 square miles. The population was 56,563 in 1891, and \n64,891 in 1901, living in 387 villages and one town, NGATHAINGGYAUNG \n(population, 7,182), the head-quarters. The township lies along the \nBassein river and is fertile, compact, and thickly populated. In 1903-4 \nthe area under cultivation was 136 square miles, paying a land revenue \nof Rs. 2,29,000, while the total revenue amounted to Rs. 4,38,000.\n\nNgathainggyaung Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of \nthe same name in Bassein District, Lower Burma, situated in 17\u00b0 23' N. \nand 95\u00b0 5' E., on the left bank of the Bassein river, about 50 miles \nnorth-north-east of Bassein town. Population (1901), 7,182. Nga-\nthainggyaung has for some time been a town of importance. It was \ngarrisoned by a native infantry detachment during the second Burmese \nWar, and was seized by the rebels in the disturbances in 1854, but was \nquickly recaptured by Major Fytche. Combined with Daunggyi on \nthe opposite bank of the river, it was constituted a municipality in \n1878, covering an area of about 3 square miles. The municipal \nincome and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged \nabout Rs. 17,000. In 1903-4 they amounted to Rs. 24,000 and \nRs. 19,000 respectively. Of the receipts, Rs. 15,000 was obtained from \ntolls on markets and slaughter-houses, and Rs. 3,000 from house tax. \nThe chief items of expenditure were conservancy (Rs. 4,000) and roads \n(Rs. 3,000). The town possesses a civil hospital, with accommodation \nfor 12 in-patients. There is no municipal school, but the committee \nspent Rs. 1,300 on education in 1903-4.\n\nNgawun.\u2014River of Lower Burma. See BASSEIN RIVER.\n\nNgazun.\u2014Township of Sagaing District, Upper Burma, lying\nbetween $21^\\circ 32'$ and $21^\\circ 55'$ N. and $95^\\circ 26'$ and $95^\\circ 49'$ E., along the south bank of the Irrawaddy, with an area of 358 square miles. The population was 44,911 in 1891, and 52,532 in 1901, distributed in 169 villages, the head-quarters being at Ngazun (population, 2,254), on the river bank about 17 miles north of Myotha, the subdivisional headquarters. The township is rugged and barren except in the neighbourhood of the river, and the rainfall is low. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 164 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 1,30,700.\n\nNi\u0101mti.\u2014Village in Shimoga District, Mysore. See Ny\u0101mti.\n\nNichlaul.\u2014Village in the Mah\u0101r\u0101jganj tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 19'$ N. and $83^\\circ 44'$ E., at the meeting of several unmetalled roads and cross-country tracks, 51 miles northeast of Gorakhpur city. Population (1901), 1,564. This is the principal mart in the north of the District, but is declining in importance owing to its distance from the railway. A few miles away are the ruins of a castle or fort, the scene of a sharp fight during the Nep\u0101lese campaign.\n\nNicobars.\u2014A group of islands in the Bay of Bengal, forming part of the Andamans and Nicobars. The islands are nineteen in number, twelve being inhabited. The extreme length of space occupied is 163 miles, and the extreme width 36 miles.

The mediaeval Arabic name 'Lankhab\u0101l\u016bs' is a mere mistranscription and misapprehension of 'Nankabar' or 'Nakkav\u0101r.' The geographical names for the different islands have all obscure, complicated, and interesting histories.\n\nThe hills vary greatly in the several islands. The chief summits are on Teressa, Bompoka, Tillanchong, Camorta, Nancowry, Katchall, and Great and Little Nicobar. The only hills over 1,000 feet are on Tillanchong and Great and Little Nicobar. The highest, Mount Thuillier, is on Great Nicobar, 2,105 feet; while three peaks on Little Nicobar reach from 1,353 feet to 1,428 feet.\n\nThe Nicobars generally are badly off for fresh surface water; on Car Nicobar there is hardly any, though water is easily obtained by digging. The only island with rivers is Great Nicobar, on which are considerable and beautiful streams: Galathea (Dak Kea), Alexandra (Dak Anaing), and Dagmar (Dak Tayal).\n\nThere is one magnificent land-locked harbour formed by Camorta, Nancowry, and Trinkat, called Nancowry Harbour, and a small one between Pulo Milo and Little Nicobar. The other anchorages are mere roadsteads.\n\nA considerable variety of scenery is presented by the several islands. Thus, from north to south, Car Nicobar is a flat coral-covered island; Chowra is also flat, with one remarkable table hill at the south end (343 feet); Teressa is a curved line of hills rising to 867 feet; and Bompoka is one hill (634 feet), said by some to be volcanic; Tillanchong is a long, narrow hill (1,058 feet); Camorta and Nancowry are both hilly (up to 735 feet); Trinkat is quite flat; Katchall is hilly (835 feet), but belongs to Great and Little Nicobar in general form, differing much from the others of the central group; Great and Little Nicobar are both mountainous, the peaks rising to 1,428 feet in the Little, and to 2,105 feet in the Great Nicobar. Car Nicobar is thoroughly tropical in appearance, showing a continuous fringe of coconuts; but a high green grass is interspersed with forest growth on Chowra, Teressa, Bompoka, Camorta, and Nancowry, giving them a park-like and, in places, an English look. Katchall and Great and Little Nicobar have from the sea something of the appearance of Sardinia seen from the Straits of Bonifacio. The scenery is often fine, and in some places of exceeding beauty, as in the Galathea and Alexandra rivers and in Nancowry Harbour.\n\nGeological knowledge of the Nicobars depends mainly on the observations of three scientific visitors, who did not, however, explore the islands: Dr. Rink of the Galathea (Danish) Expedition in 1846, Dr. Von Hochstetter of the Novara (Austrian) Expedition in 1858,\nand Dr. Valentine Ball in 1869. These observers are not in entire agreement.\n\nThe sandstones and shales of the southern islands are apparently similar to those distinguished as the Port Blair series in the Andaman Islands, and in both areas poor lignitic coal is found in the series. The clay stones and associated conglomerates of Camorta, Nancowry, and Trinkat are probably the same formation as that recognized in the Andaman (Ritchie's) Archipelago. Von Hochstetter connected the whole group geologically with the great islands of the Asiatic Archipelago farther south. From his observations the following instructive table has been drawn up, indicating the relation of geological formations to soil and vegetation, and showing how the formations have affected the appearance of the islands:\n\n| Geological character of the underlying rock. | Character of the soil. | Character of the forest vegetation. |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Salt and brackish swamp, damp marine alluvium. | Uncultivable swamp. | Mangrove. |\n| Coral conglomerate and sand, dry marine alluvium. | Fertile calcareous soil, carbonate and phosphate of lime. | Coco-nut. |\n| As above, with dry fresh-water alluvium. | Fertile calcareous sandy soil. | Large trees. Pandanus. |\n| Fresh-water swamp and damp alluvium. | Cultivable swamp. | Grassy, open land. |\n| Plastic and magnesian clay, marls; partially serpentine. | Infertile clay; silicates of alumina and magnesia. | Jungle; true primateval forest. |\n| Sandstone, slate, gabbro, dry river alluvium. | Very fertile; loose clay and sand, rich in alkalis and lime. | |\n\nSmall traces of copper have been found in the igneous rocks, and the presence of tin and amber has been reported, but not confirmed scientifically. The white clay or marls of Camorta and Nancowry have become scientifically famous as being polycistina marls like those of Barbados.\n\nAlthough the vegetation of the Nicobars has received much desultory attention from scientific observers, it has not been subjected to a systematic investigation by the Indian Forest department like that of the Andamans. In economic value the forests of the Nicobars are quite inferior to the Andaman forests; and, so far as known, the commercially valuable trees, besides fruit-trees, such as the coco-nut, betel-nut, and mellori (Pandanus Leram), are a thatching palm (Nipa fruticans) and a few timber trees, of which only that known as black chuglam in the Andamans (Myristica Irya) would be there classed as a first-class timber. Six other timber trees, known to exist, would be classed in the Andamans as second-class and one as a third-class timber. Dammer, from a Dipterocarpus, and rattans are among the minor products of the forests. The palms are exceedingly graceful, especially the beautiful Plychoraphis augusta,\nusually sold in England as a *Cocos*. Large clumps of casuarina and great tree-ferns are also striking features of the landscape in places.\n\nIn the old missionary records are frequently mentioned instances of the introduction of foreign economic plants. In this matter the people have been apt pupils; and nowadays a number of familiar Asiatic fruit-trees are carefully and successfully cultivated, including pummelos (the largest variety of the orange family), lemons, limes, oranges, shaddock, *papayas*, *bael*-fruit (wood-apple), custard-apples, bullock's hearts, tamarinds, jacks, and plantains; besides sugar-cane, yams, edible colocasia, pineapples, and capsicum. A diminutive orange, said to come from China and to have been introduced by the Moravian missionaries, is now acclimatized. It is quite possible also that with the missionaries came the peculiar zigzag garden fence of the northern islands. During the long commerce of the people a number of Indian weeds (*Malvaceae* and *Compositae*) have been introduced, including *Datura*, *Solanum*, *Flemingia*, *Mallotus*, *Mimosa*, &c.\n\nThere are no indigenous dangerous wild animals, but on Camorta buffaloes and some cattle left by the missionaries have become wild. On Great and Little Nicobar, and elsewhere in places, crocodiles are found in the rivers and on the coasts, while monkeys occur on Great and Little Nicobar and Katchall, but not elsewhere. The marine and land fauna have generally the character of those of the Andamans, though, while the latter are closely allied to Arakan and Burma, the Nicobars display more affinities with Sumatra and Java. The land fauna, owing to greater ease in communications, has been better explored than in the Andamans. The economic zoology also resembles that of the Andamans. Coral, trepang, cuttle-bones, sea-shells, oysters, pearls, pearl-oysters, turtle and tortoise-shells, and edible birds'-nests are obtained in both groups of islands. In the Nicobars a somewhat inferior quality of bath sponge is also found.\n\nThe climate generally is that of islands of similar latitude: very hot, except when raining; damp, subject to rain throughout the year, generally in sharp heavy showers; unwholesome for Europeans, and in places dangerously malarious. The weather is generally unsettled, especially in the south. The islands are exposed to both monsoons, with easterly and north-easterly gales from November to January, and south-westerly gales from May to September; smooth weather is experienced only from February to April and in October. The normal barometric readings (five years in Nancowry Harbour) vary between 29.960 and 29.797, being highest in January and lowest in June.\n\nStatistics are scanty as regards temperature. They were kept up for fifteen years (1874\u201388) in Nancowry Harbour while the Penal Settlement lasted, and were commenced on Car Nicobar in 1898. The following tables give the main features, in degrees F.:\u2014\nNANCOWRY HARBOUR\n\n| Year | Mean highest in shade | Mean lowest in shade | Highest in shade | Lowest in shade | Dry bulb mean | Wet bulb mean |\n|------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1884 | May 91.3              | Dec. 74.5           | May 92.2        | July 70.3     | July 83.3    | July 77.5    |\n| 1885 | April 91.6            | Dec. 73.3           | May 95.4        | Sept. 71.0    | Sept. 84.4   | Sept. 78.1   |\n| 1886 | April 91.9            | Dec. 71.8           | Aug. 98.2       | Dec. 64.0     | Dec. 84.0    | Dec. 76.6    |\n| 1887 | July 86.5             | Feb. 72.2           | April 96.6      | Mar. 66.4     | Mar. 82.7    | Mar. 77.2    |\n| 1888 | April 91.2            | Jan. 72.2           | May 97.4        | Jan. 68.8     | Jan. 83.9    | Jan. 77.8    |\n\nCAR NICOBAR\n\n| Year | Mean highest in shade | Mean lowest in shade | Highest in shade | Lowest in shade | Dry bulb mean | Wet bulb mean |\n|------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1898 | Sept. 84.4            | Sept. 76.7          | Sept. 88.0      | Nov. 70.7     | Nov. 79.3    | Nov. 77.2    |\n| 1899 | May 88.7              | April 77.8          | March 92.2      | Feb. 66.0     | Feb. 83.2    | Feb. 73.6    |\n| 1900 | July 88.6             | Feb. 77.6           | April 93.5      | March 66.8    | March 83.8   | March 73.0   |\n| 1901 | April 91.6            | Oct. 74.6           | April 92.3      | Jan. 71.6     | Jan. 84.2    | Jan. 74.0    |\n\n* The observations in 1898 are available only from September 1 to December 31.\n\u2020 In 1901 the observations are available only up to October 31.\n\nThe rainfall varies much from year to year. The following statistics are available:\n\nNANCOWRY HARBOUR\n\n| Year | Most wet days in a month | Heaviest fall in a month |\n|------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1884 | May . 21                 | May 21.75               |\n| 1885 | July . 23                | Dec. 17.90              |\n| 1886 | Nov. . 23                | Nov. 25.23              |\n| 1887 | May . 27                 | Nov. 20.41              |\n| 1888 | Sept. . 22               | Oct. 27.63              |\n\nCAR NICOBAR *\n\n| Year | Most wet days in a month | Heaviest fall in a month |\n|------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1898 | Oct. . 18                | Sept. 11.38             |\n| 1899 | June . 26                | June 20.96              |\n| 1900 | May . 20                 | May 15.79               |\n| 1901 | Sept. . 22               | Sept. 19.77             |\n\n* The same remarks apply to this table as to the temperature table for Car Nicobar.\n\nBetween 1874 and 1888 the wettest year in Nancowry Harbour was 1887 with 165 inches of rain, and the driest 1885 with 93 inches. The two full years of observation at Car Nicobar (1889\u20131900) showed 104 and 106 inches of rain respectively.\n\nCyclones occasionally visit the islands. Recorded instances are in May, 1885, and in March, 1892.\n\nAs the Nicobars apparently lie directly in the local line of greatest weakness, severe earthquakes are to be expected, and have occurred at least three times in the last sixty years. Shocks of great violence are recorded in 1847 (October 31 to December 5), in 1881, with tidal\nwaves (December 31) and milder shocks in 1899 (December). The tidal waves caused by the explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Sunda in August, 1883, were severely felt.\n\nLike the Andamans, the existence of the Nicobars has been known from the time of Ptolemy onwards; but unlike the Andamans, there is as long a history of European occupation as of other parts of the Eastern seas. The Nicobars began to attract the attention of missionaries in the seventeenth century at least, and probably much earlier, as the missionary Haensel speaks of *pater* as 'sorcerer' and Barbe of *deos* and *reos* as 'God,' indicating survivals of Portuguese missionaries. As early as 1688 Dampier mentions that two (probably Jesuit) 'fryers' had previously been there 'to convert the Indians.' Next we have the letters (in *Lettres \u00c9difiantes*) of the French Jesuits, Faure and Taillandier, in 1711. In 1756 the Danes took possession of the islands to colonize, but employed the wrong class of men. The colony, affiliated to Tranquebar, had perished miserably by 1759. The Danes then invited the Moravian Brethren to try their hands at conversion and colonization, and thus in due time commenced the Moravian (Herrnhuter) Mission, which lasted from 1768 to 1787. It did not flourish; and the Danish East India Company, losing heart, withdrew in 1773, and left the missionaries to a miserable fate. In 1778, by persuasion of an adventurous Dutchman, William Bolts, the Austrians appeared, but their attempt failed after three years. This offended the Danes, and from 1784 till 1807 they kept up a little guard in Nancowry Harbour. In 1790 and 1804 fresh attempts by isolated Moravian missionaries were made. From 1807 to 1814 the islands were in British possession during the Napoleonic Wars, and were then handed back by treaty to the Danes. During this time an Italian Jesuit arrived from Rangoon, but soon returned. In 1831 the Danish pastor Rosen, from Tranquebar, again tried to colonize, but failed for want of support and left in 1834. By 1837 his colony had disappeared, and the Danes officially gave up their rights in the place. In 1835 French Jesuits arrived in Car Nicobar (where the Order claim to have succeeded 200 years previously), and, though suffering great privation, remained in Teressa, Chowra, and elsewhere till 1846, when they too disappeared. In 1845 the Danes sent Busch in an English ship from Calcutta to resume possession, who left a good journal behind him, and in 1846 took place the scientific expedition in the *Galathea*, with a new and unhappy settlement scheme. In 1848 the Danes formally relinquished sovereignty and finally removed all remains of their settlement. In 1858 the Austrian ship *Novara* brought a scientific expedition and a scheme for settlement, which came to nothing. In 1867 Franz Maurer strongly advised the Prussian Government to take over the\nislands: but in 1869 the British Government, after an amicable negotiation with the Danish Government, took formal possession, and established in Nancowry Harbour, subordinate to that at the Andamans, a Penal Settlement which was withdrawn in 1888. In 1886 the Austrian corvette *Aurora* visited Nancowry, and produced a report and also a series of well-illustrated articles by its surgeon, Dr. W. Svoboda.\n\nAt present native agencies are maintained at Nancowry Harbour and on Car Nicobar, both of which places are gazetted ports. At Car Nicobar is a Church of England Mission station, under a native Indian catechist attached to the diocese of Rangoon; the only one that has not led a miserable existence. The islands since 1871 have been included in the Chief Commissionership of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nThe long story of European attempts to colonize and evangelize such a place as the Nicobars is a record of the extreme of useless suffering that merely well-intentioned enthusiasm and heroism can inflict, if they be not combined with practical knowledge and a proper equipment. Nevertheless, the various missions have left behind them valuable records of all kinds about the country and its people: especially those of Haensel (1779\u201387, but written in 1812), Rosen (1831\u20134), Chopard (1844), and Barbe (1846). Scattered English accounts of the islands are also to be found in many books of travel almost continuously from the sixteenth century onwards.\n\nDespite the nominal occupation of the country by Europeans for so long, the inhabitants, even of Nancowry Harbour, have been systematic pirates; and a long list of authentic cases exists in which traders and others of all nationalities have been murdered, wrecked, and plundered even in quite recent times. The immediate object of the British occupation was to put a final stop to this, and in the nineteen years during which the Penal Settlement was maintained it was effectually accomplished. There is now no fear of a recrudescence of piracy.\n\nThe Penal Settlement in Nancowry Harbour consisted on the average of about 354 persons: 2 European and 2 other officers; garrison, 58; police, 22; other free residents, 35; convicts, 235. They were employed on public works similar to those in the Andamans. The health was never good, but sickness was kept within limits by constant transfer to the Andamans. Individual health, however, steadily improved, and there is no doubt that in time sanitary skill would have made the sick-rate approach that of the Andamans. The first year of residence was always the most sickly, partial acclimatization being quickly acquired. Some officers stayed two to three years. Mr. E. H. Man was in actual residence, at intervals, for six and a half years. Some of the free people remained several years: convicts usually three, and sometimes voluntarily from five to fifteen years without change. With the precautions taken, the sick-rate at the\nNicobar Penal Settlement did not compare unfavourably with that at the Andamans at its close in 1888. The story of the Settlement was well told by Mr. E. H. Man in a final report, which is printed at p. 188 of the Census Report for 1901.\n\nLike all the other Governments which held an interest in the islands, the British tried a colony in 1884, which failed. But the attempt drew from the most experienced officer there, Mr. Man, the following advice of value, considering the perennial interest in these islands betrayed by European speculators:\n\n'To colonize the Nicobars employ Chinese; send them to Great Nicobar; employ agriculturists who are not opium-users; maintain quick and frequent communication with the Straits Settlements; assist the colonists in transporting their families; provide them with ready means of procuring food, clothing, medicines, tools, and implements.'\n\nA large capital and much perseverance would always be necessary for exploiting the Nicobars with any hope of success.\n\nThe indigenous population increased slightly from 5,942 in 1883 to 5,962 in 1901, when the total population was 6,511.\n\nThe Nicobarese are not divisible into tribes, but there are distinctions, chiefly territorial. Thus, they may be fairly divided into six groups: the people of Car Nicobar, Chowra, Teressa with Bompoka, the Central Group, the Southern Group, and the single inland tribe of the Shom Pen on Great Nicobar. The differences to be observed in language, customs, manners, and physiognomy of the several groups may, with some confidence, be referred to habitat and the physical difficulties of communication. There is, however, nothing in their habits or ideas to prevent admixture of the people, for both intermarriage and mutual adoption are as freely resorted to as circumstances will admit.\n\nThe ethnological interest attaching to the Shom Pen lies in the fact that, owing to their fear of the coast people of the Great Nicobar, and indeed of each other at a little distance from their houses, and the sterility of known crosses between them and the coast people, they probably represent the race in its purest form. It is also necessary to affirm distinctly that they are Nicobarese pure and simple; for so lately as in Yule's edition of Marco Polo it is stated, partly on the authority of a former Chief Commissioner, that they were an aboriginal people like the Andamanese. There is no radical difference between a Shom Pen and any other Nicobarese. The differences are merely such as are to be expected among people living an almost isolated existence.\n\nThe Nicobarese dialects have been subjected to more or less elaborate study by missionaries and others since 1711, culminating\nin Man's excellent Dictionary of the Central Nicobarese Language (1889), with Grammar attached. The Linguistic Survey has quite recently determined that Nicobarese belongs to the Mon-Khmer family. The language is spoken in six dialects, which have now become so differentiated in details as to be mutually unintelligible, and to be practically, so far as actual colloquial speech is concerned, six different languages. These are limited in range by the islands in which they are spoken: Car Nicobar (3,451); Chowra (522); Teressa with Bompoka (702); Central\u2014Camorta, Nanowry, Trinkat, Katchall (1,095); Southern\u2014Great Nicobar coasts and Kondul, Little Nicobar, and Pulo Milo (192); Shom Pen, inland tribe of Great Nicobar (348).\n\nThe Nicobarese are natural linguists. Only a century ago Portuguese was the trade language of the islands, with a sprinkling of Danish, German, and English. Malay and Chinese were both spoken before Portuguese; and now English, Burmese, and Hindustani are well understood. The women know only their own language, and are dumb before all strangers. And here as elsewhere among polyglot peoples, natives of different islands have to converse in a mutually known foreign tongue\u2014e.g. Hindustani, Burmese, Malay, or English\u2014when unable to comprehend each other's dialects. There is a custom of tabu, which in the Nicobars, as elsewhere where it is in vogue, has seriously affected the language at different places. Any person may adopt any word in the language, however essential or common, as his or her personal name, and when he or she dies it is tabued for a generation, for fear of summoning the ghost. The Nicobarese speech is slurred and indistinct; but there is no abnormal dependence on tone, accent, or gesture to make the meaning clear. The dialects are, as might be expected, rich in specialized words for actions and concrete ideas, but poor in generic and abstract terms.\n\nNicobarese is a very highly developed analytical language, with a strong resemblance in grammatical structure to English. It bears every sign of a very long continuous growth, of both syntax and etymology, and is clearly the outcome of a strong intelligence constantly applied to its development. Considering that it is unwritten and but little affected by foreign tongues, and so has not had extraneous assistance in its growth, it is a remarkable product of the human mind. There is no difference in the development of the different dialects. The speech of the wild Shom Pen is as advanced in its structure as that of the trading Car Nicobarese.\n\nThe growth of the language has been so complicated, and so many principles of speech have been partially adopted in building it up, that nothing is readily discoverable regarding it. The subject and predicate are not immediately perceptible, nor are principal and subordinate sentences. The sentences cannot be analysed correctly at once, nor\ncan the roots of the words be separated without great care from the overgrowth. Neither syntax nor etymology is easy, and correct speech is very far from being readily attained.\n\nGrammatically, the point to bear in mind is the order of the words, which is practically the English order, especially as functional inflexion is absent to help the speaker to intelligibility, and there is nothing in the form of the words to show their class, whether nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on. Prepositions, conjunctions, auxiliaries, adverbs, and the particles of speech are freely used, and so are elliptical sentences. Compound words and phrases, consisting of two or more words thrown together and used as one word, are unusually common, and the languages show their Far-Eastern proclivities by an extended use of 'numeral coefficients.'\n\nThe great difficulty lies in the etymology. Words are built up of roots and stems, to which are added prefixes, infixes, and suffixes, both to make the classes of connected words, and to differentiate connected words when of the same class: i.e. to show which of two connected words is a verb and which a noun, and to mark the difference in the sense of two connected nouns, and so on. But this differentiation is always hazily defined by the forms thus arrived at, and the presence of a particular classifying affix does not necessarily define the class to which the word belongs. So also the special differentiating affixes do not always mark differentiation.\n\nAgain, the affixes are attached by mere agglutination, in forms which have undergone phonetic change, and by actual inflexion. Their presence, too, not infrequently causes phonetic change in, and inflexion of, the roots or stems themselves.\n\nThe chief peculiarity of the language lies in a series of 'suffixes of direction,' indicating the direction (north, south, east, west, above, down, below, or at the landing-place) of any action, condition, or movement. But even suffixes so highly specialized as these are not by any means exclusively attached to words the sense of which they can and do affect in this way.\n\nOnly by a deep and prolonged study of the language can one learn to recognize a root, or to perceive the sense or use of an affix; and only by prolonged practice could one hope to speak or understand it correctly in all its phases. Nicobarese is, in this sense, indeed a difficult language.\n\nThe religion of the Nicobarese is an undisguised Animism, and the whole of their very frequent and elaborate ceremonies and festivals are aimed at exorcising and scaring spirits. Fear of spirits and ghosts (iwi) is the guide to all ceremonies, and the life of the people is very largely taken up with ceremonies and feasts of all kinds. These are usually held at night, and, whether directly religious or merely convivial.\nseem all to have an origin in the overpowering fear of spirits that possesses the Nicobarese. It has so far proved ineradicable: for two centuries of varied and almost continuous missionary effort have had no appreciable effect on it, if some of the Creation stories recorded from the southern group by De Roepstorff, and the terms learnt from the missionaries still surviving among some of the Central Group islanders, be excluded. A few rosaries existed a generation ago in Nancowry Harbour. The only outcome of the religion of the Nicobarese of political import is the ceremonial execution for grave offences against the community, such as murder, habitual theft, or public annoyance. A person so offending is regarded as being possessed and is formally put to death with great cruelty. This is the 'devil murder' of the Nicobars, now being gradually suppressed. Witches and, of course, witch-finders abound. The superstitious and animistic beliefs of the Nicobarese explain a good many articles to be seen prominently about their houses and villages. It follows that the mind of the Nicobarese is largely occupied with superstitions, which relate to the ancestors, the sun, and the moon. The funeral ceremonies show that human shadows are the visible signs of the spirits of the living, and on Car Nicobar there is a special ceremony for 'feeding shadows.' Every misfortune and sickness is caused by spirits or witches, especially that scourge of Chowra, elephantiasis; and the remedy in every case is a special exorcism by means of the menluana, or doctor-priests, or general exorcism performed privately. This last class of remedy includes the libation, which is always poured out before drinking and at spirit feasts. Lucky and unlucky actions and conditions naturally abound, and it is lucky to get a pregnant woman and her husband to plant seed in gardens. Uneven numbers are unlucky, and no others are allowed at funerals.\n\nThere seems to be an embryonic invocation of supernatural punishment, an idea so much developed in the traga and dharna of India. Thus, setting fire to their own huts and property is one way of showing shame or disgust at the misconduct of relatives and friends; and Offandi, the chief of Mus, in Car Nicobar, once attempted to dig up his father's bones before they were transferred to the ossuary, and to throw them into the sea, because an important villager had called his father a liar.\n\nThe spirit feast is a general exorcism, performed by the family and friends, with the aid of the menluana. The men sit smoking and drinking; and the women bring from the family stock provisions, implements, weapons, and curiosities, which last, after a good howl, they break up and throw outside the house. A large specially fattened pig is then roasted whole, and divided between the ancestors and the party, chiefly the latter. By this the spirits are mollified. The menluana now\ncommence their business, worked up to an ecstasy by drink and their mysteries. Their faces are painted red and they are rubbed with oil. They sing dolefully in a deep bass voice, and rush about to catch the iivi, or spirit of harm, and coax, scold, and abuse him, accompanied by a tremendous howl from the women, till after a struggle he is caught and put into a small decorated model of a boat, and towed far out to sea. Being now safe from the spirit, the fun is kept up long, with eating, drinking, singing, and dancing.\n\nEvil spirits, especially those causing sickness or likely to damage a new hut, can be caught by the menluana and imprisoned in cages which are placed on special rafts and towed out to sea. When the raft lands at another village and transfers the spirit there, quarter-staff fights take place which are described below in the section on local characteristics. In the north, elaborate feasts and ceremonies are held to confine the spirits and ghosts to the elpanam, a public ground and cemetery, and to keep them away from the coco-nut plantations during the trading season.\n\nTabu, light or serious in its consequences, enters largely into the funeral customs, and appears again in a tabu of warning fires, light in houses, smoking, and speech, for a month after sweeping the spirits out of the cemetery on Car Nicobar. The strongly marked tabu of the names of deceased relatives and friends, which lasts for a whole generation, has already been mentioned. Tabu further affects the form of the huts in some villages and islands. Among the Shom Pen the hut in which a death has occurred is tabued for an uncertain period. The making of pottery is tabued except on Chowra, and certain large kinds of pots are tabued to certain old people at the memorial feasts. Making shell lime for betel-chewing is tabued, except on Car Nicobar, Katchall, Nancowry southern group, and parts of Camorta. One kind of fish-trap is tabued for every place, except Nancowry Harbour in the rainy season. There is a common kind of private tabu of much interest, and the persons undergoing it are termed saokkua, 'dainty,' 'fastidious.' It amounts to an embryonic asceticism. These people will not eat any food cooked by others, nor drink well-water. They will not eat domesticated fowls or pigs, and their drinking-water must be rain or running water. They will only drink water drawn by themselves at a distance from the village and poured out of a coco-nut shell. Bread, biscuits, and rum are the only food and drink they will accept from others. There is also a good deal of pretence in the observation of the highly inconvenient funeral tabus. The late Okpank, or Captain Johnson, a well-known chief in Nancowry Harbour, once refused rum on board a visiting steamer because of the tabu consequent on the death of a near relative, but was eager to get beer in its place.\n\nThe funeral customs, the whole object of which is spirit-scaring, are\ndistinct in the north and south, but everywhere extravagant grief is displayed at all deaths for fear of angering the ghost. In the Central and Southern groups, notice is given to all friends and relatives, who are expected to, and in the latter case must, appear if possible with presents at the funeral ceremonies in order to appease the ghost. Relatives unavoidably absent are tabued the village until the first memorial feast (entoin) a few days later. The eyes of the dead are closed to prevent the ghost from seeing, the body is laid out, feet to the fireplace, head to the entrance of the hut, and washed with hot water continually, once to five times according to the period intervening before interment. Then follow eight obligatory duties: removal of all food, as it is tabued to the mourners till after the ceremony of purifying the hut, only hot water and tobacco being allowed; the destruction of the movable property of the deceased and placing the fragments on the grave as a propitiatory sacrifice to the ghost; the collection of a little food at the head of the corpse for the ghost, the remains being thrown to the dogs and pigs; the construction of a bier made out of the deceased's or a mourner's broken-up canoe; the digging of the grave, 5 feet deep, and erection of the two head-posts and the foot-post; the making of the fire to bar the ghost, on the ground at the hut entrance, out of chips from the bier and coco-nut husks; the completion of the grave by placing the sacrificed articles on the ground or in the deceased's destroyed basket; the throwing of pig-tusk trophies, some kareau or spirit-scarers, and pictures (hentakoi) into the jungle.\n\nThe deceased is buried in, or with, all the clothing and ornaments possessed in life to appease the ghost, and ferry-money is placed between the chin-stay and the cheek. The corpse is entirely swathed, except as to a small portion of the face, in new cloths of any colour, except black, presented by the mourners for the purpose. Burial takes place at sundown, before midnight, or early dawn, in order to prevent the shadows of the attendants from falling into the grave and being buried with the corpse.\n\nBefore removal to the grave, the body is taken to the centre of the hut and placed crosswise to the entrance, where it is mourned a short time, and then carried down the entrance ladder head foremost. Some of the mourners occasionally make a feint of going to the grave with the deceased, and the priest (menluana) exhorts the ghost to remain in the grave until the memorial feast, and not to wander and frighten the living. When in the grave the body is pinned into it by special contrivances, to prevent the mongiwanga or body-snatching spirits from abstracting it. The spirits of those present are finally waved out of the grave by a torch, and it is quickly filled in. At the laneatha feast the skeleton is exhumed and thoroughly cleaned, together with the ferry-\nmoney and silver ornaments, and reinterred, a custom which is a survival apparently of the still existing northern custom of reinterment in communal ossuaries. On Chowra and Teressa the dead are swathed in cloths and leaves, and put into half a canoe cut across for the purpose, and placed in the forks of a pair of posts about 6 feet from the ground. These canoes in Chowra are kept in a cemetery in a thick grove about 50 yards from the public buildings of the village, and in Teressa on the sea-shore, till the bodies fall out and are partly devoured by the pigs. They rapidly decompose and become skeletons, apparently without much effluvium arising from them. Children are put into small half-canoes. Every three or four years the bones are thrown at a feast into a communal ossuary. An account of the great ossuary feast by Mr. V. Solomon, Agent at Car Nicobar, is given at p. 226 of the Census Report, 1901.\n\nOn Car Nicobar there is serious wrestling over the corpse on its way to the grave: one party being for the burial and the other against it. This goes on till the corpse falls to the ground and several of the carriers are injured. It is then sometimes just thrown into the grave with the sacrifice of all the deceased's live-stock. On Car Nicobar there is only one short head-post, but this is carefully made in a convenient pattern. On Car Nicobar also there is a special ceremonial for the burial of highly revered personages, which is a distinctly Indo-Chinese custom.\n\nThe 'devil murders' of Car Nicobar are serious, and cases occasionally occur in Chowra, Teressa, and the Central group. The missionary Haensel (1779-87) reports them from the Central group. At p. 232 of the Census Report, 1901, will be found notes on every case that had come to light during the previous twenty years. They are true ceremonial murders of men and women, and sometimes even of children, undertaken for the public benefit by a body of villagers after a more or less open consultation, to get rid of persons considered dangerous and obnoxious to the community. But the root-cause is always spirit possession; the victim is bad and dangerous because he is possessed. The orthodox method is very cruel. The legs and arms are broken or dislocated so that the victim cannot fight; he is then strangled and his body sunk at sea.\n\nThe menluana is a Shaman or doctor-priest of a sort common to many half-civilized peoples, but an interesting variety at Car Nicobar is the mafai or novice, the word actually meaning 'one undergoing sacerdotal instruction.' Any one that feels himself inspired may become a mafai, but he does not necessarily pass on to the stage of a menluana.\n\nTales of origin and the like are told in a jerky, disjointed fashion. Chowra is the holy land, the cradle of the race, where the men are\nwizards, a belief that the inhabitants of Chowra turn to good account for keeping the control of the internal trade in their own hands. The Car Nicobar story of origin is that a man arrived there from some unknown country on the Tenasserim coast with a pet dog. By this dog he had a son, whom the mother concealed in her *ngong* or coconut leaf petticoat. The son grew up, killed his father, and begot the race on his own mother. The end of the long bow tied round the foreheads of young men is to represent the dog ancestress's ears, and the long end of the loin-cloth her tail. They treat all dogs kindly in consequence, whence perhaps we may trace a lost totemism among them.\n\nPhysically there is little difference between the inhabitants of the various islands, except that the Shom Pen are about an inch shorter, and less robust than the coast tribes, are anaemic in complexion, and have protuberant bellies, all due probably to diet, surroundings, and mode of life. Mr. E. H. Man's measurements show that the Nicobarese are a fine, well-developed race.\n\n| Average Measurement in Inches |\n|-----------------------------|\n| Height | Full span | Seated height | Foot | Chest | Weight in lb. |\n| Men    | 63\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | 67\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 33\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 34\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 136 |\n| Women  | 60         | 61\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 31\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 8\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | ... | 118 |\n\nThe following may be taken as the prominent external characteristics of the people. The forehead is well formed, the lips are normal and the ears of medium size, the eyes are obliquely set, the nose wide and flat (rarely aquiline), the cheek-bones prominent, the face somewhat flat, and the mouth large. The complexion is yellowish or reddish brown. The figure is not graceful, the waist being square and the back bending inwards sharply. The legs are extraordinarily developed, and the foot is long. Such prognathism as is observable is due to the habits of prolonged lactation, sucking green coco-nuts, and betel-chewing until the incisors of both jaws are forced forward in a revolting manner. Owing to their habit of dilating the lips by constant betel-chewing, adults of both sexes are often repulsive in appearance.\n\nThe skin is smooth throughout life and perspires freely. The teeth are healthy and, though disfigured, are not destroyed by the habit of perpetual betel-chewing. They loosen, however, at 50, and fall out before 60, owing no doubt to this habit. The hair is of the straight tough type (sometimes curly), growing to about 20 inches in length, and is a dark rusty brown in colour.\n\nThe recuperative powers are good, being much better than those of natives of India and equal to those of Europeans. Life is not regarded\nas precarious after five years of age. Wounds, cuts, and contusions heal with great rapidity. Child-birth is easy, but not to an abnormal extent, and the women are proud of a large family. The child-bearing age is 15 to 40, and children are suckled for two years. There is no partiality for male children, girls being as greatly, if not more, valued.\n\nLiving in a land of plenty, the Nicobarese endure hunger and thirst badly, and will eat and drink and chew betel at short intervals all day long, whenever practicable. They avoid the sun. Want of sleep is, however, borne with ease on occasion, though the sleepiness of the people in the daytime has deceived visitors. It is due to their habits of fishing and holding their ceremonies at night. They can carry very heavy weights, paddle canoes long distances, and can walk well and far without undue fatigue.\n\nThe gait is sluggish, slouching, and inelastic, but extreme agility is shown in climbing the coco-nut palm, and activity generally when there is anything important to be done. The Nicobarese on the whole do well what they are obliged to do. The daily necessary work is done regularly and systematically, and with a strict division of tasks between the sexes. They are expert in paddling and sailing boats, but not good swimmers. They are skilful and persevering sea fishermen, spearing fish by torch-light from canoes and catching them in sunken baskets, but not in nets or with stakes. Fishing lines are, however, well understood.\n\nThe gait betrays the nature. The Nicobarese will not exercise or tax his powers of endurance if he can help it, resting with his load every few hundred yards, and he is an adept in lessening the weight of coco-nuts when obliged to carry them. He will not walk more than five miles without a rest. Both sexes understand the advantage of working together at heavy tasks, to the accompaniment of the voice. The women never go far from their homes.\n\nThe Nicobarese boys attain puberty at about 14, girls at about 13; they attain full height at about 18 and 17, and full growth at about 22 and 21; the men marry at about 24, and the women much earlier, 14 to 15; they age at about 50, and live on to 70 and even 80. There are more old women than old men, and length of life is apparently greater than in India or Indo-China.\n\nInsanity is unknown, epilepsy almost so, and bodily abnormalities are rare. The great epidemics of the neighbouring continents\u2014cholera, typhoid, small-pox, measles, and beri-beri\u2014are usually absent and never endemic. Leprosy is unknown. Syphilis and cholera as epidemics have been imported, apparently since 1800. Malarial fevers are rampant everywhere, but are worst in the Central group; and though the inhabitants of the locality resist them, to all aliens they are\nespecially deadly. Elephantiasis, as a mosquito-borne disease, has an interesting history. On Chowra, in 3 square miles, 522 people, or about 20 per cent., are attacked with it; but it is unknown on Car Nicobar, and is rare everywhere else. The other diseases are climatic, and occur chiefly at the change of the monsoons.\n\nThe sense development is normal, any excellence being due to especial development for daily requirements. Taken as a whole, the Nicobarese, though for a very long while they were callous wreckers and pirates, and though they show great want of feeling in the 'devil murders,' are a quiet, good-natured, inoffensive people, honest, truthful, friendly, helpful, polite, and extremely hospitable towards each other, and not quarrelsome. By inclination they are friendly and hospitable towards, and not dangerous to, foreigners, though sometimes suspicious of and surly towards them, especially on Chowra and Katchall West. They are kindly to children, the aged, and those in trouble, even when foreigners: respectful and kindly to women, the wife being a help not a slave: and deferential towards elders. They are very conservative, and bound down by custom in all things, changing, however, with the times in certain respects. Thus, since 1840 they have abandoned leaf tobacco for China tobacco twisted dry into cigarettes, Burmese fashion.\n\nThe mental capacity of the Nicobarese is considerable. It is lowest in the south and highest in the north, and there is a marked difference between the sluggish inhabitants of Great Nicobar and the eager trader of Car Nicobar. A noteworthy mental characteristic is the capacity for picking up after 'pigeon' fashion any foreign language with which they come in contact.\n\nThe chief article of food is the coco-nut, next in importance being Pandanus pulp, fish, and imported rice. Pigs and fowls are kept for feasts. Dogs are eaten on Chowra. Cultivated fruits of many Oriental kinds are eaten everywhere. The Nicobarese are very fond of stimulants, and smoke a great deal of tobacco. Pan is the usual stimulant, and is in perpetual use. They make toddy from the coco-nut palm, constantly use it, and often get very drunk on it. Any kind of foreign spirit is acceptable, rum and arrack being in much request. This is their great trouble with traders and foreigners, and has led to many disputes and crimes.\n\nThe people are well housed, the houses being often of considerable size, containing an entire family. The house is raised on piles 5 to 7 feet from the ground, and consists of one large boarded floor, with mat and sometimes boarded walls, but without divisions. It is approached by a movable ladder. The houses are usually circular, with a high thatched pent roof, but they are sometimes oblong. The thatching is of grass or palm leaves. Underneath are often large square\nplatforms for seats or food. There is much rude comfort about such a dwelling, and inside it everything has its place and all is kept clean and in order. The cooking-place is in a separate small hut, in which are kept the coco-nut water-vessels and the larom or prepared Pandanus. Besides the dwelling-houses, the northern villages contain special houses for the moribund and the lying-in women. The interior of the villages and the immediate surroundings of houses are, in the north, well swept and clean. Nicobarese villages vary in size from one or two houses to about fifty or more, and are situated in all sorts of sites, but usually on or near the sea-shore. On a backwater or site safe from a heavy sea the house piles are at times driven into the sand below high and even low-water mark. In the house are kept all the utensils, weapons, ornaments, and belongings of the family, in chests on the floor, on platforms built into the roof, and about the walls and roofs. In places the most striking objects to the visitor are the kareau, or spirit-scarers, which are figures, sometimes life-size, of human beings, often armed with spears, of mythical animals based on fish, crocodiles, birds, and pigs, and pictorial representations of all kinds of things, painted in colours on areca spathes stretched flat. All these are connected with their animistic religion. There is often an armed figure just above the ladder. Outside the houses, too, are similar \u2018very bad devils,\u2019 spirit-scarers. Among common objects, also, of which the use might easily be mistaken, one is the row or rows of pigs\u2019 lower jaws with tusks. These are not mementoes of sport, but of the skill of the housewife in rearing large pigs for food. Bundles of wood, neatly made, are kept under the house, not for domestic use, but ready to place on the next grave that it will be necessary to dig. So, again, models of ships outside houses on Car Nicobar are not spirit-scarers, but signs to traders that the people are ready to deal in coco-nuts.\n\nOn Car Nicobar and Chowra, near each village by the seashore, is the elpanam, where are the public buildings of the village, consisting of a meeting-house, a lying-in house, a mortuary, and the cemetery. Village affairs, canoe races, &c., are settled at the assembly-house, a woman must be confined and go through a probationary period of uncleanliness in the lying-in house, and every one ought to die in the mortuary: a dying person is removed thither if possible. At the elpanam are provided places for all foreign traders to set up their houses, shops, and copra factories.\n\nThe Nicobarese busy themselves, firstly, with household duties, the care of their fruit-gardens, and the manufacture of articles for use and sale; secondly, with religious ceremonies and feasts; and, thirdly, with trade, external and internal. Special occupations are pottery and ceremonial ironwork on Chowra, basket-work on Car Nicobar, making of canoes and iron spears in the Central group, and of baskets, matting,\nwooden spears, and the collection of jungle produce in the Southern group. Car Nicobar grows half the coco-nuts in the islands.\n\nThe great pastime of the Nicobarese is feasting, and besides the numerous religious feasts and ceremonies they are constantly giving each other private feasts. The people do not seem to play games much, their leisure time being so occupied with religious and other festivals. But wrestling and playing with the quarter-staff are favourite amusements. For children, spinning-tops are ingeniously made of the betel-nut and a bit of stick: and a toy windmill, of the fashion well-known in Europe, is constructed from the seed of a creeper. Models of all kinds of articles are also made as toys, and toy imitations of the articles a dead child would have used in later life are pathetically placed on its grave.\n\nThe Nicobarese dance is a circular dance performed in or near the houses, and in the north at the assembly-house. The dancers lay their arms across each other's backs, with the hands resting on the next person's shoulder, and form a circle. Both sexes join, but in separate groups. There is a leader in a monotonous concerted song, and they step right and left under his direction, and jump in unison, coming down on both heels. The Nicobarese are a musical people, and sing clearly and well in unison. They compose songs for special occasions, and are adepts at acrostic songs. They have a flageolet and a stringed musical instrument, made of bamboo, on which they accompany themselves.\n\nFamilies are patriarchal, and as a rule live jointly. In such a household the father is the head of the family, and after his death the mother. When both parents are dead, the eldest son succeeds. Houses, and especially coco-nut and vegetable gardens, are private property, passing by heredity. The last are carefully marked off, and each owner has distinct notions as to the extent of his holding, which is carefully denoted by his private mark. On the death of the parents all real property, such as coco-nut and Pandanus trees, fruit-trees, and all cultivated gardens, is equally divided among the sons, except that most of the coco-nut trees pass to the eldest son. Practically all the father's personal property, purchased with coco-nuts, in the way of clothing and luxuries of every kind, is destroyed at his death on his grave, a custom that keeps the people perpetually poor. The daughters inherit nothing at the death of the father. Their shares are allotted on marriage by their father or their brothers, and consist of the trees and pigs. The whole subject of proprietary rights is still, however, most obscure, and requires more investigation than has hitherto been possible.\n\nGirls are free to choose their husbands; but, as is the rule where female freedom of choice in marriage exists, the question of wealth\ninfluences relatives, who bring pressure on the girls in favour of certain suitors. There is no marriage ceremony, and, though dissolution of marriage by mutual consent is common, unfaithfulness during marriage is rare. On separation the children go to relatives, and step-children are not kept in the house. Children, being valuable possessions in a thinly populated land, are looked on as belonging to the families of the persons who produced them.\n\nSocial emotions are clearly expressed by exclamations of the usual kind, and a great deal of politeness is observed in language, though the completeness of social equality prevents the use of honorifics of any kind, or titular forms of address. The social emotions are in fact strongly felt, and domestic troubles have led to suicide. Quarrels are nearly always settled by mutual friends, and seldom get beyond angry words, the final settlement being concluded by a feast given by the party adjudged to be in the wrong. Disputes arise over superstitions. When a family evil spirit has been caught and sent to sea in a model canoe which lands at another village or house site, the evil spirit has been transferred to a new house, and vengeance results. This is taken secretly by the aggrieved party and all its friends, who collect and on a dark night attack the offenders, while asleep, with quarter-staves steeped in pig's blood and covered with sand. They wear helmets consisting of a coco-nut husk, and smear their faces with red paint, so as to look savage. There is, however, not much real ferocity in the attack. The sticks are so long that they cannot be used in the houses, and so the attacked party has to come out, which it does readily. As every village is liable at any time to such an attack, it is always prepared, and keeps quarter-staves and coco-nut helmets ready for the purpose. A great deal of noise and some vigorous hammering continues till one party is getting the worst of it, and then the women interfere and part the combatants with cutlasses. Sore limbs, bruises, and broken fingers result, of which the heroes are proud, but no heads are broken. When all the trouble is over, the aggressors remain as the guests of the other party, and after a couple of days' feasting return home. This procedure is adopted also when serious general offence is given by any particular person.\n\nA child is named immediately after birth by its father, and an additional name is granted as a mark of favour by a friend. The latter is frequently changed in after life, which causes trouble when identity is sought by officials. A chief cause of the change is the tabu of the name of deceased relatives and friends for a generation, from fear of summoning their spirits, and the obligatory assumption of the name of the deceased grandfather by men and grandmother by women, on the death of both parents. Any person may adopt a name formed from any word in the language, a custom which, combined with the\ntabu on death, has a serious effect on the stability of the language in any given locality, and has caused the frequent use of synonyms.\n\nThe Nicobarese have for a long while had a great fancy for foreign, chiefly English, names, with an extraordinary result, for traders and others have for generations allowed their fancy play in giving ridiculous names, which have been used in addition to their own by the people in all good faith. Many persons also bear Indian, Burmese, and Malay names in a corrupted form. A chief, or headman, is usually styled Captain, a title they regard as lofty from observing the position of a ship's commander on board.\n\nThe Nicobarese are good carpenters, and can make fair models of most of their larger articles. They can work in, but not make, iron, and are adepts in constructing all sorts of articles for domestic use (vide Man's elaborate Catalogues of Objects made and used by the Nicobarese). Harpoons and spears of all sorts are made well, with detachable heads for pigs. All the heads are of iron, except for small fish, and among the Shom Pen, who use hard wooden spears with notched heads. They make and use a crossbow in some places, and everywhere quarter-staves (in the play of which they are adepts), and helmets, made of padded cloth or coco-nut husk. The pottery of Chowra is manufactured up to a large size, and turned by hand, not on the wheel, every maker placing his own distinctive mark under the rim. Pottery is used for food that is cooked, such as pork, Pandanus, and Cycas paste, fowls, rice, vegetables, coco-nut oil (for which, however, they have besides a special press). Fish is cooked in pots procured by trade from India. Rain-water is also caught ingeniously in Indian pots.\n\nA large portion of the manufactures is of articles connected with superstitions; but, in addition, the Nicobarese are very expert and neat in making articles for daily use from the leaves and spathes of palms, the leaf of the Pandanus, the shell of the coco-nut, and out of wood, iron, shells of fish, fibres of several kinds, bamboos, and canes.\n\nThe canoes are skilfully outrigged structures, light, and easily hauled up and carried. They are made of one piece of wood hollowed out and burnt, and very carefully constructed. In shape they are flat-bottomed, big-bellied, narrowed towards the top, with a small raised taffrail, battens for seats at regular intervals, and long and projecting bows. They are fast sailers, and, when properly managed, safe in surf and rough water. The racing canoes are specially built and costly, with ornamental masts and flagstaffs in the bows. The indigenous masts and sails are wide strips of clipped coco-nut or nipa leaves, and number two to four at intervals. Cotton lateen and other sails of borrowed patterns are, however, nowadays more commonly used. Clothing is nearly all imported, and so are most of the ornaments worn.\nThe Nicobarese cultivate no cereals, not even rice, and very little cotton, though carefully taught by the Moravians; but they exercise some care and knowledge over coco-nuts and tobacco, and have had much success with the many foreign fruits and vegetables introduced by Danish and other missionaries. They club together in making their gardens, which are industriously cultivated and always, if possible, out of sight. They domesticate dogs, fowls, and pigs, which they fatten; but not cattle and goats, as they use no milk. They tame parrots and monkeys for sale. The staple article of trade has always been the universal coco-nut, of which it is computed that 15 millions are produced annually, 10 millions being taken by the people, who in most places drink nothing but coco-nut milk, and 5 millions being exported, 2\u00bd millions from Car Nicobar and 2\u00bd millions from the remaining islands. The export consists of whole nuts and copra (pulp prepared for expressing oil). There is some export, also, of edible birds\u2019-nests, split cane, betel-nuts, trepang (b\u00e8che-de-mer), ambergris, and tortoise-shell. The imports consist of a great variety of articles, including rice, cotton cloths, iron, cutlasses (das), knives, tobacco, crockery and pottery, glass-ware, silver and white-metal ornaments, sugar, camphor, wooden boxes and chests, biscuits, fishing nets, Epsom salts, turpentine, castor-oil, looking-glasses, thread, string, matches, needles, European hats, old suits of cloth, and cotton clothing. Spirits and guns, though welcome, are contraband. As with all semi-civilized peoples, articles of trade to be accepted must conform closely to fixed pattern. The foreign trade is in the hands of natives of India, Burmans, Malays, and Chinamen, who visit the islands in schooners, junks, and other small craft.\n\nThe system of trade is for the foreign trader to give in advance to the local owner of trees the articles settled on for a certain quantity of coco-nuts, and then to recover their value from the trees. He must himself get the nuts down from the tree, make the copra and take it away and the husks too, if he wants them. The Nicobarese does nothing but reckon by tally what is taken. It is a laborious system for the trader and requires systematic working. At pp. 242\u20133 of the Census Report, 1901, will be found lists of trade articles and their value in coco-nuts.\n\nThere is an old-established internal trade, chiefly between the other islands and Chowra for pots, which are only made there. Chowra is also a mart for the purchase of racing and other canoes, made elsewhere in the islands. The season for trade is December to April. The Southern group brings to the Central group baskets, tortoise-shell, split rattans for canoes, Celtis bark and cloth for matting and formerly for general clothing, and a few canoes. These are passed on to\nChowra, with spears and racing canoes made in the Central group, in return for a certain class of iron hog-spears and pots, and are sold by the Chowra people to Car Nicobar for cloth, baskets of Car Nicobar make, and a great variety of articles valued at Car Nicobar in coco-nuts. There is a considerable trade between the Shom Pen and the coast people of Great Nicobar in canes, canoes, wooden spears, bark-cloth, matting, and honey, for iron das and cotton cloths.\n\nWithout using coin, the Nicobarese have always been ready and quick-witted traders in their great staple the coco-nut, using it also as currency, and obtaining for it even important articles of food which they do not produce, their clothing, and many articles of daily use. The system is to value the article to be purchased in nuts, and to pay for it by the other articles also valued in nuts. Thus land valued at 10,000 nuts has been paid for by about 50 manufactured articles valued in the aggregate at 10,000 nuts. So also a racing canoe valued at 35,000 nuts has been paid for by some 200 articles valued in the aggregate at the same figure.\n\nThe Nicobarese keep no records of reckoning beyond tallies, and have no methods for any mathematical process beyond tallying. The basis of all reckoning is tally by the score, and for trade purposes by the score of scores; and on this basis they have evolved a system which is naturally clumsy and complicated, but has become simplified where trade is briskest, and is made exact by an interesting series of rising standards up to very large figures. Tally is ordinarily kept by nicks with the thumbnail on strips of cane or bamboo, and on Car Nicobar, where the trade in coco-nuts is largest, by notches cut in sets on a stick. For ordinary purposes Nicobarese reckoning stops at about 600, except on Car Nicobar, where it stops at 2,000; but for coco-nuts it extends everywhere to very large figures, and even the Shom Pen have no difficulty in reckoning up to 80,000. A set of commercial scales will be found at p. 218 of the Census Report, 1901, and a detailed examination of the system of reckoning at p. 244.\n\nThe Nicobarese keep rough calendars by notches on wood. They reckon time by the monsoon season, or period of regular winds. Roughly the south-west monsoon blows from May to October, and the north-east from November to April, or for six months each. Two monsoons thus make a solar year, though the Nicobarese have no notion of such reckoning. Within a monsoon, time is approximately divided by moons or lunar months. Each moon is divided clearly into days, or as the Nicobarese reckon them nights, up to thirty, and more if necessary. As the monsoons do not fall exactly to time, but may be late or early, there is a rough and ready method of rectifying errors in reckoning, by a system of intercalary nights, when the moon cannot be\nseen, and by cutting short the month to suit the moon. In talking with the Nicobarese, it has always to be borne in mind that they never reckon by the year, but always by the monsoon or half-year.\n\nAll distant communications are by water; but on Car Nicobar good clear paths lead from village to village, and this is true to some extent of Chowra, Teressa, and Katchall. The sea distances have made the people expert in the feeling of direction, and, as among other Far-Eastern people, the points of the compass are thoroughly understood and constantly in mind. A Nicobarese always knows intuitively the direction north, south, east, or west of any object, action, condition, or movement at any time, and constantly so describes position in his speech.\n\nNecessity has also compelled the Nicobarese to study the stars and winds to a limited extent. Their astronomical knowledge is strictly limited to actual requirements, while sailing or paddling at night in calm weather, and at neap tides from one island to another. Voyages are then made partly at night under star guidance, but steering by the stars is the old men's work. Young men fight shy of it, for fear of such uncanny knowledge shortening their lives or ageing them unduly. The study and knowledge of the winds is also strictly practical. The terms for the winds have no connexion whatever with the points of the compass, but relate generally to the territorial direction of the wind which will help canoes from one island to another.\n\nInternal affairs are regulated only by the village, each of which has a chief, often hereditary, and recognized elders. In the chief is vested the land, but he cannot interfere with ownership of houses and products, without the consent of the elders. Beyond a certain respect paid to him, and a sort of right to unlimited toddy from his villagers, the chief has not much power or influence, except what may happen to be due to his personality. The maintenance of the chiefs or 'captains' has been encouraged steadily by all the foreign suzerains for their own political convenience. The custom was started by the Portuguese in the seventeenth century, and has been carried on by the Danes, Austrians, and British in succession. In the eyes of the people a man so appointed by the foreign suzerain, unless a chief or elder naturally, is looked upon merely as an interpreter for communication with the suzerain, without any social standing or power. Other persons, besides the chief and the elders, who have acquired a certain political power are the witch-finders and sorcerers (menluana). Government is, in fact, simple democracy bound by custom. Property is everywhere safe. In Car Nicobar, where the villages are much the largest, the government and the land seem to be vested in the chief (matakkolo) and three hereditary elders (yomtundal), who rule everything in council. All the village land is held from the council of\nelders for cultivation by the people, who, however, give nothing for it beyond contributions at ceremonies.\n\nIn 1882, during the occupation as a Penal Settlement, a system of control over all the islands was started by means of making formal appointments of all chiefs as from the British Government. The chiefs thus appointed are, as far as possible, selected by the people themselves, but Government reserves to itself the power to depose any chief who misbehaves, and to appoint another in his place. The whole of the islands have now acquiesced in this procedure, and by its means an effective continuous control is maintained. Each chief receives a formal certificate of appointment, an annual suit of clothes, a flag (Union Jack), and a blank leather-bound book. All these he is bound to produce at every official visit to his village; and he undertakes to hoist the flag at the approach of every ship, to produce his book so that the commander may write in it any remarks, to report to official visitors all occurrences, especially smuggling, wrecks, and violent offences that have taken place since the last visit, and to assist in keeping order. On the whole, the chiefs perform their duties as well as might be expected from people of their civilization. In every other respect the people are left to themselves.\n\nThere is a Government Agent at Nancowry, whose duties are to assist the chiefs in keeping order, to collect fees for licences to trade in the islands, to give port clearances, to report all occurrences, to prevent the smuggling of liquor and guns, and to settle petty disputes among the people themselves, or between the people and the traders, as amicably as may be. Excepting the ceremonial 'devil murders' of Car Nicobar, there is scarcely any violent crime, and very few violent disputes occur with the traders, so that order and control are maintained with hardly any interruption. The 'devil murders' are dealt with directly from Port Blair.\n\n[Rink: *Die Nikobarischen Inseln* (Copenhagen, 1847); translation in *Selections from the Records of the Government of India*, No. LXXVII, pp. 109\u201353.\u2014Maurer: *Die Nikobaren* (Berlin, 1867); valuable bibliography, English, Danish, German, 1799\u20131863.\u2014*Selections from the Records of the Government of India*, No. LXXVII (Calcutta, 1870); valuable bibliography.\u2014Hochstetter: *Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geologie der Nikobar-Inseln, Reise der Novara, Geologischer Theil ii*, 85\u2013112 (Vienna, 1866); translation in *Records of the Geological Survey of India*, No. IV, pp. 59\u201373, 1870.\u2014V.

The lower part is surrounded with six lines of fortifications. In the ninth and tenth centuries it was held by the Nolamba chiefs of the Pallava family, whose capital was at Henjeru, now called Hemavati. It then passed to the line of Chola chiefs under the Chalukyas, and the Hoysalas took it early in the thirteenth century. Under Vijayanagar rule, the Harati chiefs established themselves at Nidugal and held it until it was captured in 1761 by Haidar Ali, who made them tributary. Tipu Sultan later seized their possessions, and put an end to the line.\n\nNighasan.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Kheri District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Pali\u0101, Khairigarh, Nighasan, Dhaurahra, and Firozabad, and lying between 27\u00b0 41' and 28\u00b0 42' N. and 80\u00b0 19' and 81\u00b0 19' E., with an area of 1,237 square miles. Population increased from 279,376 in 1891 to 281,123 in 1901. There are 386 villages and two towns: Dhaurahra (population, 5,669) and Singahi Bhadaura (5,298), the former tahsil head-quarters. Nighasan, the present headquarters, has a population of only 1,240. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,81,000, and for cesses Rs. 45,000. The density of population, 227 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. The tahsil contains 293 square miles of forest. It lies between the Sard\u0101 or Chauk\u0101 on the west, and the Kauriala on the east, and the whole area is liable to be swept by heavy floods. Besides these large rivers, the Mohan forms the northern boundary, and the Dahawar, a channel of the Chauk\u0101, the southern. The Suheli or Sarju, another old bed of the Chauk\u0101, crosses the northern portion. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 439 square miles; there is practically no irrigation.\n\nNihtaur.\u2014Town in the Dhampur tahsil of Bijnor District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 20' N. and 78\u00b0 24' E., 16 miles east of Bijnor town. Population (1901), 11,740. The town has a mean appearance, most of the houses being built of mud, but there is a handsome old mosque, to which three modern domes have been added. A few years ago a seditious organization was discovered here. It was known as the Bara Topi, or 'twelve hats,' and resembled the Sicilian secret societies. Nihtaur is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 3,300. There is a little trade in dyeing, but the chief industry is sugar-refining. A middle school has 160 pupils, and two aided schools are attended by 52 boys and 40 girls.\n\nNijgarh.\u2014Town in Dhenkanal State, Bengal. See Dhenkanal Town.\n\nNijgarh.\u2014Town in Keonjhar State, Bengal. See Keonjhar Town.\nNilamb\u016br.\u2014Village in the Ern\u0101d t\u0101luk of Malabar District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 17' N. and 76\u00b0 14' E., on the road from Manjeri to the Nilgiris by the Kark\u016br gh\u0101\u1e6d. Population (1901), 2,700. It is the headquarters of the District Forest officer, South Malabar. The Nilamb\u016br valley, which lies below the Camel's Hump range and the Kundahs and is drained by the Beypore river, contains the chief Government forest Reserves of South Malabar. They extend over more than 150 square miles on the slopes of the Kundahs and along the head-waters of the Karimpula river, and include 4,000 acres of excellent teak plantations started in 1843, the best logs of which fetch Rs. 2-8 per cubic foot in the market. There are also small plantations of rubber and mahogany. Gold-washing is still carried on to a very slight extent in the upper Nilamb\u016br valley.\n\nNilanga.\u2014T\u0101luk in Bidar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 315 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 48,002. In 1891 the population was 59,148, the decrease being due to the famine of 1899-1900. The t\u0101luk has 89 villages, of which 26 are j\u0101gir; and Nilanga (population, 3,343) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 1.6 lakhs. In 1905 the t\u0101luk received a few villages from the Varv\u0101l-R\u0101j\u016bra t\u0101luk. Nilanga is composed chiefly of regar or black cotton soil. South and east lie the three paig\u0101h t\u0101luks of Part\u0101bpur, Bh\u0101lk\u012b, and Ghorw\u0101di (population, 42,761, 20,784, and 35,178), containing 63, 21, and 56 villages respectively. Bh\u0101lk\u012b (5,788), the only town, is situated in the paig\u0101h t\u0101luk of the same name.\n\nNileshwar.\u2014Village in the south of the K\u0101saragod t\u0101luk, South Kanara District, Madras, situated in 12\u00b0 16' N. and 75\u00b0 8' E. The surrounding territory formerly belonged to a branch of the Chirakkal family of Malabar. The local R\u0101j\u0101s offered considerable resistance to the Bedn\u016br kings in the eighteenth century, and were assisted alternately by the French and the English. When the District finally fell to the Company in 1799, the R\u0101j\u0101 accepted a pension, which is still continued. The village is now of little importance.\n\nNilgiri State.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 17' and 21\u00b0 37' N. and 86\u00b0 25' and 86\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 278 square miles. It is bounded on the north and west by the State of May\u016brbhanj, and on the east and south by Balasore District. One-third of the area is taken up by hills, some of which contain valuable timber. There is much land awaiting reclamation. Valuable quarries of black stone are worked, from which cups, bowls, platters, &c., are manufactured for export. Negotiations are in progress with a European firm for working the granite quarries in the State, and for connecting them by a light railway with the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway at Balasore. The origin of the State is obscure. According to tradition\nit was founded by an adventurer from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. It came into prominence during the Mughal period, and one of the chiefs was handsomely rewarded for the assistance he rendered to Akbar's Hindu general, M\u0101n Singh, in subduing the refractory Path\u0101ns. The State has an estimated revenue of Rs. 1,37,000, and pays a tribute of Rs. 3,900 to the British Government. The population increased from 56,198 in 1891 to 66,460 in 1901. The number of villages is 466, and the density is 239 persons per square mile. The most important village is Nilgiri, containing the residence of the R\u0101j\u0101; this is picturesquely situated at the foot of a hill, 5 miles from the trunk road from Calcutta to Madras, with which it is connected by a good metalled road. Hindus number 58,896, Muhammadans 101, and Animists 7,302. The most numerous castes are Khandaitis (15,000), Bhumijs (6,000), Br\u0101hmans (5,000), and Gaurs and Hos (4,000 each). A small Christian community belonging to the American Free Baptist Mission is established at Mitrapur, 11 miles west of Balasore town. The State maintains one middle English school, 9 upper primary and 75 lower primary schools, and a dispensary.\n\nNilgiris, The (Nilagiri, 'the blue mountains').\u2014A District in Madras, with the exception of Madras City the smallest in the Presidency', its area being only 958 square miles, or less than that of many taluks. It lies between 11\u00b0 12' and 11\u00b0 40' N. and 76\u00b0 14' and 77\u00b0 E., and is bounded on the north by the State of Mysore; east and southeast by Coimbatore District; and west and south-west by Malabar. It consists of two well-marked divisions: the high, steep-sided plateau formed by the junction of the Eastern and Western Gh\u0101ts as they run southwards down the two opposite sides of the Indian Peninsula; and a lower area adjoining, and geographically forming part of, the Malabar Wynad. The plateau, which is divided into the two taluks of Ootacamund and Coonoor, averages 6,500 feet above sea-level, and several of its peaks run up to over 8,000 feet. It is upheld by great masses of hill, which from the plains present almost the appearance of a wall; and its summit consists chiefly of rolling grassy downs, divided by narrow valleys, at the foot of each of which is a bog or a stream. There is not a square mile of level ground on the whole of this area, and in the wrinkles of the hills nestle small but beautiful woods, known locally as sholas. The lower area adjoining the Wynad forms the third, or G\u016bdal\u016br, taluk, and is often called the South-east Wynad. It is only 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the sea, is more level than the plateau, and is covered for the most part with thick forest.\n\nAlong the south-western edge of the plateau runs a line of bold hills\n\n---\n\nSince this article was written, a very small District of Anjengo, smaller than any of the existing Collectories, was formed in 1906.\ncalled the Kundahs, several of the peaks in which are over 8,000 feet in height. Among these is the well-known Makurti Peak (8,403 feet), one side of which is almost sheer for several hundred feet. To the east, overlooking Ootacamund, the head-quarters of the District and the hot-season residence of the Madras Government, rises Dodabetta (8,760 feet), the second highest point in the Indian Peninsula. To the north the general level is lower, dropping gradually towards the plateau of Mysore.\n\nThe extreme west of the District, the lower area above referred to, drains for the most part towards Malabar by the Pandi, a tributary of the Beypore river. All the rest drains eventually into the Bhavani. This river runs eastwards under the southern wall of the plateau in a deep and malarious valley, and is joined near the eastern limit of the District by the Moyar, which receives the drainage of the northern part of the plateau and forms for many miles the boundary between the District and Mysore State, running in a curious steep-sided trench known as the 'Mysore Ditch.' The Moyar rises on the slopes of Makurti Peak, and for the first part of its course across the plateau is known as the Pykara. It drops into the lower country by the two beautiful Pykara Falls, not far from Naduvattam in the north-west angle of the plateau, and is thereafter known as the Moyar.\n\nGeologically, the high plateau of the District consists of a great mass of the charnockite series of hypersthene-bearing granulites, with a few later dikes of olivine-norites, well seen at Coonoor, from 1 inch to 10 feet wide. Where the level drops suddenly down in the west towards Malabar, an immediate change occurs; and typical Archaean biotite and hornblende gneisses, with intrusive bands of charnockite and much younger biotite-granite, pegmatite, and basic dikes, make their appearance. The ruby, mica, and quartz-bearing reefs of this part of the District are referred to later under Minerals.\n\nThe altitude of the District naturally causes its flora to differ altogether from that of areas on the plains. Dr. Wight's Spicilegium Neilgherrense describes the more important of the plants found. The chief timber trees, indigenous and other, are referred to under Forests below. On the grassy downs occur several varieties of orchids: and wide stretches of land, especially in the neighbourhood of the Kundahs, are covered with Strobilanthes, which once in seven years bursts into a sheet of blue blossom and then dies down. The colours of its beautiful flowers vary from a pale, bright blue to a deep purple as the clouds drift over them, and form a most striking picture: they may have suggested the name 'Blue Mountains.' In the sholas grow rhododendrons, several species of ilex, Elaeocarpus, and Eugenia (the varied tints of the leaves of which render these little woods extremely beautiful in the spring), ferns of many varieties, bracken, tree-orchids with delicate blossoms, the hill gooseberry, blackberries of especial luxuriance, the\nsweet-scented Nilgiri lily, the alpine wild strawberry, and many other unusual and interesting trees and plants. English flowers (except roses, which seem to object to the high altitude) and vegetables flourish amazingly. Hedges in the gardens on the plateau are often made of heliotrope, fuchsia, and geranium, all of which grow into strong shrubs. English fruits are, however, less successful.\n\nOf the large game found on the plateau the Nilgiri ibex (*Hemitragus hylocrius*) is the most interesting, occurring only on these hills and a few other parts of the Western Ghats farther south. Tigers and leopards often, and wild dogs occasionally, ascend the plateau from the lower slopes. *Sambar* are common in the sholas throughout the hills, especially in the Kundahs. Bison (*gaur*) and elephants are fairly common in the Benne Reserve and in the Mudumalai leased forest in the Lower Wynaad. The Nilgiri Game Association, of which the Collector is usually the president and the District Forest officer the secretary, does much to prevent promiscuous shooting. It expends on watchers and other measures of preservation the income it derives from fees for shooting licences. Among rarer animals of the smaller kind may be mentioned the Nilgiri langur (*Semnopithecus johnii*) and the Indian marten (*Mustela flavigula*). The hill-otter is fairly common on the banks of the Pykara river, and Carnatic carp are numerous in the same stream, into which they were introduced in 1877. Efforts are now being made by the Game Association to stock the rivers with rainbow trout (*Salmo irideus*), all efforts to get the ordinary trout to breed having hitherto proved unsuccessful. Snakes are not so common as in the low country, but forty-five non-venomous and thirteen venomous species have been noted. Most of these, however, were seen in the Wynaad, and on the plateau these pests are rare. The District is especially rich in lepidoptera, and the Wynaad and the lower slopes of the hills near Mettupalaiyam are happy hunting-grounds for the entomologist.\n\nOf migrant birds, the woodcock is fairly common on the plateau between the months of October and March. Snipe also visit the bogs at the bottom of the valleys. The edible-nest swift breeds in a few places, notably in the cave in Tiger Hill close to the toll-bar at the top of the gh\u00e2t road from Coonoor to Ootacamund.\n\nThe 'sweet half-English air' of the Nilgiris has long been famous, and has led to the establishment on the plateau of the chief sanitarium of Southern India, Ootacamund, and the smaller stations of Coonoor, Wellington, and Kotagiri. Ootacamund, the highest of these, enjoys an annual mean temperature of $57^\\circ$, as compared with $83^\\circ$ at Madras, slight frosts occurring in the valleys at night in December and January. The climate has not, however, the invigorating qualities of the air of Europe, and is particularly unsuited to those who are liable\nto dysentery or sluggishness of the liver. The lower slope of the hills, particularly the Bhav\u0101ni valley, and the Wynaad are feverish; especially so between March and May. With the burst of the south-west monsoon in June the malaria decreases, and the Wynaad then becomes comparatively healthy.\n\nThe annual rainfall of the Nilgiris averages about 67 inches, but the distribution varies enormously according as each place is exposed or not to the full force of the south-west monsoon. All the western parts of the District receive most of their rain during this current, and on much of the plateau the five months from December to April are almost rainless. From its proximity to the west coast, the Wynaad gets the heaviest fall, the amount registered averaging 161 inches at Dev\u0101la and 90 inches at G\u016bdal\u016br. Naduvattam, the most westerly point of observation on the plateau, receives 102 inches and Ootacamund 49 inches. Coonoor receives 63 and Kotagiri 62. This heavy rain frequently washes away portions of the roads leading to the plateau, and when the rack railway to Coonoor was first opened it also suffered considerably. Experience has now rendered it possible to protect the places most exposed to landslips.\n\nOf the early history of the District nothing definite is known. It seems, however, probable that the Nilgiris shared in the varied fortunes of the neighbouring District of Coimbatore. With the latter, it would appear to have become part of the dominions of the Naik kings of Madura during the second half of the sixteenth century. In the next century it seems to have passed under the Hindu kings of Mysore. Haidar Ali (who, during the second half of the eighteenth century, usurped the Mysore throne) and his son Tip\u016b were apparently impressed with its strategical importance, for they strengthened such forts as it possessed to prevent raids from the Wynaad into Mysore and Coimbatore, which then belonged to them. The District fell to the share of the Company on the distribution of Tip\u016b's possessions after his defeat and death at Seringapatam in 1799.\n\nApparently the first European to ascend the hills was a Catholic priest, who was sent up in 1602 by the Bishop of the Syrian Christians in Malabar on an evangelistic mission. Shortly afterwards, another party under a Jesuit priest named Jacome Ferrieri went up from Calicut, and the account of their adventures contains not a little information about the tribes of the hills and their manners and customs. The first Englishman to reach the top of the plateau was Buchanan, who went up in 1800 from Devan\u0101yakkankota in the Bhav\u0101ni valley. In 1818 Messrs. Kindersley and Whish of the Civil Service went up on a shooting trip by much the same route; and their account of the pleasant coolness of the climate first attracted attention to the possibilities of the hills as a sanitarium to replace the Cape and Mauritius.\nThe next year Mr. John Sullivan, then Collector of Coimbatore, went up to the plateau, and from that time forward he did everything in his power to render it better appreciated and more accessible. In 1827 Ootacamund was formally established as the sanitarium of the Presidency. Mr. Stephen Rumbold Lushington, Governor of Madras between 1827 and 1832, had much to do with the opening up of the place. 'It will be the glory,' said a contemporary writer, 'of Mr. Lushington's government, without extravagant hyperbole, that he introduced Europe into Asia, for such are his improvements in the Nilgiris.'\n\nRude stone cairns and barrows abound on the plateau, situated usually in commanding situations on the summits of hills. A number of these, opened by Mr. Breeks, the first Commissioner of the Nilgiris, were found to contain burnt bones, pottery, iron knives, spear-heads, &c. The subject is discussed at length in his *Primitive Tribes and Monuments of the Nilgiris*, and the finds he made form a valuable portion of the collection of prehistoric objects in the Museum at Madras. The best bronzes and weapons were discovered in cairns on the northern side of the plateau. Near Kotagiri are a number of kistvaens, formed of large stone slabs enclosing a square space or vault, and surrounded by circles of single stones. Dolmens similar to the kistvaens, but built above-ground, occur in groups at Sholur, Melur, and a few other places on the plateau. Some of the older funeral stone circles built by the aboriginal tribe of Todas have been opened, and found to contain weapons, pottery, &c.\n\nThere are three old forts on the Nilgiris\u2014at Udaiyarkota, Hulikal Durgam, and Malekota. The last is situated 5 miles north-west of Ootacamund near the gh\u0101\u1e6d road running to Sigur, and was utilized by Tipu Sultan, who named it Husainabad. In digging the foundations of Bishopsdown House at Ootacamund in 1827 a Roman gold coin was discovered. This, coupled with the fact that old gold-workings have been discovered on the slopes of Dodabetta, seems to point to a very early settlement of traders and gold-diggers near Ootacamund.\n\nIn the Wynad, antiquarian interest centres chiefly round the prehistoric gold-workings found near Dev\u0101la. Some of the shafts are 70 or 80 feet deep. Old forest trees are to be seen growing out of them. The existing caste of gold-workers are the Kurumbas, but they now confine themselves entirely to alluvial washing. There is said to be a tradition among them of an extinct tribe known as Vedahs, who sunk the shafts in remote times.\n\nThe people of the Nilgiris occupy an exceptional position in many ways. In area the District is the smallest in the Presidency except Madras City, and in population it is altogether the smallest, its inhabitants amounting to less than a fourth of those of Madras City. In 1871 they numbered only 49,501. In\n1877 the South-east Wynnaad was added to the Nilgiris, and the population in 1881 increased accordingly to 91,034. In 1891 it numbered 99,797; and in 1901, 111,437. Even allowing for the increase due to the addition of the Wynnaad, the growth in these thirty years has been at the rate of as much as 74 per cent., which is higher than any other District can show, although in the decade ending 1901 the decline, caused by the falling off in the coffee-planting industry, in the number of inhabitants of the Gudalur taluk (16.8 per cent.) was greater than in any other taluk in the Presidency. The rapid increase in the Nilgiris as a whole, which still continues, is due to the expansion of the two hill stations of Ootacamund and Coonoor and the cantonment at Wellington, and to its complete exemption from famine, and has been largely caused by immigration from other Districts, notably Coimbatore. Of every 100 of the people living on the Nilgiris in 1901, only 59 had been born within the District, while 29 had come from neighbouring tracts and 12 from non-contiguous areas. Nilgiri District is still, however, the most sparsely peopled Collectorate in the Presidency.\n\nIt contains two towns, OOTACAMUND (population, 18,596), the headquarters, and COONOOR (8,525). The Census at both these places was taken in the cold season before the numerous summer visitors and shopkeepers and their servants had arrived, and in the hot months their population is considerably larger. The District is divided into the three taluks of OOTACAMUND, COONOOR, and GUDALUR, particulars of which according to the Census of 1901 are given below:\n\n| Taluk       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Ootacamund | 440                  | 1               | 17       | 37,998     | 86                        | + 20.2                                                   | 5,150                                  |\n| Gudalur     | 280                  | ...             | 12       | 21,139     | 7.5                       | - 16.8                                                   | 1,340                                  |\n| Coonoor     | 238                  | 1               | 20       | 52,300     | 220                       | + 22.2                                                   | 6,426                                  |\n| District total | 958                | 2               | 49       | 111,437    | 116                       | + 11.7                                                   | 12,916                                 |\n\nOf every 100 of the population, 82 are Hindus or Animists, 5 are Musalmans, and 13 Christians. Christians are proportionately more numerous than in any other District, and continue to be so even if all the Europeans and Eurasians among them (3,764) are left out of account. They have increased at the rate of 75 per cent. since 1881. The Nilgiris contain proportionately fewer females than any other Madras District, there being only 84 to every 100 males. In the low country round Gudalur (the Wynnaad), the chief coffee-planting centre, there are half as many males again as there are females, the labourers\non the estates leaving their womenkind behind them when they come up from the plains. On the whole, Tamil is more spoken than any other vernacular. The District is, however, the most polyglot in the Presidency, eight different languages \u2014 Tamil, Badaga, Kanarese, Malay\u0101lam, Telugu, Hindust\u0101ni, English, and Kurumba, to give them in the order of the frequency of their occurrence\u2014being spoken by at least 3 per cent. of the population. Badaga is a dialect of Kanarese spoken by the cultivating class of the same name, and Kurumba is the language of a forest tribe who live on the slopes of the hills. In the Coonoor and Ootacamund t\u0101luks Tamil and Badaga are each the vernacular of between 30 and 40 per cent. of the people, while in G\u016bdal\u016br t\u0101luk about a third of the people speak Tamil, a fifth Malay\u0101lam, and another fifth Kanarese.\n\nBr\u0101hmans are scarcer in the Nilgiris than in any area except the Ganj\u0101m Agency, numbering only 7 in every 1,000 of the Hindu and Animist population. The five Hindu castes which are found in the greatest strength are Badagas (34,152), Paraiyans (19,429), Vell\u0101las (4,501), Kurumbas (4,083), and Chettis (2,950). Three of these\u2014the Paraiyan labourers, the Vell\u0101la cultivators, and the Chetti traders\u2014are Tamil immigrants from the low country. The other two have already been mentioned. Badagas hardly occur away from the Nilgiri plateau; and though Kurumbas are found in several other Districts, those of the Nilgiris are quite distinct from their fellows, living the wildest existence in the jungles and speaking their tribal dialect, instead of talking Kanarese and subsisting by shepherding like the rest of the class. Two other tribes which are not found off the plateau are the Kotas and the Todas. The former are the artisans and musicians of the community; while the latter are a primitive pastoral people, who subsist upon the produce of herds of buffaloes, and owing to their unusual ways and customs (polyandry, for example) have attracted a great deal of attention among anthropologists. The latest contributions to the literature regarding these tribes are Mr. Thurston\u2019s Madras Museum Bulletins descriptive of them; and The Todas, by W. H. R. Rivers (1906).\n\nThe occupations of the people of the Nilgiris are in several ways exceptional. They are less exclusively agricultural than those of any District except Madras City, only 61 per cent. living by the land. Of the remainder, unusually large proportions subsist by domestic service, building, commerce, the transport of merchandise, general labour, and the learned and artistic professions, while the cantonment at Wellington brings up the number of those who belong to the army to a figure above the normal. The ordinary native of the plain dislikes life on the cold plateau; and the cost of living there, necessitating warm clothing and a substantial house, is greater than in the low country.\nConsequently wages of all kinds rule very high, an ordinary unskilled labourer being able to obtain six annas a day.\n\nThere are 14,845 Christians in the District, of whom 11,081 are natives. Two-thirds of them are Roman Catholics, and about a fifth belong to the various Protestant sects. Apparently the first Protestant mission to start operations on the plateau was the Church Missionary Society, which built a chapel at Ootacamund in 1857 near St. Stephen's Church. The Society has now a church at Coonoor also, and uses the Government church at Gudalur. It has established 13 schools, which have 810 pupils, and its work among the hill tribes is confined chiefly to the Todas and Kurumbas. There is an American Mission chapel at Coonoor, with a resident catechist; and the Basel Lutheran Mission has established settlements at Kaity, Nirkanbe, and Kotagiri, with schools at each place. The head-quarters of the latter are at Kaity, in a house in that valley which was originally built by Lord Elphinstone, Governor of Madras from 1837 to 1842, as a private residence for himself. The Roman Catholics have churches in Ootacamund and chapels at Gudalur and Naduvattam, and maintain eight schools.\n\nOwing to its elevation, agricultural conditions in the District differ considerably from those prevailing in other parts of the Presidency. The most fertile of all the soils is a rich black loam. On the plateau this is frequently of a dense, peaty nature, and the peat obtained from it is often used as fuel. The brown soil is the next in value. The yellow and red lands are both of inferior quality and require large quantities of manure to render them in any way productive, so they are chiefly used as grazing grounds.\n\nIn the Wynnaad, cultivation of grain is almost entirely confined to the marshy, alluvial flats which occur among the low hills, and the heavy rainfall allows a considerable quantity of rice to be grown without irrigation. The soil is also so fertile that little manure is required. On the plateau only 'dry' (unirrigated) crops are raised. The best of these are found in the more sheltered areas to the east and south.\n\nThere are no zamindaris or inam lands in the Nilgiris, the whole area being held on ryotwari tenure. In the Gudalur taluk the sub-tenures resemble the peculiar varieties found in Malabar. Of the 958 square miles of the District, 500, or more than half, are covered with forest, and the extent actually cultivated is less than one-third of the whole. No portion is irrigated. Statistical particulars for the three taluks in 1903\u20134 are given on the next page, in square miles.\n\nThe cultivation consists of that conducted by the planters (chiefly Europeans, whose attention is directed to the production of coffee, tea, and cinchona), and that carried on by the ordinary native ryots. More than half of it comes within the former category.\nCoffee is the most important of the three crops grown by the planters. It was introduced in 1839 from the Malabar Wynaad. By 1863-4 there were about forty estates in various parts of the District. The Ouchterlony Valley was opened up between 1850 and 1860, and by 1876 the area under coffee in it exceeded 4,000 acres. At that time coffee commanded high prices in the home market, and the value of the crop of 1878-9 was estimated at over 1\u00bd crores. Owing to the subsequent overstocking of the home market with Brazilian coffee, prices have since fallen rapidly. The average price was \u00a35 9s. 6d. per cwt. in 1891, but it fell to \u00a32 13s. per cwt. in 1901. To add to the planters' embarrassments, leaf disease and the borer, an insect which eats into the heart-wood of the trees and speedily kills them, have ruined many properties. As a natural consequence, many coffee estates have gone out of cultivation. The area under coffee in the District in 1903-4 was returned as 26,000 acres, but a very large portion of this has been practically abandoned. More than half of it lies in the Coonoor taluk.\n\nThe area under tea in 1903-4 was 8,000 acres, about equally divided among the three taluks. Its cultivation has been steadily increasing. The plant was introduced in 1835, and in 1878 was grown on 4,200 acres. Like coffee-growing, the industry has suffered from over-production. At present there is a tendency to grow for quality rather than quantity; and fair prices are obtained for leaf cultivated and picked on scientific principles, though much of the profit is absorbed by middlemen and distributing agencies.\n\nThe introduction of the quinine-yielding cinchona from South America into India is due to the exertions of Sir (then Mr.) Clements Markham in 1860. The results of his experiments proved satisfactory; and in 1862 and 1863 the Madras Government started two plantations, one on Dodabetta and another, for species requiring a warmer and moister climate, at Naduvattam, on the north-western edge of the plateau above Gudalur. Later, two more plantations were started near Pykara. The three existing plantations\u2014Dodabetta, Naduvattam, and Hooker (so called after the celebrated botanist)\u2014cover an aggregate area of 1,630 acres, of which 990 acres are under cinchona. The chief varieties cultivated are *C. officinalis* and *C. succirubra*, with their result-\nant hybrids. The quinine is manufactured at a factory at Naduvattam, and sold to the public at a low price through the agency of the post offices.\n\nThere are a number of private cinchona estates on the Nilgiris, but the low prices for bark ruling from 1894 to 1899, which were again due to over-production, made the cultivation of the tree unprofitable; and many properties have now been converted into tea gardens. The area of private estates has fallen from 10,373 acres in 1891 to 3,200 acres in 1904. Some of them sell their bark to the Government factory.\n\nOf the crops grown by the native ryots, the chief are the millet called s\u0101mai (Panicum miliare), rice, korali (another millet, Setaria glauca), r\u0101gi (Eleusine coracana), barley, potatoes, and some wheat. Rice is grown only in the Wynaad; and korali, barley, potatoes, and wheat only on the plateau. There is also much cultivation of vegetables and fruit for the Ootacamund, Coonoor, and Kotagiri markets, and 3,300 acres of private land have been planted with the blue gum-tree, which is used for firewood. Korali, r\u0101gi, s\u0101mai, barley, and potatoes are the staple foods of the lower classes on the plateau. The ryots are unprogressive and unenterprising, though careful and industrious. They evince but little inclination to avail themselves of the Loans Acts. Only Rs. 4,900 has been advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act, and only Rs. 12,700 under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act. In the Wynaad no advances at all have been taken.\n\nThe indigenous cattle of the District are of an inferior description, owing firstly to a curious lack of nourishment in the natural grasses (it is said that there is not enough lime in the soil), and secondly to the long dry weather from January to April, during which a hot sun in the day and slight frosts at night combine to kill off the pasture. The best animals are those imported from Mysore. The buffaloes maintained by the Todas for the sake of their milk are, however, very fine beasts, being much larger than those of the plains, and carrying wide curved horns of a peculiar shape.\n\nA miserable breed of pack ponies is raised in the District, but these animals are useful in a country where the unevenness of the ground makes cart-roads a luxury. Sheep and goats are not kept to any great extent, and efforts to introduce English sheep have not so far been successful. The Berkshire breed of pig has been crossed with the Chinese variety with success, but it is difficult to cure bacon and hams properly owing to the absence of real winter weather. Horses have been bred for some years at a private establishment at Masnigudi, and some success has been met with. Experiments in mule-breeding were made near Sig\u016br, but have now been abandoned.\n\nThe forests and plantations are of two classes, which differ widely\nin character. There are, first, the Reserves and plantations on the plateau, consisting of exotics and indigenous evergreen trees; and, secondly, the deciduous forest on the slopes of the hills and in the Wynaad. The natural woods or sholas on the plateau consist of patches of slow-growing trees and evergreens of little commercial value. In the deeper valleys trees in these are often of considerable size; but on the wind-swept downs the growth is gnarled and stunted, and of little use except as cover for game.\n\nThe Government recognized at an early date that the indigenous supplies would require to be supplemented, to meet the growing demand for firewood and building timber in the sanitaria which sprang up on the plateau; and as early as 1856 experiments in the planting of exotic timber were instituted at Jakatala near Wellington. The first plantations were chiefly of Australian acacias, but it was soon seen that the eucalyptus yielded better results than any other species. The Australian black-wood (Acacia melanoxylon) grows very freely and is a characteristic tree of the stations on the plateau, and the same may be said of the yellow-flowered Australian wattle. This latter is, indeed, becoming a nuisance, as it is of little commercial value and spreads amazingly.\n\nThe oldest eucalyptus plantation at Ootacamund is that known as Aramby, along the western and northern slopes of the Club Hill. This was put down in 1863 and the following years. In 1878 careful experiments were conducted by the Forest department, to ascertain whether the area planted with eucalyptus was sufficient to meet the requirements of the towns on the plateau, and the results were reassuring. The present supply is, indeed, more than equal to the demand. The chief species worked is *E. globulus*, and d\u00e9p\u00f4ts are maintained for its sale to the public. The total area at present planted with eucalyptus and other exotics on the plateau is 3,075 acres, of which 1,696 acres are in the neighbourhood of Ootacamund and 1,379 acres near Coonoor and Wellington.\n\nThe forests on the slopes of the hills and in the Wynaad comprise the three large Reserves of Mudumalai, Benne, and Sig\u016br. The first of these, which was leased from a native proprietor (the Tirumalp\u0101d of Nil\u0101me\u016br) in 1862, contains a quantity of teak, black-wood (*Dalbergia latifolia*), bamboo, and other trees of commercial value. In Benne forest the growth of teak is even finer, owing to the heavier rainfall. There is a Government plantation of this tree, 244 acres in extent, in this forest, but the absence of any railway renders it difficult to get the timber to remunerative markets. The Sig\u016br forest is about 40 square miles in extent, including a sandal-wood area of 2,000 acres from which a moderate revenue is derived. The other timber trees in this Reserve are of inferior growth and quality.\nThe Nilgiris contain iron, kaolin, mica, and gold-bearing quartz. The iron occurs in large masses at Karrashola near Kotagiri, but the absence of fuel in the neighbourhood renders it of no commercial value. Kaolin is found in several places on the plateau, but is said to contain too much iron to be of economic importance. In the Wynaad mica and gold-bearing quartz reefs occur in abundance. The attempts to establish a gold-mining industry there on a remunerative basis have hitherto proved unsuccessful. The glowing reports of experts led to the great boom of 1880, when numerous companies, with an aggregate capital of over four millions sterling, were floated on the London market. The results of crushings gave returns so much smaller than had been anticipated that the boom was followed by the equally severe depression of 1884, which led to the winding-up of nearly all the companies interested before anything had been achieved. Costly machinery sent out from England was in many cases never erected, and remains overrun by jungle or lying on the roadside to this day. A recent attempt by a local syndicate to employ the improved methods of extraction since invented has also failed to pay. Investigations lately undertaken by Messrs. Hayden and Hatch of the Geological Survey of India go to show that 'with the methods at present available for the treatment of low-grade ores, there is no hope of gold-mining in the Wynaad becoming remunerative.' Mica occurs throughout the Wynaad and particularly in the granitic rocks near Gudalur; but all efforts to extract it in sufficiently large sheets to make it commercially valuable have also, up to the present, proved unsuccessful.\n\nThe only native industry in the District is the manufacture by the Kotas of rough knives, billhooks, earthenware vessels, &c., for the Badagas and Todas. The Kotas are the only artisan caste on the plateau, and are usually paid in kind for their productions.\n\nAmong large industries brewing is the most important, and four breweries are now at work. The Castle Brewery at Aravanghat wa started in 1859, and its present annual out-turn is about 80,000 gallons the Nilgiri Brewery, Ootacamund, originally known as the Murree Brewery, has an out-turn of 131,000 gallons; the Rose and Crown Brewery at Kaity was established in 1895 and has lately been taken over by a syndicate; and the British Brewery is a small concern recently started at Ootacamund. The Castle Distillery at Aravanghat, opened in 1886, produces 11,000 gallons of spirit annually.\n\nThe Government cordite factory near Wellington consists of two parts: the power works at the foot of the Kareri Falls, the water of which is utilized to generate electrical power for working the\n\n---\n\n1 Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxiii, part ii.\nmachinery; and the factory itself, situated some distance off in the Aravangh\u0101t valley. The buildings belonging to the latter already form a small town, and operations have now been begun.\n\nThere are three soda-water factories at Ootacamund, two at Coonoor, and one at Wellington. Eucalyptus oil is distilled in bulk by a firm in Ootacamund, the annual output being about 500 gallons. There is a tea factory at Devarashola in the Wynaad, and four others on the plateau at the Liddlesdale, Curzon, Glendale, and Kodan\u0101d estates. Sulphate of quinine and febrifuge are made in large quantities at the Government factory at Naduvattam from the bark of cinchona grown on the Government plantations and on private estates. The factory has been at work since 1889, and it and the plantations are managed by a special officer called the Director of Government Cinchona Plantations. It supplies the quinine used in public hospitals, not only in this Presidency but in several other Provinces and Native States. Cheap quinine has been brought within the reach of the poorer classes by what is known as the pice-packet system, which was started in 1892. Under this, 7-grain (formerly 5-grain) powders are sold for a quarter-anna (or 3 pies) each at all post offices. The great increase in the sale of these packets shows how much they are appreciated, and the net profits of the work at the Government Cinchona Plantations and the factory since they were started have amounted to about 15 lakhs.\n\nThe Nilgiris do not produce enough food to support the large foreign non-agricultural population. The area under cereals is only 29,000 acres, and it has been calculated that the average out-turn is not equal to more than four months' supply. Consequently large quantities of rice and r\u0101gi are imported from Mysore State through G\u016bdal\u016br, and from Coimbatore District by the gh\u0101\u1e6d road and the rack railway which start from Mettup\u0101laiyam.\n\nWell-attended markets are held once a week at Ootacamund, Coonoor, Kotagiri, and G\u016bdal\u016br. The last of these supplies the Wynaad and the Ouchterlony Valley.\n\nThe principal exports of the District are coffee, tea, cinchona bark, quinine, eucalyptus oil, and beer. Many of the Wynaad products go down to Calicut. Musalm\u0101ns control the greater part of the trade.\n\nThe only railway within the District is the rack railway from Mettup\u0101laiyam, at the foot of the hills in Coimbatore District, to Coonoor. Work on this was started in 1891; but in 1895 the original company went into liquidation, and the assets and concession were taken over by a syndicate in London who soon raised the capital required for its completion. The line was opened for traffic with Coonoor in 1899, and is now worked by the Madras Railway Company under an agreement with the Nilgiri Railway Company. The line is of metre gauge on the Abt system, which is an improved rack-rail modification of the\nRigi principle. It is $16\\frac{3}{4}$ miles long, with a gradient of $1$ in $12\\frac{1}{2}$ for the last $8\\frac{3}{4}$ miles. The extension of this line to Ootacamund ($11\\frac{1}{2}$ miles) is now being completed, arrangements being made to render it available for the new cordite factory near Wellington. The terminal station at Ootacamund will be in the centre of the town in the Mettucherri valley.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads in the District is $145$ miles, and of unmetalled roads $479$ miles. Of the former, $20$ miles are under the charge of the Public Works department, and all the rest are maintained by the District board. Avenues of trees are not needed in this temperate climate, and only $18$ miles of road are provided with them. Ootacamund is the centre of the road system, and from it lines run to the various gh\u0101ts leading off the plateau. Of these the most important is that from Mettup\u0101laiyam to Coonoor, which was built in $1833$ and realigned in $1871$. From Mettup\u0101laiyam another gh\u0101t leads northwards up to Kotagiri, but is little used except by passengers and traffic connected with coffee and tea estates in the neighbourhood of Kotagiri. On the north the Sig\u016br gh\u0101t gives access to Mysore, but the road is steep and most of the Mysore traffic comes by way of the G\u016bdal\u016br gh\u0101t. At the ninth mile from Ootacamund along this a road branches to the north, leading to the Pyk\u0101ra Falls and the tea and cinchona estates at the north-west corner of the plateau. From G\u016bdal\u016br a good road runs to the north-east, connecting this line with the Sig\u016br route near Teppak\u0101du. From the same place other roads run north-west to Sult\u0101n's Battery in the Malabar Wynaad, and west, through Devala and Cheramb\u0101di, to Vayittiri and to Calicut on the west coast; and a branch goes south-west, via N\u0101dg\u0101ni and Kark\u016br, to Nilamb\u016br in the plains of Malabar. The old route from Malabar to the hills was by the Sisp\u0101ra gh\u0101t at the south-west corner of the plateau, but it was always very malarious and is now abandoned and overgrown with thick jungle. On the plateau, besides the main roads already mentioned, a good gravelled road runs from Ootacamund to Kotagiri and thence to Kodan\u0101d, and another to Devashola and Mel\u016br. From Devashola a road runs east to Coonoor through K\u0101rteri. Coonoor and Wellington are also connected with Kotagiri by a good road.\n\nActual famine is unknown in the Nilgiris, but high prices caused by scarcity in the low country occasionally cause distress among the poorer classes in the towns.\n\nUp to $1830$ the Nilgiris formed part of Coimbatore District. A portion of the plateau was transferred in that year to Malabar, but was retransferred to Coimbatore in $1843$, and the Nilgiris remained a t\u0101luk of the latter District till $1868$. The plateau was then constituted a separate District under a Commissioner\nand Assistant Commissioner, in whose hands was placed the whole of the judicial work, both civil and criminal, as well as the revenue administration. In 1873 the Ochterlony Valley was added to the District, and in 1877 the South-east Wynaad was transferred from Malabar and became the G\u016bdal\u016br t\u0101luk. In 1882 the administrative machinery was reorganized and assimilated to that in other Districts. The Commissioner was replaced by a Collector, and the Assistant Commissioner became a Head Assistant Collector.\n\nThe Nilgiris comprise only three t\u0101luks: namely, Ootacamund, Coonoor, and G\u016bdal\u016br. The first and last of these form the charge of the Collector, while Coonoor is administered by the divisional officer, whose head-quarters, formerly at Dev\u0101la, were in 1905 transferred to Coonoor. Deputy-tahsild\u0101rs are in charge of Ootacamund and G\u016bdal\u016br, and a tahsild\u0101r of Coonoor. Coonoor has also a stationary sub-magistrate. Unlike other Districts, the Nilgiris have no separate Executive Engineer. Public works in the Ootacamund and Coonoor t\u0101luks are in charge of the Engineer of Coimbatore, those in the G\u016bdal\u016br t\u0101luk are included in the Malabar Executive Engineer\u2019s division, while the public buildings in Ootacamund town are looked after by the Consulting Architect.\n\nFor civil judicial purposes the Nilgiris are included in the jurisdiction of the District Judge of Coimbatore. In addition to the usual village Munsifs, there are two courts of original jurisdiction, those of the Subordinate Judge of Ootacamund and of the District Munsif of G\u016bdal\u016br, the latter officer being the deputy-tahsild\u0101r. The former court exercises jurisdiction over the whole District, and hears appeals from the decisions of the District Munsif.\n\nFor purposes of criminal justice the District is similarly included in the Coimbatore Sessions division. The Collector is, however, invested with the powers of an Additional Sessions Judge, and tries certain classes of sessions cases defined by executive order. Others are committed for trial to the Sessions Court at Coimbatore. The Subordinate Judge, the Treasury Deputy-Collector, and the divisional officer are usually first-class magistrates.\n\nCrime is light outside the two municipal towns. Dacoities and robberies are very rare. Coffee-stealing was formerly prevalent in the Wynaad; but the great decline in the coffee industry, coupled with special police measures, has led to the practical disappearance of this form of crime. On the other hand, the number of offences committed in the larger towns is great, and, judged by the proportion of them to the population, the District is as criminal as any in the Presidency.\n\nThe Nilgiris were included in the settlement of Coimbatore District (of which they then formed part) undertaken by Major McLeod in 1799. The fifteen rates of assessment fixed as the result of that settle-\nment remained in force until 1862, when, owing to the increased demand for land by European planters and others, attention was directed to the evils arising from certain curious customary privileges enjoyed by cultivators on the hills. The first of these was the bhurti (or shifting) system, under which a patta (the document given by Government to occupiers, setting out the land they hold and the assessment payable upon it) was regarded not merely as entitling its holder to cultivate the plot specified therein, but as permitting him to shift from one place to another, and to retain without payment a preferential lien on plots formerly tilled by him, which he could return to and cultivate in rotation. Another concession enjoyed was the aiyan grass or fallow privilege, under which a ryot was permitted to retain a portion of his holding, not exceeding one-fifth, as fallow, on payment of only one-fourth of the ordinary assessment. A third peculiarity was the parava pillu vari, or grazing privilege, which allowed extensive areas to be held as grazing land on a very low assessment.\n\nIn 1862 the Government determined to abolish the bhurti system, and to require the ryot to pay assessment for all the land which he was entitled to cultivate. The fifteen rates of assessment were abolished and five simple rates were substituted. At the same time the Government abolished a peculiar system in vogue in the Kundahs, under which the so-called patta issued to the ryot was no more than a licence to him to use a certain number of ploughs or hoes, and left unstated both the extent and the position of the lands to be cultivated. These changes were followed in 1863 by the introduction of the Waste Land Rules, which not only struck the final blow at the bhurti system, but also disposed once for all of the vexed question of the rights of the Todas over lands on the hills.\n\nThe position of the Todas as the earliest occupants of the plateau had during the first half of the century given rise to a claim on their behalf to lordship over the hills. After much discussion it was decided by the Court of Directors in 1843 that no proprietary right over the soil, such as would interfere with the right of Government, could be admitted. This decision remained in force with certain modifications until the Waste Land Rules were introduced in 1863. The principle was then enunciated, that all lands are waste in which no rights of private proprietorship or exclusive occupancy exist. The Todas were, however, secured from interference in the enjoyment of their mand, the collections of curious wagon-roofed huts in which they reside, and 11 acres of land were set apart round each mand for the grazing of their cattle. The amount was increased to 34 acres in 1863. The land thus set apart is now regarded as the inalienable property of the Toda community.\n\nUnder the Waste Land Rules of 1863, land was sold subject to an\nassessment of Rs. 2 per acre for forest and R. 1 per acre for grass land. The assessment on grass land was subsequently reduced to 8 annas; and the rules have been further relaxed by the exemption from assessment, for five years after purchase on the plateau and three years in the Wynnaad, of land on which certain special products are to be raised.\n\nA detailed survey was begun in 1878, and in 1881 the settlement of the plateau was undertaken, which was completed in 1884. The four old n\u0101ds, or divisions, were arranged into thirty-six revenue villages, and proper village establishments were organized. No attempt was made to follow the usual method of settlement based on a classification of soils. The assessment was made under special rules adapted to the peculiar circumstances of the country. The average rate of assessment per acre for the whole District, which included house sites in Ootacamund assessed at Rs. 10 per acre and mining land rated at Rs. 5, amounted to nearly 11 annas. The rates varied little from those fixed at the settlements of 1799 and 1862; but the enormous increase discovered by the survey in the occupied area, together with fresh grants made at the settlement, resulted in raising the revenue demand by Rs. 35,000, or 10.4 per cent. The settlement of the Wynnaad was completed separately in 1887. The tenures in this part of the District resemble those in Malabar, the land for the most part being the janmam property of certain large owners, who may cultivate or lease it subject to the payment of the assessment to the Government. Of the twelve villages formed at the settlement out of the three amsams or parishes of Nambalakod, Munan\u0101d, and Cherankod, eight are still held by private janmis; in the remaining four the janmam right has by process of escheat vested mainly in the Government. In the tract of land between the foot of the Sig\u016br gh\u0101t and the Moy\u0101r river, forming the settlement village of Masnigudi, the ordinary ryotw\u0101ri tenure is in force.\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 54     | 1,67   | 1,48   | 1,72   |\n| Total revenue  | 3,63   | 5,96   | 6,24   | 7,69   |\n\nOutside the two municipalities of Ootacamund and Coonoor, local affairs are managed by the District board, composed of sixteen members. Wellington is a military cantonment, under its own cantonment committee. No t\u0101luk boards or Unions have been established. The income of the District board in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,73,000. Of this, about Rs. 1,19,000 was contributed by Government from Provincial revenues, the receipts derived from the land cess (Rs. 16,000),\neven when added to the large income from tolls (Rs. 34,000), being insufficient to provide for the maintenance of the great length of roads through difficult country which the District possesses. In the same year the maintenance of these cost Rs. 96,000.\n\nFor purposes of police administration the Nilgiris are attached to Coimbatore, and form part of the charge of the Superintendent of police of that District. An Assistant Superintendent stationed at Ootacamund holds immediate charge of the District. The total sanctioned strength of the force is 190 men, distributed among 14 police stations and supervised by 3 inspectors, besides 44 village policemen.\n\nThere are 3 subsidiary jails\u2014at Ootacamund, Coonoor, and Gudalur\u2014which provide accommodation for 65 prisoners. Long-term convicts are sent to the Central jail at Coimbatore.\n\nIn regard to education the Nilgiris stand second among Madras Districts, about 12 per cent. of the inhabitants (17 males and 5 females) being able to read and write, and 5 per cent. of them knowing English. Education is, however, backward in the Gudalur taluk. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1880\u20131 was 1,534; in 1890\u20131, 2,938; in 1900\u20131, 4,520; and in 1903\u20134, 4,636. On March 31, 1904, there were in the District 88 educational institutions of all kinds, of which 84 were classed as public and 4 as private. The former included 16 secondary and 67 primary schools, and one training school, and the number of girls in them was 908. Of the public institutions 2, the male and female branches of the Lawrence Asylum, are controlled by a committee working under Government, 3 are maintained by the municipalities, and 14 by the District board. It is noteworthy that all the secondary schools for boys are English schools, most of them being attached to missionary institutions. The single training school (for masters) is conducted by the Basel Lutheran Mission at Kaity, but is aided by Government. Of the male population of school-going age, 35 per cent. were in the primary stage of instruction, and of the female population of the same age 10 per cent. The corresponding figures for Musalmans were 48 and 24 per cent. respectively. There are 34 schools for Badagas at which 1,078 pupils received instruction in 1903\u20134, 3 schools for Kotas with 53 pupils, and one for Todas with 14 pupils. For Panchamas, or depressed castes, 10 schools are maintained, at which 391 boys and 107 girls were under instruction. The Breeks Memorial school at Ootacamund, instituted in 1874 in memory of the first Commissioner of the Nilgiris, has undergone many vicissitudes and is now managed by the Educational department as a Government school for Europeans and Eurasians. The endowment is vested in the Treasurer of Charitable Endowments. At Coonoor a school was established by Mr. Stanes in 1875 for Europeans and\nEurasians. The Lawrence Asylum at Lovedale is intended as a home and training school for the children of European soldiers who have served in the Madras Presidency. It was started in 1858, with funds contributed as a memorial to Sir Henry Lawrence, and in 1860 its control was transferred to Government. In 1871 the Male Military Orphan Asylum, previously established at Madras, was amalgamated with it, and the combined institution moved into the present buildings at Lovedale. In 1904 the Madras Military Female Orphan Asylum was similarly amalgamated with the girls' branch of the Lawrence Asylum. The Asylum now consists of two branches, male and female, under a head master and a head mistress respectively. In addition to an ordinary elementary education, the pupils receive practical teaching in technical and industrial subjects to qualify them to earn a livelihood when they leave. The income of the institution amounts to about Rs. 1,61,000, of which Rs. 48,000 represents the grant-in-aid from Government, Rs. 59,000 interest on investments, and Rs. 24,000 the profit derived from the Lawrence Asylum Presses at Madras and Ootacamund. The total expenditure on education in the District in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,02,000, of which Rs. 10,500 was met from fees; and Rs. 52,000 of the total was devoted to primary education.\n\nThe medical administration is in charge of the District Medical and Sanitary officer stationed at Coonoor, Ootacamund forming the separate charge of a Civil Surgeon. Besides the hospital at the Lawrence Asylum, which is intended only for the inmates of that institution, four civil hospitals are maintained at Ootacamund, Coonoor, Kotagiri, and Gudalur, and a dispensary at Pykara. There is accommodation in all these buildings for 149 in-patients. In 1903 medical relief was afforded to 36,000 persons (of whom 1,800 were in-patients), and more than 700 operations were performed. The institutions at Ootacamund, Coonoor, and Gudalur contain separate accommodation for Europeans, and at Ootacamund and Gudalur wards for the police are also provided. There is a military hospital at Wellington, with 180 beds. The total expenditure in 1903 was Rs. 52,000, which was met in almost equal shares by grants from Government, Local and municipal funds, and donations and subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the two municipalities. In 1903\u20134 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 42 per 1,000, compared with an average for the Presidency of 30.\n\n[Further particulars of the Nilgiris will be found in the Manual of the District (1880), by H. B. Grigg.]\n\nNilphamari Subdivision.\u2014North-western subdivision of Rangpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 25\u00b0 44' and 26\u00b0 19' N. and 88\u00b0 44' and 89\u00b0 11' E., with an area of 648 square miles. The subdivision, which is bounded on the east by the Tista,\nis a level strip of country, containing large sandy plains alternated with low loam and clay rice lands. The population in 1901 was 461,314, compared with 447,764 in 1891. It contains three towns, Nilph\u0101m\u0101ri (population, 2,396), the head-quarters, Sa\u012bdpur (5,848), an important railway centre, and Dom\u0101r (1,868); and 370 villages. The density is 712 persons per square mile. The subdivision is healthy, and the cultivation of tobacco and sugar-cane is extending.\n\nNilph\u0101m\u0101ri Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Rangpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 25\u00b0 58' N. and 88\u00b0 51' E. Population (1901), 2,396. It is a station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway. The town contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 18 prisoners.\n\nNilv\u0101la.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nNimach.\u2014Town and British cantonment in the Mandasor district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in 24\u00b0 28' N. and 74\u00b0 54' E., on the Ajmer-Khandw\u0101 branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. The total population in 1901 was 21,588, of whom 6,190 resided in the native town and 15,398 in the cantonment. The town stands on a barren basaltic ridge, capped with laterite, 1,613 feet above sea-level, and the cantonment lies close by. The houses of the better classes in the town are all built of limestone, which is quarried in the neighbourhood, and exported in large quantities. Grain, opium, and cotton form the other staple commodities of trade. The pargana offices, a jail, a State post office, a school, and a hospital are located in the town; and the cantonment contains branches of the Canadian Presbyterian, the Rev. Handley Bird's, and Pandit\u0101 R\u0101ma Bai's missions. In 1817 land was taken up to form a standing camp for the British troops engaged in putting down the predatory bands of Pind\u0101ris which were then ravaging the country. The following year further land was acquired and a small fort built; and in 1822 Nimach became the head-quarters of the combined R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Political Charge under Sir David Ochterlony, who was Resident till 1825. The Residency, now used as a club, was built during this period. The surrounding country was included in the tract assigned for the maintenance of the Gwalior Contingent in 1844, but was restored to Sindhia in 1860.\n\nIn 1857 Nimach was the centre of the disturbances in M\u0101lw\u0101. The cantonment was then held by a battery of native horse artillery, the 1st Bengal Cavalry, 72nd Native Infantry, and 7th Infantry, Gwalior Contingent. Signs of unrest appeared early among the men of the Contingent, and on the night of June 3 the troops rose. The Europeans, except one sergeant's wife and her children, fled in safety to J\u0101wad, which they were, however, obliged to vacate soon after. Ultimately the women and children escaped to Udaipur, where they were sheltered by the Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101. The officers returned to Nimach, and\noccupied the fort, assisted by some native troops. The garrison was hard pressed by the pretender Firoz Sh\u0101h from M\u0101ndasor, until it was finally relieved by the M\u0101lw\u0101 Field Force on November 24, 1857. On the constitution of the M\u0101lw\u0101 Agency in 1895, Nimach was selected as the head-quarters of the Political Agent.\n\n**Nim\u0101r District.**\u2014District in the Nerbudda Division of the Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 5'$ and $22^\\circ 25'$ N. and $75^\\circ 57'$ and $77^\\circ 13'$ E., and occupying a strip of mixed hill and plain country at the western extremity of the Narbad\u0101 valley and of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau, abutting on Kh\u0101ndesh and the Central India States. It is bounded on the north by the States of Indore and Dh\u0101r; on the west by Indore and the Kh\u0101ndesh District of Bombay; on the south by Kh\u0101ndesh and the Amraoti and Akola Districts of Ber\u0101r; and on the east by Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d and Bet\u016bl. The present District includes only a small portion of the old historic division of Pr\u0101nt Nim\u0101r, which comprised the whole Narbad\u0101 valley from the Ganj\u0101l river on the east to the Hirap\u0101l or \u2018deer\u2019s leap\u2019 on the west, in both of which places the Vindhyan and S\u0101tpur\u0101 ranges run down to the river. The name is considered to be derived from *n\u012bm*, \u2018half,\u2019 as Nim\u0101r was supposed to be half-way down the course of the Narbad\u0101; but in reality the District is much nearer to the mouth than to the source of the river. It may be broadly described as comprising a portion of the Narbad\u0101 valley in the north and of the T\u0101pti valley in the south, divided by the S\u0101tpur\u0101 ranges crossing the District from west to east. The Narbad\u0101 forms the northern boundary of the District for most of its length, but the two forest tracts of Ch\u0101ndgarh and Sel\u0101ni lie north of the river. The bed of the Narbad\u0101 during the first part of its course in the District is hemmed in by high cliffs of basalt to the north and a network of ravines to the south. At Pun\u0101sa it passes over a fall of about 40 feet in height, and 12 miles below this lies the sacred island of M\u0101ndh\u0101ta, where the hills open out and an alluvial basin commences. About 25 miles south of the Narbad\u0101 a low range of foot-hills, commencing on the western border of the Khandw\u0101 tahsil, traverses the District diagonally until it abuts on the river in the extreme north-east. The country lying between this range and the Narbad\u0101 is broken and uneven, and covered with forest over considerable areas. South of it lies the most fertile area of the District, comprised in the valleys of the Abn\u0101 and Sukt\u0101 rivers. Both of these have an easterly course, and are tributaries of the Chhot\u0101 Taw\u0101, which flows from south to north to join the Narbad\u0101. This part of the District is open, and contains no forest or hill of any size; but the surface is undulating, and small valleys with a central stream fringed by palms, *mahu\u0101* (*Bassia latifolia*), and mango-trees, alternate with broad ridges, some comparatively fertile, others bare and stony. To the south the\nmain range of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s crosses the District with a width of only about 11 miles and a generally low elevation, from which a few peaks, including that of As\u012brgarh, rise conspicuously. Between this range and another to the south the T\u0101pti has forced a passage, and after passing through a cleft in the hills emerges into two open basins separated by the isolated hill of Samardeo. The upper of these, though fertile, is almost uncultivated; but in the lower, in a small plain of deep alluvial deposit, stands the town of Burh\u0101npur. South of the T\u0101pti rises a higher ridge forming the southern face of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, and separating Nim\u0101r from the Ber\u0101r plain. These hills are the highest in the District, and one or two of the peaks rise to over 3,000 feet. The Khandw\u0101 plain has an elevation of about 1,000 feet above the sea, and that of Burh\u0101npur about 850 feet.\n\nThroughout the District, except in a few spots near the Narbad\u0101, the geological formation is the trap rock of the Deccan, which here appears to be of enormous thickness. Near the Narbad\u0101, sandstones, limestones, and other strata appear in places, but generally the trap is everywhere the surface rock. In the neighbourhood of the Narbad\u0101 it sometimes assumes the form of columnar basalt, forming regular polygonal pillars.\n\nWhere not under cultivation, the ridges and hills are covered with jungle\u2014sometimes a uniform thin forest of salai (Boswellia serrata), with little grass and undergrowth; at other times of a general character, the principal species being teak, s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), and anjan (Hardwickia binata). This last is the commonest tree in the District. Bastard date-palms are numerous in the open country. A number of grasses occur, the most important from a commercial point of view being r\u016bsa or tik\u0101ri (Andropogon Schoenanthus), from which a valuable oil is obtained.\n\nTigers and leopards are found. S\u0101mbar, spotted deer, and gazelle are fairly numerous. A few bison are found in the forests north of the Narbad\u0101 and the T\u0101pti valley, but they are not permitted to be shot. Numerous herds of wild dogs are very destructive to the game. Of game-birds, peafowl, quail, painted partridge, and sand-grouse are the chief.\n\nThe climate is healthy; and although the heat is severe during the summer months, the light rainfall and cool winds make the monsoon season pleasant.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 32 inches, and, though the lightest in the Province, is excellently adapted to the rains crops of millet and cotton which are principally grown in the District.\n\nSituated on the main route between Hindust\u0101n and the Deccan, and containing the fortress of As\u012brgarh which commands the passage of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, Nim\u0101r has been at several periods of history the\ntheatre of important events. In early times the country is believed to have been held by the Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jputs, from whom the present R\u0101n\u0101 of Piplo\u1e0da claims descent. In 1295 Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn, returning from his bold raid into the Deccan, took As\u012brgarh, and put all the Chauh\u0101ns to the sword, except one boy.\n\nNorthern Nim\u0101r about this time came into the possession of a ruler belonging to the Bhil\u0101la tribe, who are believed to be a mixed race of R\u0101jputs and Bhils. The chiefs of M\u0101ndh\u0101\u1e6da, Bh\u0101mgarh, and Sel\u0101ni trace their descent from the Bhil\u0101la rulers. About 1387 it became subject to the Mu\u1e25ammadan Sult\u0101ns of M\u0101lw\u0101, whose capital was at M\u0101ndu on the crest of the Vindhyan range. In 1399 N\u0101sir Kh\u0101n F\u0101r\u016bki, succeeding his father, who had obtained a grant of southern Nim\u0101r from the Delhi emperor, assumed independence, and established the F\u0101r\u016bki dynasty of Kh\u0101ndesh. He captured As\u012brgarh, and founded the cities of Burh\u0101npur and Zain\u0101b\u0101d on the opposite banks of the T\u0101pti in honour of two Shaikhs. The F\u0101r\u016bki dynasty held Kh\u0101ndesh with their capital at Burh\u0101npur for eleven generations until 1600, in which year both Nim\u0101r and Kh\u0101ndesh were annexed by the emperor Akbar, who captured As\u012brgarh by blockade from Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, the last of the F\u0101r\u016bkis. Northern Nim\u0101r was attached to the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101, and the southern portion to that of Kh\u0101ndesh. Prince D\u0101ny\u0101l was made governor of the Deccan with his capital at Burh\u0101npur, where he drank himself to death in 1605. Akbar and his successors did much to improve the District, which became a place of the first importance, the city of Burh\u0101npur attaining the height of its prosperity during the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. In 1670 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s first invaded Kh\u0101ndesh, and plundered the country up to the gates of Burh\u0101npur, the city itself being sacked by them some years afterwards, immediately on the departure of the unwieldy army which Aurangzeb led to the conquest of the Deccan. After the assumption of the government of the Deccan by the Niz\u0101m Asaf J\u0101h in 1720, Nim\u0101r was the scene of frequent conflicts between his troops and those of the Peshw\u0101, until it was ceded to the latter by different treaties between 1740 and 1760. It was subsequently transferred, with the exception of the parganas of K\u0101n\u0101pur and Beri\u0101 in the south of the District, to Sindhia and Holkar.\n\nThe curious and very inconvenient interlacing of the boundaries with those of Holkar's territory in this tract is a relic of the diplomacy of the Peshw\u0101, who retained in his own possession certain villages which would give him control of the fords over the Narbad\u0101. From 1800 until the close of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 and Pind\u0101ri Wars in 1818, Nim\u0101r was subjected to an unceasing round of invasion and plunder, still known as 'the time of trouble,' the traces of which are even now visible in the deserted state of fertile tracts once thickly populated. It was plundered impartially by the invading troops of Holkar and those which Sindhia\ngathered to protect it, while the Pind\u0101ris may be said to have been at home in Nim\u0101r, their chief camps being located in the dense wilds of Handi\u0101 between the Narbad\u0101 and the Vindhyan range. In 1818 the Pind\u0101ris were dispersed by the British troops, their leader Ch\u012btu being killed by a tiger in his jungle refuge. The parganas of K\u0101n\u0101pur and Ber\u012b\u0101 had been ceded by the Peshw\u0101 in 1817, and the north of the District came under British management by the treaty with Sindhia of 1823. In 1860 these tracts, as well as the Zain\u0101b\u0101d and Manjrod parganas, with Burh\u0101npur, were ceded by Sindhia in full sovereignty. In 1864 Nim\u0101r was attached to the Central Provinces; and the District headquarters, which had previously been at Mandleshwar, were removed to Khandw\u0101 as offering a more central position for the new District. During the Mutiny, Asirgarh and Burh\u0101npur were garrisoned by a detachment of the Gwalior Contingent who were disaffected. The District officer, Major Keatinge, collected a local force and held a pass on the southern road, until a detachment of Bombay infantry came up and disarmed the Gwalior troops. In 1858 T\u0101nti\u0101 Top\u012b traversed the District with a numerous body of starving followers. Considerable plundering occurred, and several police stations and public buildings, including those at Khandw\u0101, were burnt; but the people remained unaffected.\n\nKhandw\u0101 was formerly a centre of the Jain community, and many finely-carved pieces of stone-work taken from Jain temples may be seen in the houses and buildings of the town. At Burh\u0101npur are two mosques erected in the sixteenth century, one of which is a fine building decorated with stone carvings. M\u0101ndh\u0101ta is well-known as containing one of the twelve most celebrated lingams of Siva, and a number of temples have been constructed there at different periods.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations has been as follows: (1881) 252,937; (1891) 285,944; and (1901) 327,935. Substantial increases of 13 and 14 per cent., respectively, have occurred in the last two decades, the fortunes of Nim\u0101r between 1891 and 1901 having differed materially from those of the rest of the Province. There has been considerable immigration during the last few years from Central India, Ber\u0101r, and Bombay. The District contains two towns, Khandw\u0101, the headquarters, and Burh\u0101npur; and 922 inhabited villages. The density of population is only 77 persons per square mile, or 65 if the towns are excluded. Large areas of the District are uncultivable, while others, once populated, have never recovered from the havoc wrought at the\n\n---\n\n1 In 1904, 38 villages with an area of 51 square miles and a population of 2,580 persons, together with 293 square miles of Government forest, were transferred from Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District to the Hars\u016bd taluk. The corrected totals of area and population are 4,273 square miles and 329,615 persons.\nThe figures for religion show that 86 per cent. of the population are Hindus, 10 per cent. Muhammadans, and nearly 3 per cent. Animists. The proportion of Muhammadans is larger in Nim\u0101r than in any other District in the Province. Many of the aboriginal Bhils nominally profess this religion, while there is a large settlement of poor Muhammadans in Burh\u0101npur. The languages of Nim\u0101r are very diverse. A special local speech, Nim\u0101r\u012b, akin to the M\u0101lwi dialect of R\u0101jput\u0101na, but influenced by Mar\u0101th\u012b, is spoken by the majority of the rural inhabitants of the north of the District. The Bhils have a dialect of mixed Hind\u012b and Gujar\u0101t\u012b. About 14 per cent. of the population, principally in the Burh\u0101npur tahsil, speak the Kh\u0101ndesh dialect of Mar\u0101th\u012b, and 14,000 Muhammadans, or 4 per cent. of the population, speak Urd\u016b, while more than half of the Kork\u016bs have retained their own language.\n\nThe population, as is shown by the varieties of speech, has been recruited from different sources. There is a strong Mar\u0101th\u0101 element in the Burh\u0101npur tahsil, which was formerly part of Kh\u0101ndesh. The hills are inhabited by the Bhils of Central India and the Kork\u016bs of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, while R\u0101jputs, Muhammadans, and G\u016bjars from Northern India have colonized the Khandw\u0101 plain. The principal landholding castes are R\u0101jputs (28,000), Br\u0101hmans (15,000), Bani\u0101s (10,000), Kunbis (27,000), and G\u016bjars (20,000). The R\u0101jputs of Nim\u0101r are for the most part of very impure blood, and are locally designated as choti-tur, which has this signification. The Br\u0101hmans belong to two local subdivisions, called N\u0101gar and N\u0101ramdeo. The latter derive their name from living on the Narbad\u0101 river, while the former are village priests, accountants, landlords, and schoolmasters. The best cultivating castes are the G\u016bjars and Kunbis. The former especially constitute an industrious class of peasant proprietors, skilled in the irrigation of their fields from shallow wells, by which method they obtain two crops in the year. The Bhil\u0101las (10,000), who are considered to be descended from the Aryan R\u0101jput and the aboriginal Bhil, have already been mentioned. They include a number of old proprietary families, but, except for these,\nare scarcely to be distinguished in appearance from a purely Dravidian tribe, while they bear a very bad character for dishonesty and drunkenness. The same may be said about the Bhils (22,000), who nominally profess Isl\u0101m. In practice they, and more especially their women, retain the primitive beliefs of their forefathers. The Kork\u016bs (31,000) of Nim\u0101r are somewhat more civilized and industrious than their fellow tribesmen of the central S\u0101tpur\u0101s. They occupy chiefly the fertile lands in the otherwise depopulated T\u0101pti valley, are fairly supplied with ploughing and breeding cattle, and raise wheat, gram, and rice by regular tillage. Their villages are built of close bamboo wattle-work, with almost Swiss-like neatness. They habitually carry a small bamboo flute like a pen behind the ear, on which they play when drunk, or when propitiating the village deities. About 67 per cent. of the population of the District are supported by agriculture.\n\nChristians number 1,399, including 1,187 natives. These latter are mainly converts of the Methodist Episcopal and Roman Catholic missions, which have stations at Khandw\u0101. The former supports an orphanage, some schools, and a village in which the children are trained to agriculture. The latter has a Convent school at Khandw\u0101, and several others in the interior, and also owns a village.\n\nThe soil of the District is formed from disintegrated trap rock and is partly alluvial. Along the flat banks of streams it is a rich black mould, from 4 to 10 feet deep, and extremely tenacious of moisture. In ordinary years it produces two crops. Next to this in excellence is the ordinary black soil of the Narbad\u0101 valley, which will produce wheat or other spring crops without irrigation. It is not found over large tracts in Nim\u0101r, owing to the uneven nature of the country; but most villages have a small patch of it, and even the desolate upper T\u0101pti valley contains a considerable area of this class of soil. On the summits of the plateaux and level high-lying ground is found a shallow brown soil resting on gravel, and suited for the rains crops, which do not require large quantities of water. This covers more than half the cultivated area, and bears the staple crops of the District, jow\u0101r and cotton. There is comparatively little inferior soil.\n\nNo less than 330 square miles are held wholly or partially free of revenue, the amount thus assigned being Rs. 60,000. A special grant of a few villages for a term of years has been made to persons who assisted in the capture of the notorious dacoit T\u0101nti\u0101 Bhil. More than 550 square miles are held on ryotw\u0101ri tenure, paying a revenue of Rs. 1,02,000; part of this area is still shown as Government forest and managed by the Forest department. The remaining area is held on the ordinary tenures, 31 per cent. being in the possession of m\u0101lik-makb\u016bzas or plot-proprietors, and 52 per cent. in that of occupancy.\ntenants. The chief statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Khandw\u0101 | 2,046 | 713        | 18        | 313              | 671     |\n| Burh\u0101npur | 1,138 | 241        | 1         | 162              | 737     |\n| Hars\u016bd | 1,089 | 276        | 1         | 342              | 543     |\n| **Total** | **4,273** | **1,230** | **20**    | **817**          | **1,951** |\n\nThe staple crops are cotton and *jow\u0101r*, covering respectively 410 and 264 square miles. Of other crops, wheat occupies 60 square miles, gram 36, rice 12, *til* 153, and pulses 105. Of special crops, there are a few hundred acres under *g\u0101nja* (*Cannabis sativa*), which is grown by licence under the direct supervision of Government, and provides the Province with its supply of this drug; a number of betel-vine gardens are cultivated, and several acres of vineyards formerly existed on the As\u012brgarh hills, but viticulture is now on the decline. The vines produce a fair-sized white grape of a somewhat acid flavour. Pomegranates are also grown in Nim\u0101r.\n\nDuring the last thirty-five years the occupied area has expanded by 50 per cent. There is still room for extension of cultivation, but mainly on poorer soils. The chief feature of recent years has been the increase of cotton; in the neighbourhood of Burh\u0101npur this crop is so profitable that the cultivators do not grow enough *jow\u0101r* for their own food, and it has to be imported from Ber\u0101r. The variety of cotton called Dh\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b was obtained from Ber\u0101r in 1892, and has since largely ousted the local variety previously grown. Loans under the Land Improvement Loans Act amounted to only Rs. 13,000 from 1893 to 1903, but in the following year Rs. 23,000 was advanced. Under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act more than Rs. 80,000 was advanced during the decade ending 1904.\n\nCattle are largely bred in the District, mainly in the hills of the north and south. The Khandw\u0101 bullock is small, with short ears and dewlaps, and generally red or brown in colour, forming a striking contrast to the large white oxen of M\u0101lw\u0101 and Gujar\u0101t. For their size the local breed are powerfully built, and are light, active, and enduring, while they have the strong hoofs which are essential in a stony country. They trot well, and the marriage processions of the G\u016bjars, who prize good cattle, generally terminate in a race on the homeward journey. Buffaloes are bred locally; and well-to-do tenants frequently keep buffalo cows for the sake of their milk, from which *gh\u012b* is manufactured, and also for the manure which they afford. The young bulls are sold in Kh\u0101ndesh, or allowed to die, as they are not used for cultivation.\nGoats are largely kept by Muhammadans for their milk and for food, and sheep also in the Burh\u0101npur tahsil. Their manure is sold, but blankets are not made in any numbers.\n\nAbout 20 square miles are irrigated, of which 3,000 acres are garden crops or orchards, and the remainder the spring crops, wheat, gram, and lentils (mas\u016br). The application of an artificial water-supply to spring crops is a special feature of the agriculture of Nim\u0101r, found nowhere else in the Province. One reason which has been suggested for this is that the surface soil overlies rock or gravel at a slight depth, and is well drained. Nearly the whole of the irrigation is from wells, less than 200 acres being supplied from tanks or streams. There are about 2,500 temporary and nearly 2,000 masonry wells. Unfaced wells cost only about Rs. 60, and last for a number of years before the crumbling of the rock makes it necessary to face them at an expenditure of about Rs. 300. But occasionally the rock is too hard for blasting by indigenous methods.\n\nGovernment forests cover 1,951 square miles, or 46 per cent. of the area of the District. About 1,706 square miles are 'reserved' forest; and the remainder, mainly situated in the T\u0101pti valley, has been assigned for disforestation when required for the extension of cultivation. The best forests are comprised in the Pun\u0101sa and Ch\u0101ndgarh ranges on the banks of the Narbad\u0101, and in the upper T\u0101pti valley, which contain the most valuable teak timber in the District. The S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills, north and south of the T\u0101pti, include the greater part of the remaining forest area, mainly composed of inferior species. The growth on the hill slopes is dense; but elsewhere it is generally sparse, and interspersed with numerous bare patches, the result of former 'shifting' cultivation. The forest revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,50,000, almost the highest in the Province. This favourable result is not due to the excellence of the forests, but to the local demand for fuel and grazing. Fuel is exported to the cotton factories of Ber\u0101r and Kh\u0101ndesh, and also used in the District factories. Timber likewise is largely exported, while in 1903\u20134 nearly 210,000 head of cattle were taken to graze in 'reserved' forest, and the revenue realized from this source was Rs. 46,000.\n\nIron ores exist at Ch\u0101ndgarh, Barwai, and on the Chhot\u0101 Taw\u0101 river, but they are not now worked. There are quarries of limestone near Burh\u0101npur, and of sandstone in various places.\n\nThe hand industries of the District are unimportant, the majority of the non-agricultural population being engaged in transport, commerce, or the working-up of raw cotton. Coarse cotton cloth is woven at Khandw\u0101 and other large villages. Trade and communications. There are silk-weaving and gold and silver lace industries at Burh\u0101npur, and rough glass globes lined with lead for\ndecorating the interiors of houses are also made. In 1904 the District contained 26 cotton-ginning factories and 9 pressing factories. Most of these are at Khandw\u0101; and there are two ginning factories and two presses at L\u0101lb\u0101gh, the station for Burh\u0101npur, and ginning factories at Nim\u0101rkhedi, Jawar, and Pandh\u0101na in the Khandw\u0101 tahsil, and at Ichh\u0101pur, Burh\u0101npur, Sh\u0101hpur, Bah\u0101durpur, and Aim\u0101gird in the Burh\u0101npur tahsil. The proprietors are generally M\u0101rw\u0101ri Bani\u0101s, Muhammadan Bohr\u0101s, or P\u0101rs\u012bs, but a few are Mar\u0101th\u0101 Br\u0101hmans. The large majority of the factories have been opened since 1890, and many new ones have been started within the last few years. The amount of capital invested in them is approximately 13 lakhs, and their output for 1904 was 180,965 cwt. of cotton ginned, and 202,989 cwt. pressed. A combined oil mill, timber factory, and iron foundry has been established at Khandw\u0101, with a capital of Rs. 22,000.\n\nRaw cotton and cotton-seed, til, and jow\u0101r are the principal exports. Most of the jow\u0101r sent from Khandw\u0101 comes from Indore and the adjoining States. Other exports include san-hemp, timber and bamboos, flowers and seed of the mahu\u0101-tree, and ground-nuts. Salt comes from Bombay, and a coarser kind from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, gur or unrefined sugar from Poona and Northern India, and tobacco from Gujar\u0101t. Building and paving stones are obtained from Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. The cotton trade is in the hands of Muhammadan Bh\u0101tias, and that in oilseeds is conducted by a European firm.\n\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway line to Jubbulpore passes through the centre of the District, with a length of 89 miles and 16 stations within its limits. From Khandw\u0101, the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 metre-gauge line branches off to Indore, with a length of 29 miles and 5 stations in Nim\u0101r. There are no metalled roads, except short feeders. The only made road is that from Khandw\u0101 towards Mhow, and this has now been superseded by the railway. The rocky nature of the soil permits of the maintenance of a network of passable tracks in the open country; but the communications with the upper T\u0101pti valley and across the passes to Ber\u0101r are somewhat deficient, and are now being improved by the construction of main roads. The total length of metalled roads is 62 miles, and of unmetalled roads 117 miles. With the exception of 24 miles maintained by the District council, all are in charge of the Public Works department; and the annual expenditure on maintenance is Rs. 56,000. There are avenues of trees on only one or two short lengths of road.\n\nThe first recorded famine in Nim\u0101r was in the year 1803, and was due to a failure of rain combined with the devastation caused by Sindhia\u2019s armies. It is known as the Mah\u0101-k\u0101l, or \u2018great famine,\u2019 and grain sold at 1 lb. per rupee. The fertile and populous tracts of Zain\u0101b\u0101d and Manjrod became\nwholly waste. The next famine occurred in 1845, caused by a failure of the monsoon, which ceased in August. There was much distress: Rs. 70,000 was expended on relief and 3 lakhs of revenue was remitted. The District was only slightly affected in 1897, distress being confined to some villages on the Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d border and to the forest tribes, and the numbers relieved never reached 4,000. In the cotton areas an excellent crop in 1895 had enriched the people. In 1899 the rainfall was extraordinarily deficient, and there was a complete failure of both harvests. The numbers on relief in July, 1900, reached 89,000, or 31 per cent. of the population, and the total expenditure was 18 lakhs. Several roads were constructed or improved, the railway embankment was widened, and forest-clearings were made in the Manjrod tract with a view to the settlement of ryotw\u0101r\u012b villages.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is aided by three Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners. For administrative purposes the District is divided into three tahs\u012bls, each of which has a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r, while an additional naib-tahsild\u0101r is posted to Burh\u0101npur for the Manjrod tract. A Forest officer of the Imperial Service is usually stationed in the District, and the public works are in charge of the Executive Engineer of the Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d division, whose head-quarters are at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town.\n\nThe civil judicial staff consists of a District and a Subordinate Judge, with Munsifs at Khandw\u0101 and Burh\u0101npur, and additional Munsifs have recently been appointed to Khandw\u0101. The Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Nerbudda Division has superior civil and criminal jurisdiction. The tendency of the people to petty litigation is noticeable, but many suits are compromised after being filed in court. Owing to the situation of the District on the main route between Northern and Central India and the Deccan, many professional criminals annually pass through it and commit dacoities, burglaries, and cattle-lifting; but very little serious crime is to be attributed to the resident population. The proximity of several Native States gives rise to a large amount of smuggling of excisable articles.\n\nNim\u0101r is the only District in the Central Provinces in which the regular land revenue system of the Mughal empire was introduced. The assessment was made on separate holdings after measurement. The p\u0101tel or headman of the village received a drawback on the collections, besides various miscellaneous dues, and his office was hereditary; while for groups of villages superintendents designated mandloi were appointed, who managed the revenue accounts and received a proportion as remuneration, their offices being also hereditary. Relations of the p\u0101tel or mandloi, in lieu of succession to the office which passed by primogeniture, obtained holdings of land, and thus a class of hereditary\ncultivators grew up. In the less advanced tracts, the old R\u0101jput or Bhil\u0101la chieftains occupied the position of the mandlo\u012b. Under the Muhammadans Nim\u0101r attained a high degree of prosperity; and although the period of Mar\u0101th\u0101 administration was characterized by reckless extortion and oppression, the framework of the revenue system was not seriously impaired. Owing to changes in the District area, the revenue demand of the earlier settlements cannot be compared with that now existing. The first settlements were effected by officers who were ignorant of local conditions, and made no allowance for the removal of the market for produce furnished by the troops which had previously garrisoned the District. In 1851, after several short-term assessments, an attempt was made to settle the revenue with the body of village cultivators and to confer on them proprietary rights, the hereditary p\u0101tel and headman of the village being reduced to the position of a mere rent collector. This system generally failed, as most of the village communities, having no experience of the system or clear understanding of the proposals made, refused to accept them, and the villages were settled either with the hereditary headmen, with the old superior revenue officials, or with strangers. In certain areas the settlement was not carried out at all owing to the Mutiny. After Nim\u0101r was transferred to the Central Provinces, it was determined, in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the previous settlement, to make a fresh investigation of tenures for the whole District. A new twenty years' settlement was accordingly completed in 1868\u20139 by Captain Forsyth, whose report on Nim\u0101r may be specially mentioned for its excellence. The net revenue was fixed at 1\u00b781 lakhs. The term of the old assessment was, however, allowed to expire, and the new settlement did not come into force until 1875. Proprietary rights were conferred on the headmen; but in view of the fact that in many cases the previous settlement had been made direct with the body of cultivators, many of these received the m\u0101lik-makb\u016bza tenure, or right of ownership in their individual holdings, while an occupancy right was conferred on all other tenants. On the expiry of Captain Forsyth's settlement, the District was reassessed during the years 1895\u20138. The net revenue was raised to 2\u00b789 lakhs, or by 52 per cent., the average revenue incidence per acre being R. o\u20139 (maximum Rs. 1\u20131\u20138, minimum R. o\u20134\u20139), and that of the rental R. o\u201311\u20138 (maximum Rs. 1\u20139\u20134, minimum R. o\u20136). The term of the new settlement is fourteen or fifteen years over most of the District.\n\nThe receipts of land and total revenue for a series of years are shown in the table on the next page, in thousands of rupees. The increase in the land revenue receipts is largely due to the colonization of land by Government.\n\nThe management of local affairs outside municipal areas is entrusted\nto a District council and three local boards, each having jurisdiction over one tahsil. The income of the District council in 1903-4 was Rs. 59,000. The expenditure on education was Rs. 24,000 and on public works Rs. 17,000. Khandw\u0101 and Burh\u0101npur are municipal towns.\n\n|                  | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue     | 1,82   | 1,83   | 4,45   | 4,00   |\n| Total revenue    | 4,93   | 1,87   | 8,44   | 9,59   |\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has a force of 447 officers and men, including a special reserve of 25, and 7 mounted constables, besides 1,383 village watchmen for 924 inhabited towns and villages. Khandw\u0101 contains a District jail, with accommodation for 122 prisoners, including 12 females. The daily average number of prisoners in 1904 was 91.\n\nIn respect of education Nim\u0101r is the leading District of the Province, nearly 6 per cent. of the population (11.2 males and 0.3 females) being able to read and write. The proportion of children under instruction to those of school-going age is 12 per cent. Statistics of the number of pupils are as follows: (1880-1) 3,971; (1890-1) 4,534; (1900-1) 4,828; and (1903-4) 5,599, including 227 girls. The educational institutions comprise a high school at Khandw\u0101, 3 English and 4 vernacular middle schools, and 95 primary schools. There are also 2 primary girls\u2019 schools. The expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 42,000, of which Rs. 32,000 was derived from Provincial and Local funds and Rs. 6,000 from fees.\n\nThe District has 7 dispensaries, with accommodation for 98 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 50,262, of whom 461 were in-patients, and 1,791 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 20,000.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the municipal towns of Khandw\u0101 and Burh\u0101npur. The number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 44 per 1,000 of the District population, a very favourable result.\n\n[J. Forsyth, Settlement Report (1866); C. W. Montgomerie, Settlement Report (1901). A District Gazetteer is being compiled.]\n\nNim\u0101r Zila.\u2014District in the extreme south of Indore State, Central India, lying between 21\u00b0 22' and 22\u00b0 32' N. and 74\u00b0 20' and 76\u00b0 17' E., partly north and partly south of the Narbad\u0101 river, with an area of 3,871 square miles. The population decreased from 299,160 in 1891 to 257,110 in 1901, giving in the latter year a density of 66 persons per square mile. The district contains three towns, Khargon (population, 7,624), the head-quarters, Maheshwar (7,042), and Barw\u0101ha.\n(6,094): and 1,065 villages. The land lying immediately in the valley of the Narbad\u0101 is of high fertility, but the rest of the district is broken up by a succession of forest-covered ridges, which strike out from the S\u0101tpur\u0101s. In the sixteenth century these forests were noted for their herds of elephants.\n\nThe tract in which this district lies has always been important historically. From the earliest days the great routes from the south to the north have traversed it. In the early Buddhist books two routes from the Deccan to Ujjain are mentioned, one passing along the western side of the district and crossing the Narbad\u0101 opposite Mahissat\u012b, the modern Maheshwar, and the other on the west, which crossed at Chikalda and passed up northwards through B\u0101gh in Gwalior State. During the Mughal supremacy also the main route from the Deccan to Agra and Delhi passed along much the same line as the eastern Buddhist route, crossing the river at the ford of Akbarpur, now Khalgh\u0101\u1e6d. The line of this road is still marked by the terminations -sarai ('resthouse') and -chauki ('guardhouse') attached to village names. In the fastnesses of Nim\u0101r the aboriginal tribes who were retreating before the Aryan invaders found a last refuge, their representatives, the Bhils, Gonds, Kols, and Kork\u016bs, being to this day the principal inhabitants of the tract. It includes most of the ancient Pr\u0101nt Nim\u0101r, the country lying along the Narbad\u0101 valley between 70\u00b0 and 77\u00b0 E. In the third century A.D. the northern part was possessed by the Haihayas, who made M\u0101hishmat\u012b (now Maheshwar) their capital. In the ninth century the Param\u0101ras of M\u0101lw\u0101 held the country, and have left numerous traces of their rule in the Jain and other temples, now mostly ruined, which lie scattered throughout the tract, as at Un, Hars\u016bd, Singh\u0101na, and Deola. The Muhammadans under Al\u0101-ud-din first appeared in the thirteenth century, and from that time it became more or less subject to the rule of Delhi. From 1401 it was held by the independent Muhammadan kings of M\u0101ndu (see M\u0101lw\u0101), till it fell to Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h of Gujar\u0101t in 1531 and to Hum\u0101y\u016bn in 1534.\n\nIt passed to Akbar with M\u0101lw\u0101 in 1562, and was included in the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101, to which tract, however, it does not belong topographically, its territories being divided between the three sark\u0101rs of Bij\u0101garh, Hindia, and M\u0101ndu. The greater part of the district lay in the Bij\u0101garh sark\u0101r; while the head-quarters were at the town of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, situated at the foot of the Bij\u0101garh fort, of which the ruins are still standing. The fort was built, it is said, by a Gauli chief, Bij\u0101, of the same tribe as As\u0101 of Asirgarh, in the thirteenth century. Under Aurangzeb, most of Nim\u0101r was included in the S\u016bbah of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. The high state of prosperity reached in those days is proved by the ruins of numerous mosques, palaces, and tombs, now buried in jungle. Towards the end of the seventeenth century the Mar\u0101th\u0101s entered the\ndistrict, ravaging as far as Dharampur\u012b in 1690, but the suzerainty of the Peshw\u0101 was not firmly established over the tract till between 1740 and 1755. Under Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule the district rapidly lost its prosperity, suffering severely from the ravages of the Bhils, whom the harsh measures of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 officials entirely failed to reduce to order. Between 1764 and 1788 the country fell to Holkar, Sindhia, and the Ponw\u0101r of Dh\u0101r, while from 1800 to 1818 it was overrun by the destructive armies of the great Mar\u0101th\u0101 chiefs and the Pind\u0101ri bands.\n\nBy the agreement signed at Gwalior, in 1823, most of Nim\u0101r, which then belonged to Sindhia, was placed under British management to improve its condition. As late as 1855 the country was more than half depopulated, and it was only subsequent to the disturbances of 1857 that it recovered part of its old prosperity. The superior control rested with the Resident at Indore (after 1854 the Agent to the Governor-General in Central India), the immediate charge being entrusted to an officer whose head-quarters were at Mandleshwar. In 1861 the district was ceded in full sovereignty to the British Government, and in 1864 was incorporated in the Central Provinces, but in 1867 was restored to Holkar in exchange for certain lands held by him in the Deccan and elsewhere.\n\nThe district is in charge of a S\u016bbah; and for administrative purposes is divided into eleven parganas, with head-quarters at Barw\u0101ha, Bhi\u1e45gaon, Chikalda, Kasr\u0101wad, Khargon, Law\u0101ni, Maheshwar, Mandleshwar, San\u0101wad, Sendhwa, and Silu, each in charge of an amin. The total revenue is 9.4 lakhs.\n\nNim\u0101war.\u2014Z\u012bla in Indore State, Central India. See Nem\u0101war.\n\nNimbahera District.\u2014A pargana of the State of Tonk, R\u0101jput\u0101na, lying between 24\u00b0 24' and 24\u00b0 49' N. and 74\u00b0 13' and 74\u00b0 54' E., with an area of 383 square miles. It is irregular in shape, and consists of thirteen separate groups of villages, between which are to be found tracts belonging to Udaipur and Gwalior. Roughly speaking, the district is bounded by Gwalior on the east and by Udaipur elsewhere. The south-western part is high table-land; a broken range of hills runs north and south through the centre, and the Chitor hills extend to the north-eastern corner. The population in 1901 was 40,499, compared with 65,013 in 1891. There are 197 villages and one town, Nimbahera (population, 5,446). The principal castes are Mah\u0101jans, Br\u0101hmans, Cham\u0101rs, and J\u0101ts, forming respectively about 9, 7, 6, and 5 per cent. of the total. The district takes its name from its head-quarters, which is said to have been founded by, and named after, a Param\u0101ra R\u0101jput, Nimji, about 1058. Up to the time of R\u0101n\u0101 Ari Singh it formed part of Mew\u0101r. Ahaly\u0101 Bai got possession about 1775, and on her death it passed to T\u016bkaji Holkar, who was succeeded by his son, K\u0101shi Rao. Jaswant Rao Holkar shortly afterwards seized it; and in 1809 he\ngranted it to his comrade in arms, Amir Khan, to whom its possession was guaranteed by the British Government in the treaty of 1817. During the Mutiny some slight opposition to British authority was offered by the local governor, and the Political Agent of Mewar on his own authority allowed the troops of Udaipur to occupy the district; but after the restoration of peace the Maharana was compelled by the British Government to return it to the Nawab of Tonk, and to account for the revenues during the time of his occupation. Of the total area, about 244 square miles, or 64 per cent., are khalsa, paying revenue direct to the State; and the khalsa area available for cultivation is about 200 square miles. Of the latter, nearly 76 square miles, or 38 per cent., were cultivated in 1903-4, the irrigated area being about 11 square miles. Of the cropped area, jowar occupied nearly 29 per cent., maize 14, wheat 13, linseed 11, til 8, cotton 7, and poppy about 6 per cent. There is a great variety in the classes of soil, but the most prevalent is known as dhani, being somewhat lighter in colour and less fertile than the true black soil. The revenue from all sources is about 2.4 lakhs, of which three-fourths is derived from the land. The Rajputana-Malwa Railway (Ajmer-Khandwa section) traverses the eastern part of the district, and there is a station at Nimbahera town.\n\nNimbahera Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the pargana of the same name in the State of Tonk, Rajputana, situated in 24\u00b0 37' N. and 74\u00b0 42' E., on the Ajmer-Khandwa section of the Rajputana-Malwa Railway, 16 miles north-west of Nimach, 134 miles south of Ajmer, and about the same distance south-west of Tonk city. Population (1901), 5,446. The town is surrounded by a rampart with towers, and has a local reputation for the vessels of daily use, such as tumblers, plates, and rose-water sprinklers, made of a mixture of several metals. It possesses a cotton-ginning factory and press, both private concerns, a post and telegraph office, a small jail, an Anglo-veracular school, and a dispensary for out-patients.\n\nNimka-thana.\u2014Head-quarters of the Torawati nizamat and of the Sawai Ramgarh tahsil in the State of Jaipur, Rajputana, situated in 27\u00b0 44' N. and 75\u00b0 47' E., about 56 miles north of Jaipur city. Population (1901), 6,741. A considerable body of the State troops is quartered here. The town contains a vernacular school attended by 36 boys, and a hospital with accommodation for 4 in-patients.\n\nNimkhera.\u2014Bhumiat in the Bhopawar Agency, Central India.\n\nNimrana.\u2014Town in the estate of the same name in the State of Alwar, Rajputana, situated in 28\u00b0 N. and 76\u00b0 23' E., about 33 miles north-by-north-west of Alwar city. It possesses a vernacular school and a hospital with accommodation for 4 in-patients. The population in 1901 was 2,232. The estate, which consists of four detached blocks containing 19 villages, has an area of nearly 29 square miles, and\nis held by a R\u0101j\u0101 of the Chauh\u0101n clan of R\u0101jputs who claims descent from the great Prithwi R\u0101j, the last Hindu king of Delhi. The town of Nimr\u0101na is said to have been founded in 1467 by D\u016bp R\u0101j, from whom the present R\u0101j\u0101, Janak Singh, is the twenty-second in descent. The scattered nature of the estate is due to the fact that the entire territories, which at one time embraced three parganas containing at least 36 villages, were confiscated by Lord Lake in 1803, because the R\u0101j\u0101 gave shelter and assistance to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and were made over to Alwar. Of these only the Nimr\u0101na pargana, with a few isolated villages, was restored in 1815. The R\u0101j\u0101 for many years urged claims to independence of Alwar; but these could not be admitted, as it was clearly proved that the original estate had been granted by Alwar, subject to the payment of Rs. 8,648, being the tribute levied by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. In 1868 it was finally decided that Nimr\u0101na was a fief of Alwar, and should pay to it an annual sum, fixed for terms of thirty years. This sum was to be one-eighth of the land revenue of the whole estate (j\u0101g\u012br, temple lands, and all other alienations included); and for the thirty years ending 1898 it was fixed at Rs. 3,000, while for the next thirty years the tribute has been raised to Rs. 4,300 annually. In addition, nazar\u0101na or succession fee, varying in amount, is payable. Thus if a son or grandson succeeds, the fee is half a year\u2019s revenue, and if a brother, nephew, cousin, or the like succeed, one year\u2019s revenue, tribute being deducted. Again, when a succession follows the last preceding succession within one year, no nazar\u0101na is leviable, and when within two years, one-half of the usual amount is collected. The population of the estate in 1901 was 8,799, more than 40 per cent. being Ahirs. A regular land settlement was made for twenty years in 1898, the total demand being Rs. 33,000 for the kh\u0101lsa and Rs. 5,650 for the muafi area. The normal income of the estate is about Rs. 38,000, and the expenditure Rs. 33,000, and a sum of about 1.4 lakhs is invested in Government securities.\n\n[M. F.

Population (1901), 11,632. The estate, of which this town was the principal place, lapsed to the British Government in 1839 upon the demise of its proprietor. Nip\u0101ni has a large trade, and a crowded weekly market on Thursdays. On market days from two to three thousand cattle are offered for sale. The municipality, established in 1854, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 13,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 13,200. The town contains three schools for boys with 100 pupils, and one for girls with 22.\n\nNiph\u0101d.\u2014Taluka of N\u0101sik District, Bombay, lying between 19\u00b0 55'\nand $20^\\circ 14'$ N. and $73^\\circ 54'$ and $74^\\circ 20'$ E., with an area of 415 square miles. It contains 119 villages, but no town. Niph\u0101d is the headquarters. The population in 1901 was 92,791, compared with 92,368 in 1891. This is the most thickly populated part of the District, with a density of 223 persons per square mile. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2.4 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 19,000. The t\u0101luka is an undulating plain of deep black soil, yielding rich crops of wheat and gram. The climate is good, but the heat in April and May is excessive. The water-supply is sufficient, the chief river being the God\u0101vari. The annual rainfall averages 23 inches.\n\n**Nira Canal.**\u2014A canal on the left bank of the N\u012bra river, Poona District, Bombay, with a total length of 100 miles, commanding 177 square miles in the Purandhar, Bh\u012bmthadi, and Ind\u0101pur t\u0101lukas. The canal, which was constructed in 1885-6, is fed by Lake Whiting. The total capital outlay on the canal was 21 lakhs, and on the canal and reservoir 57 lakhs. The largest area irrigated so far has been 81 square miles. Water rates are charged according to the nature of the crops. The gross assessment of, and expenditure on, the canal has been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n| Year       | Assessment | Expenditure |\n|------------|------------|-------------|\n| 1885-1890 | 13         | 19          |\n| 1890-1900 | 95         | 55          |\n| 1903-4    | 2,34       | 64          |\n\nThe work yields a profit on capital of about 3 per cent.\n\n**Nirgunda.**\u2014Village in the Hosdurga t\u0101luk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, situated in $13^\\circ 47'$ N. and $76^\\circ 11'$ E., 7 miles west of Hosdurga town. Population (1901), 352. It was in ancient times the capital of a 'three hundred' province of the same name, held under the Gangas in the eighth century. It is said to have been founded long before by a king from the north, who named it Nil\u0101vati. During the Hoysala period it was ruled by Ganga princes. In the thirteenth century a merchant restored the temple and also repaired the tank, which had been breached for a very long period, and the king endowed an agrah\u0101ra for Br\u0101hmans. In the sixteenth century the Vijayanagar king seems to have established a bank for the Br\u0101hmans, and it was a place of trade for the Ling\u0101yats. Later on, owing apparently to some epidemic, it was deserted in favour of B\u0101g\u016br.\n\n**Nirmal T\u0101luk.**\u2014T\u0101luk in Adil\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 548 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 45,551, compared with 54,455 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Nirmal (population, 7,751), its head-quarters; and 115 villages, of which 15 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 1.2 lakhs. Rice is extensively grown by tank-irrigation. The God\u0101vari forms the southern boundary of the t\u0101luk,\nwhich is hilly in the north. In 1905 the taluk was altered by the transfer of some villages to Kinwat, and the addition of part of Narsapur. The paigah taluk of Yelgadap, containing 48 villages, lies to the east, with a population of 13,375, and an area of about 119 square miles.\n\nNirmal Town.\u2014Fortified town and head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Adilabad District, Hyderabad State, situated in 19\u00b0 6' N. and 78\u00b0 21' E. Population (1901), 7,751. In 1752 the Raja of Nirmal attacked the Nizam Salabat Jang, who was marching from Aurangabad to Golconda in company with Bussy. In the battle the Raja was slain and his forces were dispersed. The offices of the tahsildar, police inspector, Assistant Conservator of Forests, and the Public Works supervisor are located here, besides a dispensary, a sub-post office, and a school. The town is prettily situated in country broken up by granite boulder hills, most of which in the neighbourhood of the town are crowned by forts. The largest of these stands in the centre of the town and includes the ruins of the old palace. The main fortifications were built by French officers in the Nizam's service, and are still in good preservation, and contain a number of guns. Three towers appear to have been made for boring ordnance.\n\nNirmal Village (or 'The Stainless').\u2014Village in the Bassein taluka of Thana District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 24' N. and 72\u00b0 47' E., 6 miles north of Bassein town. Population (1901), 243. It is one of the most sacred places in the District, having a much venerated lingam, and being, according to tradition, the burying-place of one of the great Sankaracharyas, the apostles of the modern Brahmanic system. Here, on the anniversary of his death Kartik Vadya 11th (November), a large fair is held, which lasts for a week and is attended by about 7,000 pilgrims\u2014Hindus, Musalmans, Christians, and a few Parsis. The principal articles sold are brass and copper vessels, dry plantains, sweet-meats, cloth, and cattle. There are eight temples at Nirmal, all built about 1750 by Shankarji Keshav, Sar-subahdar of Bassein. A yearly grant of Rs. 454 is sanctioned by Government towards the maintenance of a Brahman almshouse (anna-chhatra), and Rs. 48 towards a Bairagi almshouse. The Portuguese pulled down the old temples and destroyed the lingam. The stones which they built into Christian churches were probably taken from these old temples. On the capture of Bassein by the Marathas (1739) Nirmal was purified, prints of the feet of Sri Dattatraya took the place of the lingam, and a reservoir was built. There is a church dedicated to Santa Cruz, which was rebuilt by the parishioners in 1856, at a cost of about Rs. 24,000. In front of a house in the village, about 500 yards north of the chief temple, is a long dressed stone with some letters which seem part of a Sanskrit inscription of the seventh century.\nNirm\u0101li.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nNirmand.\u2014Village in the Kul\u016b subdivision of Kangra District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 6' N. and 77\u00b0 38' E. Population (1901), 1,150. Near it stands an ancient temple dedicated to Parasu R\u0101ma, in which is deposited a copperplate deed of grant in Sanskrit, probably of A.D. 612-3, recording the assignment of the village of Sulisagr\u0101ma by a king Samudrasena to the Br\u0101hmans who studied the Atharva Veda at Nirmanda, a temple dedicated to the god Triparantaka or Siva under the name of Mihiresvara or the Sun-god.\n\n[Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, vol. iii, p. 286.]\n\nNit\u012b.\u2014Pass in Garhw\u0101l District, United Provinces, situated in 30\u00b0 58' N. and 79\u00b0 53' E. The pass is on the watershed between the Sutlej and Ganges basins, at a height of 16,628 feet above sea-level, and gives access to Tibet. A village named Nit\u012b is situated on the bank of the Dhauli river, 13 miles south of the pass, at an elevation of 11,464 feet above the sea. It contains a population (1900) of 267 during the summer months, but is deserted in winter.\n\nNiz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d District.\u2014District in the Medak Gulshan\u0101b\u0101d Division of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, formerly known as Ind\u016br District. It is bounded on the north by N\u0101nder and Adil\u0101b\u0101d; on the east by Karimnagar; on the south by Medak; and on the west by N\u0101nder. Its present area, including j\u0101girs, is about 3,282 square miles. A few minor ranges of hills are found in the east and west. The largest river in the District is the God\u0101vari, which forms its northern boundary, separating it from N\u0101nder and Adil\u0101b\u0101d. The M\u0101njra, the chief tributary of the God\u0101vari, flows along the western border, separating it from N\u0101nder on the west. Smaller streams are the Phul\u0101ng, traversing the Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d and Arm\u016br t\u0101luks, and the Yedlakatta V\u0101g\u016b, a perennial stream in the K\u0101m\u0101reddipet t\u0101luk.\n\nThe most important trees are teak, black-wood, ebony, nall\u0101maddi (Terminalia tomentosa), eppa (Hardwickia binata), bij\u0101s\u0101l (Pterocarpus Marsupium), tarvar (Cassia auriculata), custard-apple, mango, and tamarind.\n\nThe rocks are related to the Archaean and Deccan trap formations, the former occupying a very large area.\n\nTigers, leopards, wolves, bears, and wild hog are common, while s\u0101mbhar, spotted deer, and nilgai are also found.\n\nThe climate is dry and healthy from February to the end of May, but damp and malarious during the rains and the cold season, giving rise to ague and various forms of fever. The temperature ranges between 45\u00b0 in December and 110\u00b0 in May. The annual rainfall averages about 42 inches.\n\nDetails of the population and area before the changes made in 1905, when the District was constituted, have been given under Ind\u016br Dis-\ntrict, the name by which it was formerly known. It now has a population (1901) of 467,367, and in its present form comprises the five taluks of Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, Bodhan, Arm\u016br, K\u0101m\u0101reddipet, and Yell\u0101reddipet, besides a paig\u0101h estate, three samasth\u0101ns, and seven large j\u0101girs. The chief towns are Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d (population, 12,871), the head-quarters of the District, Arm\u016br (9,031), Bodhan (6,438), and Balkonda (5,118). Of the total population, more than 91 per cent. are Hindus, the rest being Musalm\u0101ns. More than 78 per cent. of the people speak Telugu. The land revenue demand is about 14\u00b77 lakhs.\n\nNiz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d Taluk.\u2014Taluk in Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, formerly known as the Ind\u016br taluk, with an area of 550 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 75,483, compared with 74,466 in 1891. The taluk contains 107 villages, of which 38 are j\u0101gir. Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d or Ind\u016br (population, 12,871), the only town, is the head-quarters of the District and taluk. The land revenue in 1901 was 2\u00b75 lakhs. The soils are mostly sandy, and rice is extensively raised by tank irrigation. The God\u0101vari flows in the north of the taluk.\n\nNiz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d Town (or Ind\u016br).\u2014Head-quarters of the District and taluk of the same name in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 18\u00b0 40' N. and 78\u00b0 6' E., on the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway. Population (1901), 12,871. It contains the offices of the First and Third Taluk-d\u0101rs, the District and Irrigation Engineers, and the Police Superintendent, the District court, one school with 324 pupils, a Central jail, a dispensary, and a District post office. The water-supply system, originally a gift from the R\u0101n\u012b of Sirn\u0101palli, is now maintained by the local board. Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d also has a rice-husking factory, cotton-ginning and pressing factories, and an American mission, all situated in the north-eastern quarter, known as Kanteshwar. The fort on a hill to the south-west of the town was originally a temple built by Raghun\u0101th Das, who made the tank which now forms the source of water-supply.\n\nNiz\u0101mat-i-Jan\u016bb.\u2014Southern district of the Bhop\u0101l State, Central India, lying between 22\u00b0 34' and 23\u00b0 17' N. and 77\u00b0 10' and 78\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 2,191 square miles. The district shares in the general conditions common to M\u0101lw\u0101. It is watered by the Narbad\u0101, Betw\u0101, and numerous tributaries of these streams. The whole of this district belonged originally to the Gond chiefs of Garh\u0101-Mandl\u0101, their principal stronghold being Ginnurgarh, which stands on an isolated hill, 38 miles south of Bhop\u0101l city, in 22\u00b0 49' N. and 77\u00b0 36' E. This fort passed into the hands of Dost Mu\u1e25ammad in the eighteenth century. In reward for services rendered to the Gond chief Newal Sh\u0101h, Dost Mu\u1e25ammad received a residence in the fort. At Newal Sh\u0101h's death he constituted himself manager on behalf of the chief's widows, and soon after filled the fort with his own adherents, though the widows\nwere always treated with consideration. The fort was later on used by Waz\u012br Muhammad as a place of retreat when he was driven out of Bhop\u0101l by his enemies. The remains of a large palace belonging to its original Gond owners, a mosque, and some other buildings are still standing. Two interesting Gond forts exist at B\u0101r\u012b and Chauk\u012bgarh.\n\nThe population in 1901 was 198,104, of whom Hindus numbered 135,599, or 68 per cent.; Animists, 51,043, or 26 per cent.; and Musalm\u0101ns, 10,438, or 5 per cent. The district contains 798 villages, and is divided for administrative purposes into eight tahsils, with headquarters at Udaipura, Baroli, B\u0101r\u012b, Behronda, Ch\u0101ndpura, Sh\u0101hganj, Kali\u0101kheri, and Mard\u0101npur, each under a tahsild\u0101r, the whole district being in charge of a Naz\u012bm, whose head-quarters are at KALI\u0100KHER\u012a. The total revenue is 8\u00b71 lakhs.\n\nNiz\u0101mat-i-Maghrib.\u2014Western district of the Bhop\u0101l State, Central India, lying between 22\u00b0 34' and 23\u00b0 17' N. and 76\u00b0 28' and 77\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 1,603 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Gwalior State; on the south by Indore State and the Narbad\u0101 river; on the east by portions of Bhop\u0101l State; and on the west by Gwalior. The Narbad\u0101 and P\u0101rbati rivers both flow through the district. It fell to Dost Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n in 1716; about 1745 it was seized by the Peshw\u0101, but was restored to the Bhop\u0101l State by the British Government in 1818.\n\nThe population in 1901 was 132,042, of whom Hindus numbered 113,042, or 86 per cent.; Musalm\u0101ns, 11,882, or 9 per cent.; and Animists, 5,226, or 4 per cent. The district contains three towns, Sehore (population, 16,864), Ashta (5,534), the head-quarters, and Ichh\u0101war (4,352); and 622 villages. It is in charge of a Naz\u012bm, and is divided for administrative purposes into seven tahsils, with headquarters at Ashta, Ichh\u0101war, Bilkisganj, J\u0101war, Chhip\u0101ner, Sehore, and Siddikganj, each under a tahsild\u0101r. The revenue amounts to 4\u00b77 lakhs. The district is traversed by three metalled roads\u2014Ashta to Sehore, 28 miles; Dodai to Sehore, 42 miles; and Sehore town to the station on the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway.\n\nNiz\u0101mat-i-Mashrik.\u2014Eastern district of the Bhop\u0101l State, Central India, lying between 23\u00b0 1' and 24\u00b0 42' N. and 77\u00b0 41' and 78\u00b0 51' E., with an area of 1,691 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Saugor District of the Central Provinces and the States of Gwalior and Naw\u0101b-B\u0101soda; on the south by portions of Bhop\u0101l and the Narbad\u0101 river, which separates it from the Central Provinces; on the east by the Saugor and Narsinghpur Districts of the Central Provinces; and on the west by Gwalior and portions of Bhop\u0101l. The district is somewhat cut up in its eastern section by outliers of the Vindhyas. It is watered by the Narbad\u0101 and numerous minor streams. The forests are of considerable commercial value.\nThe population in 1901 was 131,370, of whom Hindus numbered 94,953, or 72 per cent.; Animists, 25,923, or 19 per cent.; and Musalmans, 8,800, or 7 per cent. The number of villages is 811, and the revenue is 3.7 lakhs. The district is in charge of a N\u0101zim, whose head-quarters are at RAISEN. It is divided for administrative purposes into ten tahsils, each under a tahsild\u0101r, with head-quarters at Raisen, Bamori, Jaith\u0101ri, Dehgaon, Deori, Silv\u0101ni, Siw\u0101ns, Gairatganj, Garhi, and Piklon. The only metalled road is that from Raisen to Sal\u0101matpur station on the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway.\n\nNiz\u0101mat-i-Shim\u0101l.\u2014Northern district of the Bhop\u0101l State, Central India, lying between 23\u00b0 4' and 23\u00b0 52' N. and 77\u00b0 1' and 77\u00b0 49' E., with an area of 1,417 square miles. The whole district lies in M\u0101lw\u0101, and is watered by the P\u0101rbati, which flows along its western border, and by numerous affluents of that stream and of the Betw\u0101.\n\nSpecial interest attaches to part of this district as the nucleus from which the Bhop\u0101l State was developed. About 1709 Dost Muhammad Kh\u0101n obtained the Berasi\u0101 pargana from the emperor Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h, and on this foundation he and his successors built up the State. In Akbar's time it had formed part of the Raisen sark\u0101r of the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101. In the end of the eighteenth century the Berasi\u0101 pargana was seized by the Mar\u0101th\u0101 chief of Dh\u0101r, and for some time between 1821 and 1835 it was under British management. After the rebellion of 1857 it was confiscated, and in 1860 was assigned to the Bhop\u0101l State as a reward for services rendered during the Mutiny.\n\nThe population in 1901 was 204,445, of whom Hindus numbered 140,047, or 69 per cent., and Musalmans 52,868, or 26 per cent. The niz\u0101mat contains two towns, BHOPL\u0100L CITY (population, 77,023) and BERASI\u0100 (4,276), the head-quarters; and 842 villages. It is divided for administrative purposes into six tahsils, each under a tahsild\u0101r, with head-quarters at Berasi\u0101, Isl\u0101mnagar, Devipura, Diw\u0101nganj, Dur\u0101h\u0101, and N\u0101zir\u0101b\u0101d, the whole being in charge of a N\u0101zim whose head-quarters are at Berasi\u0101. The total revenue is 3.6 lakhs. At Isl\u0101mnagar stands a fort built by Dost Muhammad in 1716, which was his principal stronghold; it was afterwards (1736) greatly strengthened and beautified by Baiji R\u0101m, minister to Naw\u0101b Faiz Mu\u1e25ammad. Sindhia held Isl\u0101mnagar fort from 1806 to 1817, when it was restored to Bhop\u0101l by treaty. At S\u0100NCH\u012a and in its neighbourhood are numerous archaeological remains of great antiquity. The district is traversed by the metalled road from Sehore to Narsinghgarh.\n\nNiz\u0101mpatam.\u2014Seaport in the Ten\u0101li t\u0101luk of Gunt\u016br District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 55' N. and 80\u00b0 41' E. Population (1901), 4,216. During the five years ending 1883\u20134 the value of the imports and exports averaged respectively Rs. 1,12,250 and Rs. 2,56,000, but in 1903\u20134 they had fallen to Rs. 230 and Rs. 5,300. Niz\u0101mpatam was\nthe first port on the east coast of India at which the English began to trade. They landed there in 1611, sent goods on shore, and left two supercargoes, picking them up again on the ship's return from Masulipatam. A factory was established in 1621. The English called it Pettipollee from the neighbouring village of Pedapalle. The place was ceded to the French by the Niz\u0101m as part of the Northern Circ\u0101rs, but was granted to the English by Sal\u0101bat Jang in 1759.\n\nNiz\u0101m's Dominions.\u2014Native State in Southern India. See Hyder\u0101bad State.\n\nNoa Dihing.\u2014River in Lakhimpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Dihing, Noa.\n\nNo\u0101kh\u0101li District.\u2014District in the Chittagong Division of Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $22^\\circ 10'$ and $23^\\circ 18'$ N. and $90^\\circ 40'$ and $91^\\circ 35'$ E., with an area of 1,644 square miles. The District is named from a watercourse called the No\u0101kh\u0101li (or 'new cut'), on the right bank of which Sudh\u0101r\u0101m, the head-quarters, is built. It is bounded on the north by the District of Tippera and the State of Hill Tippera; on the east by Chittagong District and the Sandw\u012bp channel; on the south by the Bay of Bengal; and on the west by the Meghn\u0101 estuary.\n\nThe District consists of a tract of mainland together with a large number of islands in the mouth of the Meghn\u0101, the largest of which are Sandw\u012bp and H\u0101tia. The mainland is an alluvial plain broken only by a hilly tract in the extreme north-east corner, known as Baraiya Dh\u0101la. The plain dips in the centre, forming a depression between the high bank of the Meghn\u0101 and the uplands in the north-east. The great estuary of the Meghn\u0101, here some 7 miles in breadth, sweeps past the western face of the District, beyond which lies Backergunge, and then follows the eastward trend of the coast, separating the mainland from the islands. The H\u0101tia island divides it into two arms, of which the western is called the Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur river, because it separates H\u0101tia from the island of Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur in Backergunge District. As it passes eastward between Siddi island and the mainland, the Meghn\u0101 changes its name to the B\u0101mni. It then turns south between Sandw\u012bp island and the coast of Chittagong, and in this final stage of its career it is called the Sandw\u012bp channel. The approaches of the Meghn\u0101 estuary are rendered dangerous by the bore which rushes up these great arms of the sea at every new and full moon, and especially at the time of the equinox.\n\nThe chief tributaries of the Meghn\u0101 are the Fenny and Little Fenny rivers, which are navigable throughout the year. Both of them rise in Hill Tippera State, and flow in a generally south-westerly direction. The Fenny receives the Muh\u0101r\u012b on its right bank. The D\u0101k\u0101tia river\nformerly found an exit at Raipur, but the bulk of its waters now flow westwards into the Meghn\u0101, at Ch\u0101ndpur in Tippera District.\n\nThe coast-line is moving southwards, built up by deposits of silt from the Meghn\u0101, and H\u0101tia island especially is extending rapidly in this direction. On the other hand, the sea is encroaching on Sandwip island and on some parts of the mainland. Besides the great islands already mentioned, there are Nalchira which adjoins H\u0101tia on the south, Bayley, Jabar, King, Beh\u0101ri, and others. The settlement of the land revenue upon these islands as they gradually emerge from the bay and become cultivable is one of the problems of the administration of the District.\n\nThe surface consists of recent alluvial deposits of clay and sand from the Meghn\u0101 and its tributaries, except in the north-east, where there are hills of the Upper Tertiary formation.\n\nThe extensive groves of betel-nut palm (Areca Catechu) for which the north-west of the District is famous, give a forest-clad appearance to the country. There are numerous creeks and kh\u0101ls; but the great quantity of fresh water brought down by the large rivers renders the conditions unfavourable for salt-marsh species, so that the vegetation characteristic of the Sundarbans is but sparingly represented, and the plant-life of the District is almost exclusively confined to the ordinary field crops and weeds of the lower Gangetic plain. S\u0101l (Shorea robusta), ch\u0101pl\u0101s (Artocarpus Chaplasha), j\u0101rul (Lagerstroemia Flos Reginae), garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus), and gamh\u0101r (Gmelina arborea) grow in the north-eastern uplands; and the coco-nut palm thrives all along the sea-board. There is a small forest on Tun island, which is worked as a \u2018reserve.\u2019\n\nTigers, leopards, and barking-deer are found in the hills in the north-east, where peafowl are also occasionally met with. Crocodiles and pythons are numerous.\n\nThe temperature is moderate; the mean varies from $80^\\circ$ to $83^\\circ$ between May and October, and the mean maximum does not exceed $89^\\circ$. Humidity is very high, never falling below 85 and reaching 89 per cent. of saturation in October. The rainfall is heavy, the annual average being no less than 115 inches. It commences early with 3 inches in March, 4 in April, and 11 in May, while in June, July, and August the average fall is 22, 25, and 25 inches respectively.\n\nThe position of the District renders it especially liable to destructive inundations from the bores at the mouth of the Meghn\u0101 which have already been referred to. It suffered severely from the cyclone of 1876, when H\u0101tia lost more than half and Sandwip nearly half of its inhabitants. This cyclone was followed by a terrible epidemic of cholera, and the mortality from both causes was estimated at 100,000.\nLittle is known of the early history of No\u0101kh\u0101li, but it is supposed that the first Muhammadan settlements were made at the time of the invasion of south-east Bengal by Muhammad Tughril in 1279. In 1353 the country was overrun by Shams-ud-din, governor of Bengal. The island of Sandwip was noticed by European travellers in the sixteenth century as an exceptionally fertile spot. In the seventeenth century the Portuguese played an important part in the affairs of this part of the country. Numerous adventurers and masterless men had entered the service of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Arakan, who, at the end of the sixteenth century, included Chittagong in his dominions. Expelled from Arakan in 1605, they betook themselves to piracy, and succeeded in defeating a Mughal fleet sent against them. In 1609 they seized Sandwip island, and under the leadership of one Gonzales became the terror of the coasts. In 1610 the R\u0101j\u0101 of Arakan joined with the Portuguese in an attempt to take possession of Bengal, but after some successes the allies were routed by the Mughal troops. Gonzales next induced the viceroy at Goa to join him in an attack on Akyab, but the expedition proved a failure, and in 1616 the R\u0101j\u0101 defeated Gonzales and took possession of Sandwip. In 1664 Shaista Kh\u0101n, governor of Bengal, won over the Portuguese by threats and cajolery and transported them to Dacca, where their descendants are still to be found; he thus made the way clear for the capture of Chittagong in 1666. The District passed into the hands of the East India Company in 1765, at which time it and Tippera District were included in the ihtim\u0101m of Jal\u0101lpur. This was in charge of two native officers until 1769, and from that date until 1772 of three English Supervisors. In 1772 a Collector was appointed; but the District was administered from Dacca till 1781, when Tippera and No\u0101kh\u0101li were constituted a single revenue charge known as Bhulu\u0101. In 1787 this charge was added to the collectorship of Mymensingh, but in 1790 it was again separated and the head-quarters were transferred to Tippera. In the latter year a Salt Agent was appointed at Sudh\u0101r\u0101m to superintend the manufacture of salt on the islands, and apparently acted as an assistant of the Collector of Tippera. No\u0101kh\u0101li was first detached from Tippera and constituted a District in 1822, the criminal administration being made over to a Joint-Magistrate and the Salt Agent being vested with the powers of a Collector; the former appears to have also held charge of the Collector\u2019s office from 1832 to 1860, when a regular Collector was appointed. Although the name of No\u0101kh\u0101li was adopted in 1822 as the designation of the Joint-Magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction, the District was in respect of revenue jurisdiction known as Bhulu\u0101 from that year till 1868, when the popular name of No\u0101kh\u0101li was first employed.\n\nOn account of the cyclone of 1876 the population declined from\n840,376 in 1872 to 820,772 in 1881; but it has since been increasing by leaps and bounds, having risen to 1,009,693 in 1891, and to 1,141,728 in 1901. Its Muhammadan inhabitants are prolific, the soil is very fertile, the climate is fairly healthy, and all the conditions are favourable to a rapid growth of population. The large gain of 13\u00b71 per cent. during the last decade was entirely due to natural development, unaided by immigration. The increase has been greatest in the north-west of the District, where the people have benefited by the expansion of jute cultivation. Although the inhabitants are, on the whole, healthy, the water-supply is very inferior, being usually derived from the shallow tanks or ditches from which earth has been taken to raise the plinths of the houses. The general elevation is so low that, except along the banks of certain rivers, all houses have to be built on artificial mounds; each man erects his residence in the middle of his fruit trees and cultivation, and there are few of the crowded village sites so common farther west.\n\nThe principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| No\u0101kh\u0101li    | 1,301               | 1              | 1,955    | 822,891    | 632                       | +14\u00b74                                           | 49,859                                 |\n| Fenny       | 343                 | ...            | 678      | 318,837    | 930                       | +9\u00b77                                            | 11,819                                 |\n| District total | 1,644             | 1              | 2,633    | 1,141,728  | 694                       | +13\u00b71                                           | 61,678                                 |\n\nThe only town is Sudh\u0101r\u0101m, the head-quarters of the District. The language spoken is the corrupt dialect of Bengali known as Chatgaiya from Chittagong. Muhammadans number 866,290, or 76 per cent, of the total, and Hindus 274,474.\n\nNearly all the Muhammadans are Shaikhs, and the majority are probably descendants of local converts to Isl\u0101m. They belong to the puritanical sect of Far\u0101z\u012bs. The Jugis (47,000) are a weaving caste, and the rest of the caste in Eastern Bengal regard the family of Dall\u0101l B\u0101z\u0101r in this District as the head of their race. Next come the fishing and cultivating aboriginal castes of Kaibarttas (38,000) and Chand\u0101ls (27,000). The number of K\u0101yasths (34,000) is swelled by the pretensions of members of lower castes who have got on in the world and now claim to be K\u0101yasths. Most of the Hindu castes in this District have suffered in the estimation of their fellows owing to the outrages perpetrated by the Maghs when they overran the District. This has led in many cases to the formation of sub-castes, known as Maghia, with whom members of the same castes residing elsewhere refuse to eat or intermarry. No less than 78 per cent. of the population are agricul-\ntourists; 8 per cent. live by industry, 2 per cent. belong to the professions, and less than 7 per cent. are general labourers.\n\nRoman Catholic and Baptist missions are at work in No\u0101kh\u0101li, but they have gained very few converts. The number of native Christians in 1901 was only 158.\n\nThe soil is a rich alluvium, annually inundated and fertilized by valuable deposits of silt from the Meghn\u0101 estuary, in which the Ganges and the Brahmaputra river systems converge.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|---------|\n| No\u0101kh\u0101li    | 1,301 | 1,002      | 47               | 5       |\n| Fenny       | 343   | 268        | 14               | ...     |\n| **Total**   | **1,644** | **1,270** | **61**           | **5**   |\n\nNearly 22 per cent. of the cultivated area yields two crops annually. By far the most important product is rice, which occupies 82 per cent. of the total area under cultivation. Three-fourths of it is harvested in the winter and the remainder in the autumn. The winter crop is generally transplanted, but the early rice is sown broadcast. The central th\u0101nas, however\u2014Begamganj, R\u0101mganj, and the east of Lakshmipur\u2014lie so low that transplantation is often impossible, and here the autumn and winter rice are sown broadcast together. Pulses occupy 9 per cent. of the net cropped area, and linseed and other oilseeds 5 per cent. The cultivation of jute is spreading, but in the District as a whole it is not as yet a crop of much importance. Little manuring is practised, as the fertile soil, renovated annually by deposits of silt from the overflowing rivers, bears rich crops year after year without exhaustion; the heavy and regular rainfall also precludes the necessity for irrigation. Every house is surrounded by groves of betelnut and coco-nut palms.\n\nCultivation is gradually extending upon the newly formed islands at the mouth of the Meghn\u0101. Agricultural loans under the Acts are rarely taken, though in 1896, when the crops partially failed, Rs. 23,000 was borrowed.\n\nBuffaloes and cattle are plentiful and find abundant pasturage on the islands, but there is little on the mainland. The cattle are very inferior, and suffer greatly from both rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease.\n\nThe local arts and manufactures are few and unimportant. A little cotton cloth is woven, and coco-nut oil is manufactured; bamboo mats\nand baskets, fishing nets, and agricultural implements are made, but only in sufficient quantities to meet local requirements.\n\nThe principal exports are rice, betel-nuts, coco-nuts, linseed, chillies and onions, hides, and eggs; and the principal imports are European piece-goods, salt, kerosene oil, mustard oil, tobacco, sugar, gur, cotton yarn, brass and bell-metal articles, hill bamboos, china-ware, and betel-leaves. No\u0101kh\u0101li is one of the largest rice-producing Districts in Eastern Bengal, and it has been estimated that a quarter of a million tons are exported every year; the bulk of it finds its way to either Calcutta or Chittagong for shipment oversea.\n\nThe Assam-Bengal Railway traverses the east of the District, and a branch line from L\u0101ksh\u0101m to Sudh\u0101r\u0101m has recently been opened. Excluding 227 miles of village tracks, the District contains 357 miles of roads, of which only 8 are metalled. The Chittagong trunk road to Dacca passes through the east of the District and is maintained as a Provincial work; the other important roads connect Sudh\u0101r\u0101m with Fenny, with Comilla, and with the west of the District. During the rains most of the traffic is by water along artificial channels which follow the principal roads. Bhaw\u0101n\u012bganj and Sudh\u0101r\u0101m are connected with Baris\u0101l by a regular steamer service. Important ferries connect the islands of Sandw\u012bp and H\u0101tia with the mainland, and cross the Fenny and Little Fenny rivers on the Chittagong-Dacca road.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at Sudh\u0101r\u0101m and Fenny. The Magistrate-Collector is assisted by four Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, besides two Sub-Deputy-Collectors at Sudh\u0101r\u0101m, a Deputy-Collector at Fenny, and a Sub-Deputy-Collector at Sandw\u012bp.\n\nFor the disposal of civil work the courts subordinate to the District and Sessions Judge are those of three Munsifs at Sudh\u0101r\u0101m, two each at Lakshmipur and Fenny, and one each at Sandw\u012bp and H\u0101tia, besides that of an additional Munsif for Sandw\u012bp and Lakshmipur. The criminal courts include those of the Sessions Judge, the District Magistrate, and the above-mentioned magistrates. The people are extremely litigious, but violent crime is rare; burglary, theft, arson, cattle-poisoning, and perjury are the commonest offences.\n\nOf the current land revenue demand for 1903-4, which amounted to 6.68 lakhs, 4.61 lakhs was due from 1,544 permanently settled estates, Rs. 59,000 from 49 temporarily settled estates, and 1.48 lakhs from 235 estates managed direct by Government. Of the last, 216 estates paying 1.41 lakhs belong to Government. The temporarily settled and Government estates are situated upon the islands at the mouth of the Meghn\u0101; survey and settlement proceedings are in pro-\ngress in these estates, which are resettled periodically for short terms, generally for fifteen years. The rates of rent here vary from 7 annas to Rs. 2-12-9 per acre, the average being Rs. 2-3-3. Reclaiming tenures are common in the newly formed lands; they are usually of a permanent character and extend to several degrees of subinfeudation. The highest grade of tenure is usually called a t\u0101luk, and below it are the haol\u0101 and shikmi; all these are governed by Regulation VIII of 1819, but not the subordinate tenures, which go by the names of osat-t\u0101luk, nim-haol\u0101, and darshikmi. Part of the estate known as Ch\u0101kla Roshn\u0101b\u0101d, which belongs to the R\u0101j\u0101 of Hill Tippera, lies within the District. In this estate the all-round rate of rent per acre paid by settled and occupancy ryots is Rs. 3-10-4, the incidence on each cultivated acre being Rs. 4-4-8. The average size of each holding is 6\u00b77 acres, of which 5\u00b77 acres are cultivated.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 6,32   | 6,34   | 6,36   | 7,11   |\n| Total revenue  | 10,48  | 11,02  | 12,77  | 13,78  |\n\nOutside the Sudh\u0101r\u0101m municipality, local affairs are managed by the District board, with subdivisional local boards. In 1903-4 the income of the District board was Rs. 1,34,000, of which Rs. 66,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,53,000, including Rs. 74,000 spent on public works and Rs. 42,000 on education.\n\nThe District contains 9 th\u0101nas (or police stations) and 5 outposts. The force under the District Superintendent in 1903 numbered 3 inspectors, 20 sub-inspectors, 22 head constables, and 237 constables; the rural police consisted of 201 daffad\u0101rs and 2,118 chaukid\u0101rs. The District jail at Sudh\u0101r\u0101m has accommodation for 149 prisoners, and a subsidiary jail at Fenny for 23.\n\nNo\u0101kh\u0101li lags behind the neighbouring Districts in education, and only 5\u00b74 per cent. of the population (10\u00b75 males and 0\u00b73 females) were literate in 1901. The total number of pupils rose from 32,855 in 1881-2 to 52,954 in 1892-3. It fell again to 41,485 in 1900-1; but 48,418 boys and 5,218 girls were at school in 1903-4, being respectively 56\u00b77 and 6\u00b71 per cent. of those of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 1,770, consisting of 54 secondary, 1,373 primary, and 343 special schools. The expenditure on education was 1\u00b745 lakhs, of which Rs. 13,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 40,000 from District funds, Rs. 200 from municipal funds, and Rs. 81,000 from fees.\n\nMedical relief has made substantial progress in recent years. In\n1903 the District contained 13 dispensaries, of which 2 with 24 beds had accommodation for in-patients. Treatment was afforded during the year to 149,000 out-patients and 343 in-patients, and 4,000 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 15,000, of which Rs. 2,000 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 9,000 from Local and Rs. 600 from municipal funds, and Rs. 3,000 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is not compulsory except in Sudh\u0101r\u0101m municipality, and there is a good deal of opposition to it. In 1903\u20134 the number of successful vaccinations was 37,000, representing 32.3 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. vi (1876); J. G.

Population (1901), 4,698. The town possesses a fort (now in a dilapidated condition), a post office, a vernacular school attended by 80 boys, and a hospital with accommodation for 7 in-patients. At Gog\u0101no, a village 16 miles to the east, a cattle fair is held in August and September; it is called the Gog\u0101meri fair after Gog\u0101, a Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jput, who became a Musalm\u0101n, and is said to have held sway from H\u0101nsi to the Sutlej in the thirteenth century. The tahs\u012bl contains 170 villages, almost all of which are held on the j\u0101g\u012br tenure by R\u0101jputs of the ruling clan.

The Nonambas or Nolambas were a branch of the Pallavas, the early rulers of the Telugu country and other parts of Madras, and their name appears from the ninth century. The existing Nonabas in Mysore represent the former inhabitants of Nonambav\u0101di.\n\n**Nongkhiao.**\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u0101si Hills, Eastern Bengal and Assam. The population in 1901 was 9,715 and the gross revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,350. It was near Nongkhiao that Lieutenants Bedingfield and Burlton were massacred in 1829 with 50 or 60 natives, an event that led to a struggle with the Kh\u0101sis, which was not terminated till 1833. The principal products of the State are potatoes, rice, millet, and maize. The only manufactures are iron axes and hoes.\n\n**Nonglewai.**\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u0101si Hills, Eastern Bengal and Assam.

See Circ\u0101rs, Northern.\n\nNorthern Division (Bombay).\u2014The most northern Division of the Bombay Presidency proper, lying between $18^\\circ 53'$ and $23^\\circ 37'$ N. and $71^\\circ 19'$ and $74^\\circ 29'$ E., with an area of 13,710 square miles. It comprises the Districts of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Kaira, P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls, Broach, Surat, and Th\u0101na. It is bounded on the north by R\u0101jput\u0101na; on the east by the spurs of the Vindhyas, S\u0101tpur\u0101s, and Western Gh\u0101ts; on the south by the Central Division and the Kol\u0101ba District of the Southern Division; and on the west by K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r and the Arabian Sea. The head-quarters of the Commissioner are in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d city. It has a population of 3,513,532, of whom 786,089 reside in urban areas. The population, which had increased by 9 per cent. between 1881 and 1891, decreased by 10 per cent. during the next decade owing to the famine of 1899-1900. The Division, though the smallest in the Presidency proper, is the most thickly populated (average density 256 persons per square mile). In 1901 Hindus numbered 84 per cent. of the total, Musalm\u0101ns 9 per cent., Jains 2 per cent., and Christians 2 per cent., while other religions included Sikhs (604), Buddhists (27), P\u0101rs\u012bs (22,543), Jews (609), and Animists (58,230).\n\nThe population and revenue of the Division are shown below:\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d    | 3,816                | 795,967          | 16,45                                                  |\n| Kaira        | 1,595                | 716,332          | 22,74                                                  |\n| P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls | 1,656                | 261,020          | 3,54                                                   |\n| Broach       | 1,467                | 291,763          | 23,45                                                  |\n| Surat        | 1,653                | 637,017          | 25,49                                                  |\n| Th\u0101na        | 3,573                | 811,433          | 16,14                                                  |\n| **Total**    | **13,710**           | **3,513,532**    | **1,07,81**                                            |\n\nThe first five of these Districts are in Gujar\u0101t and are very fertile. The Division contains 47 towns and 4,950 villages. The largest towns are Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d (population, 185,889) and Surat (119,306). Other towns with a population over 20,000 are: B\u0101ndra (22,075), Broach (42,896), Godhra (20,915), and Nadi\u0101d (31,435). The chief places of commercial importance are Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Surat, and Broach. The K\u0101nheri Caves in Th\u0101na District and the Musalm\u0101n buildings in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d city are of great archaeological and historic interest. D\u0101kor in Kaira District is an important place of pilgrimage.\n\nUnder the supervision of the Commissioner of the Northern Division are the Political Agencies shown in the following table:\u2014\nNorthern Shan States.\u2014Group of States in Burma. See Shan States, Northern.\n\nNorth-Western Provinces.\u2014Old name of the province of Agra.\n\nNorth-West Frontier Province.\u2014A newly constituted Province lying between 31\u00b0 4' and 36\u00b0 57' N. and 69\u00b0 16' and 74\u00b0 7' E. Its extreme length between these parallels is 408 miles, and its extreme breadth between these meridians 279 miles. The approximate area is 38,665 square miles, of which only 13,193 are British territory, the remainder being occupied by the tribes under the political control of the Agent to the Governor-General. As its name denotes, the Province is situated on the north-west frontier of the Indian Empire. On the north it is shut off from the P\u0101mir by the mountains of the Hindu Kush; on the south it is bounded by Baluchist\u0101n and the Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n District of the Punjab; on the east by the territories of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Kashmir and by the Punjab; on the west by Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n.\n\nThe territory falls into three main geographical divisions: the cisor Indus District of Haz\u0101ra; the comparatively narrow strip between the Indus and the hills constituting the Districts of Pesh\u0101war, Koh\u0101t, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n; and the rugged mountainous regions on the north and west between those Districts and the borders of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n.\n\nHaz\u0101ra District forms a wedge extending north-eastwards far into the Outer Him\u0101layan range, and tapering to a narrow point at the head of the K\u0101g\u0101n valley. The mountain chains which enclose the K\u0101g\u0101n defile sweep southwards into the broader portion of the District, throwing off well-wooded spurs which break up the country into numerous isolated glens. Towards the base of the wedge, on the confines of the Attock District of the Punjab, the hills open out and fertile plains take the place of the terraced hill-sides and forests of the\nnorthern uplands. The tract between the Indus and the hills comprises four minor natural divisions, each of which forms a separate District. The most northern is the Pesh\u0101war valley, a lacustrine basin encircled by hills. To the south of Pesh\u0101war lies Koh\u0101t, a rugged table-land broken by low ranges of hills and separated from Pesh\u0101war by the Jow\u0101ki range. South of Koh\u0101t again is Bannu, in the broad basin of the Kurram river and completely surrounded by low ranges. The District of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n stretches south of Bannu, a vast expanse of barren plain enclosed between the Sulaim\u0101n range on the west and the Indus on the east, and tapering to a blunt point at its southern extremity.\n\nThe regions between these Districts and the Afgh\u0101n frontier are equally varied, but wilder and more rugged in character. The hills are loftier, often rising into ranges of great height, and the intervening valleys are narrower and more inaccessible. On the north, vast territories between the Hindu Kush and the border of Pesh\u0101war District form the Political Agency of Dir, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l. Of these territories, Chitr\u0101l, the most northern, is a region of deep valleys and lofty ranges, for the most part bare and treeless. Farther south lie the thickly wooded hills of Dir and B\u0101jaur, and the fertile valleys of the Panjkora and Sw\u0101t rivers. South-west of this Agency are the Mohmand hills, a rough and rocky tract with little cultivation. Farther south comes the narrow gorge of the Khyber Pass, leading westwards from Jamr\u016bd on the Pesh\u0101war border into Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. South of the pass lies Tir\u0101h, the maze of mountains and valleys held by the Afridi and Orakzai tribes, and bounded on the western extremity of its northern border by the Safed Koh. Farther west this range still forms the border of the Province, and flanks the Kurram valley in the Political Agency of that name. This fertile valley stretches south-eastwards from the great peak of Sikar\u0101m, in which the Safed Koh culminates, and the Peiwar Kotal pass to the western extremity of the M\u012br\u0101nzai valley in Koh\u0101t. South of Kurram lies Waz\u012brist\u0101n, a confused mass of hills, intersected on the north by the Tochi valley and on the south by the gorges that descend to the W\u0101na plain. The hills are for the most part barren and treeless, but on some of the higher ranges, such as Shaw\u0101l and P\u012br Ghal, fine forests are found. The valleys also broaden out into plains, and form fertile and well-irrigated dales. Such are Daur, as the lowlands of the Tochi valley are called, and Kaithu in Northern Waz\u012brist\u0101n, and the W\u0101na plain and the valley below K\u0101niguram in the south. The Waz\u012br hills are divided into two Political Agencies: Northern Waz\u012brist\u0101n, with its head-quarters in the Tochi valley; and Southern Waz\u012brist\u0101n, with its head-quarters at W\u0101na. In the latter Agency the Waz\u012br hills merge into the Sulaim\u0101n range, the highest point of which is the far-famed Takht-i-Sulaim\u0101n in the lower\nShir\u0101ni country, a political dependency of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District. The precipitous Takht presents the grandest scenery on the frontier, and forms an impassable barrier between the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchist\u0101n.\n\nHaz\u0101ra District lies on the east bank of the Indus among the confused mass of mountains formed by the meeting of the Outer and Mid-Him\u0101layan ranges. From this mass the two mountain walls, which enclose K\u0101g\u0101n, run in unbroken lines to where they meet at the Babusar pass (13,589 feet). West of the Indus the mighty range of the Hindu Koh, usually called the Hindu Kush, or Indian Caucasus, runs almost due east and west along the north-eastern and northern frontiers of the Province, and at its north-eastern corner meets a continuation of the Outer Him\u0101layan chain which crosses the Indus above the K\u0101g\u0101n valley. From this chain minor ranges descend in a north-westerly direction, traversing B\u0101jaur and Sw\u0101t, until they meet the curved range of hills which connects the Mid-Him\u0101laya with the Safed Koh and encircles the Pesh\u0101war valley on the north.\n\nFrom the Dor\u0101h pass on the Hindu Kush a long broken line of mountains runs almost due south, dividing the Province from K\u0101f\u012brist\u0101n, and farther south from other parts of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. It is pierced at Arnawai by the Chitr\u0101l river, which runs thence, under the name of the Kunar, parallel with it in Afgh\u0101n territory. Thus the Hindu Kush and the two ranges which run southward from it enclose the Dir, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l Agency, the whole intervening space being filled by the minor ranges which descend from them. The western line is again pierced after its junction with the Kunar by the K\u0101bul river, south of which it merges in the Khyber hills, which form the eastern extremity of the Safed Koh.\n\nThe Safed Koh also runs almost due east and west, forming the watershed between the K\u0101bul and Kurram rivers. Eastwards minor ranges descend from its southern slopes to the Indus. The Sulaim\u0101n range runs up the western border of the Province to meet the Safed Koh, and also throws out a series of parallel spurs to the east. These traverse the whole of Koh\u0101t District. The Sheikh Budin range, the southern extremity of the Salt Range, forms the boundary between Bannu and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and merges eventually in the Sulaim\u0101n range.\n\nWith the exception of the Kunh\u0101r river in Haz\u0101ra, which flows down the K\u0101g\u0101n valley into the Jhelum, the whole territory drains into the Indus. That river divides the Province from Chil\u0101s for some miles, and then enters it north of the Black Mountain. Farther south it separates Haz\u0101ra from the Gad\u016bn territory and Pesh\u0101war, and thence forms the eastern boundary of the Province to its southern extremity, only the Isa Khel tahsil of the Mi\u0101nw\u0101li District of the Punjab lying\non its western bank. Its whole course is to the south with a westerly trend, and it forms the great natural waterway of the Province. Into it flow the mountain streams of Haz\u0101ra, the Unar, Siran, Dor, and Harroh, on the eastern bank; but these are insignificant compared with its western tributaries, of which the chief are the Landai and Kurram. The former joins it at Attock and the latter below Isa Khel.\n\nThe Landai, by which name the K\u0101bul and Sw\u0101t rivers are called below their junction, drains Kohist\u0101n, Sw\u0101t, Dir, Chitr\u0101l, T\u012br\u0101h, and Pesh\u0101war District; but these vast territories have but a small rainfall, and, as much of the water is used for irrigation, it is nowhere a great river. Its principal tributaries are the Chitr\u0101l, which rises in the Hindu Kush; the Sw\u0101t, which rises in the hills north-east of Buner, and after receiving the waters of the Panjkora joins the K\u0101bul river at Nisatta in Pesh\u0101war District; and the B\u0101ra, which drains T\u012br\u0101h and falls into the K\u0101bul east of Pesh\u0101war city.\n\nThe Kurram, rising in Afgh\u0101n territory on the southern slopes of the Safed Koh, passes through the Kurram valley and the lower Waz\u012br hills into Bannu District. Three miles below Lakki it is joined by the Tochi or Gambila, which drains Northern Waz\u012brist\u0101n.\n\nThe geology of the North-West Frontier Province exhibits considerable diversity. The northern portion of Haz\u0101ra and the hills on the north-north-east border of Pesh\u0101war are built up of crystalline, igneous, and metamorphic rocks, comprising chiefly a massive micaceous gneissose granite (sometimes containing schorl and garnets), as bands or sills among thin-bedded mica-schists and phyllites, much entangled with each other, and laid out in parallel flexure waves one behind the other. The axis of the folding of this zone is about north-east to south-west. In Haz\u0101ra a probably younger set of less metamorphosed sedimentary strata borders this zone on the south, consisting of a group of arenaceous and calcareous rocks known as the Tan\u0101wals, which are infra-Trias in part. It seems probable that the granite is older than the Trias and possibly than the infra-Trias. All these formations are somewhat sparsely invaded by a plexus of basic dike rocks (dolerites) of still later age.\n\nThe middle portion of Haz\u0101ra is mainly composed of a very great, highly inclined, and irregularly cleaved slate series, sometimes graphitic, and very occasionally calcareous, in thin bands. It is probably very ancient\u2014certainly older than the infra-Trias, from which it is separated by a striking unconformity. No fossils are known in it, and its base has never been recognized. The series outcrops in a westerly direction to Attock, where it is well exposed in the river section; and from there it continues to form the north half of the Cher\u0101t hills, and parts at least of the Pesh\u0101war valley near Naushahra. The slates and crystalline limestone (marble) near Attock and Naushahra are worked with some\nsuccess for building and ornamental purposes. The prevailing strike direction of the slates is east-north-east to west-south-west. The slate zone is bounded on the south by a sinuous line of faulting with over-thrust, from near the axis of the Cher\u0101t hills to the Jhelum near its junction with the Kunh\u0101r river.\n\nSouth and south-east of the great fault line (as well as in the form of outliers in parts of the slate zone) comes a great set of younger formations, stretching in gentle undulations right through the rest of Haz\u0101ra and Pesh\u0101war, and the whole of Koh\u0101t, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n. These younger formations are mainly higher Mesozoic, Tertiary, and post-Tertiary, but they also include limited outcrops and sub-zones of infra-Trias (Devonian?), Permian, and Trias. With these younger formations begin much irregularity and sinuous winding of the strike, which coincides with the direction of the bare rock ridges, and also with what may most aptly be called the curling crests of the rock waves and undulations. These, by means of devious S-shaped curves, settle down to a north and south strike in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District at the foot of the Sulaim\u0101n range. The curved direction of the crests of the folds expresses the buckling caused by the meeting along this portion of the earth's surface of the Himal\u0101yan, Hindu Kush, and other more western systems of crust movement, setting in from three sides against the old and rigid gneissic rocks of Peninsular India.\n\nThe so-called infra-Trias of Haz\u0101ra\u2014which consists of abasal conglomerate followed by purple sandstones, shales, and 2,000 feet of dolomitic limestone, quite unfossiliferous, and coming beneath the Trias\u2014has only a restricted occurrence near Abbott\u0101b\u0101d at the base of the outliers of younger rocks. Its age may be Devonian\\(^1\\), and it is not known elsewhere. Carboniferous strata are not certainly known in this Province. The Permo-Carboniferous formation exposed in strips along the axes of folds in the Sheikh Budin and Khisor ranges\\(^2\\) consists of a glacial boulder-bed with striated and faceted blocks at the base, followed by 500 feet of magnesian and white limestone with sandstones and earthy beds, containing *Productus*, *Spirifer*, *Bellerophon*, corals, &c. In Haz\u0101ra the Permo-Carboniferous may be represented by a felsite and hematitic breccia, found unconformably overlying the infra-Trias (Devonian?).\n\nThe Sheikh Budin and Khisor ranges also expose a continuous section, without any physical break, up through the Trias, containing *Ceratites*, and corresponding with the Trias of the Salt Range of the Punjab. In Haz\u0101ra the Trias, represented by a massive dark-grey limestone containing *Megalodon* and *Dicerocardium*, and resembling\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lieutenant-General McMahon, *Geological Magazine*, vol. ix, pp. 3\u20138 and 49\u201358, 1902; also vol. x, p. 52, 1903.\n\n\\(^2\\) A. B. Wynne, *Memoirs, Geological Survey of India*, vol. xvii, article 2.\nthat of Kashmir, marks the beginning of a generally continuous zoological sequence upwards through the Jurassics, Cretaceous, and Nummulitics.\n\nThe Sheikh Budin and Khisor Jurassics follow the Trias, and consist of thin-bedded, light buff-coloured limestones, sandstones, and clays, which have been supposed to be connected, palaeontologically, with those of Cutch. Elsewhere, in the Tochi valley and Peshawar and the Sulaiman range, they probably occur, but have not been worked out. In Hazara they have in part a Himalayan facies and embrace black, slightly micaceous Spiti shales (30-100 feet), with ferruginous concretions, containing an abundance of typical upper Jurassic forms, e.g. Oppelia acucincta, Perisphinctes frequens, Belemnites geradi, Inoceramus, Cuculaea, and Pecten.\n\nThe Cretaceous rocks of the southern Districts follow above the doubtful Jurassics, and are represented by the belemnite bed, probably of neoconian age. In Hazara 100 feet of Giumal sandstone, exactly resembling its Himalayan namesake, and coming above the Spiti shales in all sections, is also of the same age; and above it appears a very thin band of orange-coloured limestone, crowded with characteristic fossils of the middle Cretaceous (cenomanian) and equivalent to the Utatir group of Southern India, e.g. Acanthoceras mantelli, A. navicularis, A. rotomagensis, Schlaebachia inflata, together with Anisoceras, Andyloceras, Baculites, Terebratula, Echinoconus, and Micraster. Similar rocks are known from the Samana country.\n\nThe grey, concretionary, and black-hearted hill Nummulitic limestone and its subordinate shaly bands form a thick and solid basement bed for the rest of the Tertiary system, which attains to a very great thickness and importance all round the north-west frontier of India. From 1,000 to 1,500 feet of Nummulitic limestone and shales, followed by 9,000 feet of fresh-water deposits of Murree sandstone and Siwalik sandstones and conglomerates, are bent into long and gentle undulations, and, neglecting the narrow strips of older rocks, cover 90 per cent. of the country to the south of the slate zone and its reversed boundary fault. Near the base of the Nummulitic limestone in Hazara is a variegated sandstone band with coaly matter, the probable equivalent of the Dandot coal of the Salt Range and that of Jammu. As a source of fuel the Hazara band has yet to be proved to be of any great value. In the Kohat salt region the Nummulitics appear in a long series of inliers, forming ridges from east to west, and with marvellously developed masses of rock-salt, gypsum, and red clay or marls as cores to the anticlinal flexures of these ridges.

Wyne, Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xi, pt. ii.\nhas been described as issuing from the Nummulitic sandstones near their base\\(^1\\). The fossils of this great formation still require working out in detail, to bring them into zonal relation with what has been done in Sind and Baluchist\u0101n. While the Nummulitic limestone generally occurs in anticlinal arches and ridges of rock, the Siw\u0101lik series, composed in its lower part of soft grey sandstone and shales, forms lower-lying country flanking the slopes of the hills, and trough-like synclinals in the valleys. Miocene plant remains are known from the Murree sandstones, and mammalian remains have been gathered here and there from the Siw\u0101lik conglomerate, which ranges up to the pliocene in age.\n\nThe post-Tertiary and recent conglomerates, sands, and alluvial clays, sometimes reaching 300 feet in thickness, occupy large areas in the Province, and have grown out of the conditions that caused the Siw\u0101lik series. Nearly all the surface of the flat valleys, bordering the present river-beds, and the talus slopes at the foot of the scarps are composed of them. Evidence of old glacial moraines is found at about 6,000 feet in the Kunh\u0101r valley, and probably at many other intermediate levels in K\u0101g\u0101n between that and the melting-point of the glaciers of to-day.\n\nThe flora of the plains which occupy the south-east of the Province is practically the same as that of the adjoining portion of the Punjab, its main constituent being shrub jungle with a secondary element of trees and herbs. Among the more common plants of this region are: *Flacourtia sapida* and *F. sepiaria*, several species of *Grewia*, *Zizyphus nummularia*, *Acacia Jacquemontii* and *A. leucophloea*, *Alhagi camelorum*, *Crotolaria Burhia*, *Prosopis spicigera*, several species of *Tamarix*, *Nerium odorum*, *Rhazya stricta*, *Calotropis procera*, *Periploca aphylla*, *Tecoma undulata*, *Lycium europaeum*, *Withania coagulans* and *W. somnifera*, *Nannorhops Ritchieana*, *Fagonia*, *Tribulus*, *Peganum Harmala*, *Calligonum polygonoides*, *Polygonum aviculare* and *P. plebeium*, *Rumex vesicarius*, *Crozophora plicata*, species of *Aristida*, *Anthistiria*, *Cenchrus*, and *Pennisetum*.\n\nThe arid and stony hills of Waz\u012brist\u0101n to the west only afford a foothold to a few brave species, like *Peganum Harmala*, *Calotropis*, *Rumex vesicarius*, *Crozophora plicata*, *Capparis aphylla*, &c.\n\nFarther north in the Kurram valley the meagre vegetation consists of such plants as *Acacia modesta*, *Tecoma undulata*, *Sageretia Brandthiana*, *Gymnosporia spinosa*, *Zizyphus vulgaris*, *Withania coagulans*, *Periploca aphylla*, *Nannorhops Ritchieana*, and several species of *Grewia*.

Higher up the Kurram Platanus, Celtis, Ebenus stellata, and walnut appear, while the vegetation characteristic of the Punjab becomes less and less conspicuous. Myrtle is also met with here. At altitudes over 2,000 feet Sophora mollis, Daphne oleoides, and Cotoneaster nummularia become prominent features, and up to about 10,000 feet constitute the greater proportion of the vegetation. Other species becoming more common with the rise in altitude are Convolvulus lanuginosus, Onosma echioides, Salvia Moorcroftiana, Astragalus polyacantha, and Ototestia limbata.\n\nThe plains north of the Kurram support several species of Astragalus, Onobrychis, Othonnopsis intermedia, Stachys parviflora, Gypsophila Stewartii, Thymus Serpyllum, Convolvulus lanuginosus, Isatis tinctoria, Salvia glutinosa and S. rhytidea, as well as those species already mentioned as forming the greater part of the vegetation above 2,000 feet.\n\nOn the Safed Koh range, except on its southern aspect, flourish Quercus Ilex, Cotoneaster bacillaris, Buddleia, Desmodium tiliacefolium, Jasminum officinale and J. revolutum, Lonicera quinquilocularis, Abelia triflora, Viburnum cotinifolium, Rhamnus purpureus and R. dahuricus, Rosa Webbiana and R. moschata, Smilax vaginata, Hedera Helix, Indigofera Gerardiana, Plectranthus rugosus, and Perowskia atriplicifolia. On the southern slopes of the Safed Koh grow Pistacia integerrima and P. cabulica, Rhamnus persicus, Rhus Cotinus, Syringa persica, Caragana brevispina, Morina persica, Daphne, Sophora, and Cotoneaster.\n\nThe vegetation of the Safed Koh above 10,000 feet consists of species of Silene, Primula, Geranium impatiens, Pedicularis, Myrtillus, Lonicera sericea, Isopyrum, Polypodium, Aconitum, and Botrychium. Pinus excelsa and Abies Webbiana grow up to 11,000 feet, beyond which altitude the vegetation is composed of bushes of Salix, Rhododendron, Ribes, Juniperus, Rheum Moorcroftianum, and Polygonum rumicifolium.\n\nNorth of the Kabul river the hills which enclose the Swat, Dir, Chitr\u0101l, and other valleys show a curiously mixed flora. In the lower, confined, and consequently hot valleys such as the Swat and Panjkora flourish quite a number of weeds which one would expect to find only in the plains of India. Among such may be mentioned: Cleome viscosa, Tribulus terrestris, Crotalaria albida, Indigofera pulchella, Aeschynomene indica, Desmodium podocarpum, Luffa echinata, Datura Stramonium, Solanum nigrum, Sesamum indicum, Dicliptera Roxburghiana, Vitex Negundo, Plectranthus rugosus, Anisomeles ovata, Xanthium Strumarium, Sphenoclea zeylanica, Boerhaavia repens, Celosia argentea, Digeria arvensis, and Aerva tomentosa, &c. At higher elevations of about 5,000 to 6,000 feet there are arid tracts resembling the uplands of Baluchist\u0101n and supporting a similar vegetation, mainly composed of such plants as Berberis Lysium, Malcolmia, Iris Stocksii, Capparis spinosa, Silene afghanica, Tamarix gallica, Myricaria ger-\nmanica, Peganum Harmala, Sageretia Brandrethiana, Pistacia, Alhagi camelorum, Sophora mollis, Rosa Beggeriana, Spinacia brahuica, Cotoneaster bacillaris, Myrrhis, Periploca aphylla, Paracaryum asperum, Daphne oleoides, Salix babylonica, Ixolirion montanum, Fritillaria imperialis, and Tulipa chrysantha. At higher altitudes of 6,000 feet and upwards the flora resembles that of Kashmir, with the addition of a sprinkling of Central Asiatic and European species. As typical of these higher altitudes may be mentioned several species of Clematis, Thalictrum, Anemone, Ranunculus, Aquilegia, Delphinium, Actaea spicata, and Paeonia anomala. Corydalis, Arabis, and Sisymbrium are each represented by several species. There are three species of Viola. Silene, Cerastium, Stellaria, Geranium impatiens, Prunus, Spiraea, Rubus, Potentilla, Rosa, Pyrus, Crataegus, Sedum, Epilobium, Bupleurum, Pimpinella, Anthriscus, Sonchus, Viburnum, Galium, Asperula, Valeriana, Campanula, Primula, Androsace, Fraxinus, Gentiana, Veronica, Pedicularis, Origanum, Nepeta, Rheum, Ulmus, Quercus, Juniperus, Abies, Pinus, Allium, Gagea, Juncus, Koeleria, Poa, and Secale are all genera representative of the flora of the higher altitudes. Picea Morinda, Abies Webbiana, and Pinus excelsa form forests at higher levels. The prevailing oak is Quercus Ilex. Ferns, chiefly belonging to the genera Adiantum, Pteris, Asplenium, and Nephrodium, are not uncommon; there are, besides, not a few mosses.\n\nTigers used to be common in the Indus valley, but are now quite extinct in the Province; leopards, hyenas, wolves, jackals, and foxes are the chief carnivora. The black, and occasionally the red or brown, bear is found in Haz\u0101ra, and monkeys are rare except in that District. The hog deer is found in the Indus valley, the gural, musk deer, barking-deer, and ibex in Haz\u0101ra, and the \u2018ravine deer\u2019 (Indian gazelle), m\u0101rkhor, and uri\u0101l in the western hills. Wild hog are found chiefly in the Indus valley.\n\nA large variety of birds, including the Argus and other pheasants and numerous kinds of partridge, are found in Haz\u0101ra. In the rest of the Province the chikor, sis\u012b, grey and black partridge, sand-grouse, quail, the demoiselle crane, lesser bustards, geese, duck, and snipe are the chief game-birds. Bustards, plovers, pigeons, sandpipers, and coots are also found. The eagle and l\u00e4mmergeyer are not uncommon, and there are many varieties of falcons, hawks, and harriers, some of which are tamed for hawking. The passerine tribe includes fly-catchers, orioles, thrushes, mynas, chats, swallows, larks, tits, and finches.\n\nMany varieties of fish are caught in the Indus, the most important\n\n---\n\n1 J. L.

Of snakes, the cobra, karait (Echis carinata), and Russell's viper are found, besides other species.\n\nThe North-West Frontier Province, stretching southward from the B\u0101roghil pass in the Hindu Kush, covers nearly six degrees of latitude. Mainly a mountainous region, but including the Pesh\u0101war valley and the broad riverain tract of the Indus in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District, its climatic conditions are extremely diversified, the latter District being one of the hottest areas in the Indian continent, while over the mountain region to the north the weather is temperate in summer and intensely cold in winter. The air is generally dry, and hence the daily and annual ranges of temperature are frequently very large.\n\nThe Province has two wet seasons: one, the monsoon, when moisture is brought up by the winds from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal; the other in winter, when storms from Mesopotamia, Persia, and the Caspian districts bring widespread rain and snowfall. Both sources of supply are precarious, and not infrequently either the winter or summer rainfall fails almost entirely.\n\nIn Chitr\u0101l, the extreme north of the Province, the rainfall conditions are those of the temperate zone. The summer rainfall at Chitr\u0101l is light, averaging only 4 inches for the six months May to October, out of which nearly 3 inches fall in the first and last months, while for the rest of the year the rainfall averages 13 inches. Farther south, in the neighbourhood of Pesh\u0101war, the amounts received in the two seasons are approximately equal; while in the Him\u0101layan District of Haz\u0101ra and in Koh\u0101t, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n the summer rainfall is distinctly heavier than that of the winter. The area of lightest annual rainfall is the riverain District of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n (9 inches), and the heaviest that of Haz\u0101ra, Abbott\u0101b\u0101d having a total annual fall of 45 inches. In the central parts of the Province (including Pesh\u0101war) the annual fall ranges from 10 to 25 inches, while in the north, at Chitr\u0101l, it is about 17 inches. The winter rains ordinarily fall in the four months January to April, while the summer rainfall, except in Chitr\u0101l, is mainly confined to July and August, the falls in the other months barely averaging half an inch.\n\nDuring the winter months the wind ordinarily blows from a westerly direction and the weather is fine, with cold nights; but at intervals the sky clouds over, the wind changes to the southward, the temperature, particularly at night, rises, and a storm advances from the west. During its passage the wind is high, and rain and snow fall. After the passage of the storm the weather clears rapidly; a north-westerly wind, chilled by its passage over the snow-clad hills, sets in, and the night temperature falls considerably below freezing-point, even at the plains stations of Pesh\u0101war and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, while at the hill stations the frost on these occasions is very severe. These changes occur at\nintervals throughout the winter till the end of March. During April and May strong, hot, westerly winds are experienced, the temperature rises quickly, and though storms of the cold-season type are not unknown during these months, they are now accompanied by lightning and thunder. Towards the end of June the westerly winds die down, the weather becomes close, damp, and steamy, and spasmodic advances of monsoon winds occur, giving occasional heavy downpours of rain, more particularly in Haz\u0101ra District. These conditions last, varying according to the strength and extent of the monsoon current in different years, until the middle of September. After that the weather clears, the temperature falls, and the finest and most settled months in the years are usually October and November, when in most parts of the area there is very little rain. The days are hot; but the mornings, evenings, and nights are cool and pleasant. Hailstorms of great violence are common in the late spring and early autumn.\n\nThe thermometer rises during the hottest part of the year to between $100^\\circ$ and $106^\\circ$ at Cher\u0101t; to between $114^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$ at Pesh\u0101war; to between $115^\\circ$ and $122^\\circ$ at Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n; to between $104^\\circ$ and $108^\\circ$ at Chitr\u0101l; and to between $97^\\circ$ and $100^\\circ$ at P\u0101rachin\u0101r. Slight frost is recorded almost every year in the plains, while intense frost is experienced on the hills. At Chitr\u0101l in 1897 the thermometer fell to $5.4^\\circ$, and the annual range of temperature at that station was close on $100^\\circ$. At P\u0101rachin\u0101r the minimum temperature was $11.8^\\circ$ in 1900, while at Pesh\u0101war and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n it fell to about $28^\\circ$ in 1902, and the annual range at these two stations was about $90^\\circ$. The lowest temperature recorded was minus $13^\\circ$ at W\u0101na in January, 1905.\n\nThe key to the history of the North-West Frontier Province lies in the recognition of the fact that the valley of Pesh\u0101war was always more closely connected politically with Eastern Ir\u0101n (the ancient Ariana and modern Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n) than with India, though in pre-Muhammadan times its population was mainly Indian by race.\n\nHistory. Early history finds the Iranians dominating the whole Indus valley. At some date later than 516 B.C. Darius Hystaspes sent Scylax, a Greek seaman of Karyanda, to explore the course of the river, and subsequently subdued the races dwelling west of the Indus and north of K\u0101bul. Gandh\u0101ra, the modern District of Pesh\u0101war, was incorporated in a Persian satrapy; and the Assakenoi, with the tribes farther north on the Indus, formed a special satrapy, that of the Indians. Both satrapies sent troops for Xerxes' invasion of Greece.\n\nIn the spring of 327 B.C. Alexander the Great crossed the Indian Caucasus (Hindu Kush) and advanced to Nicaea, where he was joined by Omphis, king of Taxila, and other chiefs. Thence he dispatched part of his force through the valley of the K\u0101bul river, while he himself\nadvanced into B\u0101jaur and Sw\u0101t with his light troops. Craterus was ordered to fortify and repeople Arigaion, probably in B\u0101jaur, which its inhabitants had burnt and deserted. Having defeated the Aspasians, from whom he took 40,000 prisoners and 230,000 oxen, Alexander crossed the Gouraios (Panjkora) and entered the territory of the Assakenoi and laid siege to Massaga, which he took by storm. Ora and Bazira (? B\u0101z\u0101r) soon fell. The people of Bazira fled to the rock Aornos, but Alexander made Embolima (? Amb) his basis, and thence attacked the rock, which was captured after a desperate resistance. Meanwhile, Peukelaotis (in Hashtnagar, 17 miles north-west of Pesh\u0101war) had submitted, and Nicanor, a Macedonian, was appointed satrap of the country west of the Indus. Alexander then crossed that river at Ohind or, according to some writers, lower down near Attock. Nicanor was succeeded as satrap by Philippus, who was, however, assassinated by his Greek mercenaries soon after Alexander left India, and Eudamos and Taxiles were then entrusted with the country west of the Indus. After Alexander's death in 323 B.C. Porus obtained possession of the Lower Indus valley, but was treacherously murdered by Eudamos in 317. Eudamos then left India; and with his departure the Macedonian power collapsed, and Sandrocottus (Chandragupta), the founder of the Mauryan dynasty, made himself master of the province. His grandson Asoka made Buddhism the dominant religion in Gandh\u0101ra and in Pakhli, the modern Haz\u0101ra, as the rock-inscriptions at Sh\u0101hb\u0101zgarhi and M\u0101nsehra show.\n\nAfter Asoka's death the Mauryan empire fell to pieces, just as in the west the Seleucid power was waning. The Greek princes of Bactria seized the opportunity for declaring their independence, and Demetrius conquered part of Northern India (c. 190 B.C.). His absence led to a revolt by Eucratides, who seized on Bactria proper and finally defeated Demetrius in his eastern possessions. Eucratides was, however, murdered (c. 156 B.C.), and the country became subject to a number of petty rulers, of whom little is known but the names laboriously gathered from their coins. The Bactrian dynasty was attacked from the west by the Parthians and from the north (about 139 B.C.) by the Sakas, a Central Asian tribe. Local Greek rulers still exercised a feeble and precarious power along the borderland, but the last vestige of Greek dominion was extinguished by the Yueh-chi.\n\nThis race of nomads had driven the Sakas before them from the highlands of Central Asia, and were themselves forced southwards by the Hiung-nu. One section, known as the Kushan, took the lead, and its chief Kadphises I seized vast territories extending south to the K\u0101bul valley. His son Kadphises II conquered North-Western India, which he governed through his generals. His immediate successors were the kings Kanishka, Huvishta, and Vasushka or V\u0101sudeva, of\nwhom the first reigned over a territory which extended as far east as Benares and as far south as M\u0101lw\u0101, comprising also Bactria and the K\u0101bul valley. Their dates are still a matter of dispute, but it is beyond question that they reigned early in the Christian era. To this period may be ascribed the fine statues and bas-reliefs found in Gandh\u0101ra (Pesh\u0101war) and Udy\u0101na (Buner).\n\nUnder Huvishka\u2019s successor, Vasushka, the dominions of the Kushan kings shrank to the Indus valley and the modern Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n; and their dynasty was supplanted by Ki-to-lo, the chief of a Yueh-chi tribe which had remained in Bactria, but was forced to move to the south of the Hindu Kush by the invasion of the Yuan Yuan. The subjects of Ki-to-lo\u2019s successors who ruled in the valley of Pesh\u0101war are known to the Chinese annalists as the Little Yueh-chi. Their rule, however, did not endure, for they were subdued by the Ephthalites (Ye-ta-i-li-to or Ye-tha), who established a vast empire from Chinese Turkist\u0101n to Persia, including the K\u0101bul valley. Known to the Byzantines as the White Huns, they waged war against the Sassanid dynasty of Persia. Under Toram\u0101na and Mihirakula they held Northern India, ruling at Sagala, which may be Si\u0101lkot in the Punjab. Mihirakula penetrated far into India, but about 528 was defeated by a confederacy of Indian princes under Yasodharman, and was driven back to the Punjab and Indus valley.\n\nThere were two distinct streams of Muhammadan invasion towards India. The earlier had resulted in the conquest of Khor\u0101s\u0101n; but, though K\u0101bul had been assailed as early as 655 and made tributary in 683, it regained its independence before 700, and the stream of invasion was deflected towards Mult\u0101n and Sind. Ghazni was only taken in 870; and in 902 we find the Kashmir forces deposing the rebellious ruler of Udabhandapura (Ohind) and giving his kingdom to Toram\u0101na, son of Lalliya, with the title of Komaluka\u2014the Kamalu of Muhammadan historians. In 974 Pir\u012bn, the slave-governor of Ghazni, repulsed a force sent from India to seize that stronghold; and in 977 Sabuktagin, his successor, became virtually independent and founded the dynasty of the Ghaznivids. In 986 he raided the Indian frontier, and in 988 defeated Jaip\u0101l with his allies at Laghm\u0101n, and soon after possessed himself of the country up to the Indus, placing a governor of his own at Pesh\u0101war. Mahm\u016bd, Sabuktagin\u2019s son, having secured the throne of Ghazni, again defeated Jaip\u0101l in his first raid into India (1001), and in a second expedition defeated Anandp\u0101l (1006), both near Pesh\u0101war. He also (1024 and 1025) raided the Afgh\u0101ns, a name that now appears for the first time as that of a people living in the hills between Ghazni and the Sulaim\u0101n range. The present territories of the North-West Frontier Province, excluding Haz\u0101ra, thus formed part of the Ghaznivid empire. In\n1179 Muhammad of Ghor took Peshawar, capturing Lahore from Khusru Malik two years later. After Muhammad was assassinated (1206), his able general, Taj-ud-din Yalduz, established himself at Ghazni, the Kurram valley being his real stronghold, until he was driven into Hindustan by the Khw\u0101rizmis (1215). The latter were in turn overwhelmed by the Mongols in 1221, when Jal\u0101l-ud-din Khw\u0101rizmi, defeated on the Indus by Chingiz Kh\u0101n, retreated into the Sind-S\u0101gar Do\u0101b, leaving Peshawar and other provinces to be ravaged by the Mongols. Yet in 1224 we find Jal\u0101l-ud-din able to appoint Saif-ud-d\u012bn Hasan, the Karlugh, in charge of Ghazni. To this territory Saif-ud-d\u012bn added Karm\u0101n (Kurram) and Bani\u0101n (Bannu), and eventually became independent (1236). In the same year Altamsh set out on an expedition against Bani\u0101n, but was compelled by illness to return to Delhi. After his death Saif-ud-d\u012bn attacked Mult\u0101n, only to be repulsed by the feudatory of Uch, and three years later (1239) the Mongols drove him out of Ghazni and Kurram, but he still held Bani\u0101n. In his third attempt to take Mult\u0101n, he was, however, killed (1249), whereupon his son N\u0101sir-ud-d\u012bn Muhammad became a feudatory of the Mongols, retaining Bani\u0101n. Eleven years later (1260) we find him endeavouring to effect an alliance between his daughter and a son of Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn Balban, and to reconcile the Mongol sovereign with the court of Delhi. By this time the Karlughs had established themselves in the hills.\n\nIn 1398 Tim\u016br set out from Samarkand to invade India. After subduing Kator, now Chitr\u0101l, he made his devastating inroad into the Punjab, returning via Bannu in March, 1399. His expedition established a Mongol overlordship in the province, and he is said to have confirmed his Karlugh regent in the possession of Haz\u0101ra. The descendants of Tim\u016br held the province as a dependency of Kandah\u0101r, and Shaikh Ali Beg, governor of K\u0101bul under Sh\u0101h Rukh, made his power felt even in the Punjab. But with the decay of the Tim\u016brid dynasty their hold on the province relaxed.\n\nMeanwhile the Afgh\u0101ns were rising to power. Implacably hostile to the Mongols, they now appear as a political factor. At the close of the fourteenth century they were firmly established in their present seats south of Koh\u0101t, and in 1451 Bahlol Lodi's accession to the throne of Delhi gave them a dominant position in Northern India. Somewhat later B\u0101bar's uncle, Mirza Ulugh Beg of K\u0101bul, expelled the Khashi (Khakhai) Afgh\u0101ns from his kingdom, and compelled them to move eastwards into Peshawar, Sw\u0101t, and B\u0101jaur. After B\u0101bar had seized K\u0101bul he made his first raid into India in 1505, marching down the Khyber, through Koh\u0101t, Bannu, Isa Khel, and the Deraj\u0101t, returning by the Sakhi Sarwar pass. About 1518 he invaded B\u0101jaur and Sw\u0101t, but was recalled by an attack on Badakhsh\u0101n.\nIn 1519 B\u0101bar's aid was invoked by the Gigi\u0101nis against the Umr Khel Dilaz\u0101ks (both Afgh\u0101n tribes), and his victory at P\u0101n\u012bpat in 1526 gave him control of the province. On his death in 1530 Mirza K\u0101mr\u0101n became a feudatory of K\u0101bul. By his aid the Ghwaria Khel Afgh\u0101ns overthrew the Dilaz\u0101ks who were loyal to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and thus obtained control over Pesh\u0101war; but about 1550 Kh\u0101n Kaj\u016b, at the head of a great confederation of Khashi Afgh\u0101n tribes, defeated the Ghwaria Khel at Shaikh Tap\u016br. Hum\u0101y\u016bn, however, had now overthrown K\u0101mr\u0101n, and in 1552 he entered Pesh\u0101war, which he garrisoned strongly, so that Kh\u0101n Kaj\u016b laid siege to it in vain. Nevertheless the Mughal hold on these territories was weak and often precarious. On Hum\u0101y\u016bn's death in 1556 K\u0101bul became the apanage of Mirza Muhammad Hak\u012bm, Akbar's brother; and in 1564 he was driven back on Pesh\u0101war by the ruler of Badakhsh\u0101n, and had to be reinstated by imperial troops. Driven out of K\u0101bul again two years later, he showed his ingratitude by invading the Punjab; but eventually Akbar forgave him, visited K\u0101bul, and restored his authority. When Mirza Hak\u012bm died (1585), Akbar's R\u0101jput general, Kunwar M\u0101n Singh, occupied Pesh\u0101war and K\u0101bul, where the imperial rule was re-established, M\u0101n Singh becoming governor of the province of K\u0101bul.\n\nIn 1586, however, the Mohmands and others revolted under Jal\u0101la, the Rosh\u0101nia heretic, and invested Pesh\u0101war. M\u0101n Singh, turning to attack them, found the Khyber closed and was repulsed, but subsequently joined Akbar's forces. Meanwhile, the Y\u016bsufzai and Mandaur Afgh\u0101ns had also fallen under the spell of the Rosh\u0101nia heresy; and about 1587 Zain Kh\u0101n, Kokalt\u0101sh, was dispatched into Sw\u0101t and B\u0101jaur to suppress them. The expedition resulted in the disastrous defeat of the Mughals, B\u012brbal, Akbar's favourite, being killed. In 1592 the Afgh\u0101ns invested Pesh\u0101war, but Zain Kh\u0101n relieved the fortress, and in 1593 overran T\u012br\u0101h, Sw\u0101t, and B\u0101jaur. The Rosh\u0101nias, however, were still far from subdued. T\u012br\u0101h was their great stronghold, and about 1620 a large Mughal force met with a severe defeat in attempting to enter that country by the Sampagha pass. Six years later Ihd\u0101d, the Rosh\u0101nia leader, was killed; but Jah\u0101ng\u012br's death in 1627 was the signal for a general Afgh\u0101n revolt, and the Rosh\u0101nias laid siege to Pesh\u0101war in 1630, but distrusting their Afgh\u0101n allies retreated to T\u012br\u0101h. Mughal authority was thus restored, and T\u012br\u0101h was invaded and pacified by the imperial troops in an arduous campaign. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, however, attempted to govern the Afgh\u0101ns despotically and caused great discontent. Nevertheless R\u0101j\u0101 Jagat Singh held Koh\u0101t and Kurram, and thus kept open the communications with K\u0101bul. In 1660 T\u012br\u0101h had to be pacified again; and in 1667 the Y\u016bsufzai and Mandaur Afgh\u0101ns were strong enough to cross the Indus, and were only defeated near Attock. In 1672 Muhammad Am\u012bn\nKh\u0101n, S\u016bbahd\u0101r of K\u0101bul, attempted to force the Khyber, and lost his whole army, 40,000 men, with baggage and mat\u00e9riel. Other disasters followed. At Gand\u0101b in 1673 the Afr\u012bdis defeated a second Mughal army, and in 1674 they defeated a third force at Kh\u0101pash and drove it into B\u0101jaur. These reverses brought Aurangzeb in person to Hasan Abd\u0101l, whence he dispatched a force to Koh\u0101t, while a second army forced the Khyber. Aurangzeb appears to have adopted a conciliatory policy towards the Afgh\u0101ns, some of whom now received fiefs from the emperor. This policy and their internal dissensions kept the country in a state of anarchy, but prevented any concerted Afgh\u0101n rising against the Mughals.\n\nNevertheless the Afgh\u0101ns overran the Pakhli district of Haz\u0101ra early in the eighteenth century and the Mughal power rapidly declined, until in 1738 N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h defeated N\u0101zir Sh\u0101h, the Mughal governor of K\u0101bul, but allowed him as feudatory to retain that province, which included Pesh\u0101war and Ghazni. Of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h\u2019s successors, Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni indeed established something more nearly approaching a settled government in the Pesh\u0101war valley than had been known for years, but with the advent of Tim\u016br Sh\u0101h anarchy returned once more. On the death of Tim\u016br Sh\u0101h his throne was contested with varying fortunes by his sons, whose dissensions gave ample opportunity to the local chieftains throughout the province of establishing complete independence. Pesh\u0101war ultimately fell to the B\u0101rakzai family; Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n to the Sadozais.\n\nThe Sikh invasions began in 1818, and from that date to the annexation by the British the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh were steadily making themselves masters of the country. In 1818 Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n surrendered to a Sikh army, and five years later the Sikhs harried the Marwat plain of Bannu. In 1836 all authority was taken from the Naw\u0101bs of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n and a Sikh Kard\u0101r appointed in their place. But it was not till after the first Sikh War that the fort of Bannu was built and the Bannuchis brought under the direct control of the Lahore Darb\u0101r by Herbert Edwardes. In 1834, two years after the great Sikh victory over the Afgh\u0101ns at Naushahra, the famous general Hari Singh took possession of Pesh\u0101war fort, and at the same time Koh\u0101t and Teri were temporarily occupied by Sikh garrisons. These, however, were speedily withdrawn; and the death of Hari Singh in battle with the Afgh\u0101ns near Jamr\u016bd in 1837 brought home to Ranjit Singh, now nearing the close of his career, the difficulty of administering his frontier acquisitions. On his death the Sikh policy was changed. Turbulent and exposed tracts, like Hashtnagar and Mir\u0101nzai, were made over in j\u0101gir to the local chieftains, who enjoyed an almost complete independence, and a vigorous administration was attempted only in the more easily controlled areas. Of the\nSikh governors, the best remembered is General Avitabile, who was in charge of Pesh\u0101war District from 1838 to 1842.\n\nBy the proclamation of March 29, 1849, the frontier territory was annexed by the British. For a short time the Districts of Pesh\u0101war, Koh\u0101t, and Haz\u0101ra were under the direct control of the Board of Administration at Lahore, but about 1850 they were formed into a regular Division under a Commissioner. Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n and Bannu, under one Deputy-Commissioner, formed part of the Leiah Division till 1861, when two Deputy-Commissioners were appointed and both Districts were included in the Deraj\u0101t Division, an arrangement which was maintained until the formation of the North-West Frontier Province. The internal administration differed in no way from the rest of the Punjab. But to maintain the peace of the border a special force\u2014the Punjab Frontier Force\u2014was raised under the direct orders of the Board. It consisted at first of 5 regiments of cavalry, the corps of Guides, 5 regiments of infantry, 3 light field batteries, 2 garrison batteries, 2 companies of sappers and miners, and the Sind camel corps. Various changes were made in the composition of the force, which at length, in 1886, was removed from the control of the Punjab Government and amalgamated with the regular army.\n\nThe attitude of the people during the Mutiny is the highest tribute that can be paid to the success of the internal administration. In the history of the frontier the interest of that period of stress centred at Pesh\u0101war. The Hindust\u0101ni regiments at Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n and Koh\u0101t were disarmed without difficulty, and troops and levies were hurried away to strengthen the garrison of Pesh\u0101war or join the British forces cis-Indus. The situation in Pesh\u0101war was very different. The District contained a large Hindust\u0101ni force, which proved mutinous to the core. It was thought possible that the Amir of K\u0101bul might pour an army through the Khyber. For one crime or another almost every powerful tribe beyond the border was under a blockade. When the news of the outbreak reached Pesh\u0101war, a council of war was at once held and measures adopted to meet the situation. The same night the Guides started on their memorable march to Delhi. On May 21 the 55th Native Infantry rose at Mard\u0101n. The majority made good their escape across the Indus, only to perish after fearful privations at the hands of the hill-men of the Haz\u0101ra border. On May 22, warned by this example, the authorities of Pesh\u0101war disarmed the 24th, 27th, and 51st Native Infantry, with the result that Path\u0101ns not only of Pesh\u0101war, but also from across the border, came flocking in to join the newly raised levies. The next few months were not without incident, though the crisis was past. When the Mutiny was finally suppressed, it was clear that the frontier Districts had proved to the British Government a source of strength rather than of danger.\nA complete list of all expeditions undertaken against the frontier tribes is given in an appendix. During the nine years between annexation and the outbreak of the Mutiny, on no less than seventeen occasions was the dispatch of troops against the tribesmen necessary. But the operations were simply of importance as being measures required for the establishment of a strong rule and a peaceful border, in countries which had never before known law and order.\n\nOf all the frontier tribes, only a few Y\u016bsufzai villages within the British border took advantage of the difficulties of 1857. They were speedily punished, Narinji, the centre of disturbance, being stormed and razed to the ground. In the next year the misbehaviour of the Khudu Khel, roused by emissaries from the Hindust\u0101ni fanatics, compelled an invasion of their country, from which the fanatical colony was expelled. In 1859\u201360 operations were undertaken in the country of the K\u0101bul Waz\u012brs between Thal and Bannu; and in 1860 the Mahs\u016bd country was overrun, in punishment for a long series of outrages, culminating in an attempt to plunder and burn the border town of T\u0101nk. The tribe, however, did not submit, and after the withdrawal of the troops was put under blockade. Different sections of the tribe, and from 1877 onwards the whole of it, remained under embargo, on account of repeated violations of British territory, almost without intermission, until the next expedition was undertaken in 1881.\n\nIn 1863 took place the Ambela campaign. Repeated robberies in British territory had led to a blockade on the Y\u016bsufzai border, and blockade in turn had caused the denunciation of the infidel and the proclamation of jih\u0101d in all the high places between Sw\u0101t and the Haz\u0101ra border. Sw\u0101t itself was at this time controlled by the famous Akhund, who had had experience of the strength of the Government, and whose inclinations were consequently for peace, especially as a religious rivalry prevailed between him and the head of the fanatical colony. Even in Sw\u0101t, however, intense excitement was rife. The object of the expedition was to root out the colony of Hindust\u0101ni fanatics which since 1858 had been located in the Barandu valley and was recognized as a permanent source of danger and disturbance. The troops gained the crest of the Ambela pass leading to the Chamla valley, and thence advanced to M\u0101lka, when they encountered unexpected opposition from the Bunerw\u0101ls, whose country lies immediately north of Chamla. The Akhund was no longer able to stem the tide, and joined the enemy\u2019s camp, followed by standards from all the tribes of Sw\u0101t, D\u012br, B\u0101jaur, and by contingents from the Utman Khel and the Mohmands, as well as by some British subjects. For more than a month the British force, though raised by successive additions to a strength of more than 9,000 men, could not do more than hold its ground. But\nwith the passage of time the coalition of the enemy began to fall asunder, and on the repulse with heavy slaughter of the last of a long series of attacks the object of the expedition was achieved. The Bunerw\u0101ls agreed to destroy M\u0101lka and drive out the fanatics, and exclude them from their country for ever. From 1863 to 1893 the fanatics wandered to and fro in the Chagarzai, Hasanzai, and Madda Khel (Y\u016bsufzai) country; and since 1893 they have lived mainly in the Amazai territory in Buner, but they have lost most of their political importance. Other operations in this period do not require detailed mention; but the Black Mountain expedition of 1868, in which the British force numbered nearly 15,000 men (including the reserve), was noteworthy, more perhaps from the audacious provocation given, the strength of the force used, and the difficulty of the country traversed, than from the stubbornness of the enemy or the permanence of the results secured.\n\nAn account of the second Afgh\u0101n War will be found in the article on Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. Its importance lay chiefly in the imperial issues involved, but it marks an important stage in the relations of the British with the frontier tribes. By the Treaty of Gandamak (May, 1879) the Amir Yak\u016bb Kh\u0101n renounced his claim to authority over the Khyber and Mohmand passes, the tribes flanking the main routes into India, the Kurram valley as far as the Shutargardan pass, and the districts of Pishin and Sibi in Baluchist\u0101n.\n\nBetween the outbreak of the second Afgh\u0101n War and the Path\u0101n revolt of 1897 there were sixteen expeditions against the frontier tribes. Of these, eight took place before peace was concluded with K\u0101bul, and were in the nature of punishment inflicted on the clans. The expedition of 1881 against the Mahs\u016bds was more noteworthy, and produced comparative peace on this part of the border for five years. Between 1888 and 1892, the Haz\u0101ra border was disturbed almost continuously, and large expeditions were dispatched against the Isazai clans of the Black Mountain, and their neighbours, the cis-Indus Sw\u0101tis, Alatis, and Parari Saiyids. Little resistance was offered to the troops, and the expeditions were completely successful. The first and second M\u012br\u0101nzai expeditions of 1891 were directed against the Orakzai tribes living along the crest of the S\u0101m\u0101na. There was little fighting, but the expedition resulted in the occupation of posts along that range; and, except in 1897, there has been no trouble since then on the Orakzai border.\n\nIn 1894 the deputation of the Commissioner of the Derajat to demarcate the border between Wazirist\u0101n and Afgh\u0101n territory, and the invitation extended by the Ahmadzai of W\u0101na to the Government to occupy their country, led to an attack by the Mahs\u016bds, under the leadership of the Mull\u0101 Powinda, on the Commissioner's escort, in\nthe Wana plain. An expedition followed, which effected the submission of the tribe. Since 1894 W\u0101na has been occupied, and parts of Southern Waz\u012brist\u0101n have been administered by the Political officer in charge. An account of the Chitr\u0101l expedition of 1895 will be found in the article on CHITR\u0100L.\n\nThe summer of 1897 found the border in an inflammable condition. Exaggerated accounts had been circulated of the successes gained by the Turkish armies in their war against Greece, while the growth of a fanatical spirit was fostered by the Mull\u0101s, and by the belief that aid would be forthcoming from K\u0101bul. Apart from these reasons for religious excitement, the operations taken to demarcate the new Durand line, referred to below, and the occupation of the S\u0101m\u0101na range, the Kurram valley, Daur, and W\u0101na, the passage of British troops through various tracts, and administrative grievances, such as the tax on Koh\u0101t salt, added to the discontent of the tribesmen. The prevalent excitement first sprang into flame in Tochi. An unexpected visit from the Political officer, accompanied by an unusually strong escort, on June 10, to the village of Maizar, the inhabitants of which were already in disgrace for the murder of a Hindu, caused the explosion. After being hospitably entertained, the troops were treacherously attacked. All the British military officers were killed or wounded, but the escort, with the Political officer, withdrew in good order to Datta Khel.\n\nThe news spread rapidly and everywhere formed the text of fanatical harangues by Mull\u0101s, and in particular by a Bunerw\u0101l of Upper Sw\u0101t named S\u0101d-ullah, whose eccentricities had earned him the name of the Mull\u0101 Mast\u0101n ('mad'). On July 26, followed only by a few boys, one of whom he proclaimed king of Delhi, he started from Landakai, a village about 6 miles above Chakdarra on the south bank of the Sw\u0101t river. The tribesmen flocked after him, and by evening, with ever-increasing numbers, the gathering approached the Malakand. A sudden attack was made on the Malakand and Chakdarra simultaneously. The numbers, which at first had barely reached 1,000 men, were rapidly swollen to 12,000 at the Malakand and 8,000 at Chakdarra. Heavy fighting continued at both places, until the Malakand was relieved on August 1 and Chakdarra on the 2nd. The assailants then drew off with a loss of not less than 3,000 men, while the British losses had amounted to 33 killed and 188 wounded. On the relief of Chakdarra the gathering quickly dispersed, and the task of punishment and prevention of further combination was taken in hand at once.\n\nThe next to rise were the Mohmands. Animated by the discourses of Najm-ud-din, the Adda Mull\u0101, a gathering of about 5,000 armed men from all sections (except the Tarakzai) advanced on August 7 into the Pesh\u0101war valley, and attacked the village of Shankargarh, in which there is a large Hindu element, and the adjoining police post of\nShabkadar. Troops were dispatched from Pesh\u0101war, and the tribesmen were driven back into the hills.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout Afridi and Orakzai T\u012br\u0101h the excitement had been growing; and frequent rumours reached Pesh\u0101war, Koh\u0101t, and Kurram of the reconciliation of intertribal feuds and the gathering of clans for jih\u0101d, at the bidding of Mull\u0101 Saiyid Akbar, Aka Khel Afridi. The trouble began with desultory firing by the Orakzai at the troops on the S\u0101m\u0101na on August 15. By the 23rd and 24th the whole of the posts in the Khyber, held only by the Khyber Rifles, whose British officers had been withdrawn, fell before a strong combination of Afridis. By the end of the month the Orakzai and Afridis had collected 15,000 men, all the posts on the S\u0101m\u0101na were closely invested, Shin\u0101wari (a police post at the juncture of Upper and Lower Mir\u0101nzai) had fallen, and Hangu was threatened. The siege of the S\u0101m\u0101na posts continued till September 14, when Fort Lockhart and Fort Cavagnari (Gulist\u0101n) were relieved, the small post of S\u0101ragarhi having fallen on September 12. On the approach of the relief force the enemy withdrew from the S\u0101m\u0101na ridge into the Kh\u0101nki valley.\n\nThese unprovoked attacks, which had not been without success, involved active military operations as a punishment and a deterrent. The operations began with the dispatch of two brigades (7,000 men) to Datta Khel in the Tochi valley, which caused the submission of the Madda Khel, who agreed to give up seventeen ringleaders, make compensation for the property taken at Maizar, and pay a fine. The final submission was, however, not concluded till 1901, after further operations.\n\nIn Sw\u0101t a quicker settlement was made. Before the end of the year Upper Sw\u0101t, B\u0101jaur, Chamla, and the Utman Khel country had been penetrated by British troops, and the fines imposed had been realized. In January, 1898, an expedition was sent through Buner, fines were realized from the Khudu Khel and Gad\u016bns of the Y\u016bsufzai border, and the Mull\u0101 Mast\u0101n was expelled by political pressure from Dir and Sw\u0101t. The Malakand Field Force consisted of three brigades, with the usual complement of divisional troops, in all 10,000 men.\n\nThe punishment of the Mohmands was effected by two brigades (7,000 men) advancing from Pesh\u0101war, in co-operation with two others detached from the Malakand Field Force. Difficulties were encountered in the advance of the latter, during which the affair at In\u0101yat Kila took place; but before the end of October the Mohmands had been punished, and the Adda Mull\u0101 fled to Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. On his departure a fine was paid by the tribe and weapons were surrendered.\n\nT\u012br\u0101h was invaded from Mir\u0101nzai by the route passing from Shinw\u0101ri over the Chagru Kotal, between the cliffs of Dargai and the S\u0101m\u0101na Sukh. The army consisted of two divisions, under Sir W. Lockhart,\nsupported by columns at Pesh\u0101war and in the Kurram. The advance began on October 18, and on the 21st was fought the severe action of Dargai, in which the British loss was 38 killed and 191 wounded. The troops then penetrated to Maid\u0101n and B\u0101r\u0101. By December 20, the Orakzai had completely fulfilled their obligations, but the Afr\u012bdis, who had as yet received little punishment, held out. Their territories were, therefore, still further harried; but the demands of the Government were not complied with till April, 1898, and the posts in the Khyber were held by regular troops till December, 1899, when they were made over to the Khyber Rifles. About 30,000 men were employed in the T\u016br\u0101h campaign, which had taken place in a difficult and unknown country, with an enemy who gave the troops no rest and pressed close on the heels of every retirement, while cleverly avoiding resistance in strength to an advance.\n\nSince the conclusion of peace with the Afr\u012bdis in 1898, the border from the Kurram northwards has been undisturbed\u00b9. In Wazirist\u0101n the period has also been marked by increasing tranquillity, but on three occasions troops have been required\u00b9. On December 1, 1900, the Mahs\u016bds, whose behaviour had been very unsatisfactory, were put under strict blockade. As the tribe continued its depredations, their country was harried during the winter of 1901\u20132 by constant incursions of lightly equipped columns. In the spring the fines imposed were paid, stolen rifles were surrendered, and security was given for the fulfilment of the other terms demanded. Since this settlement the behaviour of the Mahs\u016bds, as a tribe, has been conspicuously good, though three British officers were murdered by individuals in 1904\u20135.\n\nIn 1901 troops were marched through the Madda Khel country, in North Wazirist\u0101n, to enforce complete compliance with the terms imposed in 1897. The operations were successful.\n\nIn the autumn of 1902 an incursion was made into the K\u0101bul Khel country from Thal, Idak, and Bannu. There was little fighting except with a band of outlaws at Gumatti, but severe punishment was inflicted on the tribe, with excellent results.\n\nBy the terms of the Treaty of Gandamak, the limits of the Afgh\u0101n sphere of influence were set back along the main lines between India and K\u0101bul to the western ends of the Khyber Pass and the Kurram valley, but north and south of these routes no boundary was fixed. At intervals during their history some measure of control had been exercised over the Path\u0101n tribes from K\u0101bul; and the more important of them, such as the Afr\u012bdis and Mohmands, had been in receipt of allowances from the Amir for keeping open the passes. But practically they had been independent, and their main object has always been to remain so. In 1893 the Amir consented to a precise fixing of\n\n\u00b9 Except for the expedition against the Zakka Khel Afr\u012bdis in 1908.\nboundaries, and a mission, under Sir Mortimer Durand, proceeded to K\u0101bul to discuss the question. An agreement was signed definitely fixing 'the line which the Government of India and the Am\u012br have agreed to regard as the frontier of Afghanistan from Chandak (in the valley of the Kunar river, 12 miles north of Asm\u0101r) to the Persian border.' Commissions were next issued to demarcate the boundary. The Asm\u0101r Commission (1894) demarcated from the Bashgal valley on the borders of K\u0101f\u012brist\u0101n to Naw\u0101 Kotal, a point on the confines of B\u0101jaur and the Mohmand country. This delimitation was accepted by both Governments; but south of the Naw\u0101 Kotal no demarcation was made, owing to disagreement, the Am\u012br being unwilling to admit the boundary framed by the Durand agreement in the Mohmand territory. Between the K\u0101bul river and Sik\u0101r\u0101m (Safed Koh) no demarcation was attempted. But in the same year (1894) boundary stones were set up on the Kurram border, and orders were issued for demarcation from the Kurram to the Gomal river, which led to the Mahs\u016bd expedition already mentioned. In 1895 this demarcation was carried out, after which no further work on the boundary has been undertaken.\n\nFrom annexation till 1901 the Path\u0101n frontier was under the control of the Punjab Government. Various schemes had been propounded for an alteration of this arrangement, with the double object of securing closer and more immediate control and supervision of the frontier by the Supreme Government, and of making such alterations in the personnel and duties of frontier officials as would tend to the establishment of improved relations between the local British representatives and the independent tribesmen. Of these schemes the most notable was that formulated by Lord Lytton in 1877, which was laid aside on the outbreak of the second Afghan War in the following year. The question was raised again, in consequence of the experiences of 1897; and after mature discussion and deliberation a scheme was formulated by which the Districts of Haz\u0101ra, Pesh\u0101war, and Koh\u0101t, together with the trans-Indus portions of Bannu and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and the Political Agencies in the Khyber, the Kurram, the Tochi, and W\u0101na were removed from the control of the Punjab Administration. To these areas was added the political charge of D\u012br, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l, the Political Agent of which had never been subordinate to the Punjab. The new Province was constituted in 1901, under a Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, with head-quarters at Pesh\u0101war, in direct communication with the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In political questions there is no intermediary between the Chief Commissioner and the local officer\u2014an arrangement designed to secure both prompt disposal of references and the utilization of the expert knowledge of frontier conditions for which the head of the administration is selected.\nThe northern portion of what is now the North-West Frontier Province corresponds fairly closely with the ancient kingdoms of Udy\u0101na (Sw\u0101t) and Gandh\u0101ra (Pesh\u0101war), while Kurram has been identified with the Ki Kiangha of Hiuen Tsiang, and Bannu with the country called by him Falana, probably a Chinese transcription of a Sanskrit form Varna or Barna.\n\nObjects of archaeological interest are not uncommon in all these regions, and may be divided into two main categories: those which date from the era before the Muhammadan conquest (1000), and those of more recent origin. The former are generically described as Buddhist or Graeco-Buddhist. Consisting of well-graded roads, rock-inscriptions for the preservation of royal edicts, massive buildings, and sculptures of an almost Hellenic elegance, they form an unmistakable record of the high degree of many-sided civilization to which the people had attained before the advent of Isl\u0101m. The antiquities of the Muhammadan era, on the other hand, with the exception of a building in Pesh\u0101war city known as the Gorkhatri, which takes its name from a Hindu shrine, consist chiefly of mosques, tombs, and shrines, buildings of an exclusively religious nature, which evince no marked culture in the builders.\n\nOf ancient roads the best known are to be found on the Koh\u0101t, Malakand, and Sh\u0101hkot passes, where they are still used for the passage of pack-animals. Ruined structures of a massive type of architecture, some of which have been recognized as forts, others as monasteries and st\u016bpas, exist at many places. Of these, the most famous are the ruins on Mount Banj in Gadun territory (identified by Dr. Stein as the famous place of Buddhist pilgrimage, the scene of Buddha\u2019s body offering); those at Ch\u0101rsadda, Naogr\u0101m, Jam\u0101l Garhi, Kharaki, Takht-i-Bahai, S\u0101hri Bahlol, Tiralai in Pesh\u0101war District, Adh-i-Samudh near Koh\u0101t, the Akra mound in Bannu, and K\u0101fir Kot in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n. From the sites in Pesh\u0101war District, and to the north of it, many valuable finds of coins, inscriptions, and sculptures have been made at different times; and from the evidence afforded by these, such knowledge as we have of the ancient kingdoms of Udy\u0101na and Gandh\u0101ra and their dynasties is largely derived. Perhaps the most valuable relics of all from this point of view are the famous Kharoshth\u012b rock-inscriptions at Sh\u0101hb\u0101zgarhi in Pesh\u0101war District and M\u0101nsehra in Haz\u0101ra. These have been deciphered as slightly variant versions of a series of edicts published about 250 B.C. under the orders of king Asoka, the grandson of Chandragupta, or Sandrocottus, the renowned antagonist of Seleucus, Alexander\u2019s general. Pre-Muhammadan buildings, still extant in other parts of the Province, such as Adh-i-Samudh and K\u0101fir Kot, have not been equally distinguished by such finds. They appear to be of more recent construction than the remains in the northern regions, and to have been used more exclusively for defensive purposes.\nAmong later buildings mention has already been made of the Gorkhatri, once a place of Hindu pilgrimage, to which reference is made in B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs. The present building was erected as a resthouse for travellers under the orders of N\u016br Mahal, queen of the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br. The Gorkhatri, once the residence of General Avitabile, who governed Pesh\u0101war in the days of Sikh rule, is now used as a tahsil office. Besides this and the mosque named after Muhabbat Kh\u0101n, a Mughal governor of Pesh\u0101war, and the country seat of Ali Mard\u0101n Kh\u0101n Durr\u0101ni, now in the middle of cantonments and used as the District treasury, neither Pesh\u0101war nor any other District of the Province can boast of any buildings of later date than the eleventh century possessing either architectural pretensions or historical interest.\n\nThe population of the Province as enumerated in 1901 was 2,125,480; but this figure includes merely the population of the five British Districts, the Kurram Agency, and the Shir\u0101ni country, only the military posts in the remaining territories having been enumerated. In 1903 a Census was taken in the Tochi valley, which was found to contain a resident population of 24,670. It may be estimated that the whole Province has a population of nearly four millions.\n\nIn the administered Districts the density of the population per square mile rose from 148 in 1891 to 152 in 1901. The fertile valley of Pesh\u0101war supports 330 persons per square mile, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n being the most sparsely populated District with 74, while the Kurram Agency has only 42.\n\nOf the population enumerated in 1901, 269,905 lived in towns and 1,855,575 in rural areas. The Province contains one city, Pesh\u0101war (population, 95,147, including 21,804 in cantonments), its capital, and four towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants: namely, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n (31,737), Koh\u0101t (30,762), Bannu (14,291), and Ch\u0101rsadda (20,235). The first three include large cantonments. The Province has 15 smaller towns and 3,348 villages, 1,067 of which contain over 500 inhabitants each. The insecurity of life and property in former days compelled the people to build large villages and fortify them strongly, but there is now a marked tendency to found new homesteads which gradually grow into hamlets. This is especially noticeable in Haz\u0101ra and Koh\u0101t. Beyond the administrative border almost every family has its walled homestead, and the villages often consist of a number of towers or hamlets fortified against one another as much as against external enemies.\n\nDuring the ten years ending 1901 the population in the British Districts rose from 1,857,504 to 2,041,493, an increase of 9\u00b79 per cent. Since 1881 there has been an increase of 30\u00b72 per cent. Precise comparison with the figures of 1868 and 1855 is not possible, but the\nincrease since the latter year has undoubtedly been very great, especially in Pesh\u0101war. In the decade ending 1901 the increase of the population was almost entirely in the rural areas, the tendency being for the smaller towns to remain stationary or even to decline. Pesh\u0101war city, however, increased from 84,191 to 95,147. The population of the Province is still largely immigrant, though less so than formerly. More than 241,000 immigrants, of whom 76,000 came from Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, were enumerated in 1901; but against these have to be set off 87,000 emigrants. Neither the immigrants nor the emigrants are more than sojourners who spend the winter months away from their homes, trading, pasturing, or in less reputable employment. After annexation the Districts of the Province were to a large extent colonized by settlers from the tribal territories beyond the border and from Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. The stream of immigration from these sources is now weakening, the descendants of the first settlers having occupied most of the cultivable area. Thus the population of the Districts is far more stable than it was a generation or two ago.\n\nThe age returns of the Province are even more untrustworthy than in other parts of India. At the Census of 1901 the mean age of the population was 23\u00b78 for males and 23 for females. These figures are low according to European standards and below the corresponding figures in the Punjab, but the age return is probably too inaccurate for any conclusions to be drawn. The mean age of Muhammadans is lower than that of Hindus, a fact explained by the larger number of children among the former. The number of children under ten is high, being 3,032 (compared with 2,653 in the Punjab) in every 10,000 of the population.\n\nThe registration of births and deaths is defective, perhaps on account of the alleged reluctance of Path\u0101ns to register the birth of a girl. Vital statistics are collected by the police in rural tracts, and by municipal officials in municipalities. The following table shows the principal vital statistics for the Province:\n\n| Year | Population under registration | Ratio of registered births per 1,000 | Ratio of registered deaths per 1,000 | Deaths per 1,000 from |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|\n|      |                               |                                     |                                     | Cholera.

The virulent type which resembles cholera and is known as 'Pesh\u0101war fever' still occurs in that District,\nthough it is less prevalent than formerly. Autumnal fever frequently assumes a malignant form in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n. Diseases of the lungs, though less fatal than fever, often cause heavy mortality in the winter months. Small-pox is not responsible for many deaths. Stone is common throughout the Province. Goitre affects those who drink water from the hill streams, and guinea-worm those who use tank-water. Eye-affections are peculiarly common in the hot, dry Districts of Bannu and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n.\n\nTyphus in epidemic form has visited Pesh\u0101war nine times in the past fifteen years. Cholera is an occasional visitant. Until the spring of 1906 the Province remained free from plague except for a few imported cases. The disease then appeared in a virulent form, but its ravages were confined to a small area of the plains portion of Haz\u0101ra District. The trans-Indus Districts and Agencies have so far escaped altogether.\n\nThe recorded rates of infant mortality (156 males and 121 females per 1,000 births in 1901) would compare favourably with those in the Punjab if the registration were not defective. Although female infanticide is not suspected, the births reported show a marked excess of males over females, 120 boys being born to 100 girls. This is attributed to the reluctance of Path\u0101ns to report the birth of a girl. Of the total population in 1901, 1,159,306, or 54\u00b75 per cent., were males and 966,174, or 45\u00b75 per cent., females. In other words, there were 834 females to every 1,000 males. In 1891 the ratio was 843.\n\nAmong Muhammadans marriage is a civil contract. Among Hindus it is in theory a sacrament and the tie is dissolved only by death, and in the wife's case not even by death; but in the frontier Districts there is much laxity in practice. Women here do not occupy a high position; but custom, which is preferred to Muhammadan law by the courts in all cases where the parties are agriculturists, gives to widows and unmarried daughters in the presence of male heirs a right of maintenance only, and in their absence a life interest. A wife is almost invariably purchased, her price being determined by her looks. Infant marriage is unknown among the Muhammadan tribes on the frontier. Divorce for infidelity is not uncommon; but a Path\u0101n, as a rule, considers it due to his honour to kill both the unfaithful wife and her paramour, though in certain circumstances he will be content with lopping the foot of the latter. Across the border divorcees and widows are not infrequently sold by the husband, or by his heir as the case may be, a Path\u0101n's mother being a realizable asset. There is no prejudice against widow remarriage. The table on the next page gives statistics of civil condition as recorded in 1891 and 1901.\n\nThe figures show that social conditions have changed little since 1891. Marriage is less general than in the Punjab, a natural result of the avoidance of early marriage.\nThe dominant language of the Province is Pasht\u016b, which belongs to the Iranian branch of the Aryan family of speech. It has two main dialects: a hard or north-eastern (Pakhto), and a soft or south-western (Pashto). The dividing line of these two dialects runs westwards from Thal through Koh\u0101t District almost to the Indus, but then turns northward, and the speech of the Akhora Khattaks is the soft Pasht\u016b. Thus, Pakhto is spoken in B\u0101jaur, Sw\u0101t, and Buner, and by the Y\u016bsufzai, Bangash Orakzai, Afridi, and Mohmand Path\u0101ns, while the Khattaks, Waz\u012brs, Marwats, and various minor tribes in the south speak Pashto. It has been asserted that this division of the language corresponds roughly with the tribal systems of the Path\u0101ns, those who speak the hard or north-eastern Pakhto having a tendency to an oligarchic form of government, while the Pashto-speaking branch is intensely democratic in organization.\n\nThe classical dialect is that of the Y\u016bsufzai, in which the earliest Pasht\u016b works were composed. It is the purest and clearest form of the language. The sub-dialects of the Utman Khel tribe, of B\u0101jaur, and of the Afr\u012bdis and Orakzai differ but little from it, though each has its own accent, and there are local differences in vocabulary. The Waz\u012brs have several patois, which are probably less removed from the speech of the original Path\u0101ns than the present standard dialect of Pesh\u0101war, and they have retained many words still found in Punj\u0101bi. Round K\u0101nigoram in Waz\u012brist\u0101n, Bargista, or Ormuri, an independent Iranian language, is spoken by the Ormurs. The conquered strata of the population on the frontier speak Indian dialects, called Hindk\u012b in the north and Jatk\u012b or the Jat speech in the south, while G\u016bj\u0101ri is spoken by many of the G\u016bjars, who are numerous in the hills of Haz\u0101ra and to the north of Pesh\u0101war. In the Sw\u0101t Kohist\u0101n, Garhw\u012b and Torw\u0101l\u012b are spoken; and the Bashkar\u012bs of the upper portion of the Panjkora Kohist\u0101n speak Bashkar\u012b, which is said to be the same as Garhw\u012b. Of these two dialects little is as yet known.\n\nThe table on the next page gives the chief figures returned for languages in the territories enumerated in 1891 and 1901.\n\nThe population contains several ethnical strata, representing the deposits formed by different streams of immigration or invasion. Most numerous and important are the Path\u0101ns (Pakht\u0101na), who regard themselves as the dominant class, and form the majority of the agricultural\npopulation in Pesh\u0101war, Koh\u0101t, and Bannu, while beyond the administrative border they are in exclusive possession from Chitr\u0101l to the Gomal. In Haz\u0101ra, G\u016bjars and other tribes of Indian origin predominate, while Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n is inhabited mainly by Jats.\n\n| Language spoken | Persons |\n|-----------------|---------|\n|                 | 1891    | 1901    |\n| Pasht\u016b          | 1,005,195 | 1,142,869 |\n| Western Punjabi | 172,412   | 581,713  |\n| Punjabi         | 649,449   | 300,587  |\n| G\u016bjari          |          | 53,921   |\n| Western Hindk\u012b  | 15,131    | 16,775   |\n\nPath\u0101n is not now a racial term, whatever its original significance may have been. It now denotes status, and is said in Sw\u0101t and Dir to describe one who possesses a share in the tribal estate and who has therefore a voice in the village and tribal councils. One who has lost his share is called a fak\u012br, forfeits the name of Path\u0101n, and has no voice in the councils. The Path\u0101n tribes are mainly of Iranian origin, but many of their sections are affiliated clans of Hindk\u012b or indigenous descent, others of Saiyid (Arabian), and a few possibly of Turkish origin. The Path\u0101ns in the settled Districts and Kurram numbered 883,779, or more than two-fifths of the population, in 1901.\n\nNext in numerical importance come the Aw\u0101ns or vassals with 241,000, mainly in Haz\u0101ra and the Pesh\u0101war valley. The G\u016bjars number 108,000, of whom 92,000 are in Haz\u0101ra. They are also numerous in Dir, Sw\u0101t, and B\u0101jaur, where they speak Pasht\u016b, though on the borders of Dir and Asm\u0101r they retain their Indian speech. Other less numerous tribes are the Jats (81,000), mostly in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, Saiyids (77,000), Tanaolis (62,000, immigrants from Tan\u0101wai), Malli\u0101rs (27,000), Dhunds (25,000), Balochs (24,000), R\u0101jputs (20,000), Shaikhs (19,000), Kharrals (16,000), Mughals (14,000), Kureshis (14,000), B\u0101ghb\u0101ns (12,000), Par\u0101chas (11,000), Kass\u0101bs (7,000), Sureras (7,000), and Gakhars (6,000). Of Hindu castes, the Aroras (69,000), Khattris (34,000), and Br\u0101hmans (15,000) are important. In tribal territory, besides the tribes already alluded to, the Torw\u0101l and Garhw\u012b reside in the higher ranges of Sw\u0101t and the Bashk\u0101r\u012b in the Panjkora hills. In Jandol and Maid\u0101n are various other tribes of K\u0101fir descent converted to Isl\u0101m, and now reckoned as Path\u0101ns.\n\nOf the artisan classes, the most numerous are the Tarkh\u0101ns or carpenters (40,000), some of whom are rising under British rule to the status of a professional class as trained engineers. Next to them in numerical strength are the Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers, 38,000), then come the Loh\u0101rs (blacksmiths, 27,000), Moch\u012bs (leather-workers and shoemakers, 23,000), Kumh\u0101rs (potters and brick-burners, 20,000), Son\u0101rs (gold-\nsmiths), and Telis (oil-pressers, 10,000). The Kashmiris (wool-weavers and general labourers) number 25,000. Of the menial classes, the Nais (barbers) stand first numerically with 24,000. Next to them come the scavengers, 22,000 in all. Other menial classes are the Dhobis and Chhimb\u0101s (washermen, 17,000), and the Mir\u0101s\u012bs or Dums (village minstrels, 11,000).\n\nThe predominance of Isl\u0101m may be gauged by the fact that 1,957,777 persons, or 92 per cent. of the population enumerated in 1901, were returned as Muhammadans. In the tribal areas not enumerated its importance is still more marked, though Hindu traders are found even in the wildest tracts and receive ample toleration from their Muhammadan overlords. Tir\u0101h has a colony of Sikhs. The Muhammadans are mainly Sunnis, less than one per cent. confessing the Shiah tenets, though the Turis and some of the Bangash tribes in Kurram are avowed Shias, as are many of the Orakzai Path\u0101ns in Tir\u0101h, and the sect is also found in Koh\u0101t and the Shir\u0101ni country. The Shias are chiefly distinguished by the reverence they pay to Saiyids as descendants of Ali, while among the Sunnis Mull\u0101s or priests exercise supreme influence. Fanaticism is violent throughout the Province. As preached by the Mull\u0101s, Isl\u0101m is a religion of gloom, songs and dancing being condemned by them, while a sombre fanaticism, compatible with a degraded morality, is inculcated. Shrines abound and are objects of pilgrimages, fairs being held at each on specified days. The shrines are of saints who have obtained a reputation for miraculous powers or spiritual excellence. They are so numerous that few possess special eminence, but those of the Akhund of Sw\u0101t and of the P\u012br B\u0101ba in Buner attract pilgrims from all parts of the Muhammadan world. At most shrines bodily ailments may be cured or other advantages obtained.\n\nOf the total population of the Province, only 5,273 (including 533 natives), or 0.25 per cent., were returned as Christians in 1901. The Church Missionary Society has flourishing stations at Pesh\u0101war and Bannu, with outposts at Mard\u0101n and T\u0101nk. The medical work of the mission is most beneficial, and people come from great distances to be treated by the mission doctors. The Province lies in the Anglican diocese of Lahore. It is all included in the Roman Catholic prefecture of Kashmir and K\u0101firist\u0101n, excepting Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District, which lies in the diocese of Lahore.\n\nThe majority of the people of the Province are agriculturists. In 1901, 64\u00bd per cent. of the population was returned as dependent on agriculture. This high percentage illustrates the backward condition of industry, only 14\u00bd per cent. being returned as employed in the preparation and supply of material substances, and 2\u00bd per cent. in commerce. The artisans are cotton-weavers (39,000), leather-workers\n(29,000), blacksmiths and carpenters (26,000), and potters (12,000). Other classes are mainly employed in the large cantonments.\n\nThe food of the peasant has improved considerably since annexation. Two meals a day are usual, one at 10 a.m., and the other, the principal meal, at 8 p.m., or earlier in winter. The early breakfast of the Punjab is seldom taken except in Haz\u0101ra, and even there consists only of food left from the previous evening. The townsfolk as a rule eat wheaten bread. In summer the well-to-do countryman consumes a mixture of wheat and barley cakes, vegetables, pot-herbs, wild fruit, and milk in various forms. In winter, maize and millet are the staple diet, as they are said to be more warming, but a more obvious reason is the fact that they are harvested in the autumn. In the irrigated tracts the people live better, eating khichri, a mixture of rice, pulse, and vegetables, and a kind of hot porridge. The poorer peasants, however, sell their rice and wheat, and use the cheaper millet. All Path\u0101ns eat meat when they can afford it. The Path\u0101n is generally abstemious, and outside the towns the use of opium and spirits is regarded as disreputable. Smoking is universal, despite the efforts of the Mull\u0101s to put a stop to it.\n\nThe dress of the peasant consists of a turban, a loose shirt or tunic, baggy trousers, tied round the waist by a running string, and two or three shawls or a Sw\u0101ti blanket wrapped round the waist or placed on the head as a protection against the sun. In Wazirist\u0101n the shirts or tunics worn by the men, though indescribably filthy, are often elaborately embroidered round the neck and down the back. Waistcoats are worn not uncommonly. A leathern belt is always worn on a journey by those who have arms to put in it. In parts of the southern Districts among the Jats the trousers are replaced by a loin-cloth, and a sheet is thrown over the shoulders. Women wear an upper garment forming a bodice and skirt in one piece, dark blue in colour with a red border, and a yoke. Underneath are worn baggy trousers, and above is a shawl. Sandals of grass or leather or shoes of the ordinary Punjab type are worn by both sexes. Under Muhammadan rule a Hindu was not allowed to wear a turban, and a skull-cap is still his head-dress. In winter Path\u0101ns wear a post\u016bn or sheep-skin coat with the wool inside. In the south the hair is generally allowed to grow long and sometimes to curl into ringlets. In Pesh\u0101war the Path\u0101n shaves his head. The hair of the women is elaborately braided.\n\nA house generally consists of a single room about 25 by 12 feet, built of the material most easily obtainable. In Koh\u0101t and parts of Haz\u0101ra rough stone cemented with mud is used, with coarse slate for the roof. Elsewhere the walls are made of mud mixed with straw or of grass wattles. Wooden rafters support the roof, which is of mud and flat. The internal arrangements are very simple. The grain-\nsafe is the principal piece of furniture: and two or three beds, a low stool or two, some spindles, and baskets for wool and clothes complete the list. Hospitality is a characteristic of the Path\u0101n, and every village has its guesthouse, maintained by the headman or a few of the leading villagers. An unlimited supply of beds, blankets, and food is the mark of a true Path\u0101n headman, and to a great extent his influence depends on his extravagance in entertaining. An ordinary guest receives bread and some condiments, but for an honoured guest a fowl and for a powerful chief a sheep or goat is killed. The guesthouse is also used as a village club where residents and visitors assemble to smoke and talk, and the bachelors of the village sleep there, as Path\u0101n custom does not allow them to sleep at home after reaching man's estate. As elsewhere, the Muhammadans in this Province bury their dead. Hindus burn them, but it is not usual to carry the ashes to the Ganges.\n\nMost Path\u0101ns are fond of field sports, such as hawking, hunting with dogs, and shooting. Frequently they combine with these the more exciting pleasures of highway robbery, cattle-lifting, and burglary. In parts of Koh\u0101t a favourite pastime is to beat the low jungles at night with blazing torches, so that any hares or partridges that may be disturbed are dazzled and secured. In the north fighting rams and quails afford great amusement, and young men play a wrestling game rather like cock-fighting. Farther south tent-pegging is the national game, and on every occasion of rejoicing all who own horses assemble for the sport. In default of a wooden peg an old grass sandal will serve. Atinda, a kind of prisoner's base, is played keenly in Bannu, though not perhaps to the same extent as in the adjoining Punjab Districts. Everybody is fond of music, singing, and dancing, and the half-Gregorian style of music affected by the minstrels is not unpleasing. It is claimed for them that they distinguish intervals too subtle for the European ear to appreciate, though they know nothing of harmony, and consider European music mere noise. The recitations of the minstrels are sometimes epic in character, but love-songs and burlesques are favourite subjects also. Some of the latter are witty and do not spare British officials. Often, however, both recitation and gesture are obscene. Muhammadans picnic and feast on the two Id festivals, and Hindus celebrate the Bais\u0101khi in April and the Dasehra in October. In Pesh\u0101war a fair called the Jhanda mela is held in the early spring in honour of Sakhi Sarwar, a Hindu saint, who is held in equal honour by Hindus and Muhammadans.\n\nNatives, whether Muhammadan or Hindu, have generally two names, though sometimes one is considered sufficient. In common speech names are contracted; thus Fateh-ud-din will be Fattu to his comrades, and Fazl Ilahi will become Fazlu. Where two men\nin the village have the same name, the tribal name is often added, and if they also belong to the same tribe their fathers' names are added to distinguish them. A son never receives his father's name. Honorific titles are considered very important. These are of two classes: those conferred or formally recognized by Government, such as R\u0101j\u0101, Waz\u012br, Sard\u0101r, Rai Bah\u0101dur, or Rai S\u0101hib for Hindus, and R\u0101j\u0101, Naw\u0101b, Mirz\u0101, M\u012br, Mi\u0101n, Kh\u0101n S\u0101hib, or Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur for Muhammadans; and, secondly, those which have a customary validity in native society, and are therefore used as a matter of courtesy by Europeans in conversation or official communications. These include Pandit, Misra, Bhai, B\u0101w\u0101, L\u0101la, and Sodhi (Hindus), and Arb\u0101b, Kh\u0101n, K\u0101zi, Maulvi, Munshi, Mirza, and Malik (Muhammadans). Kh\u0101n, which literally means 'lord,' is adopted as a matter of course by every Path\u0101n, like Mr. in English, and is suggestive of the Path\u0101n attitude to other tribes. Two Muhammadan gentlemen in Haz\u0101ra hold the title of R\u0101j\u0101 by licence from Government, and the whole tribe of the Gakhars put R\u0101j\u0101 before their names. In this Province, as elsewhere, a man's name is an unmistakable indication of his religion: but there are instances of Hindu families who use the distinctively Muhammadan title of Kh\u0101n, while the reverse process is exemplified in the Gakhars, who are Muhammadans to a man.\n\nIn the spiritual hierarchy titles are of even greater importance. Saiyid is a title given only to descendants of the Prophet. Next in order is Mi\u0101n, one who is descended from a saint of old time and of more than local or tribal celebrity. Kureshis rank as Mi\u0101ns. Next come Akhundz\u0101das or P\u012brz\u0101das, descendants of holy men having local or tribal repute. Last come the S\u0101hibz\u0101das, descendants of Mull\u0101s or priests who had acquired a reputation for sanctity. Yet these religious classes need not necessarily occupy themselves with religion, and their profession or character affects their status only to a slight extent in popular esteem.\n\nThe settled Districts of the Province form two main tracts, which differ markedly in their agricultural conditions. The first lies east of the Indus, and consists of the sub-Him\u0101layan District of Haz\u0101ra, where the soil, deep and rich in the plain tracts, but shallow and stony in the hills, receives sufficient rainfall. Here a good spring crop is assured in the plains, except on the rare occasions when the winter rains fail; but the autumn harvest is inferior to that of the lower hills, where it forms the chief crop, while the higher altitudes above 5,000 feet hardly produce any harvest in the spring. The other tract, west of the Indus, may be further subdivided into stony uplands and level plains. In both tracts the rainfall, which averages less than 20 inches in the year, is uncertain in amount and uneven in distribution; and both depend largely on irrigation. The plains comprise the Pesh\u0101war valley, the Bannu and Marwat plains\nof Bannu District, and that of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n; but the soils vary greatly. A light, porous surface soil, more or less intermixed with sand and underlain by strong retentive clay, is found in Pesh\u0101war, while a sandy gravel predominates in Bannu, and sand in the Marwat valleys. In Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, the d\u0101man, or 'skirt of the hills,' has a clayey soil, and is fringed with a strip of alluvial loam along the Indus. Wherever irrigation is applied, the rich silt deposits tend to make the soil deep and stiff, with a large admixture of clay. Cultivation depends more on facilities for irrigation than on the intrinsic fertility of the soil. The Pesh\u0101war and Bannu valleys are well irrigated and are, therefore, highly cultivated; in Marwat, which depends mainly on the rainfall, the harvests are precarious; and in the d\u0101man the crops depend on the embankments, which hold up the surface water, or, in the riverain strip, on wells and floods from the Indus and the fertilizing floods brought down by hill torrents. In the hills the best cultivation is found in the valleys of Koh\u0101t, which generally contain a good clean loam, singularly retentive of moisture, and therefore well able to resist drought. Elsewhere the hill soils are thin and poor, and the harvest is entirely dependent on well-timed rainfall.\n\nThere are two harvests: the khar\u012bf or autumn, sown from May to August, and reaped between early September and the close of the year; and the rabi or spring harvest, sown from October to January and mostly reaped in April or May. Extra spring crops, chiefly tobacco, melons, &c., are cut in June. Sugar and cotton are classed as belonging to the autumn harvest, but are on the ground for nearly a year.\n\nThe systems of cultivation vary greatly, as might be expected where conditions are so diverse. In Haz\u0101ra the main factor is the elevation, the cold mountain ranges producing little but autumn crops, while in the plains the rabi is the chief harvest. In highly irrigated tracts, whether in the plains or in the fertile valleys of Koh\u0101t, the cultivator's main object is to make the most of the water at his disposal, and the best lands are cropped twice a year for years together. Even inferior lands often bear two successive crops, followed by a year's fallow; but in the parts of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n watered by embankments, where land is very abundant, the people prefer to leave the land fallow for two years out of three.\n\nRotations are to some extent followed, the idea being, as in Bannu, to follow such crops as wheat, cotton, tobacco, or turmeric, which are considered exhausting, by clover, maize, barley, or some other recuperative crop the residue of which is ploughed into the soil. When the crop depends on rain, the system pursued is largely determined by the character of the soil, and by the rainfall of each season; some lands are cropped only once every three or four years, others are cropped continuously until exhaustion compels a fallow, and one year the cultivation\nwill be all for autumn, the next all for spring crops. Cultivation in the Indus riverain is equally variable, as it depends on the floods.\n\nThe tillage of the Province is not of a high order. This is due in part to the now obsolescent custom, formerly universal in all Path\u0101n tribes, of a periodical redistribution of holdings. Further, the Path\u0101n is notoriously lazy, and half a century of settled government has not altogether dispelled the demoralization caused by the anarchy that prevailed before annexation. In the lighter soils the seed is often sown at the first ploughing, but other soils are usually tilled from three to six times, according to the crop. The plough, drawn by cattle, resembles that used in other parts of Northern India; but a large heart-shaped iron spade is often used in the heavy clay soils by the Bannuchis and in Daur, either to break up the clods before ploughing or instead of the plough. Seed is usually sown broadcast. Weeding is seldom attempted. Manure is used near villages, its use being limited only by the amount available. In Marwat, Y\u016bsufzai, and the Khattak and M\u012br\u0101nzai tracts in Koh\u0101t, cultivators often cut the stalk close to the ear, leaving the straw to rot on the ground, while elsewhere it is utilized for fodder. Grain is trodden out by oxen, and winnowing is done by hand with fans. The agricultural implements in use are of an ancient type, but the iron sugar-mill has almost entirely replaced the old wooden press.\n\nIn 1901, 1,363,000 persons, or 64.5 per cent. of the population, were returned as supported by agriculture; and of these, 418,000, or 31 per cent., were actual workers. Of the latter, 216,000 were peasant proprietors, including cultivating owners or mortgagees, and 168,000 were cultivating tenants, only 28,000 being non-cultivating owners or tenants. Agricultural labourers numbered only 15,000 actual workers, most of the agricultural work being done by the cultivators themselves (who are often able to assist one another when harvest time falls differently in different places), and by village menials\u2014tanners, sweepers, and the like\u2014who in addition to their proper calling obtain a great portion of their income from harvest wages paid in kind.\n\nWheat is the chief crop of the spring harvest. It is sown usually in the latter half of October and November, but sowing may begin as early as the middle of September or as late as the middle of January. The harvest is gathered in May and June. Wheat ordinarily covers 1,094 square miles, though in good years, such as 1891, 1898, and 1904, it was sown on more than 1,406 square miles. About one-third of the crop is irrigated. The average yield per acre is on irrigated land from $7\\frac{1}{2}$ cwt. to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ tons, and on unirrigated land from $3\\frac{1}{2}$ cwt. to 5 cwt.\n\nBarley is next in importance. It ordinarily occupies more than 313 square miles, though in good years, such as 1891 and 1898, it\ncovers double that area, and in a year of scarcity, like 1902, sinks to 156 square miles. Although sown rather later than wheat, it is the first crop to ripen in the spring, and harvesting begins as early as April. About two-fifths of the crop is usually grown on irrigated land. The yield per acre is slightly less than that of wheat.\n\nGram, which ordinarily covers about 188 square miles, is sown at about the same time as wheat and barley, and reaped as a rule after the latter and before the former. It is grown chiefly in Bannu, which returns nearly two-thirds of the total area covered by this crop. From 4 to 5 cwt. per acre is a good return.\n\nMaize, the chief crop of the autumn harvest, generally covers about 625 square miles, coming next to wheat. It is sown in July or August, or occasionally as early as April, and is harvested from the middle of September to the end of November. More than half the crop is usually grown on irrigated land, Haz\u0101ra being the only District in which it is largely produced without irrigation. Pesh\u0101war and Haz\u0101ra claim most of the out-turn, and it is practically unknown in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n. An acre of irrigated land will give from 10 to 14 cwt. of maize, while unirrigated land seldom produces more than 5 cwt.\n\nThe area under spiked millet or bajra (Pennisetum typhoideum) is ordinarily about 313 square miles, though in bad years, such as 1892 and 1900, it is less than half as much. June and July are the best months for sowing, though it may be sown as early as April, and it is mostly reaped in October and November. Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n and Koh\u0101t are the chief Districts for bajra, which is rarely irrigated. From 3 to 7 cwt. per acre, according as the land is with or without irrigation, is the usual yield of bajra and also of jow\u0101r.\n\nGreat millet or jow\u0101r (Sorghum vulgare) occupies usually about 109 square miles. In good years, such as 1891 and 1893, it rose to 156 square miles, while in 1902, a bad year, it fell to 63. It is chiefly grown in Pesh\u0101war, where very little spiked millet is grown. Less than a quarter of the crop is irrigated. The sowing and harvest times are the same as for spiked millet. The crop is often grown for fodder, and is then sown very thickly and known as chari.\n\nRice is but little cultivated, covering only 49 square miles on an average, chiefly in Haz\u0101ra, Pesh\u0101war, Kurram, and Tochi. It is confined to irrigated land, and yields 8 to 10 cwt. per acre.\n\nBesides gram many varieties of pulses are grown, usually mixed with other crops. Of these the chief are m\u0101sh (Phaseolus radiatus), m\u016bng (P. Mungo), and moth (P. aconitifolius) in autumn, and mas\u016br (Ervum Lens) in spring. M\u0101sh and m\u016bng ordinarily cover 31 square miles, though in 1893 they were sown in about twice that area, and the other pulses occupied 109 square miles.\n\nCotton, mostly produced in Pesh\u0101war and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n Districts,\nis sown on about 50 square miles, rising in good years, such as 1891 and 1896, to 109, and falling in bad years, such as 1892 and 1902, to 3 square miles. The seeds are used as fodder.\n\nThe oil-crops chiefly grown are *til* (*Sesamum indicum*) and rapeseed. They ordinarily cover about 120 square miles; but in good years, such as 1891 and 1893, the area increases to more than double.\n\nAs recently estimated, the total production of food-grains in an average year in the Province amounts to about 539,000 tons, and the total consumption, including fodder, grain, and wastage, to 552,000 tons. The excess of consumption over production, however, is partly due to the large number of temporary immigrants and men in Government service.\n\nThe total area under fruit orchards is estimated at 4,000 acres, of which 2,700 acres are situated in Pesh\u0101war District. The chief kinds of fruit are grapes, peaches, Orleans plums (*al\u016bcha*), quinces, pears, figs, pomegranates, water-melons, loquats, and dates. Mulberries grow wild almost everywhere. Most of the produce is consumed locally; but dates from Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n find a market in Mult\u0101n and other neighbouring Districts, while apricots from Haz\u0101ra and grapes from Koh\u0101t are sent as far as R\u0101walpindi and sometimes Lahore. The only District which exports fruit in considerable quantities is Pesh\u0101war. The system of fruit cultivation is crude, though an occasional attempt has been made to introduce improved varieties. Pomegranates are the fruit most extensively cultivated, and the Pesh\u0101war pomegranate is now considered to be superior in quality even to that of Jal\u0101lab\u0101d. The principal varieties of grapes are *bed\u0101na* ('seedless') white and *bed\u012bna* black with round berries, and *husaini* with long oval berries. The annual export of fresh fruits from Pesh\u0101war is estimated in maunds at: pomegranates, 37,500; quinces and pears, 37,500; grapes, 4,500; peaches, 4,500; Orleans plums, 1,500; total, 85,500 maunds (3,130 tons). Pomegranates are sent to the whole of India and as far as Rangoon; quinces are chiefly consumed in the Punjab, while pears go to Rangoon; the export of grapes and peaches is generally limited to Northern India, a small quantity only being sent to Calcutta, as they do not keep longer than about five days; for the same reason, plums are mostly exported to the Punjab, only selected fruit being dispatched to Calcutta. A considerable portion of the fruits imported from across the frontier comes to Pesh\u0101war; this largely consists of dried fruits (almonds, raisins, nuts, and the like), but also includes musk-melons, grapes, and pomegranates. A special fruit van, booked every day from Pesh\u0101war to Howrah during the busy months of September, October, and November, in the height of the pomegranate, quince, and pear season, carries about 5,000 maunds a month.\nIn but few tracts, outside the Indus valley, are conditions suitable for sinking irrigation wells; but loans are largely taken for the construction and repair of the dams, by means of which the surface water from the hills is utilized for irrigation. Advances for seed and bullocks after the monsoon rains are usually in great demand. Between 1891 and 1900 about Rs. 19,000 was lent annually under the Land Improvement Loans Act, and the advances amounted to Rs. 10,000 in 1900\u20131 and Rs. 39,611 in 1903\u20134. The loans bear interest at $6\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent. per annum, the borrower's holding being hypothecated as security. Under the Agriculturists' Loans Act about Rs. 40,000 was advanced annually from 1891 to 1900; Rs. 50,000 was lent in 1900\u20131 and Rs. 49,347 in 1903\u20134. These loans are made on the borrower's personal security.\n\nThroughout the Province the amount of agricultural indebtedness is considerable, but in Koh\u0101t the Path\u0101n proprietary bodies are strong enough to prevent their lands from passing to outsiders. In the other Districts there is some danger that the agricultural tribes may be expropriated, and the Punjab Land Alienation Act has been extended to them (excluding Pesh\u0101war) in a modified form. Creditors are nearly always Hindus of the trading classes, and the rate of interest on loans may be anything from 12 per cent. upwards.\n\nThe Province possesses no noteworthy breed of cattle, except the Pesh\u0101war buffalo, which is used for burden and will carry to market as much as 10 to 15 maunds of agricultural produce. The other local breeds are small and weak, but as there is not much well-irrigation strong cattle are not required. When needed, they are generally imported from the Punjab.\n\nSheep and goats are bred in every District, but large numbers are also brought from across the border for the winter grazing. The two chief breeds of sheep are the ordinary thin-tailed variety of the Punjab, and the dumba or fat-tailed. Sheep and goats are kept for their wool and hair and the profits from the sale of the young, and there is a large market for mutton in the cantonments.\n\nCamels are largely used for transport, but are not bred except in Koh\u0101t District.\n\nNo District has any special reputation for its horses, though horse breeding is encouraged by the supply of stallions kept by the Imperial Remount department in Haz\u0101ra and by the District boards in the remaining Districts. The best animals are imported from beyond the border. Donkeys are much used for local transport; and the Remount department keeps donkey stallions for mule-breeding in Haz\u0101ra, where the nature of the country renders the use of mule transport indispensable.\n\nOf the total cultivated area, 72 per cent. is dependent on the rainfall,\n25 per cent. is irrigated by canals, 2 per cent. is irrigated by perennial streams or inundated by river floods, and less than one per cent. is irrigated from wells. The present canal systems utilize the waters of the K\u0101bul, Sw\u0101t, and B\u0101r\u0101 rivers in Pesh\u0101war District, of the Kurram in the Kurram Agency and Bannu, of the Tochi in Daur and Bannu, and of the minor affluents of the Indus in the remaining Districts. The Indus itself has not as yet afforded any great supply for irrigation; but a scheme for an inundation canal on its western bank at Paharpur in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District, which would command nearly 94 square miles, is under preparation.\n\nWork will also shortly begin on a bolder project, that of bringing a canal from the Sw\u0101t river by a tunnel under the Malakand Pass into the eastern portion of Pesh\u0101war District. When completed this will supply, besides the independent villages of Sam R\u0101nizai, from which a water rate will be levied, an area of nearly 300 square miles in the north-eastern portion of the District, for which the existing Sw\u0101t River Canal does not suffice.\n\nThe demand for irrigation is greatest in the arid plains of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n and Bannu. In the former District there is considerable irrigation from the creeks of the Indus, and from hill torrents and perennial streams, but no large canal has been made. Bannu is in parts very highly irrigated, 30 per cent. of the cultivation in that District being protected by canals. In the Daur tract of Northern Waz\u012brist\u0101n the whole of the cultivated area is irrigated. Nearly all the cultivation in the Kurram valley is watered from the Kurram river and the snow-fed streams which descend from the eastern slopes of the Safed Koh. In Koh\u0101t the Koh\u0101t Toi and perennial streams irrigate considerable areas, but the broken character of the District forbids any large schemes. Haz\u0101ra possesses an ample rainfall, and its hill tracts are to a great extent independent of canals; but its plains and open valleys receive an abundant and fertilizing irrigation from the perennial streams, the Kunh\u0101r, Siran, Dor, and Harroh. The District in which irrigation has been most fully utilized is Pesh\u0101war. Wells are confined to the Sw\u0101bi tal\u016bs\u012bl of Pesh\u0101war, the Indus riverain in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and parts of Koh\u0101t. The physical conditions of the Province preclude any great extension of well irrigation.\n\nBefore annexation canals had been dug in Pesh\u0101war, Bannu, Daur, and elsewhere. In Pesh\u0101war several small canals were constructed under Mughal or Durr\u0101ni rule. Most of these are still in working order, and they are included among the scheduled canals which are managed by the Deputy-Commissioner. The total area irrigated from this source is about 203 square miles, paying a net assessment of nearly 6 lakhs. The Sw\u0101t River Canal, which irrigates about 250 square miles in the table-land east of the Sw\u0101t and K\u0101bul rivers,\nwas completed in 1885. The K\u0101bul River Canal, which irrigates 78 square miles in the Pesh\u0101war and Naushahra tahsils, was completed in 1893. Both the Sw\u0101t and K\u0101bul Canals are the property of the Government. The B\u0101r\u0101 is a scheduled canal, but its weir and upper distributaries were constructed and are managed by the Irrigation department. Besides these canals, the Michni, Dilazak, and Shabkadar branch were constructed by the District board of Pesh\u0101war in 1896.\n\nThe numerous canals in the Districts south of Pesh\u0101war are all private, none being owned by the Government, though they are to a certain extent controlled by the Deputy-Commissioners on behalf of the people, with the aid of a small establishment paid from a cess levied in the area irrigated. All these canals are perennial.\n\nThose canals which are under departmental control are classed as 'major' works. The total outlay on them up to 1903\u20134 was 56 lakhs, and the average receipts have been 11 per cent. on the capital outlay. Other canals are classed as 'minor' works. The total expenditure on these has been 5 lakhs, and the return 11 per cent. on the sum expended.\n\nNo canal revenue, beyond a small cess to cover the expenses of management, is levied on the private canals, but the lands irrigated by them are assessed to land revenue at irrigated rates. Water rates are paid on the canals owned by the Government or the Pesh\u0101war District board, the rate usually varying according to the crop grown.\n\nRights in water are as valuable as rights in land, though the two rights are now sometimes distinct when the supply of the water is very abundant. The distribution of the available water-supply is governed by ancient customs, often of great intricacy when the supply is scanty. Its ultimate distribution among individual co-sharers is usually determined by lot.\n\nUnder native rule the State took all, or nearly all, the produce of the land which was not required for the subsistence of the cultivators, in tracts where such exactions were possible, such as the Pesh\u0101war valley and the Haripur plain in Haz\u0101ra. Rents, wages, and prices.\n\nIn outlying areas, such as the northern glens of Haz\u0101ra, the remote valleys of Koh\u0101t, and the Bannu Marwat plain, the revenue could, however, be collected only by an annual military expedition: and, as this was not always feasible, the practice arose of farming out large tracts to the local chiefs for a cash revenue, the amount of which usually depended on the chief's strength and the expediency of conciliating him. The chief similarly took all he could from the actual cultivators. In these circumstances there was no room for a landlord intermediate between the cultivator and the state or local chief; and it is only since the value of land has risen under the milder\nBritish assessments that anything in the shape of a margin leivable as rent has been in any general way available for the owners of land.\n\nThe assessment on rent-paying lands, which under native rulers was usually taken direct from the cultivator in kind, is now always collected from the owner in cash, and the latter recovers from the tenant, in kind or in cash, an amount which ordinarily runs to at least three times the value of the assessment. The usual practice is to take rent in kind at a share of the produce, and produce rents are paid in 57 per cent. of the rented area of the Province; but where the crops grown are difficult to divide, and in the neighbourhood of towns, or on land held by occupancy tenants, it is not unusual to find rents paid in cash. The exact rate at which a rent in kind is paid is largely a matter of custom; and such rents, while varying considerably from soil to soil, do not change much from time to time. Cash rents, on the other hand, have necessarily increased with the rise in the prices of agricultural produce, and the average incidence of such rents was Rs. 3-4-7 per acre in 1901-2.\n\nAs more than 48 per cent. of the land is cultivated by the owners themselves, and a fair portion of the rest by owners who pay rent only to co-sharers, the tenant class in the North-West Frontier Province, as in the Punjab, is neither so large nor so distinctively marked as in other parts of Northern India, and the law affords much less elaborate protection to the tenant than is usual in the United Provinces or Bengal. A limited number of the tenant class, amounting to 22.5 per cent. of the whole, has been marked off by the legislature on certain historical grounds as entitled to rights of occupancy; and the rents of this class, if paid in cash, cannot be enhanced to a rate exceeding the land revenue by more than 12\u00bd to 75 per cent. (according to circumstances). In the case of the remaining tenants who hold at will, no limit is fixed to the discretion of the landlord in the matter of enhancement; but the procedure to be followed in ejectment, and the grant of compensation for improvements legally executed, is provided for by the law in respect of both classes of tenants. Rent in kind is usually one-half the produce or more on irrigated and one-third or less on unirrigated land, the tendency being for rents to rise on the former.\n\nWith normal prices, the sum required for the food of a labouring family may be taken at about Rs. 4\u00bd a month, and to this Rs. 1\u00bc a month must be added for a reasonable amount of furniture, clothing, and other necessaries. The ordinary unskilled labourer, therefore, requires about Rs. 6 a month, or its value; and this may be taken as the ordinary wage now prevailing. The labourer in a town is usually paid entirely in cash; in the country he is paid either wholly or partially in kind. The agricultural labourer consumes a little more food than the town labourer; but whereas the latter has house-rent to\npay, the former is generally housed by his employer. The cultivator who rents but does not own land lives at a standard of comfort very little higher than the landless labourer. As his expenditure, like his income, is almost entirely in grain, and a large part of his food and clothing is produced by himself or his family, it is difficult to estimate his receipts in money: but it would probably be correct to say that, when the ordinary day labourer of the Province receives Rs. 6 a month, the income of the cultivator after paying his rent would be represented by something like Rs. 7 or Rs. 8, while if the cultivator were also an owner of land, his average income, after payment of Government dues, might be put at Rs. 10, or more. Skilled labourers, such as blacksmiths or masons, get about Rs. 16 a month or its equivalent, and carpenters still more. A clerk receiving between Rs. 20 and Rs. 30 has to maintain a better style of dress and living than men with the same income who work with their hands. Wages are now twice or thrice as high as they were under Sikh rule, and there has been a progressive rise in recent years. So far as the labourer's food is concerned, its money value has increased 30 to 35 per cent. since 1880, while the other items of his expenditure have decreased in price: and it would probably be correct to say that during the same period the labourers' wages have risen some 20 to 25 per cent. With artisans the increase has been larger, or from 25 to 30 per cent. During the decade ending 1901 the extension of railways, roads, and cantonments greatly increased the demand for skilled, and to a less extent for unskilled, labour. Wages in consequence have risen more than the cost of living. At harvest time labour from the Punjab and independent territory is required.\n\nNo official statistics are maintained regarding the prices of any but agricultural staples. The rise of prices is best studied in the retail figures, which are available in greater completeness than the others. The following table shows rates, in seers per rupee, at the principal centres:\n\n| Percentage of crops under | Peshawar | Dera Ismail Khan |\n|---------------------------|----------|-----------------|\n|                           | Average for ten years ending | Average for ten years ending |\n|                           | 1880.    | 1890.           | 1900.          | 1880.    | 1890.           | 1900.          |\n| Wheat                     | 38.4     | 19.13           | 18.69          | 16.69    | 15.16           | 24.87          | 18.69          | 17.72          | 15.35          |\n| Gram                      | 6.7      | 20.26           | 21.13          | 18.00    | 19.11           | 27.81          | 25.25          | 21.43          | 19.84          |\n| Jow\u0101r                     | 3.0      | 27.37           | 28.06          | 21.43    | 21.69           | 36.81          | 27.62          | 22.18          | 26.87          |\n| Bajra                     | 8.3      | 23.69           | 22.06          | 16.25    | 16.47           | 24.87          | 24.56          | 18.50          | 20.89          |\n| Koh\u0101ti salt               | ...      | ...             | ...            | 29.62    | 17.36           | ...            | ...            | 24.02          | 15.67          |\n\nFrom these it will be seen that the rise in the price of agricultural produce has been steady and almost universal, varying from nearly\n40 per cent. in the price of wheat, the most important crop, during the last twenty-three years at Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, to less than 5 per cent. in the case of gram at Pesh\u0101war during the same period. The price of land has steadily risen meanwhile; and there is no reason why the agricultural population, among whom the standard of comfort has enormously improved, especially in Pesh\u0101war, should not have their full share in the prosperity of the country, but for their inveterate propensity to improvidence and extravagance, to say nothing of litigation and crime, which has caused so much land in Pesh\u0101war to pass into the hands of the money-lending mortgagee.\n\nThe operations of the Forest department are confined to the 'reserved' forests in Haz\u0101ra, which have an area of 235 square miles, and that District forms the only Forest division in the Province. It is in charge of a Deputy-Conservator, under the control of the Revenue Commissioner; but the Conservator of Forests, Punjab, exercises a general professional superintendence over the management of the forests. The financial results of the department are shown below:\n\n|                | 1880-1 to 1889-90 (average) | 1890-1 to 1899-1900 (average) | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue        | Rs. 78,000                 | Rs. 87,000                    | Rs. 89,000 | Rs. 83,000 |\n| Expenditure    | Rs. 60,000                  | Rs. 62,000                    | Rs. 53,000 | Rs. 52,000 |\n| Surplus        | Rs. 18,000                  | Rs. 25,000                    | Rs. 36,000 | Rs. 31,000 |\n\nThe revenue is principally derived from sales of deod\u0101r. The village forests of Haz\u0101ra are also important, and the Deputy-Commissioner is entrusted with their administration. Haz\u0101ra likewise contains military reserves, 8 square miles in area. In Koh\u0101t 74 square miles of unclassed forest and Government waste are controlled by the Deputy-Commissioner, and there is a small forest area in Pesh\u0101war in which the people have rights jointly with Government. The other two Districts contain a few scattered rakhs, but these consist chiefly of scrub and form grazing grounds rather than forests. The chief trees in the Haz\u0101ra forests are deod\u0101r, Pinus excelsa, blue pine, Scotch fir, wild cherry, ilex, sycamore, horse-chestnut, walnut, and yew; while in the other Districts the shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), mulberry, willow, Melia sempervirens, Acacia modesta, tamarisk, olive, and poplar are most common. The dwarf-palm grows largely in the lower hills, and is much used for making mats and other articles. Beyond the administrative border the Wazirist\u0101n hills contain some fine forests, as do the upper slopes of the Safed Koh in Kurram, and the highest ranges in Chitr\u0101l. All these forests, however, are as yet almost unexplored.\nThe only mineral product of commercial importance in the Province is rock-salt, which is obtained from the Jatta, M\u0101lg\u012bn, Bah\u0101dur Khel, and Karak quarries in Koh\u0101t District. The average output during the six years ending 1903 was 2,640 tons. Saltpetre is manufactured in most Districts from the nitrous earth found on village sites. In 1903-4 there were three refineries in the Province, which produced about 150 tons of refined saltpetre and 25 cwt. of impure salt (sitta).\n\nAssociated with the Koh\u0101t salt are layers of gypsum and alum shale, but they are at present of no commercial importance. Marble is worked in Pesh\u0101war District near Naushahra and opposite Attock. Limestone and sandstone are abundant, and are used locally for building. There are petroleum springs at Panoba in Koh\u0101t, and in one or two other places in the Province, but the amount of oil yielded is insignificant. Under Sikh rule, sulphur was worked near Nakband in Koh\u0101t District, but the pits are now closed. It is also found with gypsum in the Sulaim\u0101n range. Gold occurs in minute quantities in the sands of the Indus and K\u0101bul rivers. Traces of lignite have been observed in Haz\u0101ra and in the Sheikh Budin range, and probably exist in other parts of the Province. The lignite in Haz\u0101ra is regularly worked and made into briquettes for local use, but the out-turn does not exceed 1,055 cwt. annually. Coal of a fairly good description has also been recently found, in considerable quantities, along the eastern border of Bannu and Koh\u0101t Districts in the Maid\u0101n range which separates them from the Punjab District of Mi\u0101nw\u0101li. Iron is found in the Y\u016bsufzai hills, where there are signs of old workings, and workings still exist in Waz\u012brist\u0101n. Red hematite ore is also found at Bakot in Haz\u0101ra District. From B\u0101jaur fused or hammered iron of good quality is imported into Pesh\u0101war. The metal is said to be abundant at Baroul in Dir, but is no longer worked. Antimony has been found with iron at Bakot, and a very good ore is also imported from B\u0101jaur. The Mehtar of Chitr\u0101l has derived a considerable income in recent years from the sale of orpiment, but the mine now shows signs of exhaustion.\n\nCoarse cotton fabrics are woven by hand in every part of the Province, but there is no export, as the amount made is insufficient for home consumption. Beautiful longcloths or khes are made in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, Koh\u0101t, and Pesh\u0101war. Finer fabrics are generally woven for lung\u012bs (turbans), mostly in grey or dark blue, with richly worked end-pieces in bands of gold thread (tila) or coloured silk; and in Haz\u0101ra fine stripes and checks are produced.\n\nA very interesting production of Pesh\u0101war is a cotton fabric decorated with a substance called roghan, a preparation of oil\nobtained from the wild safflower (*Carthamus oxyacantha*), by the Afridis, whence the material is generally known as 'Afridi waxcloth.' The roghan is applied in a plastic condition to the fabric by means of an iron style on the lines of the required pattern. It is then pressed into the cloth with the moistened tip of the finger, when it sets and firmly adheres to the texture. Various colours are used, and the composition is often dusted over before drying with powdered mica, thus giving the pattern a silvery gloss.\n\nPesh\u0101war and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n produce wool of fair quality, but the only woollen goods woven are blankets, the best of which are made in Sw\u0101t for export. Woollen camel-bags are also woven. Felted *namd\u0101s* are used as coverings for animals, for keeping ice, and for saddle-pads, the better qualities having coloured designs inserted. Haz\u0101ra and Koh\u0101t export *namd\u0101s* on a large scale, the largest serving as carpets. Among the Waz\u012brs on the Bannu border a kind of woollen *dar\u012b* is made, with a bold design and some artistic merit. The Marwats of Bannu District also make woollen-pile rugs, locally known as *nakhais*.\n\nSilk-spinning and weaving are fairly important industries at Koh\u0101t and Pesh\u0101war, where silk turbans (*lung\u012bs*) are woven, and a few other silk fabrics are made in the latter city. At both places, turbans are more commonly made of fine cotton, ornamented with stripes and bars of silk and gold thread. The Koh\u0101t *lung\u012b* is richly ornamented with coloured silk bars and stripes at the ends, something like the familiar Algerian stripes. The pattern is known as the Bangash *lung\u012b*, and, like the check of a Scottish tartan, is distinctive of a particular *khel* or clan.\n\nThe stitch peculiar to frontier embroideries is that known as herring bone, and is the most characteristic feature of the indigenous embroideries of India. In every District wraps, known as *phulkarris*, are embroidered with silk, those of Haz\u0101ra being of special excellence. White drawn embroidery (*chikan doz*) is made in Pesh\u0101war, and some of the patterns worked on fine muslin are of exquisite fineness and beauty. It is chiefly applied to the veils (*burkas*) worn by Muhammadian ladies, and to quilts or *soznis*.\n\nThe ornaments worn on the frontier are few and simple, and differ little from those in other parts of Northern India. At Pesh\u0101war massive necklets of characteristic patterns, and bangles forming a single curved roll with open-work perforations, are made. In Haz\u0101ra silver is wrought into necklaces and other articles, plates are cut out in the form of a cartouche, made convex and roughly embossed and engraved, the ground being filled in with imitation enamel in green and red. Personal ornaments are sometimes crudely enamelled in blue and yellow, while occasionally the pattern is emphasized by being roughly gilt.\nBefore the introduction of British rule, swords and matchlocks were made in almost every part of the frontier, and Peshawar still produces sword-blades and knives, while the manufacture of firearms, once an important industry, now flourishes in the Kohat Pass.\n\nCopper-ware, tinned for Muhammadan domestic use, is one of the specialities of Peshawar. It is all hammered work, the patterns being engraved and often loaded with lac. Trays, dishes, ewers with basins, and wine-bowls are the usual objects; and the workmen, unlike those of Kashmir who work in the same style, have not attempted adaptations to European uses. The Persian character and feeling of the ornament is much more striking than in Kashmir work, the chasing is simpler and bolder, and the forms are often identical with Persian originals, which in their turn were copied from Tatar vessels. Very little brass-ware is made, its use being mainly confined to Hindus, who are not numerous in the Province.\n\nAt Peshawar glazed earthenware or faience is manufactured for native use. The reddish earth body or paste is coated with a dressing of white earth, forming the slip or engobe. It is then dipped into a glaze, of which the basis is lead oxide. Rude patterns in manganese are outlined on the unburnt glaze, and filled in with oxide of copper, the result being green leaves, outlined in brown, on a dirty greenish white. Besides glazed ware, earthen vessels decorated with fleeting water-coloured painting or in coarsely pencilled parti-coloured patterns, and glass phials and bottles are made at Peshawar. Hazara and Bannu produce a very good quality of unglazed earthenware.\n\nBoats are built in some numbers in Peshawar District; and the carpentry of the city is above the average, a speciality being pinjra, a kind of lattice-work, in walnut and other woods, in which the tracery consists of small laths, arranged in geometrical patterns with their edges displayed. The charm of this work lies in the fact that each small piece is fitted to the other by means of a minute joint, no glue being used. The lac turnery, carried on at Dera Ismail Khan, is of considerable artistic merit, and is applied to larger articles than is usual in this class of work, the small round tables being well-known. The general tone of colour is subdued and almost sombre, red, black, and dark green, relieved by a little grey, being the principal colours, with ornaments in amalgam, which have the effect of dull silvery lines. The pattern is always inscribed with a style, and in certain parts the lines are filled with amalgam. Ivory and camel-bone ornaments in the shape of knobs, studs, and flowers are liberally employed. The lac-ware of Bannu is bolder in design, and of some merit, though in technique it is inferior to that of Dera Ismail Khan. The charpais or beds of the Wazirs are so contrived that they can be used as chairs in the daytime.\n\nThe tanners of the frontier make richly embroidered leathern belts,\nwith powder flasks, bullet cases, flint and steel pouches, and other accoutrements attached. They also make sheep-skin coats or postins (inferior to those imported), water-bottles, mule trunks, and a certain amount of saddlery. The shoes have a great reputation, and articles in embossed leather are produced at the same place.\n\nOrganized industries are still in their infancy; and the only factories are one at Pesh\u0101war for ginning and cleaning cotton, and ice factories at Bannu and Koh\u0101t.\n\nThe North-West Frontier Province, with a territory for the most part sparsely inhabited, and without manufactures or a large surplus of agricultural products, owes its commercial importance to the fact that it lies across the great trade-routes which connect trans-border tribal territories and the marts of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and Central Asia with India. These routes are determined mainly by geographical and, to some extent, by political conditions. The imports from Buner and B\u0101jaur come through Naushahra. Most of this traffic still comes over the Malakand Pass, but the pacification of the country is leading to a more general use of the shorter routes, via the Sh\u0101hkot and Mur\u0101d passes and the Totai road. Commerce with Tir\u0101h passes through Pesh\u0101war and Koh\u0101t. The trade of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n comes down wholly through those two Districts and the Tochi and Gomal valleys. The bulk of it is carried on with Pesh\u0101war by the Khyber Pass, which is open for traffic two days a week under the protection of the Khyber Rifles. Some of the trade also crosses the Peiwar Kotal into the Kurram valley and thence down to Koh\u0101t. Next in importance is the Gomal route, which has been steadily increasing in popularity since the pacification which followed the Mahs\u016bd blockade of 1901\u20132. The Chuhar Khel Dh\u0101na and Vihowa Kharr routes, once important, are being abandoned by the nomad tribes of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n for the more developed route by rail through Baluchist\u0101n, and now only supply local needs in the country east of Kal\u0101t-i-Ghilzai and Ghazni. The trade is borne on camels which travel in caravans; and the owners, the Powindas, or nomad merchants, generally pass through the Province, without breaking bulk, to Lahore, Amritsar, and Mult\u0101n, or, if they can afford the journey, to Calcutta and Bombay. Pesh\u0101war city carries on a considerable trade with Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, but is too remote from the lower Provinces of India to form an entrep\u00f4t for the Central Asian trade, and an attempt made in 1869 to establish a fair there failed. The trade with Bokh\u0101ra, once important and lucrative, has steadily declined under the double system of transit and customs dues levied by the Am\u012br of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and the Russians, who have included Bokh\u0101ra in their customs system. Such of the trade as still survives is being diverted to the Batoum-Bombay sea route.\nThe trade which is carried along these routes is registered at convenient places near the entrances to the passes traversed by the caravans.\n\nFrom Buner are imported sheep, goats, grain, pulses, hides and skins, and ghi. From B\u0101jaur come similar products, with cordage and mats, oils, timber, and wool. From Tir\u0101h are imported cordage, ropes, raw fibre, fruit, vegetables and nuts, hides and skins, leather, mats, and timber. The imports from K\u0101bul are chiefly sheep and goats, fruits, nuts and vegetables, wheat, asafoetida and other drugs, hides and skins, mats, ghi, timber, silk, and wool. The trade has greatly increased since 1901, when the severe restrictions imposed on it by the late Am\u012br, Abdur Rahm\u0101n, were partially removed.\n\nThe chief exports across the border are cotton piece-goods, twist and yarn, salt, sugar, tea, tobacco, hardware, metals, leather, dyeing materials, silver, and coin.\n\nStatistics of the trans-border trade are given in Table VII A on p. 215. It will be observed that in 1903\u20134 the value of exports exceeded that of imports by Rs. 44,12,000, and that the excess of treasure exported amounted to Rs. 2,64,000.\n\nThe value in 1903\u20134 of the trade carried on with the principal territories, as far as this is registered, is shown below, in thousands of rupees. The trade with K\u0101bul includes that with Central Asia; and that with B\u0101jaur includes the large and increasing commerce with Sw\u0101t, Chitr\u0101l, and the countries east of the Hindu Kush.\n\n|                  | Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n | Tir\u0101h. | B\u0101jaur. | Buner. |\n|------------------|-------------|--------|---------|-------|\n| Imports from     | 29,84       | 3,96   | 33,18   | 1,97  |\n| Exports to       | 51,48       | 4,72   | 55,91   | 3,61  |\n\nTable VII on p. 214 shows the rail-borne trade with other Provinces and States in India, and that with Kashmir, which is entirely by road through Haz\u0101ra District. Cotton piece-goods, metals, tea, and woollen goods are the principal imports; hides, skins, apparel (chiefly furs), and tobacco are the principal exports. The general conditions of the trade with Kashmir resemble those of the trans-border trade, in that there is a considerable excess of exports. Ghi is the chief import and piece-goods are the main export. Statistics of the goods carried down the Indus are not available.\n\nThe Province is traversed by the North-Western Railway system of the Punjab, which gives communication at three points. The Attock bridge conducts the main line over the Indus to Pesh\u0101war, 1,520 miles from Calcutta; and a broad-gauge extension, 12 miles in length, runs to Fort Jamr\u016bd at the mouth of the Khyber Pass. From Naushahra cantonment a\nnarrow-gauge branch runs via Mard\u0101n to Dargai at the foot of the Malakand Pass. The second point of connexion is at Khush\u0101lgarh, also on the Indus, 53 miles south of Attock. Here the river is crossed by a bridge of boats, which forms a link between the M\u0101ri-Attock branch of the North-Western Railway and the narrow-gauge line to Koh\u0101t and Thal; but a railway bridge is now being built across the Indus, and on its completion the Khush\u0101lgarh-Koh\u0101t-Thal line will be converted to the broad-gauge. Farther south there is no railway in the Province, but Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n is connected with Dary\u0101 Kh\u0101n on the Sind-S\u016bgar branch of the North-Western Railway by a bridge of boats during the cold season. The only line open in 1891 was that from the Attock bridge to Pesh\u0101war, 44 miles in length. In 1904 the total length of railways open was 188 miles.\n\nThe railway system is supplemented by several important roads. The grand trunk road runs beside the railway from Attock to Pesh\u0101war, and thence through the Khyber to Landi Kotal. A metalled road, 234 miles long, passes from Pesh\u0101war, through Koh\u0101t and Bannu, to Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, traversing the whole length of the Province. A similar road connects Khush\u0101lgarh with Koh\u0101t and Thal, a distance of 96 miles. From Thal a partially metalled road runs up the Kurram valley to P\u0101rachin\u0101r (57 miles), whence a trade route leads over the Peiwar and Shutargandan passes to K\u0101bul. The roads from Bannu to Datta Khel up the Tochi valley (64 miles), and from Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n to Murtaz\u0101 via T\u0101nk (60 miles), are also metalled. The latter is being extended to W\u0101na (57 miles), which lies a little north of the Gomal. The cis-Indus District of Haz\u0101ra is entered by a road (metalled) from Hassan Abd\u0101l on the North-Western Railway in the Attock District of the Punjab to Abbott\u0101b\u0101d (44 miles), whence it runs through Garh Habibullah to Domel in Kashm\u012br.\n\nAll the metalled roads thus lie in the settled Districts, or in the administered parts of trans-border territories, and are entirely a creation of British rule. In 1890\u20131 the total length was only 294 miles, but in 1900\u20131 it had risen to 448 and in 1904 to 524 miles. Apart from these, and excluding the metalled roads within cantonment and municipal limits, the Province possessed, in 1900\u20131, 4,208 miles of unmetalled roads; but these are often mere camel tracks, with bridges of boats over the deeper streams in the hot season. Roads are maintained from Imperial revenues, and from municipal, cantonment, and District funds.\n\nMail tongas ply between Hassan Abd\u0101l and Abbott\u0101b\u0101d; Pesh\u0101war and Koh\u0101t; Thal and P\u0101rachin\u0101r; Koh\u0101t and Bannu, and thence to both Datta Khel and to Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n; and from the last place to T\u0101nk and Murtaz\u0101. Cher\u0101t and Sheikh Bud\u012bn also enjoy a tanga service in summer time. Bullock-carts, ekkas, and light two-wheeled\ntraps are used on the metalled and on some of the better unmetalled roads; but the great mass of the traffic is carried on pack-animals, camels being mainly employed, though buffaloes and donkeys are also used.\n\nThe navigable rivers of the Province are the Indus, Sw\u0101t, and K\u0101bul. The bulk of the traffic is on the Indus, on which there is a regular trade down-stream to Mult\u0101n and Sind, the boats being generally broken up or sold at the end of their voyage to save the expense of towing them up-stream. As has been said, the Indus is crossed by the Attock bridge, and at Khush\u0101lgarh and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n by bridges of boats. At the latter place a steam ferry replaces the bridge in the hot season. Passengers have often to wade up to their necks through subsidiary channels to reach the steamer, which only plies across the main channel. Elsewhere the ordinary country ferry-boat is used, or the rivers are crossed by means of inflated skins, the possession of which without a licence is prohibited by law, owing to the facilities they afford to criminals.\n\nThe territories under the administration of the Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province form a part of the postal circle in charge of the Postmaster-General, Punjab and North-West Frontier Province. There are only two postal divisions in the Province, which is included with Kashm\u012br in a single telegraph division. The figures below show the postal business of the Province in 1903\u20134:\n\n| Number of post offices and letter boxes | 574 |\n| Number of miles of postal communication | 2,088 |\n| Total number of postal articles delivered: | |\n| Letters | 3,730,272 |\n| Postcards | 3,609,970 |\n| Packets | 472,082 |\n| Parcels | 91,910 |\n| Newspapers | 428,584 |\n| Value of stamps sold to the public | Rs. 216,810 |\n| Value of money orders issued | Rs. 4,601,827 |\n| \" paid | Rs. 2,967,848 |\n\nThough parts of the Province are liable to drought and occasional scarcity, famine conditions have never been recorded in any part of it. Most of the cultivated area enjoys good rainfall or irrigation, or both. The pressure of the population on the soil is comparatively light; the people are enterprising and usually have other resources besides agriculture. These include service in the army, the local militia corps, the civil and border military police, employment by railway and steamship companies as navvies and stokers, and trade, especially in Koh\u0101t salt, and in forest produce in Haz\u0101ra.\n\nIn Haz\u0101ra the holdings are, generally speaking, fairly large; and\nthe rainfall is so copious that during the last twenty years there has never been any serious failure of the crops, except in one or two isolated tracts. Pesh\u0101war District as a whole is practically secure from drought, except in part of the Pesh\u0101war tahsil, where the holdings are comparatively small, and the irrigation from the B\u0101ra river somewhat precarious, and in parts of the Naushahra and Mard\u0101n tahsils, where cultivation is wholly dependent on the rainfall; but even in the insecure parts of these two tahsils the people trade in wool and salt, and are not wholly dependent on cultivation. In Bannu a considerable portion of the cultivated area is irrigated and secure; and though the people of the unirrigated tracts are sometimes compelled to tide over a season of scarcity by migrating with their cattle to more favoured parts of their own or neighbouring Districts, the average rainfall, if small, is sufficient for the light but fertile soil, the surplus of one good harvest covers the deficiencies of many, and a succession of bad harvests is seldom experienced. In Koh\u0101t the rainfall is fairly constant, part of the area is irrigated and practically secure, and the salt-mines and forests in the barren tracts provide those who are most liable to feel the pinch of scarcity with the means of earning a livelihood as carriers of salt and wood. In Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n the rainfall is scanty and capricious; but the Indus valley is never actually confronted with scarcity, and the people in the daman tract, whose revenue is in ordinary years trifling as compared with the crop harvested, migrate in seasons of scarcity to the Indus valley, and when seasonable rain falls return to their own villages and recoup themselves by bumper crops. Many of these tribes, being of Powinda origin, are also able to eke out a livelihood by trading down country. The whole of the Province is thus fairly secure from famine, and no relief is usually necessary beyond suspensions and remissions of land revenue.\n\nThe North-West Frontier Province comprises both British Districts and also the tribal areas under the political control of the British Government which stretch northward and westward towards Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. In 1901 it was constituted a separate administration, and placed under the control of a Chief Commissioner, who is also, in the political areas, Agent to the Governor-General of India. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir H. A. Deane was appointed to this office, which he still holds. His staff consists of members of the Indian Civil Service, military officers of the Political department of the Government of India and the Punjab Commission, members of the Provincial and Subordinate Civil Services, Police officers, and officers specially recruited for the departments requiring special knowledge. The direct administrative functions of government are performed by the Chief Commissioner through a Revenue Commissioner (who is also Revenue and Financial Secretary to the Chief\nCommissioner, Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Commissioner of Excise, Superintendent of Stamps, Registrar-General, Inspector-General of Registration and Registrar of Joint-Stock Companies, and as regards Courts of Wards fulfils the functions of the Financial Commissioner and Commissioner in the Punjab), a Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, a Staff officer for militia and border military police, and a Personal Assistant. The following are the heads of departments: the Administrative Medical Officer (also in charge of jails and sanitation), the Inspector-General of Education and Archaeological Surveyor, and the Inspector-General of Police. The Officer commanding Royal Engineers is head of the Public Works department, but the canals in Peshawar District are under the Irrigation department of the Punjab. The Accountant-General of the Punjab exercises control over the finances of the Province.\n\nThe British territory in the Province is divided into five Districts, of which the largest, Dera Ismail Khan, has an area of 3,401 square miles, and the smallest, Bannu, 1,676 square miles. Particulars regarding each District will be found in Table V on p. 212.\n\nEach District is under a Deputy-Commissioner, and is divided into sub-collectorates, called tahsils, from 2 to 5 in number. A tahsil is in charge of a tahsildar, who is invested with criminal, civil, and revenue powers, and is assisted by a naib-tahsildar, who exercises only criminal and revenue powers. Subordinate to each tahsildar are 2 or 3 field k\u0101nungos or revenue officials, each of whom supervises from 13 to 19 patw\u0101ris or accountants. A patw\u0101ri maintains the revenue records of 4 or 5 villages. Every village has one or more village headmen who collect the revenue, and chaukid\u0101rs or village watchmen. Y\u016bsufzai, Mardan, and the Naushahra tahsil in Peshawar, and the tahsils of Thal in Koh\u0101t and T\u0101nk in Dera Ismail Khan, form subdivisions, each in charge of an Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioner. Peshawar city is also in charge of a subdivisional officer. The District is the unit for police, medical, and educational administration; and the ordinary staff of each includes a District Superintendent of police, a Civil Surgeon, who is also Superintendent of the District jail, and a District Inspector of schools. The Province forms a single educational circle, and only possesses one Forest division, that of Haz\u0101ra, which comprises the District of that name and is in charge of a Deputy-Conservator under the Revenue Commissioner. There are four divisions of the Roads and Buildings branch of the Public Works department, each under an Executive Engineer; and one division (Peshawar) of the Irrigation branch in charge of an Executive Engineer, who is subordinate to the Superintending Engineer, Jhelum Circle, Punjab, and under the control of the Chief Engineer, Irrigation branch, Punjab.\n\nThe territories lying north and west of the British Districts are\ndivided into five Political Agencies\u2014Dir, Swat, and Chitral; the Khyber; the Kurram; and Northern and Southern Waziristan\u2014each under a Political Agent. The principal frontier chieftainship under the political control of the Agent to the Governor-General in the North-West Frontier Province is Chitral, which is included in the Dir, Swat, and Chitral Agency. Other chieftainships in this Agency are the Khanates of Dir and Nawagai (comprising most of Bajaur). Both of these are divided into numerous minor Khanates, held on a kind of feudal tenure by relatives of the chief Khans. The title of Nawab has recently been conferred on the Khan of Dir. In the remaining tribal territories nothing approaching an organized state can be said to exist.\n\nUnder the North-West Frontier Province Law and Justice Regulation of 1901, custom governs all questions regarding succession, betrothal, marriage, divorce, the separate property of women, dower, wills, gifts, partitions, family relations such as adoption and guardianship, and religious usages and institutions, provided that the custom be not contrary to justice, equity, or good conscience. In these matters the Muhammadan or Hindu law is applied only in the absence of special custom.\n\nThe Legislative Council created for the Punjab in 1897 had jurisdiction over the British Districts of the North-West Frontier Province, until by the constitution of the latter as a separate administration in 1901 its jurisdiction was withdrawn, and the Province now has no Council. The following are the chief legislative measures affecting the Province which have been passed since 1880:\n\nActs of the Governor-General in (Legislative) Council.\n- The District Boards Act, XX of 1883.\n- The Punjab Municipal Acts, XIII of 1884 and XX of 1891.\n- The Punjab Tenancy and Land Revenue Acts, XVI and XVII of 1889.\n- The Punjab Land Alienation Act, XIII of 1900, as modified by Regulation I of 1904.\n\nRegulations of the Governor-General in (Executive) Council.\n- The Frontier Crimes Regulation, III of 1901.\n- The Frontier Murderous Outrages Regulation, IV of 1901.\n- The North-West Frontier Province Law and Justice Regulation, VII of 1901, which embodies certain provisions of the Punjab Courts Act, XVIII of 1884 (as amended by Acts XIII of 1888, XIX of 1895, and XXV of 1899).\n\nActs of the Punjab Legislative Council.\n- The Punjab Limitation Act, I of 1900.\n- The Punjab Municipal Amendment Act, III of 1900.\n- The Punjab Riverain Boundaries Act, I of 1899.\n- The Punjab Descent of Jagirs Act, IV of 1900.\n\nThe administration of justice in the British Districts was not affected by their transfer from the Punjab, except that the supreme court in both civil and criminal matters is now that of the Judicial Com-\nmissioner, which has taken the place of the Chief Court of the Punjab. Subordinate to him are the two Divisional and Sessions Judges of Pesh\u0101war and the Deraj\u0101t. As Divisional Judges these officers decide most of the appeals in civil suits from the courts of first instance. As Sessions Judges they try sessions cases, with the aid of assessors, and hear criminal appeals. Thus the Divisional and Sessions Judges in this Province fulfil the functions of District and Sessions Judges in the Regulation Provinces. Appeals in minor civil suits from the Munsifs\u2019 courts are heard by the District Judge, whose court is also the principal court of original civil jurisdiction in the District. The Divisional and District Courts are established under Regulation VII of 1901, which also provides for the appointment of Subordinate Judges (exercising unlimited civil jurisdiction) and Munsifs. The latter are of three grades, the jurisdiction of a first-grade Munsif being limited to suits not exceeding Rs. 1,000 in value. Two Munsifs are also invested with the powers of a Small Cause Court, under Act IX of 1887.\n\nThe criminal courts are those established under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Deputy-Commissioner is ex-officio District Magistrate, and as such is ordinarily empowered to try all offences not punishable with death, and to inflict sentences of seven years\u2019 imprisonment. Additional District and subdivisional magistrates are usually invested with these powers. Assistant and Extra-Assistant Commissioners are, when qualified, appointed magistrates of the first class. Tahsild\u0101rs generally have second and naib-tahsild\u0101rs third-class powers. Honorary magistrates, sitting singly or as benches, also exercise first or second, but more commonly third-class magisterial powers in Districts or smaller local jurisdictions. In all Districts an offender may be tried by a council of elders under the Frontier Crimes Regulation, and the Deputy-Commissioner may pass any sentence of imprisonment not exceeding fourteen years in accordance with the findings of the council. Sentences exceeding seven years require the confirmation of the Chief Commissioner, who has also revisional jurisdiction in all cases under the Frontier Crimes Regulation.\n\nThe revenue courts established under the Punjab Tenancy Act are those of the Revenue Commissioner, Collector (Deputy-Commissioner), and Assistant Collectors of the first and second grades. These courts decide all suits regarding tenant-right, rents, and divers cognate matters in which the civil courts have no jurisdiction. Appeals from the Assistant Collectors ordinarily lie to the Collector, and from him to the Revenue Commissioner with certain limitations.\n\nAs regards the territories beyond the border, the provisions of the Indian Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes, and of the Frontier Crimes and Murderous Outrages Regulations, have been extended (with certain modifications) to the administered portions of the Political\nAgencies of Dir, Swat, and Chitral, the Khyber, the Kurram, Northern and Southern Waziristan, and also to the Shirani country under the provisions of the Foreign Jurisdiction and Extradition Act. The Political Agents in Northern and Southern Waziristan and the Kurram exercise all the powers of a District Magistrate and Court of Session in respect of offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the functions of a High Court as regards appeal, reference, and revision being exercised by the Judicial Commissioner.\n\nThe Registration agency is chiefly official. All Deputy-Commissioners are registrars and all tahsildars are sub-registrars under the Act; but there are also five non-official sub-registrars, who are remunerated by a percentage on the fees collected. In 1903 the Province had 28 registering officers and 9,996 documents were registered. General control over registration is exercised by the Revenue Commissioner.\n\nThe revenue and expenditure of the North-West Frontier Province are wholly Imperial, and separate figures for its finances are available only since 1902-3 (see Table X on p. 216).\n\nFinance. Speaking generally, the receipts from irrigation have largely increased within the past few years in Peshawar, the only District in which they are separated from the land revenue receipts. The land revenue was below the average in 1902-3, a year unfavourable for agriculture. The receipts under this head will be enhanced on the completion of the reassessments now in progress in several Districts. Other heads of receipt show a steady tendency to increase. The expenditure of the new Province, with its growing requirements, also tends to rise. The large excess of expenditure over income is due to the geographical position and political importance of the Province, considerations of imperial policy calling for special outlay under Political (which includes subsidies to tribes, maintenance of frontier militias and tribal levies), police, general administration, and civil public works.\n\nThe character of the land tenures in the settled Districts of the North-West Frontier Province generally resembles those of the Punjab, and only such as present peculiar local features will be here described. Among the Pathans, who own the largest amount of land in the Province, the original occupation of the land may be described as a tribal tenure, a tribe holding a tract of land which was divided into tappas or lots each held by a main subdivision of the tribe; these lots were again divided into blocks, each held by a section (khel) of the subdivision; these blocks were yet again divided into 'sides' (kandi or taraf), held by subsections of the khel, generally branches of what was originally a single family; and finally each kandi was subdivided into shares (bakhra), each held by an individual proprietor. The bakhra did not, however, form a single compact plot of land, for, to ensure equality, every\nkandi was divided into wands according to the nature of the soil and the facilities for irrigation, and a bakhra comprised one or more fields in each wand. These fields usually ran the whole length of the wand, and as population increased the fields became so narrow that their cultivation was difficult. This, combined with the development of well and canal cultivation, has forced the people to abandon the old system of division, and the old practice of a periodical redistribution of holdings (vesh).\n\nA characteristic of the Path\u0101n tenure was the periodical redistribution (vesh) of the land among not only the individual members of a section, but even among the various sections of the tribes as a whole. This redistribution was made by lot, if the majority desired it. The shares on which the original partition was made were in some cases maintained, but in others every male, and in others again every male and female of the tribe, received an equal share. The last method was followed in a remarkably complete form in the Marwat (Bannu District) and T\u0101nk (Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n) tahsils, in which a khulla or 'mouth' vesh was made, every man, woman, and child receiving a share. The period for which a vesh was made was rarely less than five or more than fifteen or twenty years. Even as late as 1904 a redistribution of two large estates in Marwat, based on the existing number of 'mouths,' was allowed, but in many other cases it was held that the custom had become obsolete. The system prevailed more or less in every District except Haz\u0101ra, and among every tribe save the Wazirs. Traces of it still linger in Upper M\u012br\u0101nzai (Koh\u0101t District) and Y\u016bsufzai (Pesh\u0101war); but they are rapidly disappearing, and the tribal shares are now only maintained as a basis for the distribution of water for irrigation, or for the partition of land still held in common. In the unadministered territories, however, the system survives. For example in Buner, and among the Isazai clans, the land and houses held by each clan are still divided among the adult males. In Sw\u0101t the vesh, which originally extended to the whole valley, so that a tribesman had to change land, house, and village periodically, is now limited to the village and the land within its limits.\n\nThe method and standard of assessments in the British Districts of the Province are the same as in the Punjab, but in some, for political reasons, the assessments are lighter. Thus in Pesh\u0101war the demand is only 52 per cent. of the estimated half 'net assets.' In Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n the recent settlement fixed a demand of 71 per cent., and in Koh\u0101t from 70 to 75 per cent., of half 'net assets.' In Haz\u0101ra and Bannu Districts, now under reassessment, the term of the old settlements was thirty years, and the existing demand is extremely light. The term is twenty years in Pesh\u0101war, and that period has been fixed provisionally for the latest revisions in Koh\u0101t and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n. As a rule, the demand is fixed for the term of settlement; but owing\nto the uncertainty of the seasons and the precarious returns from cultivation, fluctuating assessments have been introduced in parts of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and it is proposed to extend the system to Marwat (Bannu). Elsewhere fixed cash assessments work satisfactorily.\n\nOf the Agencies, only Kurr\u0101m and the Tochi valley (Northern Waz\u012brist\u0101n) pay land revenue to the British Government. The former was summarily assessed in 1894 for a period of ten years, and is now being reassessed. On the occupation of the Tochi valley in 1895 the Daurs undertook to pay Government a tithe of the gross produce, and pending a settlement this was commuted into an annual payment of Rs. 8,000 in cash. A regular settlement has now resulted in a demand of Rs. 3,600.\n\nThe Punjab Alienation of Land Act (XIII of 1900) has been extended to Haz\u0101ra, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and Bannu; but it is not proposed to apply it to the purely Path\u0101n Districts of Pesh\u0101war and Koh\u0101t, in which the feeling of personal and individual ownership is strong, and interference with freedom of transfer would be resented. In independent territory absolute free trade in land has been the rule from time immemorial.\n\nSalt is obtained from the Koh\u0101t salt quarries. Under Sikh rule these were farmed to local chiefs. At annexation light duties were imposed, allowances being made to the Kh\u0101n of Teri and other chiefs to secure their co-operation in the new arrangements, and a preventive line was established on the Indus to prevent the export of Koh\u0101t salt to the cis-Indus territory. In 1883 the duty was raised to 8 annas per local maund (102\\(\\frac{7}{28}\\) lb.). In 1896 the duty was increased to Rs. 2 per local maund, and the preventive line was withdrawn, but the prohibition against the export of this salt to cis-Indus territory was maintained. The management of the quarries, which was formerly in the hands of the Punjab Government, was transferred to the Northern India Salt Revenue department in 1899. The Deputy-Commissioner of Koh\u0101t District is ex-officio Deputy-Commissioner of Salt Revenue.\n\nKoh\u0101t salt is greyish to black in colour, but of good quality, chemical analysis showing that it possesses from 87 to 94 per cent. of chloride of sodium. Traders purchase the salt they require direct from the miners under the supervision of the officers of the Salt department. Since 1903 the duty has been Rs. 1\u20138 per maund of 82 lb. The quarries are at Jatta, M\u0101lg\u012bn, Bah\u0101dur Khel, and Kharak. A little cis-Indus rock-salt is imported, but practically all the salt consumed in the Province is obtained from the local source. About half the salt produced in the Koh\u0101t quarries is exported to Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, Tir\u0101h, Buner, and the Dir, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l Agency. The registered export to Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n amounted in 1903\u20134 to 1,285 tons, compared with 564 tons in 1901\u20132.\nDetails of the quantities of salt sold for consumption within the Districts which lie west of the Indus in this Province and the Punjab, and of the revenue derived therefrom, are given in the following table:\n\n| Year       | Salt sold at the mines in Koh\u0101t District | Salt imported from cis-Indus mines Division | Salt exported beyond the Province | Salt placed for consumption in the area described | Gross revenue realized, exclusive of miscellaneous receipts |\n|------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1880\u20131     |                                          |                                             |                                  |                                                  | Rs.                                                       |\n| 1889\u201390    | 20,614                                   | Figures not available                       |                                  |                                                  | 1,79,624                                                  |\n| 1890\u20131     | 20,372                                   | Figures not available                       |                                  |                                                  | 3,55,878                                                  |\n| 1899\u20131900  | 16,011                                   | 100                                          | 9,913                            | 6,285                                            | 7,01,510                                                  |\n| 1903\u20134     | 16,464                                   | 325                                          | 8,563                            | 8,183                                            | 6,73,965                                                  |\n\nThe incidence of consumption per head was 11.11 lb. in 1898\u20139, 7.01 lb. in 1900\u20131, and 7.43 lb. in 1903\u20134.\n\nThe people being mainly Muhammadan generally abstain from the use of intoxicating liquors, but not from drugs. Opium and charas are consumed in considerable quantities in Pesh\u0101war and the tribal territories which adjoin that District, their place being taken by bhang in the two southern Districts of the Province. The use of spirituous liquor is virtually confined to the Hindu townspeople and the immigrant population of the cantonments. The consumption of intoxicants is, however, low as compared with the Punjab, being in 1903\u20134 only 10.61 gallons of Indian spirit, 1.45 seers of opium, and 4.43 seers of hemp drugs for every 1,000 of the population in British Districts. Whether the consumption is increasing or not it is impossible to say, as the population from which consumers are mostly drawn is to a large extent immigrant and varies in numbers. The incidence of consumption during the triennium ending 1903\u20134 shows a slight downward tendency.\n\nPrior to annexation, the poppy was cultivated only to a limited extent in the frontier Districts, and its cultivation was gradually interdicted until, at the time of the formation of the Province in 1901, it had entirely ceased. The opium consumed now comes entirely from outside. The annual consumption is small, amounting to only 60 or 70 maunds a year; and, of this, 24 maunds are allotted to the Province out of the 200 maunds of Bengal opium which the Benares Agency supplies annually to the Punjab. The latter is sold retail at Rs. 16 a seer, of which sum Rs. 7\u20138 is credited to the Province. M\u0101lw\u0101 opium is imported direct from Ajmer and pays duty at the rate of Rs. 4 per seer, while some Kashmir and Afgh\u0101n opium is admitted on payment of half that duty. Opium is produced in the Punjab, and opium which has already paid duty in that Province is admitted free of duty. The Province could be easily supplied with almost all the opium\nit needs from the Jalalabad valley of Afghanistan, but that source of supply is uncertain owing to the unsettled excise policy of the Amir.\n\nCountry spirit is prepared in two Government distilleries, at Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, which supply Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan Districts, Peshawar, Hazara, and Kohat Districts being supplied from the Rosa Distillery near Shahjahanpur (United Provinces), or by wholesale vendors and private distilleries in the Punjab, whence free transport of spirit is allowed. The demand for spirit in Peshawar District is considerable, amounting to about 10,000 gallons a year. This is due to the large consumption in the city.\n\nThere are no breweries in the Province, the Murree Brewery Company supplying the British troops in the garrisons at Peshawar, Cherat, and Naushahra, and the detachments which spend the summer in the Hazara hills.\n\nThe hemp plant grows spontaneously in Hazara, and along the low hills which skirt the other Districts; but most of the bhang used comes from the Punjab, the drug being placed in bond on arrival until the duty (Rs. 4 a maund) has been paid. The consumption of bhang in the Districts of Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan is considerable. Charas produced in Central Asia is imported from the Punjab under bond. On the removal from bonded warehouses, duty is levied at the rate of Rs. 6 a seer. A certain amount of inferior charas from Bokhara is probably smuggled via the Malakand into the Peshawar valley through Chitrail, and to prevent this the Mehtar of Chitrail was required in 1904 to impose a prohibitive duty of Rs. 7 a seer on all charas transported through his territories.\n\nThe number and location of shops for the retail vend of liquor, opium, and drugs in each District are determined each year by the Deputy-Commissioner and the licences are publicly auctioned. Licences for the sale of imported liquors and beer may be granted at fixed fees to respectable merchants in cantonments and to hotel-keepers and refreshment-rooms.\n\nIn the Agencies the Opium and Excise Acts are not in force, but arrangements have been made under executive authority in the Kurram and Tochi for the control of the sale of liquors and drugs. In the Kurram two shops have been licensed and in the Tochi seven, the licences for which realized Rs. 3,940 in 1903-4. The Dauris are notorious for their excessive use of drugs.\n\nThe total excise revenue in 1903-4 amounted to 2 lakhs. Of this sum, Rs. 34,000 was realized on account of opium, Rs. 84,000 on account of country-made spirits and fermented liquors, Rs. 25,000 on account of imported spirits, Rs. 41,000 on account of charas, and Rs. 9,000 on account of bhang.\n\nThe net revenue from sales of stamps in 1903-4 was 2.3 lakhs in the case of judicial stamps, and 1.4 lakhs in the case of non-judicial. In\nthe same year Rs. 99,000 was collected on account of income tax from 1,823 persons. The incidence of the tax per assessee was Rs. 42, and 87 persons paid tax out of every 1,000 of the population.\n\nThe village community, characteristic of some parts of India, is not indigenous among the Path\u0101ns. Its place as a social unit is, to some extent, taken by the tribe, which is held together by the ties of kindred and a common ancestry, real or imaginary. So strong was the communal instinct in the tribes, that by the practice called vesh, traces of which still exist in Sw\u0101t and other independent territories (as among the ancient Greeks, Gauls, and Germans), all lands, water-rights, and even houses owned by any one tribe were periodically redistributed. Before annexation different branches of a tribe, or even different tribes, lived together for mutual protection; but such aggregations were not properly speaking village communities, for the headmen of one kandi or sub-section acknowledged no responsibility for, and claimed no authority over, the members of another kandi. As a result of British rule, something resembling the village community, in which the village headmen are jointly responsible for the whole, has been evolved; but the tribal division into kandis remains very marked.\n\nThe history of local self-government in this Province before its separation will be found in the article on the Punjab. No municipalities were constituted under Act XXVI of 1850; but between 1867 and 1873 Har\u012bpur and Kul\u0101chi, and all the District head-quarters, except Koh\u0101t, were made municipalities under Act XV of 1867. By 1883, Act IV of 1873 had been extended to these, as well as to Koh\u0101t and five of the smaller towns, raising the number of municipalities to twelve. These were reconstituted under Act XIII of 1884, and again under Act XX of 1891, excepting the municipalities of Shankargarh and Pah\u0101rpur, which were abolished. The Province now possesses ten municipalities, which, in 1904, contained 162 appointed members, and 50 sitting ex officio. Of these, 51 were officials and only 23 Europeans. The total population within municipal limits in 1901 was 186,375, of whom 73,343 were enumerated in Pesh\u0101war, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n and Koh\u0101t being the only other municipalities with a population exceeding 10,000. In 1893 the town of T\u0101nk was declared a \u2018notified area\u2019 under the Act of 1891, and in 1903 the small sanitaria of Dunga Gali and Nathia Gali (the summer head-quarters of the Provincial Administration) were similarly constituted. Table XI on p. 217 gives the chief items of municipal income and expenditure. The incidence of taxation in 1903-4 was Rs. 2, and that of income Rs. 2-10-9, per head of the population within municipal limits. Octroi is the chief source of income; and Har\u012bpur, Abbott\u0101b\u0101d, and Pesh\u0101war are the only municipalities in which other forms of taxation are in force.\nEach of the five Districts of the Province has a District board, constituted under Act XX of 1883. The members are all appointed by the Chief Commissioner. In the Haripur and Abbott\u0101b\u0101d tahsils of Haz\u0101ra District the elective system was in force till 1903, when it was abolished. The total number of members in 1904 was 216, of whom 49 were appointed ex officio and 167 nominated. The two local boards of Bannu and Marwat, which existed when the Province was first constituted, were abolished in 1904.\n\nThe income of a District board is mainly derived from the local rate, a consolidated cess of Rs. 10\u20136\u20138 per cent. on the land revenue. The expenditure is chiefly on education, the maintenance of dispensaries, vaccination, roads and resthouses, arboriculture, ferries, cattle-pounds, horse-breeding, and horse and cattle fairs. The greater part of the income being ear-marked, there is little room for local initiative; and, as in the Punjab, the District boards are chiefly useful as consultative bodies.\n\nAll public works, except canals and railways, are in charge of the Commanding Royal Engineer, North-West Frontier Province, an officer of the Military Works department, who is also ex officio Secretary to the Chief Commissioner.\n\nPublic works. The revenue administration and maintenance of the Sw\u0101t River and K\u0101bul River Canals and the maintenance of the B\u0101r\u0101 River Canal are in charge of the Chief Engineer, Irrigation branch, Punjab, who is also ex-officio Secretary to the Chief Commissioner. The canals are directly managed by an Executive Engineer with head-quarters at Mard\u0101n, whose division is included in the circle of the Superintending Engineer, Jhelum Circle, Punjab. The Sw\u0101t River Canal was opened in 1885. It was primarily constructed as a protective work, but has proved very remunerative, and irrigated a maximum area of about 250 square miles in 1903-4. The K\u0101bul River Canal commenced irrigation in 1893, and in 1903-4 irrigated about 45 square miles. The Haz\u0101r Kh\u0101ni branch, an extension of this canal, is under construction, and in connexion with it a scheme for electric power for Pesh\u0101war cantonment has been designed.\n\nThe total strength of the British and Native army stationed within the Province on June 1, 1903, was as follows: British, 2,946; Native, 19,991; total, 22,937. The Province is garrisoned by the Pesh\u0101war and part of the R\u0101walpindi divisions, and by three independent brigades of the Northern Command. The military stations in 1904 were:\u2014in the Pesh\u0101war division, Chakdarra, Chitral, Dargai, Drosh, Jamrud, Malakand, Mard\u0101n, Naushahra, and Pesh\u0101war; in the R\u0101walpindi division, Abbott\u0101b\u0101d; in the Koh\u0101t brigade, Fort Lockhart, Hangu, Koh\u0101t, and Thal; in the Deraj\u0101t brigade, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, Drazinda, Jandola, Jatta, and Z\u0101m; and Bannu brigade, Bannu.\nAll these stations are garrisoned by Native infantry and, if in the plains, by Native cavalry also. British infantry regiments are cantoned at Pesh\u0101war and Naushahra, British artillery at Pesh\u0101war, and Native artillery (mountain batteries) at most of the other stations. Sappers and miners are stationed at Pesh\u0101war and Drosh.\n\nUp to 1886 a special military force entitled the Punjab Frontier Force, which was under the direct orders of the Government of the Punjab, maintained the peace of the border. In 1886 this force was transferred to the control of the Commander-in-Chief, and its regiments are no longer restricted to service on the frontier. The cavalry regiments are the 21st Prince Albert Victor's Own, the 22nd, 23rd, 25th, and Guides Cavalry. The infantry regiments, which rank as light infantry, are the Guides Infantry, the 51st, 52nd, 53rd, and 54th Sikhs, the 55th Coke's Rifles, 56th Infantry, 57th Wilde's Rifles, 58th Vaughan's Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles, and 5th Gurkha Rifles. Prior to 1899, the garrisons on the north-west frontier were largely scattered in isolated outposts, rendering concentration at any threatened point difficult. Since then a number of outlying garrisons have been withdrawn, their posts being handed over to militia and border military police, the total strength of which forces is just under 10,000 men. Under this scheme Naushahra has become a large cantonment, and mobile columns are kept always ready at Pesh\u0101war, Mard\u0101n, Naushahra, Koh\u0101t, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n.\n\nThe administration of the civil police force in the settled Districts of the North-West Frontier Province is now vested in an Inspector-General. The force in each District is under a Superintendent, who works under the general control of the Deputy-Commissioner (District Magistrate). Three Assistant Superintendents are also posted to Pesh\u0101war District.\n\nAfter the annexation of the Punjab, the police duties in the trans-Indus Districts were carried out by a force known as the Pesh\u0101war and Deraj\u0101t mounted and foot levies or political contingent, which was under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner in each District. This force consisted of local tribesmen nominated by their chiefs, and its cost included subsidies to them. Just as in recent years the disciplined and orderly militia corps have been evolved from tribal levies, so this political contingent, in its civil aspect, was gradually transformed into a regular police force, while in its tribal aspect it has now been supplanted by the border military police. In 1863 the contingent was brought under the general police system of the Punjab, and placed for purposes of inspection under the Inspector-General of Police. In 1870 the Police Act was applied partially, and in 1889 it was applied in its entirety. The constables and subordinate officers of the civil police now form a Provincial service; but the gazetted officers are borne on\nthe cadre of the Punjab police, and receive promotion and acting allowances in the list of that Province.\n\nThe strength of the force within the five British Districts of the Province is 3,006 sergeants and constables, giving an average of one man to 4.4 square miles and to 700 persons. The unit of administration is the th\u0101na or police station, under a sub-inspector, and road-posts and outposts are established where necessary. Nearly four-fifths of the force are armed with bored-out Martini-Henry rifles and bayonets. Every constable is also provided with a sword and baton. In regard to recruitment, the Police department has to compete with the army and militia, which offer better pay and prospects. It inevitably results that the best material is not attracted to the force. The training of constables is carried on in the Districts in which they are enlisted, but the superior grades are eligible for training in the Police school at Phillaur in the Punjab. Crime is watched by a special branch at head-quarters in charge of an Assistant Superintendent, but there is no separate force of detective police. Trained recorders of finger impressions are maintained in each District, but the central bureau used is that at Phillaur.\n\nThe village watchmen or chaukid\u0101rs are appointed by the District Magistrate, on the recommendation of the village headmen. They provide their own arms, and are paid in kind by the proprietary body of the village to which they belong at the rate of Rs. 3 per month. Their duties are similar to those in other Provinces, but they are regarded as acting under the control of the village headmen, and as jointly responsible with the latter for the reporting of crime. In executive duties they are under the orders of the t\u0101hsild\u0101r, but in all matters relating to the prevention and detection of crime and the collection of information they report to the police.\n\nIn the large towns municipal funds contribute towards the upkeep of the local police, and in cantonments special police are paid partly from Local funds; in some Districts ferry police are paid by the District boards. All these, however, are under the control of the Superintendent of police of the District. The Railway police form part of the general system of the Punjab Railway police, and are under the control of that Government. No tribes have been registered under the Criminal Tribes Act.\n\nStatistics of cognizable crime (that is, offences for which the police may arrest without a magistrate's warrant) are shown below:\n\n| Number of cases          | 1902   | 1903   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Reported                 | 6,692  | 6,267  |\n| Decided in the courts    | 4,785  | 4,676  |\n| Ending in acquittal or discharge | 823    | 773    |\n| \" conviction             | 3,532  | 3,487  |\nIn the earlier days of the occupation of the frontier, the British sphere of influence was limited entirely to the plains. Little was known of the tribes living in the hill country across the border, and hardly any control was exercised over them. It was not even until a comparatively recent date that the question was finally decided as to whether many of these tribes came under Afgh\u0101n or British jurisdiction. To guard against the constant incursions and raids of these tribesmen into British territory, the border military police was created out of what was known as the old frontier militia. The force was originally organized purely on the *sillad\u0101ri* system. The leading Kh\u0101ns and headmen living within the border received allowances, in return for which they produced a certain number of horse or footmen. The system naturally led to grave abuses. Vacancies were left unfilled; horsemen were without horses; and boys and old men, equally incapable of work, were nominated as foot-soldiers. The *sillad\u0101ri* system was in consequence abolished, and the border military police is now on the same footing as any other force as regards pay and enlistment. The duties remain the same, but the advance of British occupation and the creation of the new militia corps have contributed further to the peace of the border.\n\nThe border military police corps under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner in each District is commanded by an Assistant Commissioner, usually a military officer in civil employment, except in Koh\u0101t, where the commandant is an officer of police. The men are armed with Martini-Henry rifles, and are employed in garrisoning posts distributed along the administrative border, with a reserve at each head-quarters. The strength of the five corps is 2,061 men, of whom 289 are mounted.\n\nWhen the Agencies across the administrative border were first occupied, they were garrisoned entirely by regular troops; but levies were raised from among the local tribesmen to convoy travellers, collect information, and act as a means of communication between the Political officers and the tribes. From these levies have been raised the present militia corps, which contain an equal proportion of men living on either side of the administrative border, and thus combine the advantages of local levies with the steadying element of outside influences. In all the Agencies except Dir, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l, the levy corps have been disbanded, and the policy is being carried out of relieving the regular troops of the onerous and expensive work of garrisoning trans-border outposts. Chitr\u0101l, Drosh, Chakdarra, the Malakand, Drazinda in the Shir\u0101ni country, and Jandola in Southern Wazirist\u0101n are now the only posts in the Agencies at which a garrison of regular troops is maintained. These corps are officered by British military officers, seconded for a period of five years from their regi-\nments. Their armament is the Martini-Henry rifle, Mark II. Although strictly speaking a border military police corps, the Sam\u0101na Rifles are generally counted in Koh\u0101t District with militia corps; their armament and equipment are the same as those of the militia corps, but their British officers belong to the Punjab police. The total strength of the militia corps is 6,033 men, of whom 336 are mounted.\n\nThe experiment has also been lately tried of raising in Chitr\u0101l a corps of scouts organized on the old feudal system of the country, with the Mehtar of Chitr\u0101l as honorary commandant. The object is the creation of a body of trained marksmen to defend the passes into Chitr\u0101l in the event of invasion. The corps has two British military officers, and the scheme contemplates the training of 1,200 men. The force is organized on an entirely different system from the militia corps, as its members are only called out for training in batches for two months in the year, and when not under training return to ordinary civil life. They are armed with .303 rifles.\n\nWith the exception of the Bhitt\u0101ni Levies in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District, whose absorption in the Southern Wazirist\u0101n Militia is under contemplation, the only levy corps still existing are those in the D\u012br, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l Agency. The D\u012br levies are armed with rifles supplied by Government, but are under the orders of the Naw\u0101b of D\u012br. The principal responsibilities of this force are the security of communications, mail escorts, and the maintenance of order on the Chakdarra-Chitr\u0101l road.\n\nThe Jail department is under the control of the Administrative Medical Officer of the Province. The number of jails (5) has remained unchanged since 1881. Those at Pesh\u0101war and Abbott\u0101b\u0101d are in charge of the Civil Surgeon of the District, while the others, at Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, Bannu, and Koh\u0101t, are in charge of the military medical officers who hold collateral medical charge of the Districts. These are all District jails, and there are no Central or subsidiary jails, long-term prisoners being transferred to cis-Indus jails, while the large judicial lock-ups at Mard\u0101n in Pesh\u0101war District and at Teri and Hangu in Koh\u0101t fulfil the requirements of subsidiary jails.\n\nThe table on the next page gives the chief statistics of jails for a series of years.\n\nThe daily average number of prisoners in 1881 and the three preceding years was abnormally high, a result of the succession of bad harvests which began in the autumn of 1877, and the drain of food-grains from the Province for the armies serving in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. The unrest on the frontier also caused large numbers of persons to be sentenced to imprisonment in default of security for good behaviour. The steady decrease in mortality is largely due to the immunity from typhus fever enjoyed by prisoners of recent years. This disease was\nendemic in the Frontier Districts and more especially in the Pesh\u0101war valley, and caused as many as 58 deaths in the Pesh\u0101war jail in 1881. Dysentery and pneumonia have also ceased to be so fatal as they were twenty years ago. The expenditure incurred on measures to improve the condition of jail life, together with the higher prices of food-grains and other articles, accounts for the steady rise in the daily average cost of maintenance per head during recent years. The earnings for 1881 were unusually large, a result of the employment of prisoners at Pesh\u0101war on the railway then under construction in the vicinity of the jail, while the drop in the earnings for 1901, as compared with those for 1891, is due to alterations in the method of account. The chief industries carried on in the jails are paper-making, lithographic printing, weaving, and oil-pressing. Most of the out-turn is supplied to Government departments.\n\n|                      | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1904 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of District jails | 5    | 5    | 5    | 5    |\n| Number of subsidiary jails (lock-ups) | 1    | 2    | 2    | 3    |\n| Average daily population:\u2014 |      |      |      |      |\n| (a) Male              | 1,649| 1,159| 1,191| 1,233|\n| (b) Female            | 63   | 55   | 43   | 47   |\n| Total                | 1,712| 1,214| 1,234| 1,280|\n| Rate of jail mortality per 1,000 | 70.68| 25.54| 12.16| 14.84|\n| Expenditure on jail maintenance Rs. | 1,10,682| 81,498| 91,048| 87,786|\n| Cost per prisoner Rs. | 64-13-2| 67-2-1| 73-12-6| 68-9-4|\n| Profits on jail manufactures Rs. | 20,418| 10,486| 7,457| 7,084|\n| Earnings per prisoner Rs. | 15-9-2| 10-12-5| 8-13-0| 7-10-0|\n\nAs now constituted, the inspecting staff of the Educational department in the North-West Frontier Province consists of an Inspector-General of Education, a Personal Assistant, and 4 District Inspectors. Most Districts have a District Inspector, but Koh\u0101t, Bannu, and Daur in Northern Waz\u012brist\u0101n are in charge of one District Inspector. The schools of the Kurram valley are inspected twice a year by the head master of the municipal high school at Koh\u0101t.\n\nThe Province possesses no University of its own, and its only college is affiliated to the Punjab University at Lahore. The number of matriculations was 15 in 1891, 98 in 1901, and 71 in 1903.\n\nThe only college in the Province is the Edwardes Church Mission College at Pesh\u0101war, opened in 1900\u20131. Seven of its students passed the Intermediate examination of the Punjab University in 1903.\n\nThe school curriculum is the same as that in force in the Punjab. At the close of 1903\u20134 the Province possessed 25 secondary schools, of which 15 were Anglo-veracular (8 maintained by local bodies, 4 aided, and 3 unaided) and 10 vernacular schools, all maintained\nby local bodies. These schools contained 1,421 pupils, excluding pupils in their primary departments.\n\nAt the close of 1903-4 the Province possessed 172 primary schools for boys, of which 145 were maintained by local bodies, 21 (mostly indigenous) were aided, and 6 unaided. These and the primary departments of the secondary schools contained 11,959 pupils.\n\nThe Province possesses 8 girls' schools: namely, 4 maintained by local bodies, 3 aided, and one unaided. These contained 578 pupils in 1903-4, in addition to which 1,721 girls were receiving instruction in private schools, and 21 in boys' schools, so that 2,316 girls in all were under instruction. These consisted of 1,381 Muhammadans, 781 Hindus, 153 Sikhs, and one native Christian. The municipal girls' schools at Dera Ismail Khan and Kohat admit Muhammadan girls only, and Urdu is the medium of instruction. The other public schools are attended almost entirely by Hindus and Sikhs, and Gurmukhi or Hindi is taught in them. Dera Ismail Khan District returns the largest number of girl pupils (258), Hazara 103, Kohat 85, Bannu and Peshawar 64 girls each.\n\nIn 1903-4 only 110 per 1,000 of the number of Muhammadan boys of school-going age attended schools of all kinds, and only 9,045 Muhammadans attended public schools for boys. Relatively the Muhammadan community is, in this Province, far behind the Hindus and Sikhs, from an educational standpoint. It is, however, progressing and, though progress is slow, there are signs of awakening in Hazara and Kohat Districts. Muhammadan education is especially encouraged by the award of 9 high and 13 middle-school Victoria scholarships annually; and, to foster it among the border tribes, 5 stipends are awarded to Wazir and Shirani boys, and 4 to Dauri boys, and two stipends have recently been granted to Mohmand boys in Peshawar District. Special schools for Muhammadans are maintained at Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, and Abbottabad. All these are elementary, but Peshawar possesses an Islamiya Anglo-vernacular high and an Anglo-vernacular middle school.\n\nIn 1903-4 there were 206 public and 744 private schools, in which 26,439 pupils of both sexes were being educated. This number is equivalent to 8 per cent. of the children of school-going age in the administered portion of the Province. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,91,000. The number of girls in receipt of instruction was 2,326, of whom less than half were Muhammadans.\n\nOnly one newspaper is published in the North-West Frontier Province, the Tuhfa-i-Sarhadd, a weekly Urdu journal issued by the Bannu Mission and devoted to missionary enterprise.\n\nThe Medical department is under an Administrative Medical Officer. Two of the five British Districts and three of the Political Agencies are in charge of whole-time civil surgeons. Military medical officers\nare in collateral charge of the other Districts and Agencies. A military assistant surgeon is in medical charge of the Khyber. Assistant surgeons are in subordinate charge of hospitals and dispensaries at the head-quarters of Districts and subdivisions.\n\nMinor dispensaries are in charge of hospital assistants of different grades. There are female dispensaries at Pesh\u0101war and Koh\u0101t, under female medical subordinates. The supply of hospital assistants is obtained chiefly from the Lahore Medical School.\n\nOf the 39 hospitals and dispensaries, 17 are maintained wholly, and one is aided, by Government. The others are maintained from Local and municipal funds. In 1904 there were 345 beds for males and 130 for females. The most important institution is the Egerton Hospital at Pesh\u0101war, with accommodation for 42 male and 12 female in-patients. It is maintained from Local and municipal funds. An institution for the relief of lepers at B\u0101la Pir's Zi\u0101rat, at B\u0101lakot, Haz\u0101ra District, is supported by private subscriptions and to some extent by Local funds. The Church Missionary Society provides a large share of the medical relief available in the Province. It maintains the Duchess of Connaught Hospital for women at Pesh\u0101war, and hospitals or dispensaries at Pesh\u0101war, Bannu, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and T\u0101nk. These institutions are not included in the statistics attached to this article. In 1901 they treated 1,139 in-patients and 36,960 out-patients, and in 1904 2,527 in-patients and 59,593 out-patients. The number of operations performed was 3,588 in 1902 and 4,330 in 1904.\n\nThere is no lunatic asylum in the Province, and patients are sent to the Punjab.\n\nThe Administrative Medical Officer is in charge of the Vaccination department. There are two divisional Inspectors for the Province, whose duties also include the checking of the registers of births and deaths. Each District has a native supervisor and a varying number of vaccinators supervised by the civil surgeon. The Kurram and Tochi Agencies have each one vaccinator. Small-pox is very common among the Path\u0101ns, especially beyond the border. Vaccination is popular, but its extension is seriously interfered with by inoculation, an art practised by certain families and handed down from father to son. At the same time these practitioners are not bigoted adherents of their system; and excellent results have been obtained in Y\u016bsufzai and neighbouring tracts by inducing them to learn vaccination, and then sending them back to their tribes not as inoculators but as vaccinators.\n\nSurveys in the North-West Frontier Province have been the work of two distinct agencies, the Survey department and the local Revenue establishment. Pesh\u0101war was surveyed by officers of the Survey department between 1863 and 1870, and Bannu and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n between 1874 and 1878; Haz\u0101ra\nbetween 1865 and 1869, and again partially in 1888\u201392; Koh\u0101t was topographically surveyed on the one-inch-to-the-mile scale in the years 1880\u20133.\n\nIn independent territory surveys have until the last two years been possible only when an expedition was in progress. Geographical reconnaissances based on triangulation were carried out in Chitr\u0101l, Dir, and Sw\u0101t in 1885, 1892, 1893, 1895, and 1901, and maps on the quarter-inch scale have been prepared. The more important passes in Chitr\u0101l were again surveyed in 1904\u20135. In 1897 8 B\u0101jaur and Bunur, with part of Sw\u0101t and the Mohmand and Mamund countries, were roughly surveyed on the half-inch scale. A survey of the Khyber and part of Tir\u0101h on the one-inch scale was carried out in 1878\u20139, and survey operations in the latter country were extended during 1897\u20138. The settlement maps of Pesh\u0101war were revised in 1890\u20134; those of Haz\u0101ra, Koh\u0101t, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and Bannu are either still under revision or have been recently brought up to date. Reconnaissance maps of the Kurram valley on the quarter-inch scale were made in 1878\u201380, and the valley was again surveyed on the one-inch scale in 1894 and 1898. The cultivated area is now again under survey, in connexion with the settlement operations.\n\nWaz\u012brist\u0101n has been the scene of desultory operations whenever occasion offered since 1860, and maps of the whole country on the half- and quarter-inch scales exist, most of the work having been done since 1894. Survey operations are again in progress.\n\nFurther information concerning the North-West Frontier Province will be found in the Punjab Border and General Administration Reports for the years from 1851\u20132 to 1900\u20131, and in the Annual Provincial Reports which have been published since 1901; in the Punjab Census Reports of 1871, 1881, 1891, and in the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province Census Report of 1901.

See Goa City.\n\n**Nowgong District** (Naogaon = \u2018new village\u2019).\u2014District in Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 25\u00b0 36\u2032 and 26\u00b0 42\u2032 N. and 91\u00b0 57\u2032 and 93\u00b0 45\u2032 E., with an area of 3,843 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Brahmaputra; on the east by Sibs\u0101gar; on the south by the N\u0101g\u0101 and North C\u0101ch\u0101r Hills; and on the west by the Jainti\u0101 Hills and K\u0101mr\u016bp. The outlying spurs of the Jainti\u0101 range project into the southern portion of the District, while on the north-east a portion of the M\u012bkir Hills, a tract of hilly country cut off from the main mass of the Assam Range by the valleys of the Dhansiri and L\u0101ngpher, is included within the District boundaries. The rest of Nowgong is flat, though a few isolated hills crop up above the alluvium in the south and west, and a low range, known as the K\u0101makhy\u0101 hills, runs from the Brahmaputra to the north bank of the Kalang. The hills are, as a rule, rocky, with steeply sloping sides, and are covered with dense tree jungle, except where they have been cleared for shifting cultivation. The principal river is the Brahmaputra, which flows along the...\nnorthern boundary. A little to the east of Silgh\u0101t the Kalang leaves the parent stream, and, after pursuing a tortuous course through the centre of the District, rejoins the Brahmaputra on the border of K\u0101mr\u016bp. The Diphlu falls into the Brahmaputra east of Silgh\u0101t, and the country north of the Kalang is drained by the Sonai. The other rivers fall into the Kalang, the most important being the Kapili, with its tributaries the Doi\u0101ng, Jamun\u0101, Barp\u0101ni, and Umi\u0101m or Kiling. The District is well supplied with streams and rivers, and there are numerous b\u012bls and swamps. None of these is of any great importance, and many are merely the old beds of rivers that have altered their channels. Along a great part of its course the banks of the Kalang are fringed with a continuous line of villages, buried in groves of bamboo and the graceful areca palm. Elsewhere the scenery is wild, but not unpleasing. To the south and east blue forest-clad hills shut in the view, while on a clear day the snowy ranges of the Himalayas can be seen north of the Brahmaputra. A considerable portion of Nowgong lies too low for permanent habitation or cultivation. A large tract south of the Brahmaputra is covered with high grass, in which patches are cleared for cold-season crops; and there are great expanses of jungle-covered land in the valley of the Kapili and along the foot of the hills. Nowgong is, in fact, the most sparsely-peopled and jungly District in the whole of the Assam Valley.\n\nThe soil of the plain is an alluvium, consisting of a mixture of clay and sand in varying proportions. The northern Mikir Hills are mainly of gneiss, which towards the south is overlain by sedimentary strata of the Tertiary period. These younger rocks consist of soft yellow sandstones, finely laminated grey shales, and nodular earthy limestones.\n\nWhere not under cultivation, the plains usually bear high grass or reeds, of which there are three main varieties\u2014khagari (Saccharum spontaneum), ikra (Saccharum arundinaceum), and nal (Phragmites Roxburghii). Higher land produces ulu (Imperata arundinacea) and other kinds of shorter grass used for thatching. The hills are covered with evergreen forest, and patches of s\u0101l (Shorea robusta) are found here and there.\n\nWild animals are numerous, including elephants, rhinoceros, buffalo, bison, tigers, leopards, bears, and various kinds of deer. Elephants, if their numbers are not kept down, cause injury to the crops. In 1904 wild animals were said to have killed 8 men and 1,246 head of cattle. Rewards were paid in that year for the destruction of 38 tigers and leopards. Small game include florican, partridges, pheasants, pea- and jungle-fowl, hares, wild duck, and snipe.\n\nThe climate does not differ materially from that of the other Districts in the Assam Valley. Between November and the middle of March it\nis cool and pleasant, and during the rest of the year warm and damp. The thermometer at the hottest season seldom rises much above 90\u00b0, but the air is overcharged with moisture and is therefore oppressive. The District, and more especially the part lying at the foot of the hills, has always been considered unhealthy; and this reputation has been well sustained of recent years.\n\nNowgong is to some extent sheltered from the monsoon by the Assam Range, and the annual rainfall over the greater part of the District averages from 70 to 80 inches in the year. The Kapili valley is exceptionally dry, and only receives about 40 inches. The earthquake of 1897 did much damage in Nowgong town, and injured roads and bridges throughout the District.\n\nNowgong has no independent history apart from that of the Assam Valley. Jangal, a Hindu king of K\u0101mar\u016bpa, is said to have made his capital near Rah\u0101 in the thirteenth century A.D.; and several places, such as Rah\u0101, J\u0101gi, and K\u0101jalimukh, take their names from incidents which are supposed to have occurred when this prince was defeated and killed by the K\u0101ch\u0101ri R\u0101j\u0101. The K\u0101ch\u0101ris at one time occupied a considerable portion of the District, but in 1536 they were defeated by the Ahoms and their capital at Dimapur sacked. From this time the Kalang seems to have been their northern boundary, while north of that river the Ahoms were the dominant power. On the break up of the Ahom kingdom, the District was exposed to the ravages of the Burmans, who in 1820 decapitated 50 men on the banks of the Kalang and burned alive 200 persons, young and old, men and women together. After the British took possession of the country in 1826, Nowgong was at first administered as a portion of K\u0101mr\u016bp, but in 1832 was formed into an integral revenue unit. The eastern boundary was at that time the Dhansiri, and it included the Mik\u012br Hills and part of the North C\u0101ch\u0101r and N\u0101g\u0101 Hills. The N\u0101g\u0101 Hills and a large part of the Mik\u012br Hills were formed into a separate District in 1866; but a considerable portion of the Mik\u012br Hills was subsequently retransferred to Nowgong, which took its present form in 1898. Under British rule the course of affairs has been uneventful. On one occasion, however, the aboriginal tribes broke out; when the cultivation of poppy was prohibited in 1861 the Lalungs killed the Assistant Commissioner, Lieutenant Singer, who had been sent to disperse a meeting of that tribe at Phulaguri, about 9 miles south of Nowgong town. The District contains few objects of archaeological interest. There is a Hindu temple at K\u0101makhy\u0101, near Silgh\u0101t, which dates from the middle of the eighteenth century; and ruins of temples and forts have been found in the Kapili valley, which were probably erected in the time of the K\u0101ch\u0101ri R\u0101j\u0101s.\n\nThe District contains one town, Nowgong (population, 4,430), its\nhead-quarters; and 1,117 villages. The population at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 260,238, (1881) 314,893, (1891) 347,307, and (1901) 261,160, the density in the last year being only 68 persons per square mile. The enormous decrease that took place during the last decade, amounting to about 30 per cent. among the indigenous population, and nearly 25 per cent. in the total, was chiefly due to the ravages of kal\u0101 az\u0101r, a very acute and contagious form of malarial poisoning.\n\nAbout 64 per cent. of the population in 1901 were Hindus, 31 per cent. belonged to animistic tribes, and 5 per cent. were Muhammadans.\n\nThe proportion of foreigners (11 per cent.) is comparatively low for Assam. One of the effects of the exceptional unhealthiness in recent years has been to increase the proportion of women, who among the indigenous population now exceed the men in numbers. Assamese is spoken by 66 per cent. of the people, while 20 per cent. speak Mikir and other languages of the Tibeto-Burman family.\n\nThe proportion of higher castes is fairly large, including Br\u0101hmans (6,100), Kalit\u0101s (16,300), and Kewats (13,300). The Koch, who are largely composed of converts from the aboriginal tribes, number 33,600. The principal lower castes are Nadiy\u0101ls or fishermen (18,900) and Jugis (15,000). The Bori\u0101s (7,800), a caste peculiar to Assam, are composed of the offspring of Br\u0101hman widows and other alliances contracted outside the pale of customary law. The chief aboriginal tribes are Mikirs (35,700), Lalungs (29,000), and K\u0101ch\u0101ris (11,800), all of whom are members of the great Bodo family, and are believed to have entered Assam from the north-east many centuries ago. Only 93 members of European and allied races were enumerated in the District in 1901. Agriculture is the staple occupation, and was returned by 90 per cent. of the people at the last Census, a proportion which is high even for Assam.\n\nThe American Baptists have for many years had a mission in Nowgong town, and the native Christians (496) are members of this sect.\n\nThe soil of the plains consists of clay and sand mixed in varying proportions, but the character of the harvest depends more upon the rainfall and the level of the fields than upon the quality of soil on which it is grown. The plains are much exposed to injury from flood. A sudden rise of the Kapili or Kalang and their tributaries is liable to destroy the rice crop, and cultivation in the neighbourhood of the Brahmaputra is largely affected by the action of that river. If the waters rise too early, the summer rice suffers; and if they remain late into the autumn, the ground is left too damp and cold for mustard.\n\nIn 1903-4 the unsettled area was 3,417 square miles, including 142\nsquare miles of 'reserved' forest; and 348 square miles were cultivated, out of a total settled area of 426 square miles. Rice is the staple crop, and in 1903-4 covered 245 square miles, or 61 per cent. of the total cropped area. It is divided into three main classes: s\u0101li, or transplanted winter rice, which is grown on land that is low enough to retain moisture, but high enough to be free from risk of flood; \u0101hu, or summer rice, which is for the most part sown on the chaparis near the Brahmaputra, and to be successful must be cut before the river rises; and bao, a long-stemmed variety grown in marshy tracts. Thirty per cent. of the rice area is usually under \u0101hu, 19 per cent. under bao, and 51 per cent. under s\u0101li, which gives a larger out-turn than the other two classes, but requires a greater expenditure of labour. In 1903-4 mustard and pulse, which are grown in conjunction with \u0101hu, covered 47,000 and 15,000 acres respectively. Other crops are tea, sugar-cane, til, and cotton, which last is raised by the Mikirs in the hills.\n\nThe tea plant was first introduced into Nowgong about 1854; but the soil and climate have not proved as suitable as in Upper Assam, and the industry has suffered from the unhealthiness of the past decade. In 1904 there were 43 gardens with 11,857 acres under plant, which yielded more than $4\\frac{1}{2}$ million lb. of manufactured tea and gave employment to 23 Europeans and 12,461 natives, nearly all of whom had been imported from other parts of India. The largest concern is the S\u0101lan\u0101 Tea Company, with head-quarters at S\u0101lan\u0101.\n\nThe decrease in population was accompanied by a decrease in the area settled at full rates, which shrank by 26 per cent. between 1891 and 1901. Since that date there has, however, been a slight extension of cultivation. Little or no attempt has been made to improve the existing staples by the selection of seed or to introduce new varieties. Agricultural loans were first made in 1902, and since that date a few hundred rupees have been distributed.\n\nThe farm cattle, as in the rest of Assam, are poor and undeveloped, in spite of the abundance of excellent grazing ground; but the buffaloes of the District are fine animals. There is no indigenous breed of sheep or ponies.\n\nIrrigation is practised only in the submontane tracts, where water is occasionally diverted from the hill streams by means of artificial channels. In the plains, the problem for solution is rather the protection of the fields from flood than the introduction of more water. Prior to the earthquake of 1897 there were raised roads along the banks of several of the rivers, which served the purpose of flood embankments. The most important were the road running along the right bank of the Kalang from Kali\u0101bar to Rah\u0101, that along the left bank of the Rupahi, and that along the right banks of the Kapili and Jamun\u0101 from Rah\u0101 to Dabak\u0101. These dikes were breached or\ndestroyed by the earthquake, and since that date considerable damage has been done by flood.\n\nThere are ten 'reserved' forests in Nowgong, covering an area of 142 square miles. Most of these forests contain s\u0101l (Shorea robusta): but the largest trees in the more accessible portions have been worked out, and though there is excellent timber in the Diju, Kukrak\u0101\u1e6d\u0101, and Rangkhang Reserves, the difficulties of transport are considerable. The area of unclassed state forest was 3,436 square miles in 1903\u20134, but this includes large stretches of land covered with grass and reeds and practically destitute of timber. The most valuable trees are poma (Cedrela Toona), gomari (Gmelina arborea), gunserai (Cinnamomum glanduliferum), sam (Artocarpus Chaplasha), from which canoes or dugouts are hollowed out, and s\u0101l and sonaru (Cassia Fistula), which are used for posts. The amount of timber exported from the District is small; and though cane is plentiful, there is very little trade in this product. Rubber is extracted in small quantities.\n\nNo minerals are worked; but iron ore is found in the M\u012bkir Hills, and limestone in the beds of the Deop\u0101ni, Harij\u0101n, and Jamun\u0101 rivers. Coal has also been found on Langlei hill, about 12 miles from Lumding.\n\nApart from tea, the manufactures of Nowgong are of small importance, and are usually practised as home industries, subsidiary to the main occupation, which is agriculture. They include the weaving of silk and cotton cloth, rough jeweller's work, basket- and mat-making, and the manufacture of coarse pottery and of various utensils from brass, bell-metal, and iron. A speciality of the District is the jhapi, or broad-brimmed hat, which is made of leaves and artistically ornamented with coloured cloth.\n\nThe lac insect is reared by the hill tribes, and lac is exported in considerable quantities. Wholesale trade is almost entirely in the hands of M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants from R\u0101jput\u0101na, known as Kayahs. The principal exports are tea, mustard seed, raw cotton, lac, bamboo mats, and hides; the imports include rice, gram and other grain, sugar, salt, kerosene and other oils, opium, gh\u012b, cotton twist and piece-goods, and hardware. The principal centres of trade are at Nowgong, Rah\u0101, and Ch\u0101parmukh, where there is a considerable business in cotton and lac; but the total is not of very great importance. Weekly markets are held for the disposal of local produce, the most important of which are those at S\u0101lan\u0101 and J\u0101luguti. A considerable proportion of the trade of the District leaves it by water. Country boats come up the Kalang and take away the mustard grown in the neighbourhood, while Silgh\u0101\u1e6d on the Brahmaputra is an outlet for the country to the north and east. The trade of the hills comes down the Kapili and its tributaries, and passes by the Kalang to the Brahmaputra; but of recent\nyears a considerable portion has been dispatched from Ch\u0101parmukh by rail to Gauh\u0101ti.\n\nThe Assam-Bengal Railway enters the west of the District near J\u0101gi Road, and after passing 14 miles south of Nowgong town, runs up the Kapili valley to Dim\u0101pur, where it enters Sibs\u0101gar. Lumding, 43 miles west of Dim\u0101pur, is the junction for the main line which pierces the North C\u0101ch\u0101r Hills and runs along the Surm\u0101 valley to Chittagong. In 1903\u20134, 154 miles of unmetalled roads were maintained by the Public Works department, and 192 miles of unmetalled roads by the local board. The most important road is the trunk road, which enters the District near Nakhola, passes through Rah\u0101, Nowgong, and Kali\u0101bar, and then runs along the north of the Mikir Hills into Sibs\u0101gar. The road from K\u0101mpur via S\u0101lan\u0101 to Silgh\u0101t also carries a considerable quantity of traffic. Timber bridges have been constructed over the minor streams, but the larger rivers, such as the Kalang and Umi\u0101m, are crossed by ferries. Daily passenger steamers and large cargo boats, owned by the India General Steam Navigation Company and the Rivers Steam Navigation Company, ply on the Brahmaputra and call at the port of Silgh\u0101t; and in the rains feeder steamers go down the Kalang as far as Nowgong. Except in the west the District is fairly well provided with means of communication, but during the rains roads carrying heavy traffic are much cut up.\n\nNowgong, like the rest of Assam, has never experienced famine. In 1896 and 1900 the rainfall was insufficient and the rice crop suffered from drought, but no measures of relief were necessary. Floods often do damage, but their effects are only local.\n\nThe District contains no subdivisions, and is administered by the Deputy-Commissioner, who usually has two Assistants. Public works are in charge of the Executive Engineer stationed at Tezpur, and the Forest officer is generally a native.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner exercises the powers of a Sub-Judge, and his Assistants have jurisdiction as Munsifs. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie to the Judge of the Assam Valley at Gauh\u0101ti, but the chief appellate authority is the High Court at Calcutta. Special rules for the administration of the criminal law have been prescribed for the Mikir Hills, where the Code of Criminal Procedure is not in force, the jurisdiction of the High Court is barred, and the Deputy-Commissioner exercises the powers of life and death, subject to confirmation by the Chief Commissioner. The Assamese are a peaceful and law-abiding people, and there is little serious crime.\n\nThe land revenue system resembles that in force in the rest of Assam proper, which is described in the article on Assam. The settlement is ryotw\u0101ri, engagements being made direct with the actual cultivators of the soil, and is liable to periodical revision. The District\ncontains a large area of waste land, and the settled area of 1903-4 was only 11 per cent. of the total area, which includes, however, rivers, swamps, and hills. Mustard and summer rice are seldom grown on the same land for more than three years in succession, and the villagers are allowed to resign their holdings and take up new plots of land on giving notice to the revenue authorities. In 1903-4 more than 21,000 acres of land were so resigned and nearly 30,000 acres of new land taken up. Fresh leases are issued every year for this shifting cultivation, and a large staff of mandals is maintained to measure new land, test applications for relinquishment, and keep the record up to date.\n\nLike the rest of the Assam Valley, Nowgong was last resettled in 1893 for a period of ten years; but in 1901 the assessment was reduced by a lakh, as kal\u0101 az\u0101r had not only killed a very large proportion of the population, but had left the survivors despondent and apathetic. The average assessment per settled acre assessed at full rates in 1903-4 was Rs. 2-1-6 (maximum Rs. 4-2 and minimum Rs. 1-11). In the hills a tax is levied of Rs. 2 a house, irrespective of the area under actual cultivation.\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue, in thousands of rupees, are shown in the following table:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue from land | 4.32   | 5.03   | 5.61   | 4.77   |\n| Total revenue    | 9.02*  | 10.09  | 10.34  | 9.88   |\n\n* Exclusive of forest receipts.\n\nOutside the municipality of Nowgong, local affairs are managed by a board presided over by the Deputy-Commissioner. The presence of a strong European element on this board imparts to it an exceptional degree of vitality. The expenditure in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 49,300, rather more than one-third of which was devoted to public works. The principal sources of income are local rates and a substantial grant from the Provincial revenues.\n\nFor the purposes of the prevention and detection of crime the District is divided into eight investigating centres, and the civil police force consisted in 1904 of 24 officers and 166 men. There are no rural police, their duties being discharged by the village headmen. The jail at Nowgong has accommodation for 77 prisoners; female convicts are sent to Tezpur.\n\nEducation has not made much progress. Between 1874-5 and 1903-4 the number of pupils increased by only 46 per cent., as compared with 223 per cent. in the plains Districts as a whole. The number of pupils under instruction in 1880-1, 1890-1, 1900-1, and 1903-4 was 3,844, 5,696, 4,501, and 4,456 respectively. At the\nCensus of 1901, 2.8 per cent. of the population (5.4 males and 0.1 females) were returned as literate. There were 121 primary and 6 secondary schools in the District in 1903-4. The number of female scholars was 110. The great majority of the pupils under instruction were in primary classes, and no girl had advanced beyond that stage. Of the male population of school-going age 19 per cent. were in the primary stage of instruction, and of the female population of the same age less than one per cent. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 45,000, of which Rs. 6,000 was derived from fees; 34 per cent. of the direct expenditure was devoted to primary schools.\n\nIn proportion to its population, the District contains a comparatively large number of dispensaries and hospitals, some of which were opened in the hope of their being able to check the progress of the epidemics from which Nowgong has recently been suffering. In 1904 there were one of the latter class, and nine of the former, with accommodation for 38 in-patients. In that year the number of cases treated was 98,000, of which 200 were in-patients, and 1,100 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 24,000.\n\nThe advantages of vaccination are not so much appreciated here as elsewhere, and in 1903-4 only 31 per 1,000 of the population were protected, which is 13 per 1,000 below the mean of Assam as a whole. Nowgong town is the only place in which vaccination is compulsory.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, *A Statistical Account of Assam*, vol. i (1879); B. C. Allen, *District Gazetteer of Nowgong* (1906).]\n\n**Nowgong Town** (1).\u2014Head-quarters of the District of the same name in Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 20' N. and 92\u00b0 41' E., on the left bank of the Kalang river. Though the Magistrate's court was transferred to this place from Rang\u0101gar\u0101 nearly seventy years ago, it has made but little progress, and the population in 1901 was only 4,430. The earthquake of 1897 did serious damage to Nowgong. Most of the masonry buildings were shaken down, and the level of a neighbouring swamp was raised, with the result that parts of the town lie under water for days together during the rains. The public buildings stand near the bank of the river on a park-like lawn dotted over with fine trees; but the site, though picturesque, is hot, and generally thought unhealthy. The town contains a jail with accommodation for 77 male prisoners, a dispensary with 38 beds, and a branch of the American Baptist Mission. It is connected by road with the river port of Silgh\u0101t (32 miles away), and with the railway at Ch\u0101parmukh (17 miles). In 1894-5 Nowgong was formed into a municipality, and during the next nine years the municipal receipts and expenditure averaged Rs. 10,700. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 10,900, including fees from pounds (Rs. 1,600), and a grant from Provincial revenues.\n(Rs. 5,000), while the expenditure was Rs. 10,800. The water-supply is obtained from excellent masonry wells. The trade of the town is in the hands of M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants. The principal articles of export are mustard, cotton, and lac; and the chief imports are salt, oil, cotton cloth, and grain. No troops are stationed in the town, but 27 members of the Assam Valley Light Horse are resident in the District. The chief educational institution is a high school, which in 1903-4 had an average attendance of 198 boys.\n\nNowgong Town (Naugaon)(2).\u2014Combined civil station and cantonment in the Chhatarpur State, Central India, being the head-quarters of the Political Agent in Bundelkhand, and a station for British and Native troops. It is also the head-quarters of a division of the Central India Public Works department. It is situated in $25^\\circ 4' N.$ and $79^\\circ 27' E.$, 19 miles by road from the Harp\u0101lpur station of the Jh\u0101nsi-M\u0101nikpur section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and is connected by a good metalled road with Satn\u0101 via Chhatarpur and Pann\u0101, also, by a road crossing this at Chhatarpur, with Mahob\u0101 and B\u0101nd\u0101, and with Saugor. Population (1901), 11,507. The cantonment was formed in 1843, when Kaitha in Hamirpur District was given up. It was enlarged in 1869, more land being acquired from the Chhatarpur State. In 1874 Pipr\u012b village and surrounding land were acquired to form the civil limits, which included the Agency and R\u0101jkum\u0101r College (since abolished). In 1857 the garrison consisted of a wing of the 12th Madras Infantry, a wing of the 14th Irregular Cavalry, and 6 guns of No. 9 Native Battery. The troops mutinied on July 10, but did not injure the Europeans, who were allowed to proceed to B\u0101nd\u0101. The garrison in 1905 included a brigade of two heavy batteries, two companies of British infantry, and one regiment each of Native cavalry and infantry. The cantonment magistrate exercises jurisdiction as District Magistrate (including cases arising on the railway), District Judge, and judge of a Small Cause Court, and is also ex-officio Assistant Political Agent. Appeals lie to the Political Agent, who is a Sessions Judge. The station is policed by a force of Central India Agency police, consisting of 36 constables under an inspector, and contains a District jail, a civil dispensary, a hospital, and a school. The cantonment income, derived from octroi, house tax, and conservancy tax, amounts to about Rs. 32,000 a year, and the expenses of administration to about Rs. 28,000. The place has little trade, except that connected with the supply of the troops.\n\nNowrangapur.\u2014Northernmost tahsil in the Agency tract of Vizagapatam District, Madras, stretching up into the Central Provinces and Bengal, between the States of Bastar and K\u0101l\u0101handi. It is open, and is watered by the tributaries of the Tel and Indr\u0101vati. Much fine forest still exists and the valleys are highly cultivated. The area is\n2,172 square miles; and the population in 1901 was 104,145 (chiefly Khonds and other hill tribes), compared with 116,399 in 1891. They live in 1,031 villages. The head-quarters of the tahsil are at Nowrangapur village, where the R\u0101n\u012b of Nowrangapur, a connexion of the Jeypore family, resides. Considerable traffic passes through this tahsil between Jeypore and the neighbouring States of the Central Provinces and Bengal.\n\nNowshera.\u2014Tahsil, cantonment and town in Pesh\u0101war District, North-West Frontier Province. See Naushahra.\n\nNuddea.\u2014District and town in Bengal. See Nad\u012b\u0101 and Nabadw\u012bp.\n\nN\u016bh (Noh).\u2014Tahsil of Gurgaon District, Punjab, lying between 27\u00b0 53' and 28\u00b0 20' N. and 76\u00b0 51' and 77\u00b0 19' E., with an area of 493 square miles. It is bounded on the west by the State of Alwar. The population in 1901 was 145,931, compared with 131,593 in 1891. It contains the village of N\u016bh, the head-quarters, and the town of Hattin (4,301), with 257 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2.9 lakhs. Of the parganas which make up the greater part of the present tahsil, N\u016bh was brought under British rule in 1808, Hattin in 1823, and Taoru (which had been assigned to Bharatpur) after the Bharatpur War in 1826. The high plateau of Taoru is separated from the low-lying tract round N\u016bh by a low range of hills. To the east the country is undulating and water collects in the hollows.\n\nNujikal.\u2014River in the west of Coorg, Southern India, which drains the Sampaji valley. At Sulya it receives a tributary from the Todikana pass and Tale-K\u0101veri, and under the name of the Basavani falls into the sea near K\u0101saragod, in the South Kanara District of Madras.\n\nNundy.\u2014Village in Kol\u0101r District, Mysore. See Nandi.\n\nNundydroog.\u2014Hill in Kol\u0101r District, Mysore. See Nandidroog.\n\nNunke Bhairava.\u2014A bare rocky hill, 3,022 feet high, in the north-east of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, situated in 14\u00b0 44' N. and 76\u00b0 47' E. The Kadambas had a fort here called Lunkeya-kote. In a remarkable enclosed ravine on this hill, with no visible outlet at either end, is an ancient temple of Nunke Bhairava or Lunkesvara, built by a Kadamba prince in the tenth century. It is served by a succession of Gosains from Northern India.\n\nN\u016brmahal.\u2014Town in the Phillaur tahsil of Jullundur District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 6' N. and 75\u00b0 36' E. Population (1901), 8,706. It lay on the old imperial road from Delhi to Lahore and was refounded by N\u016br Jah\u0101n, wife of Jah\u0101ngir. A large sarai was built by her orders, the west gateway of which is still in good preservation. The town has some manufacture of gabr\u016bn cloth. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 6,300. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 6,100, chiefly\nfrom octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 5,900. The town possesses a vernacular middle school, maintained by the municipality, and a Government dispensary.\n\n**N\u016brpur Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil of K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 58'$ and $32^\\circ 24'$ N. and $75^\\circ 37'$ and $76^\\circ 9'$ E., with an area of 525 square miles. It consists of a confused mass of hills, mostly forest-clad, and is bounded on the north-east by the Dhaola Dh\u0101r range which divides it from Chamba. The population in 1901 was 102,289, compared with 104,895 in 1891. The town of N\u016brpur (population, 4,462) is the head-quarters, and there are 191 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 1.6 lakhs.\n\n**N\u016brpur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 18'$ N. and $75^\\circ 55'$ E., 37 miles west of Dharm\u015b\u0101la on the road to Path\u0101nkot, on the western side of a hill which rises sharply from the plain. Population (1901), 4,462. N\u016brpur was anciently called Dhameri (or Temmery by the old travellers), and was renamed N\u016brpur in honour of the emperor N\u016br-ud-din Jah\u0101ng\u012br. The fort, begun by one of the local R\u0101j\u0101s, was finished in the time of Aurangzeb. It contains a curious wooden temple, and excavations made in 1886 revealed the existence of a stone temple of much earlier date than the fort. The carvings on the temple are of a kind unknown elsewhere in the Province. The R\u0101j\u0101s of N\u016brpur are known to Muhammadan historians as the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs of Mau and Paith\u0101n, and N\u016brpur became their capital after the destruction of Mau by Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. They were loyal feudatories of the Mughal empire, and stoutly defended their territory against the Sikhs. Ranjit Singh finally reduced N\u016brpur in 1815.\n\nThe principal inhabitants are R\u0101jputs, Kashmiris, and Khattris, the last being descendants of fugitives from Lahore, who fled from the exactions of the later Muhammadan rulers. The Kashmiris settled in N\u016brpur in 1783, driven from their country by famine, and were reinforced by others from a like cause in 1833. They carried with them the national manufacture of their native valley, that of shawls of pashmina wool, and made the town famous for the production of these and other woollen cloths. Owing to the collapse in the shawl trade which followed the Franco-Prussian War, the trade has dwindled, and is now confined to the manufacture on a small scale of shawls and woollen fabrics of an inferior description. N\u016brpur was for long the chief town of the District, in both size and commercial importance; but owing to the decay of its chief industry, shawl-weaving, it is now much reduced, though still a centre of local trade. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 10,200. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 9,700, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 11,300. The town\npossesses a Government dispensary, and the municipality maintains an Anglo-vernacular middle school.\n\n**N\u016brpur Mine.**\u2014Salt-mine in the Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n tahsil of Jhelum District, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 39'$ N. and $72^\\circ 38'$ E., in the Nilaw\u0101han gorge, about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles south-east of the village of N\u016brpur. It supplies only the local demand. In 1903\u20134, 4,000 maunds of salt were sold. The mine is an old one, worked during Sikh rule, but closed after annexation and subsequently reopened.\n\n**Nursingarh.**\u2014State in Central India. See Narsinghgarh.\n\n**Nurwar.**\u2014Zila and town in Gwalior State, Central India. See Narwar.\n\n**Nuseer\u0101b\u0101d.**\u2014Town in Mymensingh District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Nas\u012br\u0101b\u0101d Town (2).\n\n**Nushki Tahsil.**\u2014The most easterly tahsil of Ch\u0101gai District, Baluchist\u0101n, lying between $29^\\circ 2'$ and $29^\\circ 54'$ N. and $65^\\circ 13'$ and $66^\\circ 25'$ E., at an elevation of about 3,000 feet. The area is 2,202 square miles, and the population (1901) 10,756. The eastern portion is hilly; the remainder consists of a level plain, with sand-hills on the north and in the centre. The great stretch of alluvial plain, known as the d\u0101k, is very fertile when irrigated, but the absence of cultivators and of drinking-water presents much difficulty. The number of permanent villages is ten. Most of them are situated under the hills on the east. Nushki Town (population, 644) is the head-quarters, from which the tahsil gets its name. The revenue in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 10,700.\n\n**Nushki Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of Ch\u0101gai District, Baluchist\u0101n, and terminus of the Seist\u0101n trade route, situated in $29^\\circ 34'$ N. and $66^\\circ 0'$ E., at an elevation of 2,900 feet above the sea, 91 miles from Quetta, with which it was connected by railway in 1905. Population (1901), 644. It came into existence in 1899, when the Nushki ni\u0101bat was taken over from the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t; and a bazar of some fifty shops and buildings for the tahsil, police, and levy establishments quickly sprang up. The place is, however, inconveniently situated, as the water-supply from the Kais\u0101r stream is liable to dry up almost completely in summer. A house and shop tax is levied, and the proceeds are used in maintaining sanitary establishments. The income of this fund in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,800 and the expenditure Rs. 1,300. Trade from Nushki is carried on with Kh\u0101r\u0101n, with Garmsel and Shor\u0101wak in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, and with J\u0101lk and Seist\u0101n in Persia.\n\n**N\u016bzv\u012bd T\u0101luk.**\u2014T\u0101luk in Kistna District, Madras, lying between $16^\\circ 13'$ and $17^\\circ 4'$ N. and $80^\\circ 39'$ and $81^\\circ 3'$ E., with an area of 789 square miles. The whole of it was originally a single zam\u012bnd\u0101ri estate, which by a decree of the Privy Council was divided into eight portions. The population in 1901 was 188,761, compared with 153,628 in 1891. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted\nto Rs. 5,72,000. The head-quarters are at Gannavaram, and there are 230 other villages, besides the town of N\u016bzv\u012b\u1e0d (population, 9,015). The Ellore canal cuts the t\u0101luk into two divisions, the eastern being composed chiefly of deltaic lands, and the western traversed by low hills and jungle. There is some irrigation from tanks, and the t\u0101luk contains the largest of these sources in the District, the Brahmayya-lingam lake.\n\n**N\u016bzv\u012b\u1e0d Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk and zam\u012bnd\u0101ri of the same name in Kistna District, Madras, situated in 16\u00b0 48\u2032 N. and 80\u00b0 52\u2032 E., on rising ground about 24 miles north-east of Bezw\u0101da. Population (1901), 9,015. Around it are large tracts of jungle, formerly its chief defence. It contains a mud fort still inhabited by the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs. Its chief features are large groves of coco-nut palms and mango-trees.\n\n**Ny\u0101mti.**\u2014Town in the Honn\u0101li t\u0101luk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated in 14\u00b0 9\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 35\u2032 E., 21 miles north of Shimoga town. Population (1901), 3,461. The original name was Nematti. In 1245 and 1247 severe fighting took place here between the Hoysalas and Scunas. In 1314 it was an agrah\u0101ra under the former. In 1396, under Vijayanagar supremacy, it was subject to the governor at Goa, who had charge of the Kadamba kingdom. The modern town seems to have been established by the Diw\u0101n Purnaiya at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The merchants are all Ling\u0101yats, and a considerable trade is carried on in exchanging the products of the Malnad for those of the Maid\u0101n. Much money was made here in the cotton trade during the American Civil War. The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 2,700 and Rs. 3,100. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 2,200 and Rs. 2,500.\n\n**Nyaungdon.**\u2014Township and town in Ma-ubin District, Lower Burma. See Yandoon.\n\n**Nyaunglebin Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Pegu District, Lower Burma, consisting of the Pyuntaz\u0101 and Nyaunglebin townships, divided in 1899\u20131900.\n\n**Nyaunglebin Township.**\u2014Northern township of Pegu District, Lower Burma, lying between 17\u00b0 53\u2032 and 18\u00b0 25\u2032 N. and 95\u00b0 57\u2032 and 96\u00b0 52\u2032 E., with an area of 380 square miles. The population increased from 39,447 in 1891 to 64,712 in 1901. The head-quarters are at Nyaunglebin Town (population, 7,627), on the railway. The western portion consists of hills and forests; but so thick is the population in the neighbourhood of the railway, which passes up the eastern plain land, that the average density is 170 persons per square mile. The number of villages is 261. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 188 square miles, paying Rs. 2,22,400 land revenue.\n\n**Nyaunglebin Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Nyaunglebin sub-\ndivision and township, in Pegu District, Lower Burma, situated in 17\u00b0 57' N. and 96\u00b0 45' E., in flat rich country near the north-eastern border of the District, on the Rangoon-Mandalay railway, 46 miles from Pegu and 93 from Rangoon. The town, which is an important centre of the paddy trade, had a population of 7,627 in 1901. It was constituted a 'notified area' in 1902, and placed in charge of a town committee. The income of the town fund in 1903-4 was Rs. 25,500. The hospital has 16 beds, and is supported chiefly from the town fund.\n\n**Nyaungu.**\u2014Town in Myingyan District, Upper Burma. *See Pagan Village.*\n\n**Nyaungywe.**\u2014State in the Southern Shan States, Burma. *See Yawnghwe.*\n\n**Nyehattee.**\u2014Town in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal. *See Naihati.*\n\n**Od.**\u2014Town in the Anand taluka of Kaira District, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 37' N. and 73\u00b0 7' E. Population (1901), 6,072. It has been a municipality since 1889. The income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 5,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 4,980. The town contains three vernacular schools, two for boys and one for girls, attended by 262 and 51 pupils respectively.\n\n**Odalguri.**\u2014Site of a fair in Darrang District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. *See Udalguri.*\n\n**Oghi (Ughi).**\u2014Chief place in the Agror valley, Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, and head-quarters of the Haz\u0101ra border military police.

The population in 1901 was 22,689, compared with 22,280 in 1891. Okh\u0101mandal came under the full sovereignty of the Gaikw\u0101r in 1817; but the W\u0101ghers, who are the aboriginal inhabitants, have often risen in rebellion, and have had to be subjugated repeatedly by both British and Baroda forces. It contains one town, Dw\u0101rka (population, 7,535), and 43 villages. The aspect of the country is a dull and generally undiversified verdureless plain. In the northern part the soil is light red, alternating with a fairly rich black mould. Along the coast it is sandy, but inland it is fairly productive. In the southern portion the soil is also light red, but in many places it is rocky and barren. The staple crops are\nb\u0101jra, tal, and jow\u0101r; and the rainfall is so scanty as a general rule that the tract may be said to suffer from chronic drought. Salt is procurable in large quantity, but its export is restricted by the rules of the Government of India. In 1904\u20135 the land revenue was Rs. 36,000.\n\n**Okpo.**\u2014Township of Henzada District, Lower Burma, lying between 17\u00b0 38\u2032 and 18\u00b0 2\u2032 N. and 94\u00b0 53\u2032 and 95\u00b0 31\u2032 E., with an area of 694 square miles. It occupies the centre of the District, extending from the Irrawaddy to the Arakan Yoma. The population increased from 73,686 in 1891 to 84,046 in 1901, though that of the head-quarters, Okpo, fell during the decade from 10,894 to 3,762, and it is no longer administered by a town committee. There are 436 villages. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 136 square miles, paying Rs. 1,82,000 land revenue.\n\n**Oktwin.**\u2014Township in Toungoo District, Lower Burma, constituted in 1905 from a portion of the Pyu Township, with an area of 646 square miles and a population (1901) of 10,809.\n\n**Old Dihing.**\u2014River in Lakhimpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Dihing, Buri.\n\n**Old M\u0101lda.**\u2014Town in M\u0101lda District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See M\u0101lda Town.\n\n**Olp\u0101d.**\u2014North-western t\u0101luka of Surat District, Bombay, lying between 21\u00b0 and 21\u00b0 28\u2032 N. and 72\u00b0 35\u2032 and 72\u00b0 57\u2032 E., with an area of 323 square miles. The t\u0101luka contains 118 villages and one town, Olp\u0101d (population, 3,275), the head-quarters. The population in 1901 was 58,748, compared with 66,668 in 1891. The density, 182 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. Land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to nearly 5-6 lakhs. Olp\u0101d forms an almost unbroken plain, and the fields are generally unenclosed owing to the low level and the inroads of the sea. Well-irrigation is possible only in a few of the eastern villages. The climate is generally healthy. The rainfall (39 inches) is less than in the rest of the District.\n\n**Ongole Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Gunt\u016br District, Madras, consisting of the Ongole and B\u0101patla t\u0101luks.\n\n**Ongole Taluk.**\u2014T\u0101luk of Gunt\u016br District, Madras, lying between 15\u00b0 17\u2032 and 15\u00b0 59\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 48\u2032 and 80\u00b0 16\u2032 E., with an area of 796 square miles. It is mostly flat, but contains a few hills, of which Chim\u0101kurti is the loftiest, being 2,097 feet above sea-level. The Gundlakamma, the Mudigandi, the Musi with its tributary the Chilakaleru, and the Paleru are the principal streams. The population in 1901 was 224,172, compared with 225,240 in 1891. It contains three towns\u2014Ongole (population, 12,864), the head-quarters, Kottapatham (7,626), and Addanki (7,230)\u2014and 162 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 4,30,000. The predominant soils are black clay and black loam, both very fertile.\nif rain falls. Of the occupied area in Government villages of 288,000 acres, only 2,700 acres are 'wet' land, the rest being 'dry.' Some of the former is watered from the Kistna. Cholam (Sorghum vulgare) is the most important crop.\n\n**Ongole Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and taluk of the same name in Gunt\u00fbr District, Madras, situated in $15^\\circ 31'$ N. and $80^\\circ 3'$ E., on the East Coast Railway, and on the trunk road from Madras to Calcutta, 181 miles from Madras. Population (1901), 12,864. It was constituted a municipality in 1876. The municipal income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 13,900 and Rs. 13,200 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 16,000, the chief sources being the profession tax, the tax on buildings, and tolls; and the expenditure was Rs. 17,000. Ongole contains an industrial institute for the benefit of the native Christian community, under the management of the American Baptist Mission. In this aluminium work and boot- and shoemaking are taught. It also possesses a second-grade college and other institutions for the education of boys and girls, two orphanages for children, and a training school for girls managed by the same mission. Other institutions are a municipal lower secondary school, and a Government training school for the instruction of teachers of classes up to the primary standard. Pulses, ghi, and leather are exported to Madras and elsewhere.\n\n**Oodeypore.**\u2014State and capital thereof in R\u00e2jput\u00e2na. See UDAIPUR.\n\n**Oomta.**\u2014Town in Kadi pr\u00e2nt, Baroda State. See UMTA.\n\n**Ooregam.**\u2014Village in Kol\u00e2r District, Mysore State. See URIGAM.\n\n**Oossoor.**\u2014Subdivision, taluk, and town in Salem District, Madras. See Hos\u00fbr.\n\n**Ootacamund Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of the Nilgiri District; Madras, consisting of the taluks of OOTACAMUND and G\u00fbDAL\u00fbR.\n\n**Ootacamund Taluk.**\u2014The largest of the three taluks in the Nilgiri District, Madras, lying between $11^\\circ 12'$ and $11^\\circ 39'$ N. and $76^\\circ 25'$ and $76^\\circ 52'$ E., and corresponding almost exactly with the old divisions of Todan\u00e2d and Kundahn\u00e2d. It also includes the village of Masnigudi, below the Sig\u00fbr gh\u00e2t, the only village in the District where ordinary ryotw\u00e2ri tenures obtain. The area is 440 square miles, and the population in 1901 was 37,998, compared with 31,602 in 1891. It contains one town, OOTACAMUND (population, 18,956), the head-quarters; and 17 revenue villages. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 38,000. The whole taluk is exposed to the south-west monsoon, the annual rainfall at the westernmost village of Naduvattam averaging 102 inches. Owing to its high elevation, the vegetation is almost that of the temperate zone. Tea and cinchona are largely grown, the latter chiefly at Naduvattam and on the slopes of Dodabetta in the Government plantations. Experiments with jalap are also being\nmade at the latter. Through Ootacamund t\u0101luk runs the Pyk\u0101ra river, the only stream of any size in the District, which leaves the plateau at the north-west corner of the t\u0101luk in two picturesque falls. More than half the area (309 square miles) consists of 'reserved' forest.\n\n**Ootacamund Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Nilgiri District, Madras, and of the t\u0101luk of the same name, situated in $11^\\circ 25'$ N. and $76^\\circ 42'$ E., on the Nilgiri plateau, about 7,500 feet above the sea; distance from Madras city, 356 miles (the last 11 by road); from Bombay, 1,053 miles; and from Calcutta, 1,374 miles. Population (1901), 18,596, of whom 10,770 were Hindus, 2,378 Muhammadans, and 5,345 Christians. The nearest railway station is at present at Coonoor, which is reached by a rack railway up the slopes of the plateau from Mettup\u0101laivam; but the extension of the line to Ootacamund has been taken in hand.\n\nBesides containing the Collector's and the t\u0101luk offices, Ootacamund is the head-quarters of the Madras Government during the hot season, and of the general officer commanding the Ninth (Secunder\u0101b\u0101d) Division and his staff. It is thus the chief sanitarium in Southern India. The possibilities of the climate of the plateau on which Ootacamund stands were first brought to notice in 1818 by two civilians who had reached it from the Coimbatore side, but it is doubtful whether they ever visited the present site of Ootacamund itself. The next year Mr. John Sullivan, the Collector of Coimbatore, within which District the Nilgiris were then included, visited the plateau, and two years later he built the first house at Ootacamund. This was Stonehouse, which has given its name to the hill on which the Government offices are now situated. The name of the station is a corruption of Utaka-mand, a mand, or collection of quaint huts in which the aboriginal tribe of the Todas live, not far from Stonehouse. Mr. Sullivan did much to enlist the sympathies of the authorities in the development of the place, and in 1827 it was formally established as the sanitarium of the Presidency. Mr. Stephen Rumbold Lushington, Governor of Madras between 1827 and 1832, greatly interested himself in opening up the station, and since then it has steadily increased and improved. The figures of population given above do not afford an adequate idea of its size, as the Census was taken in the cold months before the annual influx of hot-season visitors with their servants and following had arrived; but they demonstrate how considerable is the number of permanent residents.\n\nThe station reposes in an amphitheatre surrounded by four great hills: Dodabetta (8,760 feet), the highest point of the Nilgiri plateau, Snowdon (8,380 feet), Elk Hill (8,090 feet), and the Club Hill. At the bottom of the valley enclosed by these, on the slopes of which are built the various residences and offices, was formerly a wide bog through\nwhich wandered a stream that eventually left the valley on the west. The lower part of this stream has been turned into a lake, round which winds a carriage drive; and the upper part of the bog has been filled in and levelled and converted into the Hobart Park, one of the most beautiful polo and cricket grounds in India, round which runs a race-course with a lap of a mile and a quarter. By the side of the Park stands the chief bazar in the station, and farther west, in the K\u0101ndal Valley, is another large collection of native houses.\n\nWest of this again are the Wenlock Downs, a wide expanse about 16 square miles in area, of undulating springy turf diversified with woods and streams, on which are the golf links, and which forms the home country of the Ootacamund Hunt, an institution founded in 1867 to hunt the hardy and fast hill-jackal with foxhounds imported from England. Across the downs and round the outer edges of the plateau run several carriage drives, which wind through beautiful scenery and in places command magnificent views of the low country. These downs and drives, and the possibilities they afford for outdoor exercise, constitute the chief superiority of Ootacamund over the more steep cramped hill stations on the Him\u0101layas.\n\nThe station itself has also a great charm. The somewhat mournful-looking Australian trees\u2014the eucalyptus, the wattle, and the *Acacia melanoxylon*\u2014which have been planted throughout it are perhaps now too numerous to be beautiful; but, on the other hand, plants and shrubs which in England require care and shelter here flourish in an almost wild state with wonderful luxuriance. Hedges round gardens frequently consist of roses, geraniums, fuchsia, and even heliotrope. The annual rainfall is about 49 inches, and the frosts in the colder months are only slight, so that flowers bloom in profusion in every month of the year.\n\nOotacamund was made a municipality in 1866. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 (excluding debt heads and other fictitious items) averaged Rs. 1,40,000 and Rs. 1,59,000 respectively. Loans have been necessary to supplement the deficit. In 1903\u20134 the corresponding figures were Rs. 1,92,000 and Rs. 2,53,000, the chief items among the receipts being a grant from Government, the taxes on houses and lands, and the water rate. The council maintains excellent driving roads throughout the station, has constructed an intercepting sewer to keep the drainage of the main bazar from polluting the lake, supplies the place with water led through pipes from the Marlimund and Tiger Hill reservoirs on the tops of the enclosing hills, controls a weekly market which is in many ways a model institution and is well supplied with commodities from the plains, and is contemplating an elaborate scheme of drainage estimated to cost 3 lakhs. Plague visited the station in 1903; and Government has lent the council money to enable it to open out the more crowded\nparts of the bazars, and purchase house sites for natives outside the centre of the station.\n\nOotacamund contains a branch of the Bank of Madras, a library established in 1859 and possessing about 15,000 volumes, several churches belonging to different denominations (of which the oldest is St. Stephen's, the chief Church of England place of worship), a residential Club, and a Gymkhana Club. The Government Botanical Gardens, situated in a sheltered valley surrounding Government House, contain many rare trees and plants and are in charge of a Curator. They cover 51 acres, and were established in 1842 during the governorship of the Marquis of Tweeddale. The educational and medical institutions of the town are referred to in the article on the Nilgiri District.\n\n**Orai Tahsil (Urai).**\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of J\u0101laun District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 25\u00b0 46' and 26\u00b0 3' N. and 79\u00b0 7' and 79\u00b0 34' E., with an area of 311 square miles. Population fell from 67,702 in 1891 to 59,065 in 1901, the rate of decrease being the highest in the District. There are 105 villages and two towns, including Orai (population, 8,458), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,02,000, and for cesses Rs. 33,000. The density of population, 190 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. Orai lies north of the Betw\u0101, and the greater part of it forms an extensive plain of rich black soil called m\u0101r. This tract is at present greatly depressed owing to a succession of bad years, commencing in 1893, when a hailstorm caused such damage that Rs. 55,000 of revenue was remitted. The Ham\u012brpur branch of the Betw\u0101 Canal, which crosses the tahsil, is being more largely used for irrigating the black soil. In 1899\u20131900 the area under cultivation was 134 square miles, of which only 2 were irrigated.\n\n**Orai Town (Urai).**\u2014Head-quarters of J\u0101laun District and also of the Orai tahsil, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 59' N. and 79\u00b0 28' E., on the Cawnpore-Saugor road, and on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 8,458. Orai was chosen in 1839, probably on account of its position on the Cawnpore-Saugor road, as the head-quarters of the newly-annexed territory of J\u0101laun. It then consisted of a few dilapidated huts, and has been improved to some extent, but still remains a place of no importance except as the District head-quarters. Besides the ordinary offices, Orai contains male and female dispensaries, and high and tahsil schools with about 200 pupils, and is the head-quarters of a Special Judge under the Bundelkhand Encumbered Estates Act. There is a fine tank with masonry approaches south of the town. A municipality was constituted in 1871. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure\naveraged Rs. 9,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 15,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 7,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 12,000. There is no trade.\n\n**Orakzai.**\u2014A tribe of Path\u0101ns inhabiting the northern slopes of the Sam\u0101na range and the adjoining valleys of T\u012br\u0101h. The chief subdivisions of the Orakzai are as follows:\n\n| Strength | Strength |\n|----------|----------|\n| Masozai  | 4,500    |\n| Laskkarzai | 6,500   |\n| Alizai   | 500      |\n| Muhammad Khel | 300     |\n| Daulatzai | 2,000   |\n| Ismailzai | 2,000    |\n| Mishti   | 3,000    |\n| Malla Khel | 800     |\n| Sheik\u0101n  | 3,000    |\n| Alikhel  | 3,000    |\n\n**Oraon.**\u2014An aboriginal tribe whose home is in R\u0101nch\u012b District, Bengal. The members of the tribe call themselves Kurukh, and they believe that they came from the Carnatic, whence they travelled up the Narbad\u0101 river, and settled in Bih\u0101r on the banks of the Son. Driven out by the Muhammadans, the tribe split into two divisions, one of which followed the Ganges and finally settled in the R\u0101jmah\u0101l hills, where they were the progenitors of the M\u0101le or Sauri\u0101 race, while the other went up the Son and occupied the north-western portion of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, whence they ousted the earlier Mund\u0101 inhabitants. The Oraons numbered 652,286 in 1901, and they inhabit the north and north-west of R\u0101nch\u012b, the south of Pal\u0101mau, and the adjoining States of G\u0101ngpur and Jashpur; numbers have also emigrated to the Jalpaiguri tea gardens. Their language is known as Oraon and is akin to Kanarese; it is spoken by 544,000 of the tribe. The majority of the race are Animists, but 156,000 were returned as Hindus, and 62,000 have been converted to Christianity. Unmarried males sleep in a bachelors' dormitory (dhumkuria), and marriage does not take place until after the girls have attained the age of puberty.\n\n**Orchh\u0101 State** *(Urchh\u0101, Ondchh\u0101, or T\u012bkamgarh).*\u2014Treaty State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency, lying between 24\u00b0 26\u2032 and 25\u00b0 40\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 26\u2032 and 79\u00b0 21\u2032 E., with an area of about 2,080 square miles. It is bounded on the north and west by the Jh\u0101nsi District of the United Provinces; on the south by the Saugor District of the Central Provinces and by the States of Bij\u0101war and Pann\u0101; and on the east by the States of Charkh\u0101r\u012b and Bij\u0101war and by the Garrauli j\u0101g\u012br. The State also holds the isolated *pargana* of P\u0101h\u0101rpur in the Niz\u0101m's territory near Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, granted by the Delhi emperors. The original capital was at Ondchh\u0101 or Orchh\u0101. In 1783 it was transferred to Tehr\u012b or T\u012bkamgarh. The latter, which is the name now in general use, was officially recognized in 1887 to prevent confusion with the Tehr\u012b State or Garhw\u0101l. The State lies in the level plain which forms the Betw\u0101-Dhas\u0101n do\u0101b, these\ntwo streams being the only rivers of any importance. Artificial lakes are numerous, several being of considerable size, as at Baldeogarh, Ladhaura, Jat\u0101ra, and Birs\u0101gar.\n\nOrchh\u0101 lies wholly in the area of the Bundelkhand gneiss, a hard greyish-pink granitoidal rock, of simple composition, traversed by conspicuous quartz reefs, which constitute an integral part of this formation and almost invariably strike in a north-easterly direction. A number of basaltic dikes strike approximately north-west, at right angles to these reefs. These dikes are probably disintegrated representatives of the volcanic rocks of the Bij\u0101war series.\n\nJungles cover a considerable part of the State, but consist only of small trees and rough undergrowth, the principal species being the dh\u0101k or chhiula (Butea frondosa), semal (Bombax malabaricum), salai (Boswellia serrata), and various acacias, with brushwood of Woodfordia, Crotolaria, Capparis, and Desmodium. The scanty nature of the jungle makes it unsuited to big game, which is not plentiful, though small game abounds.\n\nThe climate is noticeably hotter than that of M\u0101lw\u0101. The northern part of the State is considered unhealthy, malarial fever being very prevalent there. The annual rainfall averages 45 inches.\n\nThe Orchh\u0101 chiefs are Bundel\u0101 R\u0101jputs, claiming to be descendants of the Gaharw\u0101rs of Benares. The State had no independent existence till comparatively modern times, and its early history is that of BRITISH BUNDELKHAND. According to local records, the first Bundel\u0101 who acquired power in this locality was Sohan P\u0101l, son of a petty chieftain in what is now the J\u0101laun District of the United Provinces, who lived early in the thirteenth century. He appears to have had differences with his father Arjun P\u0101l and to have left Mahoni, the ancestral home. For some years he led a life of adventure of which nothing is known. He reappears as the champion of the oppressed R\u0101jputs against the tyranny of the Khang\u0101r chief of Garh Kur\u0101r, 35 miles east of Orchh\u0101, whose attempts to force the weaker neighbouring R\u0101jputs into matrimonial connexions with his family had raised a storm of indignation. Sohan P\u0101l, after defeating the Khang\u0101rs, established himself at Garh Kur\u0101r, and married his daughter to the Ponw\u0101r (Param\u0101ra) chief of Paw\u0101nya (a village in Gwalior). From this time onwards, the Ponw\u0101rs, Bundel\u0101s, and Dhandelas, a local branch of the great Chauh\u0101n family, formed a separate endogamous group, having no connexion with other R\u0101jput clans, though, according to the State records, these chiefs had married with the great R\u0101jput families up to Arjun P\u0101l\u2019s time. On his father\u2019s death Sohan P\u0101l succeeded to the Mahoni State. Between 1269 and 1501 eight chiefs ruled, who gradually extended the Bundel\u0101 dominions. In 1501 Rudra Prat\u0101p succeeded. He was a bold and successful leader; and, although he came into collision with Bahlol\nand Sikandar Lod\u012b on several occasions, he managed to increase his dominions considerably during the confusion caused by B\u0101bar\u2019s invasion. He died in 1531, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Bh\u0101rt\u012b Chand. Bh\u0101rt\u012b Chand (1531\u201354) unsuccessfully attempted to oppose Sher Sh\u0101h on his march to K\u0101linjar in 1545. On his death in 1554, he was succeeded by his brother Madhukar S\u0101h, who was a religious recluse, and the fortunes of the State began to decline from this time.\n\nThe Mughal forces invaded Orchh\u0101 for the first time in 1577, when S\u0101dik Kh\u0101n managed to take Orchh\u0101 after a severe fight in which Madhukar\u2019s eldest son Horal Deo was killed. In 1591 it was found that the Bundel\u0101 chief had seized some parganas near Gwalior. The imperial troops attacked and defeated him in an engagement near Narwar, and Madhukar had to flee to the jungles, where he soon after died a natural death. His son R\u0101m S\u0101h (1592\u20131604) sued for pardon and was allowed to succeed, but turned out a weak ruler, and the whole State was soon plunged in confusion through the turbulence of his brothers, B\u012br Singh Deo, Indraj\u012bt, and Prat\u0101p. B\u012br Singh Deo, in order to ingratiate himself with prince Sal\u012bm (Jah\u0101ng\u012br), murdered Abul Fazl, the famous author of the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b, near Antr\u012b in Gwalior State in 1602 (see Gwalior Gird). Akbar at once sent an army to capture him, but, although Orchh\u0101 was assaulted and taken, B\u012br Singh Deo escaped. On his ascension in 1605, Jah\u0101ng\u012br installed B\u012br Singh Deo as R\u0101j\u0101 of Orchh\u0101 in place of his brother R\u0101m S\u0101h, whom he confined for a time at Delhi, but subsequently released and presented with the fief of Chander\u012b and B\u0101npur. Of all the rulers of Orchh\u0101 B\u012br Singh Deo (1605\u201327) is the most famous. A man of strong personality and no scruples, he soon acquired large territories and immense wealth. He was, moreover, not only a great warrior but a mighty builder, and has left many monuments of his activity in this direction, as the great palace-forts at Orchh\u0101 and Dati\u0101, the Chaturbhuja temple at Orchh\u0101, and many other edifices within and without the limits of Central India testify. His cenotaph at Orchh\u0101, a huge rugged stone-built erection, which stands on the edge of the Betw\u0101 river facing his great palace, is a fitting memorial of this architecture-loving monarch. He was succeeded by Jhujh\u0101r Singh, a weak but turbulent man, who rapidly plunged his State into difficulties. In 1628 he fell into disgrace, by conniving at the escape through his territories of the rebel Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n Lod\u012b. In 1630, however, when Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n again attempted to pass through Orchh\u0101, Jhujh\u0101r Singh retrieved his position by attacking him. He was then pardoned and sent on service to the Deccan. While absent, he left the State in charge of his brother Hardaul. On his return, suspecting Hardaul of undue intimacy with his wife, he forced him to drink poison. This act has made his memory a byword throughout Bundelkhand, while the un-\nhappy brother has been exalted into a local deity, small platforms at which he is worshipped being set up in every village in the country, and his sad end being the subject of numerous local songs. In 1634\u20135 Jhujh\u0101r Singh went into open rebellion. He was pursued by the Mughal forces, and he and his son were driven into the Gondw\u0101na jungles, where both were killed.\n\nFrom 1635 to 1641 the Orchh\u0101 State was without a ruler and virtually ceased to exist. During this period, however, the Bundel\u0101 clan was represented by the chiefs of Datia and Chanderi and Champat Rai, whose more famous son Chhatars\u0101l was the founder of Pann\u0101. In 1641 Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n granted to Pah\u0101r Singh (1641\u201353), a son of Bir Singh Deo, the chiefship of Orchh\u0101, in the hope that it would put an end to the ravages of Champat Rai. The Orchh\u0101 State, however, possessed but little power, though the chief was always recognized as the head of the clan and consulted in all family disputes. He was followed by Suj\u0101n Singh (1653\u201372), Indramani (1672\u20135), Jaswant Singh (1675\u201384), and Bhagwat Singh (1684\u20139). The chiefs of Bundelkhand served the Mughal emperors loyally in their expeditions to Badakhsh\u0101n and elsewhere. During the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Ud\u014dt Singh (1689\u20131735), the Mar\u0101th\u0101s commenced operations in Bundelkhand. In 1729 Chhatars\u0101l called in the Peshw\u0101 to his assistance, and much territory formerly belonging to the Bundel\u0101s passed to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Ud\u014dt Singh was succeeded by Prithwi Singh (1735\u201352), during whose time more land was lost to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, his circumstances being such that he possessed practically only the town of Orchh\u0101, while his retinue consisted of fifty sepoys and one elephant. S\u0101nwant Singh (1752\u201365) received the title of Mahendra from Alamg\u012br II. He was followed by H\u0101te Singh (1765\u20138), M\u0101n Singh (1768\u201375), Bh\u0101rt\u012b Chand (1775\u20136), and Vikram\u0101jit (1776\u20131817).\n\nVikram\u0101jit entered into relations with the British by a treaty made in 1812. He abdicated in favour of his son Dharam P\u0101l in 1817, but on Dharam P\u0101l\u2019s death in 1834 resumed charge of the State. He died the same year and was succeeded by his brother Tej Singh (1834\u201341). The next chief, Suj\u0101n Singh, died in 1854 and was followed by Ham\u012br Singh (1854\u201374), who received a sanad of adoption in 1862. He was succeeded by his brother Prat\u0101p Singh, the present chief. All transit dues were abolished in 1880. The tribute payable to the British Government for the Tahrauli pargana was remitted for the good services rendered during the Mutiny. In 1884 Prat\u0101p Singh ceded all land required for railways in his territory. The ruler of the State bears the titles of His Highness and Sar\u0101mad-i-R\u0101j\u0101ha-i-Bundelkhand Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Mahendra Sawai Bah\u0101dur, and receives a salute of 17 guns, 2 being personal to the present chief, who was made a G.C.I.E. in 1900, and a G.C.S.I. in 1906.\nPopulation has been: (1881) 311,514, (1891) 333,020, and (1901) 321,634. An increase of 7 per cent. was recorded in the period 1881-91, but during the last decade the total fell by 3 per cent., owing mainly to the severity of the famine of 1896-7. The density is 155 persons per square mile. The State contains one town, Tikamgarh (population, 14,050), the capital; and 706 villages, most of which are very small. Hindus number 306,347, or 95 per cent.; Musalmans, 8,248; Jains, 5,884; Animists, 1,155. The prevailing language is Bundelkhandi, spoken by 94 per cent. of the population. About 40 per cent. of the inhabitants are supported by agriculture and 23 per cent. by general labour.\n\nThe chief castes are Chamars, 36,300, or 11 per cent.; Kachhis, 25,900, or 8 per cent.; Brahmins, 23,200, or 7 per cent.; Lodhis, 22,400, or 7 per cent.; Dhimars, 15,600, or 5 per cent.; and Chhatris, including Bundela and other Rajputs, 15,200, or 5 per cent. The other castes are of minor importance.\n\nThe soil of Orchha is nowhere of very high fertility, the greater part of the country being covered with the red and yellow soils common to the gneissic area. Here and there intrusive dikes of trap have given deposits of a richer black soil. The people distinguish a large number of varieties. The principal are mota, the loamy soil found in the intrusive dikes; kabaar, a brown soil, but of a lighter quality; parua, a yellow loam; and rankar, a rocky soil strewn with boulders. The best soil is found in the Tahrauli pargana to the north. The usual systems of cultivation prevailing in Bundelkhand are followed. The cultivators are assisted by grants of grain and money at the beginning of the sowing season, the State taking a commission of 25 per cent. in kind on seed given, and of 12 per cent. on cash loans. Of the total area, 1,614 square miles, or 78 per cent., are khalsa (State land), while 466 square miles have been alienated in grants (jagirs). About 994 square miles are cultivated, of which 232 square miles are irrigated. Of the uncultivated area of 1,086 square miles, 166 square miles are covered with forest, 601 square miles are cultivable, and the rest is uncultivable waste. Pasture land is ample, but no special breeds of cattle are raised. Jowar occupies 94 square miles, or 9 per cent.; rice, 76 square miles, or 8 per cent.; barley, 71 square miles, or 7 per cent.; til, 70 square miles, or 7 per cent.; gram, 57 square miles, or 6 per cent.; wheat, 47 square miles, or 5 per cent.; and pulses, 29 square miles, or 3 per cent.\n\nIrrigation is confined to the spring crops and garden produce, and water is obtained from tanks, or raised from wells by the Persian wheel. It is a common practice to have the watering done by contract, one-third of the produce of the land being given in payment. Wages for agricultural work are paid in kind, 2 to 3 seers of grain being given to\neach worker per diem. The village artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, who keep the agricultural implements in order, receive shares of each crop.\n\nThe forests of Orchh\u0101, though covering a large area, are not of any particular value, consisting mostly of small trees and scrub. The trees are divided into three classes, those in the first class, which are of value for their timber or fruit, being alone 'reserved.' The first class contains teak (*Tectona grandis*), *achir* (*Buchanania latifolia*), *tendu* (*Diospyros tomentosa*), *bel* (*Aegle Marmelos*), and *k\u016bradai* (*Cleistanthus collinus*); the second class, *seja* (*Lagerstroemia parviflora*), *khair* (*Acacia Catechu*), *nim* (*Melia Azadirachta*), *reunja* (*Acacia leucophloea*); the third class, *chhiula* (*Butea frondosa*) and *salai* (*Boswellia serrata*). The forest work is done by the jungle tribe of Sahari\u0101s.\n\nThough trade has increased considerably of late years, it is not yet in a flourishing condition owing to want of communications. Grain, *ghi*, and coarse cotton cloth are the chief exports, being sent to Bombay and Cawnpore. A little iron is still smelted in a few places, but the industry has almost died out, the guns formerly manufactured in some quantity being now no longer in demand. In the State workshop at Tikamgarh a combined saw-mill, lathe, planing machine, and flour-mill are worked by steam.\n\nMeans of communication are the Jh\u0101nsi-Bhop\u0101l and Jh\u0101nsi-M\u0101nikpur sections of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, with stations at Orchh\u0101, Arj\u0101r, and Teharka. The only metalled roads are the high road from Jh\u0101nsi to Nowgong, which traverses the Tahrauli *pargana*, the feeder road from Orchh\u0101 railway station to Orchh\u0101 town, and that from Tikamgarh which meets the road from Lalitpur. There was no postal system of any kind in the State until 1895. A regular State service was then instituted, with an office at each police station. An issue of stamps was also made. British post offices are maintained at Tikamgarh, Baldeogarh, and Jat\u0101ra, and telegraph offices at the Orchh\u0101, Arj\u0101r, and Teharka railway stations.\n\nThe State is divided into five *parganas*, each under a *tahsild\u0101r*, who is magistrate and revenue collector for his charge. The *tahsil* headquarters are at Baldeogarh, Jat\u0101ra, Orchh\u0101, Tahrauli, and Tikamgarh. The largest *tahsil* is Jat\u0101ra, with an area of 600 square miles, while the others average 300. The administration is divided into three departments, dealing respectively with the chief's personal establishment, the general administration, and military matters. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 is assisted by a minister, entitled the *Mad\u0101r-ul-Muh\u0101m*, who has immediate control of administrative machinery. All matters are referred for final orders to the chief. In judicial cases the chief has full powers of life and death over his subjects, and all final appeals are heard by him. The subordinate criminal and civil courts are more or less modelled\non those of British India, the Penal Code being used as a general guide in issuing local regulations. Cases relating to caste are referred to the Panch\u0101yat (deliberative committee).\n\nThe State has a normal revenue of 7 lakhs, besides 1\u00b76 lakhs assigned to the j\u0101gird\u0101rs. The land revenue is for the most part farmed out to headmen, who are responsible for the collections, though the leases are granted directly by the State to the cultivators. The expenditure is about 6\u00b75 lakhs. Since 1877 several rough settlements have been made, but only for short periods, the last being in 1902. The land is assessed according to quality, the rates varying for irrigated mota land from Rs. 8 to Rs. 4\u20138, for parua land from Rs. 3\u20133\u20132 to Rs. 2, and for unirrigated mota land from Rs. 4 to Rs. 2\u20136\u20135 per acre. The incidence of land revenue demand is Rs. 1\u20132\u20135 per acre of cultivated area, and Rs. 0\u20138\u20139 per acre of the total area. Excise is given out on contract as a monopoly, and brings in Rs. 14,400 a year.\n\nThe conversion of the Orchh\u0101 coinage has not yet been undertaken, the Gajja sh\u0101hi rupee minted at Tikamgarh being still the principal currency. The mint was originally situated at Orchh\u0101, but was transferred when the capital was changed. Gold, silver, and copper coins are struck at this mint.\n\nThe regular army consists of 250 cavalry and 1,000 infantry, and 100 gunners with 90 serviceable guns. The irregulars assist in policing the State, in addition to 150 regular police and 402 chaukid\u0101rs. A Central jail is maintained at Tikamgarh.\n\nOrchh\u0101, like other States in Bundelkhand, is backward in education, only a little over 1 per cent. of the population being returned as literate in 1901. The Mahendra school, opened in 1866, prepares boys for the entrance examination of the Allah\u0101b\u0101d University. There are also 8 village schools with 234 pupils, and one girls\u2019 school with 40 pupils. The annual expenditure on education is Rs. 3,300. One hospital has been opened at Tikamgarh and vaccination is carried out, the annual cost of the medical establishment being Rs. 2,500.\n\n**Orchh\u0101 Town.**\u2014Former capital of the State of the same name, in Central India, situated in 25\u00b0 21' N. and 78\u00b0 38' E., 3\u00bd miles from a station on the Jh\u0101nsi-M\u0101nikpur section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 1,830. The town, which was founded by Bh\u0101rt\u012b Chand in 1531, stands on the very edge of the Betw\u0101 river in a hollow surrounded by scrub jungle. In 1634 the jungle must have been of considerable thickness, as in spite of its low position the Mughals found it a difficult place to approach. In 1783 Vikram\u0101j\u012bt removed the capital to Tikamgarh, and since that time Orchh\u0101 has rapidly fallen into decay. It is now of interest only on account of its magnificent buildings, of which the finest were erected by Bir Singh Deo. On an island in the Betw\u0101, which has been surrounded by\na battlemented wall and is approached by a causeway over a fine bridge of fourteen arches, stands a huge palace-fort, mainly the work of Bir Singh Deo (1605-27), but consisting of several connected buildings erected at different times, the finest of which are the R\u0101jmandir and Jah\u0101ng\u012br-mahal. The R\u0101jmandir is built in the shape of a square with an almost entirely plain exterior, relieved by projecting windows and a line of delicate domes along the summit. The Jah\u0101ng\u012br-mahal, so called from the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br having stayed in it during a visit to his friend Bir Singh Deo, is a much handsomer building. Also built in rectangular form, it is relieved by a circular tower at each corner surmounted by a dome, while two lines of graceful balconies supported on brackets mark the central storeys. These balconies are closed in with fine screens of pierced stonework. Above, the roof is crowned by eight large fluted domes with smaller domes between them, connected by an ornamented balustrade. The whole building is magnificent in its combination of massive strength and delicate ornament, and is perhaps unsurpassed as a specimen of Hindu domestic architecture. Many temples are scattered over the area formerly occupied by the town, the finest being the Chaturbhuj, dedicated as its name implies to the \u2018four-armed\u2019 Vishnu. This temple stands on a huge stone platform, and is a rectangular building with a very plain exterior, ornamented by two large and four small spires, one of which has been destroyed, of the pine-cone variety common in Bundelkhand. Inside it is quite devoid of carving or ornament. The great loftiness of its ceilings, an unusual feature in a Hindu temple, its bare walls, and the arrangement of its sanctuary suggest a Christian church rather than a Hindu temple. Of the other buildings, the cenotaphs of Bh\u0101rt\u012b Chand (1531-54), Madhukar S\u0101h (1554-92), Bir Singh Deo (1605-27), Pah\u0101r Singh (1641-53), and S\u0101nwant Singh (1752-65), all rulers of Orchh\u0101, and their R\u0101nis are grouped together on the river\u2019s edge below the fort. That of Bir Singh Deo, had it been completed, would have been the finest; but the domes were never finished, and it remains a mere rugged pile of stone, massive and picturesque, but with no pretensions to architectural form. Not far from the Chaturbhuj temple is the shrine of Hardaul, where that prince is said to have died of the poison administered by his brother Jhujh\u0101r Singh. Orchh\u0101 is still the head-quarters of a tahsil.\n\nOrissa Division.\u2014Division of Bengal, extending from West Bengal to Madras and from the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau to the Bay of Bengal, and lying between 19\u00b0 28\u2032 and 22\u00b0 4\u2032 N. and 82\u00b0 38\u2032 and 87\u00b0 31\u2032 E. The head-quarters of the Division are at Cuttack City; and it includes five Districts, with area, population, and revenue as shown in the table on the next page.\n\nSambalpur was transferred to Bengal from the Chatt\u012bsgarh Division\nof the Central Provinces in 1905, two large zamind\u0101ris which were previously comprised within that District remaining attached to the Central Provinces.\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cuttack      | 3,654                | 2,062,788        | 13,91                                                    |\n| Balasore     | 2,085                | 1,071,197        | 7,30                                                     |\n| Angul        | 1,681                | 191,911          | 87                                                       |\n| Puri         | 2,499                | 1,017,284        | 7,97                                                     |\n| Sambalpur    | 3,851                | 659,971          | 1,86 *                                                   |\n| **Total**    | **13,770**           | **5,003,121**    | **31,91**                                                |\n\n* Includes Rs. 4,500 (additional rate) and Rs. 18,300 (patwari cess).\n\nIn the Census Report of 1901 the area of Cuttack was shown as 3,629 square miles, of Balasore as 2,059 square miles, and of Puri as 2,472 square miles. The figures adopted above for Puri are taken from the Settlement Report, while those for Cuttack and Balasore were supplied by the Surveyor-General.\n\nThe term Orissa, properly speaking, means the country in which the speakers of Oriy\u0101 form the dominant people. During the period of British rule the name has been applied to the tract extending from the Chilka Lake to the Subarnarekh\u0101 river, which comprises the four Districts first mentioned and also the Orissa Tributary States, a group of twenty-four Feudatory States, with a population in 1901 of 3,173,395 and an area of 28,046 square miles. The Commissioner of Orissa is Superintendent of these States, in respect of which he exercises the powers of a Sessions Judge and High Court.\n\nThe population of the Division increased from 3,554,871 in 1872 to 4,309,923 in 1881, to 4,666,227 in 1891, and to 5,003,121 in 1901. The density is 363 persons per square mile, compared with 438 in Bengal as a whole. In 1901 Hindus constituted 95.5 per cent. of the total; there were 106,889 Muhammadans, 90,038 Animists, and 5,751 Christians.\n\nThe four Districts first mentioned occupy a narrow alluvial tract between the sea and the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, while Sambalpur, lying in the valley of the Mah\u0101nadi, is separated from them by a broken hilly tract and from the Chatt\u012bsgarh plain on the west by a jungle-covered range of hills. The Division possesses a language of its own, and a system of castes differing alike from those of Bengal and of Madras. Oriy\u0101 is also spoken over a considerable area in the northern Districts of Madras and in the adjoining parts of the Central Provinces and of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, while it has largely modified the Bengali of South Midnapore; the distinctive Oriy\u0101 castes are also well represented for a considerable distance beyond the borders of the Division.\nAt the dawn of history Orissa formed part of the powerful kingdom of Kalinga, which stretched from the mouths of the Ganges to those of the God\u0101vari. It was conquered by Asoka, but by 150 B.C. had again passed to the Kalinga kings. Jainism was then beginning to spread in the land; but about the second century A.D. it was succeeded, according to Buddhist tradition, by the latter creed, which was still flourishing in A.D. 640. Subsequently the power of the Kalinga dynasty declined, and Orissa seems to have become independent. In 610, however, an inscription of Sas\u0101nka, king of Magadha, claims it as a part of the dominions of that monarch, and in 640 it was conquered by Harshavardhana of Kanauj. In the tenth and eleventh centuries Orissa is said to have been under the rule of the Kesari kings, to whose rule are ascribed the Saiva temples at Bhubaneswar and most of the ruins in the Alti hills; but the existence of such a dynasty is uncertain. Then followed the dynasty founded by Chora Gang\u0101 of Kalinganagar. These kings were of the Vaishnava faith; they built the famous temple of Jagann\u0101th at Puri and the black pagoda of Konarak. There were frequent wars with the Muhammadans, and about 1361 the emperor Firoz Sh\u0101h conducted an inroad into Orissa in person. In 1434 Kapileswar Deva of the Solar line usurped the throne. He extended his dominions to the south, where Muhammadan inroads had subverted the old order, as far as the Penner river; but his successors were gradually shorn of these additions by the Musalm\u0101n rulers of Golconda. From the north also the onset of the Muhammadans became more and more insistent; and at last in 1568, after a period of civil war, the last Hindu king, a usurper of the name of Mukund Deo, was overthrown by K\u0101la P\u0101h\u0101r, the general of Sulaim\u0101n Karar\u0101n\u012b. Orissa (including Midnapore) remained in the possession of the Afgh\u0101ns till 1592, when M\u0101n Singh, Akbar\u2019s Hindu general, annexed it to the Mughal empire. It was placed under separate governors, but Midnapore and Balasore were subsequently transferred to Bengal. In 1751 Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n ceded the province to the Bhonslas of N\u0101gpur, in whose possession it remained until its conquest by the British in 1803. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s made no attempt to establish any civil administration, and their rule was confined to a periodic harrying of the country by their cavalry, who extorted whatever they could from the people. In 1804 a board of two Commissioners was appointed to administer the province, but in the following year it was designated the District of Cuttack and placed in charge of a Collector, Judge, and Magistrate. In 1828 it was split up into the three Regulation Districts of Cuttack, Balasore, and Puri, and the non-Regulation Tributary States. As already explained, Sambalpur has only recently been attached to Orissa; and an account of its history, which differs in several respects from that of the rest of the Division, will be found in the article on that District.\nOrissa has on more than one occasion suffered from disastrous famines; and within recent times it was devastated by the memorable calamity of 1865-7. The full extent of the crop failure consequent on the scanty rainfall of 1865 and the exhaustion of the local food-supplies was not realized by the authorities in time; and when at last, in June, 1866, an effort was made to provide the starving population with food, the south-west monsoon prevented the ships, lying laden with grain in the port of Calcutta, from reaching the stricken tract. It is said that a quarter of the population died of starvation and of the diseases that supervened. Orissa has now been made accessible by the East Coast section of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, which connects it with Calcutta and Madras; and Cuttack and portions of Balasore have been provided with an elaborate and costly system of irrigation known as the Orissa Canals system.\n\nThe Districts of the Orissa Division are temporarily settled, and a resettlement of all the eastern Districts, except Angul, has recently (1889-99) been effected. The area brought under assessment was 2,950 square miles, against 2,212 square miles at the previous settlement of 1837; and the revenue is 21.05 lakhs, or Rs. 1-1-10 per acre, compared with 13.84 lakhs, or R. 0-15-7, on the previous occasion. The rents payable by tenants were fixed in the course of the settlement operations; they work out on an average to Rs. 2-1 per acre. The term of the last settlement of Sambalpur expired in 1902, and the District is now under resettlement.\n\nThe Division contains 7 towns and 15,416 villages. The largest towns are Cuttack (population 51,364), Puri (49,334), and Balasore (20,880). There are ports at False Point, Chandbali, Balasore, and Puri, and the total value of the imports and exports in 1903-4 was 28.9 lakhs and 53.8 lakhs respectively.\n\nThe temple of Jagannath at Puri is well-known, and the town contained at the time of the Census of 1901 over 17,000 pilgrims. Other famous antiquities are the Lingaraj temple at Bhubaneswar, the black pagoda at Konarak, several temples at Jajpur, and the caves in the Khandgiri and Udayagiri hills.\n\n[Rajendralala Mitra, Antiquities of Orissa (Calcutta, 1875, 1880); A.

They lie between $19^\\circ 53'$ and $22^\\circ 34'$ N. and $83^\\circ 35'$ and $87^\\circ 10'$ E., and have an area of 14,387 square miles and a population (1901) of 1,947,802. They are bounded on the north by the Districts of Singhbh\u016bm and Midnapore; on the east by Orissa; on the south by Ganjam District in the Madras Presidency; and on the west by the Tributary States of Patn\u0101, Sonpur, Rair\u0101khol, B\u0101mra, and Bonai. The names of the individual States are Athgarh, T\u0101lcher, May\u016brbhanj, N\u012blgiri, Keonjhar, P\u0101l Lahar\u0101, Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, Athmallik, Hindol, Narsinghpur, Bar\u0101mb\u0101, Tigiri\u0101, Khandpar\u0101, Navagarh, Ranpur, Daspall\u0101, and Baud. A separate article on each will be found under its own name.\n\nThe States occupy a succession of ranges rolling back towards the centre of the peninsula. They form three watersheds with fine valleys between, down which pour the three great rivers of the inner table-land. The southernmost is the valley of the Mah\u0101nad\u012b, at some places closely hemmed in by peaks on either side and forming picturesque passes, at others spreading out into fertile plains, green with rice, and watered by a thousand mountain streams. At the Barm\u016bl pass the river winds round magnificently wooded hills, from 1,500 to 2,500 feet high. Crags and peaks of a wild beauty overhang its channel, which at one part is so narrow that the water rises 70 feet in time of flood. From the north bank of the Mah\u0101nad\u012b the ranges tower into a fine watershed, from 2,000 to 2,500 feet high, running north-west and south-east and forming the boundary of the States of Narsinghpur and Bar\u0101mb\u0101. On the other side they slope down upon the States of Hindol and Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, supplying countless little feeders to the Br\u0101hm\u0101ni, which occupies the second of the three valleys. From the north bank of this river the hills again roll back into magnificent ranges, running in the same general direction as before, but more confused and wilder, till they rise into the Keonjhar watershed with peaks from 2,500 to 3,500 feet high, culminating in Malayagiri, 3,895 feet above the sea, in the State of P\u0101l Lahar\u0101. This watershed, in turn, slopes down into the third valley, that of the Baitaran\u012b, from whose eastern or left bank rise the mountains of May\u016brbhanj, heaped upon each other in noble masses of rock from 3,000 to nearly 4,000 feet high, sending countless tributaries to the Baitaran\u012b on the south, and pouring down the Burh\u0101balang\n\n---\n\n1 In 1905 five States (B\u0101mra, Rair\u0101khol, Sonpur, Patna, and K\u0101l\u0101hand\u012b) were added from the Central Provinces, and two (G\u0101ngpur and Bonai) from the Chota Nagpur States. These have an area of 13,659 square miles and a population (1901) of 1,225,593.\nand the feeders of the Subarnarekh\u0101 on the north. The hill ranges are densely wooded to the summit, and, except at the regular passes, are inaccessible to beasts of burden. The intermediate valleys yield rich crops in return for negligent cultivation, and a vast quantity of land might be reclaimed on their outskirts and lower slopes. Cultivation is, however, rapidly extending in all the States, owing to improved means of communication and to the pressure of population in the adjoining British Districts.\n\nBesides Malayagiri, the principal peaks are Megh\u0101san\u012b (3,824 feet) in May\u016brbhanj; Gandham\u0101dan (3,479 feet), Th\u0101kur\u0101ni (3,003 feet), and Tom\u0101k (2,577 feet) in Keonjhar; P\u0101nchdhar (2,948 feet) in Athmallik; Go\u0101ldes (2,506 feet) in Daspall\u0101; Suliy\u0101 (2,239 feet) in Nay\u0101garh; and Kopil\u0101s (2,098 feet) in Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Mah\u0101n\u0101di, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b, the Baitaran\u012b, and the Burh\u0101balang. The Mah\u0101n\u0101di enters the Tributary States in Baud, forming the boundary between that State on the south and Athmallik and Angul on the north for 49 miles. It then divides Daspall\u0101, Khandpar\u0101, and Cuttack District on the south from Narsinghpur, Bar\u0101mb\u0101, Tigiri\u0101, and Athgarh on the north. In the last State it debouches through a narrow gorge upon the Cuttack delta. It is navigable throughout the Tributary States by flat-bottomed boats of about 25 tons burden, and carries a considerable trade, which has decreased since the opening of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway; it would afford even more valuable facilities for navigation but for the numerous rocks and sandbanks in its channel. Its chief feeders in the Tributary States are, on its north or left bank, the S\u0101pua in Athgarh, and the Dand\u0101tap\u0101 and M\u0101no in Athmallik; on its south or right bank, the Kusumi and Kamai in Khandpar\u0101, with the Jor\u0101mu, Hin\u0101mand\u0101, G\u0101nduni, Bolat, S\u0101lkib\u0101gh, M\u0101rini, and Tel. This last stream divides the Orissa Tributary States from those of the Central Provinces, and forms the boundary between the States of Baud and Sonpur. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b, which is formed by the junction of the South Koel and S\u0101nkh in G\u0101ngpur State, enters T\u0101lcher from Bonai State, and passes through T\u0101lcher and Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l into Cuttack District. It is navigable for a few months of the year as far as 4 miles below T\u0101lcher, where there are some dangerous rocks. The Baitaran\u012b rises among the hills in the north-west of Keonjhar State; its chief affluent is the S\u0101land\u012b, which rises in May\u016brbhanj. In the dry season the Baitaran\u012b is navigable by small boats, but with difficulty, as far as Anandpur, a large trading village in Keonjhar on its north bank. The Burh\u0101balang rises in May\u016brbhanj and, after receiving two tributaries, the Gang\u0101har and Sunai, passes into Balasore.\n\nSo far as is known at present, gneissic rocks cover these States, except T\u0101lcher and parts of Angul and Athgarh, where sandstones,\nconglomerate, and shales belonging to the Gondw\u0101na system are developed.\n\nThe narrower valleys are often terraced for rice cultivation, and these rice-fields and their margins abound in marsh and water-plants. The surface of the plateau land between the valleys, where level, is often bare and rocky, but, where undulating, is usually clothed with a dense scrub jungle, in which *Dendrocalamus strictus* is prominent. The steep slopes of the hills are covered with a dense forest mixed with many climbers. *S\u0101l (Shorea robusta)* is often gregarious; and among the other noteworthy trees are species of *Buchanania*, *Semecarpus*, *Terminalia*, *Cedrela*, *Cassia*, *Butea*, *Bauhinia*, *Acacia*, and *Adina*, which are found also on the lower Him\u0101layan slopes. Mixed with these, however, are a number of trees and shrubs characteristic of Central India, such as *Cochlospermum*, *Soymida*, *Boswellia*, *Hardwickia*, and *Bassia*, which do not cross the Gangetic plain.\n\nWild elephants infest the jungles of Athmallik, Bar\u0101mb\u0101, Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, Hindol, May\u016brbhanj, Nilgiri, and Narsinghpur, and the chiefs of some of these States carry on *khedda* operations in the beginning of the cold season. Game, big and small, is plentiful in most of the States, including tigers, leopards, hyenas, bears, bison, deer of several kinds, antelope, wild hog, hares, wild-fowl, peafowl, partridges, &c. Tigers carry off considerable numbers of men and cattle every year. Crocodiles swarm in the large rivers. Among snakes, pythons and the *ahir\u0101j* or hamadryad (*Ophiophagus elaps*) are met with in the jungles, while cobras and *karaitis* are responsible for hundreds of deaths by snake-bite.\n\nNo record has been kept of the temperature, but the climate is said to be similar to that of the rest of Orissa, except that it is hotter in summer and colder in winter. During a period of five years the annual rainfall has averaged 55 inches, of which 5\u00b76 inches fell from January to May, 48\u00b76 inches from June to October, and one inch in November and December. Failure of the autumn rains is not frequent, but it involves, when it does occur, a more or less serious failure of the rice crop. The low-lying lands on the banks of the Mah\u0101n\u0101di and Br\u0101hman\u012b are subject to devastating floods and to deterioration by the deposit of sand; the floods of 1866, 1872, 1894, and 1900 were especially destructive.\n\nThe Tributary States have no connected or authentic history. Comprising the western and hilly portion of the province of Orissa, they were never brought under the central government, but from the earliest times consisted of numerous petty principalities which were more or less independent of one another. They were first inhabited by aboriginal races, chiefly Bhuiy\u0101s,\n\n---\n\n1 Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. i, 'Geological Structure of B\u0101nkur\u0101, Midnapore, and Orissa.'\nSavaras, Gonds, and Khonds, who were divided into innumerable communal or tribal groups each under its own chief or headman. These carried on incessant warfare with their neighbours on the one hand and with the wild beasts of the forests on the other. In course of time their hill retreats were penetrated by Aryan adventurers, who, by reason of their superior prowess and intelligence, gradually overthrew the tribal chiefs and established themselves in their place. Tradition relates how these daring interlopers, most of whom were R\u0101jputs from the north, came to Pur\u012b on a pilgrimage and remained behind to found kingdoms and dynasties. It was thus that Jai Singh became ruler of May\u016brbhanj over 1,300 years ago, and was succeeded by his eldest son, while his second son seized Keonjhar. The chiefs of Baud and Daspall\u0101 are said to be descended from the same stock; and a R\u0101jput origin is also claimed by the R\u0101j\u0101s of Athmallik, Narsinghpur, P\u0101l Lahar\u0101, T\u0101lcher, and Tigiri\u0101. Nay\u0101garh, it is alleged, was founded by a R\u0101jput from Rewah, and a scion of the same family was the ancestor of the present house of Khandpar\u0101. On the other hand, the chiefs of a few States, such as Athgarh, Bar\u0101mb\u0101, and Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, owe their origin to favourites or distinguished servants of the ruling sovereigns of Orissa. The State of Ranpur is believed to be the most ancient, the list of its chiefs covering a period of over 3,600 years. It is noteworthy that this family is admittedly of Khond origin, and furnishes the only known instance in which, amid many vicissitudes, the supremacy of the original settlers has remained intact. The States acknowledged the suzerainty of the paramount power and were under an implied obligation to render assistance in resisting invaders; but in other respects neither the ancient kings of Orissa nor their successors, the Mughals and Mar\u0101th\u0101s, ever interfered with their internal administration. All the States have annals of the dynasties that have ruled over them; but they are made up in most part of legend and fiction and long genealogical tables of doubtful accuracy, and contain very few features of general interest.\n\nThe British conquest of Orissa from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, which took place in 1803, was immediately followed by the submission of ten of the Tributary States, the chiefs of which were the first to enter into treaty engagements. Meanwhile, Major Forbes penetrated through the hilly and jungly country on the west and reached the famous Barm\u016bl pass in Daspall\u0101, the key to what is now the Central Provinces. Here the Mar\u0101th\u0101s made a last stand, but on November 2 the pass was forced and the enemy fled in confusion. The R\u0101j\u0101 of Baud and others hastened to tender their submission. Including Khurd\u0101, the Tributary States were then twenty in number. In the following year the chief of Khurd\u0101 rebelled, was vanquished, and forfeited his State, which is now a Government estate and is administered as a subdivision of Pur\u012b.\nDistrict. The R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101nki was deposed in 1840 for murder, and his State, which escheated to Government, has since been added to the District of Cuttack. In 1847 Angul was annexed on account of the misconduct of its chief, and with the Khondm\u0101ls (originally a portion of Baud State) was in 1891 formed into a British District. Athmallik was a tributary of Baud and P\u0101l Lahar\u0101 of Keonjhar, and they find no mention in the early treaty engagements. They were both recognized as separate States in the sanads of 1874, which at the same time conferred the hereditary title of R\u0101j\u0101 on their chiefs. P\u0101l Lahar\u0101, however, still pays to Keonjhar a quit-rent, which is remitted through the Superintendent of the Tributary Mah\u0101ls. It has been held that these States do not form part of British India, and the status, position, and power of the chiefs are defined in the sanads granted to them in 1894.\n\nSome interesting archaeological remains are found at Khiching in the May\u016brbhanj State, including statues, pillars, mounds, and the ruins of several temples. The village of Baud contains a number of small but exquisitely finished temples.\n\nThe population of the States increased from 1,103,699 in 1872 to 1,410,183 in 1881, to 1,696,710 in 1891, and to 1,947,802 in 1901.\n\n**Population.** The earlier enumerations were very defective, and the large increase brought out by each successive Census is due in a great measure to improvements in the arrangements for counting the people. At the same time, there is no doubt that the population is growing rapidly; the inhabitants are hardy and prolific, and there is ample room for expansion. Owing to the presence of low hills and forests, the climate of the greater part of the States is somewhat unhealthy, especially during the rainy season and the beginning of the cold season, when malarial affections prevail to a greater or less extent.\n\nThe principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown in the table on the next page.\n\nThe only towns are Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l and Bhuban in Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, Barip\u0101d\u0101 in May\u016brbhanj, and Keonjhar in Keonjhar. The population is very sparse, but becomes greater on the lower levels as the plains of Orissa are approached. The greatest increase in the decade ending 1901 took place in the State of Athmallik, which gained by immigration from Baud and the Central Provinces, and in Hindol, which also received an accession of new settlers. The comparatively slow rate of increase in Tigiri\u0101 and Khandpar\u0101 is explained by the fact that the population of these States is already much more dense than elsewhere. The only State which shows a loss of population is Baud, which suffered much from epidemic disease and general unhealthiness, and from which many of the restless Khond inhabitants emigrated during\nthe scarcity of 1900. As a general rule, the growth of the population has been greatest along the borders of the British Districts of Orissa, where the level is comparatively low and the proportion of arable land relatively high. The construction of the railway through Orissa and of feeder roads in connexion with it has greatly improved the communications and raised the prices of produce in this tract. The volume of immigration is very considerable, and the Census of 1901 showed a net gain of 61,000 persons from contiguous territory in Bengal and 7,000 from the Central Provinces. Oriy\u0101 is the vernacular of 76\u00b76 per cent. of the total population; Mund\u0101 dialects are spoken by 18\u00b74 per cent., including Sant\u0101l\u012b (nearly 10 per cent.), Ho (5 per cent.), Bhumij, and Ju\u0101ng; and Bengali is the language of 3\u00b74 per cent. Hindus number 1,778,921 persons, or 91 per cent. of the total, and Animists 159,321, or 8 per cent.\n\n| Name of State | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|---------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Athgarh       | 168                 | 192            |          | 43,784     | 260                       | + 19\u00b76                                          | 2,100                                  |\n| Talcher       | 399                 | 293            |          | 60,432     | 151                       | + 14\u00b77                                          | 1,275                                  |\n| May\u016brbhanj    | 4,243               | 3,593          | 1        | 610,383    | 144                       | + 14\u00b77                                          | 13,115                                 |\n| Nilgiri       | 27                  | 466            |          | 66,460     | 239                       | + 18\u00b73                                          | 3,660                                  |\n| Keonjhar      | 3,096               | 1,937          | 1        | 285,758    | 92                        | + 15\u00b72                                          | 7,348                                  |\n| P\u0101l Lah\u0101r\u0101    | 452                 | 205            |          | 22,351     | 49                        | + 13\u00b75                                          | 518                                    |\n| Dhenk\u0101nal     | 1,463               | 998            | 2        | 273,662    | 187                       | + 14\u00b78                                          | 9,392                                  |\n| Athmallik     | 730                 | 460            |          | 40,753     | 56                        | + 28\u00b79                                          | 558                                    |\n| Hindol        | 312                 | 234            |          | 47,180     | 151                       | + 24\u00b72                                          | 1,668                                  |\n| Narsinghpur   | 199                 | 198            |          | 39,613     | 199                       | + 17\u00b70                                          | 3,309                                  |\n| Bar\u0101mb\u0101       | 134                 | 181            |          | 38,260     | 285                       | + 17\u00b76                                          | 1,675                                  |\n| Tigir\u0101        | 46                  | 102            |          | 22,625     | 492                       | + 10\u00b71                                          | 1,105                                  |\n| Khandpar\u0101     | 244                 | 325            |          | 69,450     | 284                       | + 9\u00b77                                           | 1,301                                  |\n| Nay\u0101garh      | 588                 | 775            |          | 140,779    | 239                       | + 19\u00b74                                          | 12,013                                 |\n| Ranpur        | 203                 | 201            |          | 46,975     | 227                       | + 14\u00b79                                          | 3,101                                  |\n| Daspall\u0101      | 568                 | 485            |          | 51,977     | 92                        | + 14\u00b70                                          | 876                                    |\n| Baud          | 1,264               | 1,070          |          | 88,250     | 70                        | - 1\u00b74                                           | 1,474                                  |\n\nTotal 14,387 4 11,805 1,947,802 135 + 14\u00b78 64,578\n\nThe most numerous castes are Ch\u0101sas (220,000), Sant\u0101ls (194,000), P\u0101ns (177,000), Gours (150,000), Hos (99,000), Khandaits (86,000), Br\u0101hmans (76,000), Khonds (71,000), Bhumij (67,000), Bhuiy\u0101s (55,000), Kurmis (54,000), Telis (51,000), B\u0101thudis (44,000), and Sahars (41,000). The so-called Hindus include a large number of aboriginal and semi-aboriginal tribes. These are most numerous in the mountainous tracts of May\u016brbhanj, Keonjhar, and Baud. The majority, including the Sant\u0101ls (see Sant\u0101l Parganas), P\u0101ns, Hos, Khonds (see Khondm\u0101ls), Bhumij, Savaras, and Bhuiy\u0101s, are of so-called Dravidian stock. The B\u0101thudis and Sahars are of uncertain\norigin. The primitive leaf-wearing Ju\u0101ngs, a small tribe found chiefly in Keonjhar and Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, deserve mention. The Ch\u0101sas, Gaurs, Khandaits, and Kurm\u012bs are derived from various elements and seem to be mainly non-Aryan. Agriculture supports 70\u00b76 per cent. of the population, industries 11\u00b77 per cent., commerce 0\u00b72 per cent., and the professions 1\u00b72 per cent. Small Christian missions are at work in Athgarh, May\u016brbhanj, and N\u012bgiri, the total number of Christians in 1901 being 950, of whom 917 were natives.\n\nThe Tributary States, consisting of a succession of hills and valleys, present every variety of soil and conformation of surface. The mountain-sides exhibit bare rocks or are covered only by a thin layer of earth, and extensive ridges of laterite or other hard soil support nothing but scrub growths. The intervening valleys hold rich deposits of clay, loam, and alluvium, varying in thickness from a few inches to several feet, over a foundation of solid metamorphic rocks; the soil is enriched by mineral substances washed down from the disintegrated hills by the annual rains. The rainfall is adequate and well distributed, but the sloping nature of the country enables the numerous hill streams to drain off the rain-water quickly into the main rivers. The forests, where they exist, help to retain a certain amount of moisture; and perennial springs are also met with, though not to any great extent. Cultivation is confined to the valleys and to clearings on the hill slopes. The shifting method of cultivation, locally called dahi, has been pursued from time immemorial by the aboriginal tribes in the uplands of May\u016brbhanj, P\u0101l Lah\u0101r\u0101, and Keonjhar, and has practically denuded the valuable forests in these parts of all good timber. When preparing a clearing the large trees are ringed, and the smaller ones are removed by the hatchet and fire. The soil is then scratched with primitive hand-ploughs, bullocks being seldom used; and a fairly good miscellaneous crop, consisting of early rice, maize, millets, oilseeds, turmeric, &c., is raised for two or three seasons. The site is then abandoned for a fresh one and is allowed to rest until again covered with jungle, when the same process is repeated. The sloping nature of the country affords ample opportunity for cultivation in terraces, which can easily be irrigated from a tank or reservoir.\n\nThe staple crop is rice, of which three kinds are grown: bi\u0101li or early, s\u0101rad or winter, and d\u0101lua or spring. Advantage is taken of the early spring showers to prepare the land for the first two kinds, the former of which is grown on comparatively high land and the latter in hollows and on the lower levels. D\u0101lua is cultivated to a limited extent along the edges of basins which remain wet throughout the year. The modes of cultivation are the same as in Orissa proper. As a food-crop, rice is supplemented by millets, such as china, mandi\u0101 or\nmaru\u0101, &c., and maize and pulses, including birhi, m\u016bng, kurthi, rahar, and gram, which form a large part of the diet of the people. Cereals and oilseeds are grown on the high lands and slopes, the chief oilseeds being mustard, sesamum, and castor-oil; the last is sometimes used by the poorer classes for cooking. Sugar-cane is extensively cultivated, and the coarse sugar which is made from it is not only consumed locally, but is exported to Cuttack and elsewhere. Cotton is largely grown, chiefly for export. Tobacco is raised on the rich silt deposits of rivers and near homesteads, where cattle manure is plentiful. Turmeric is extensively grown for export, and all the ordinary vegetables are cultivated, the commonest being the brinjal or egg-plant and the pumpkin. The hills produce various tubers and edible roots, upon which the aborigines largely subsist. As a result of the growth of population within the States, of immigration from outside, and of improved communications, cultivation is steadily on the increase; extensive clearings are being made on all sides, and the problem in every State is how to devise measures for the proper conservation of the forests without unduly restricting the reclamation of waste lands. Each chief maintains a number of State granaries, which are replenished by rent payments and repayments of advances in kind and also from the produce of his private lands.\n\nPasture lands are generally plentiful, and no difficulty is experienced in feeding cattle; during the dry season large numbers are brought up from the plains for grazing purposes. The local breeds of cattle are poor, and no attempt has been made to improve them.\n\nThere are no canals, but the cultivators often irrigate their fields from tanks and wells. It is a common practice to construct reservoirs for the storage of water by damming up streams, but this method of irrigation might be utilized much more widely than it is at present. Tanks and wells number about 12,000 each, and the area irrigated from them is roughly estimated at 512 square miles. For irrigating sugar-cane, vegetables, tobacco, &c., in the dry season, the people sink temporary wells in the sandy beds of streams, and lift the water by means of simple levers worked by one or two men.\n\nThe character of the forests is the same throughout the Tributary Mah\u0101ls. The hills in most of the States extend over a large area and are covered with vegetation, but the most valuable timber is found in the intervening narrow valleys. These forests were at one time among the best timber-producing tracts in India; but the chiefs have taken little care of them, and reckless exploitation and clearings for dahi cultivation have caused nearly all their valuable timber to disappear. Till lately forest conservancy was practically unknown; but the example of May\u016brbhanj and the British District of Angul, where the forests have been surveyed, 'reserved,'\nand brought under regular control, has induced the other States to follow suit, though in a crude and unmethodical way. There is very little good timber left in the vicinity of the Mah\u0101nad\u012b and the Br\u0101hman\u012b rivers, but elsewhere and farther inland the absence of good roads and the difficulty of transport have saved them from wholesale destruction. The principal timber trees are s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), pi\u0101s\u0101l (Pterocarpus Marsupium), siss\u016b (Dalbergia Sissoo), karam (Adina cordifolia), bandhan (Ougetia dalbergioides), gamh\u0101r (Gmelina arborea), tendu or ebony (Diospyros melanoxylon), mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), and \u0101san (Terminalia tomentosa). Among other common trees are the mango (Mangifera indica), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), j\u0101m (Eugenia Jambolana), jack (Artocarpus integrifolia), amr\u0101 or hog-plum (Spondias mangifera), p\u0101r (Buchanania latifolia), haritak\u012b (Terminalia Chebula), kuchila (Strychnos Nux-vomica), khair (Acacia Catechu), gundi (Malotus philippinensis), baher\u0101 (Terminalia belerica), semul or cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum), karanj (Galedupa indica), kusum (Schleichera trijuga), banyan (Ficus indica), and pipal (Ficus religiosa). The minor forest products are honey, beeswax, tas\u0101r, lac, a dye called gundi, and various medicinal drugs. Sabai grass (Ischoemum angustifolium) grows largely in Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, Keonjhar, May\u016brbhanj, Nilgiri, P\u0101l Lah\u0101r\u0101, T\u0101lcher, and other States, and is used locally for the manufacture of ropes. Paper can also be made from it, and small quantities are now exported for use in the Bengal paper-mills. The area of forests in the Tributary States has not been ascertained, but the revenue from them in seventeen of the States in 1903-4 is reported to have amounted to 2\u00b75 lakhs.\n\nThe T\u0101lcher coal-field was last explored in 1875, when a thorough examination was made by an officer of the Geological Survey, with no very favourable result. The bed extends to Angul, Athmallik, and Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, having a total area of about 700 square miles; but the coal is of inferior quality. Limestone and sandstone suitable for building purposes are procurable in almost all the States. Iron has been found and worked from the earliest times; and a recent geological survey shows that the iron ores of May\u016brbhanj are of excellent quality. A scheme is now being developed for a railway to carry the latter to Sini in the Saraikel\u0101 State, where large iron- and steel-works will be constructed. Gold dust is washed to a small extent in Keonjhar, Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, and P\u0101l Lah\u0101r\u0101. A kind of magnesian rock, intermediate in composition between potstone and serpentine, locally called mugni, is extensively quarried in Nilgiri for the manufacture of dishes, plates, and bowls, which have a large sale. Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l and a few other States produce talc. Red and yellow ochre is found in Athmallik, May\u016brbhanj, and Nay\u0101garh.\n\nIn Bar\u0101mb\u0101 and Tigiri\u0101 tas\u0101r silk and cotton cloths of very fine\ntexture and superior quality are made; they find a ready sale in the local markets and are also exported. In Khandpar\u0101 and Narsinghpur, brass and bell-metal utensils are manufactured on a large scale; but, since the opening of the railway in Orissa, the industry has suffered from outside competition. In Baud, Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, Daspall\u0101, Khandpar\u0101, May\u016brbhanj, and T\u0101lcher blacksmiths make, for local use, iron implements, such as axes, billhooks, crowbars, shovels, spades, sickles, and knives, some of which are very well turned out. At one time the States, like the rest of Orissa, possessed excellent workers in stone and wood, but very few are now met with. In Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l and Nay\u0101garh ivory work of good quality is still made by one or two families.\n\nTrade is carried on principally by itinerant dealers from the British Districts and by the ubiquitous M\u0101rw\u0101ri and K\u0101buli. They take away rice, pulses, oilseeds, *tasar* cocoons, &c., and timber and other forest produce, in return for salt, dried fish, European cotton piece-goods, cotton twist, and kerosene oil. A considerable business in hides and horns is carried on by Muhammadans. Most of the trade is with Cuttack, but some also with Balasore and Pur\u012b. There are no markets of much importance; Kantilo in Khandpar\u0101, Anandpur in Keonjhar, and Bh\u016bban and Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l in Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l are the principal local centres. The larger rivers are open to country boats for about eight months in the year, during which they are largely used for floating down rafts of timber and bamboos. But the greater part of the trade is carried on during the dry season when the rivers are low; country carts are used where there are fair-weather roads, but elsewhere pack-bullocks still form the chief means of transport. Carts with small solid wheels are used for bringing down timber and stone from the forests, and for carrying other goods in places where only rough tracks exist.\n\nThe Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway passes in proximity to Ranpur, Nilgiri, and May\u016brbhanj; and Barip\u0101d\u0101, the capital of the last State, has recently been connected with it by a branch line on the narrow-gauge, 32 miles long. The most important roads are those from Cuttack to Sambalpur and to Sonpur, which are maintained by Government as fair-weather roads; the former skirts the south, and the latter the north, bank of the Mah\u0101nadi. A new diversion of the second road, the greater portion of which is metalled, passes through Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l and Angul. Branch roads lead from these main lines of communication to all the States situated in the Mah\u0101nadi and Br\u0101hman\u012b valleys. May\u016brbhanj is traversed by several excellent roads, some of which are metalled and bridged; and in Keonjhar two important roads have recently been made, one to the Balasore and the other to the Singhbh\u016bm boundary. The Mah\u0101nadi and Br\u0101hman\u012b form broad water-\nways during half the year, but there is no steamer or regular boat service on either of them. All the States except Tigiri\u0101 and Upper Keonjhar have subsidized British post offices, and the telegraph line to Angul passes through Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l; there are also branch telegraph lines to Nilgiri and Barip\u0101d\u0101.\n\nThe great Orissa famine of 1866 did not extend its ravages to the Tributary States, which have long been free from famine, though some of them have suffered from partial scarcity in recent years, e.g. in 1897 and 1900. The reason of this comparative immunity is to be found in the conformation of the country, which is less subject to devastating floods and which, owing to the presence of wooded hills, is better able to retain moisture than the plains. The natural facilities for irrigation are also better. The people do not depend entirely on the single crop of rice, but grow also other food-grains and a variety of crops. The fruit of the mango and jack and the flower of the mahua tree, with which the forests and village sites abound, afford substantial relief in time of scarcity, and the jungles contain many edible roots and tubers.\n\nThe States have formed the subject of frequent legislation of a special character. They were taken over from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1803 with the rest of Orissa; but, as they had always been tributary states rather than regular districts of the native governments, they were exempted from the operation of the general regulation system, by sections 36, 13, and 11 of Regulations XII, XIII, and XIV of 1805. The exemption was allowed on the ground of expediency only; and it was held that there was nothing in the nature of British relations with the proprietors that would preclude their being brought under the ordinary jurisdiction of the British courts, if it should ever be thought advisable. The office of Superintendent of the Tributary States was established in 1814, and he was directed to endeavour to establish such control over the conduct of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs as might prevent the commission of crimes and outrages. The only law, however, under which he appears to have been formally invested with any judicial authority was Regulation XI of 1816, by which he was empowered to dispose of claims to inheritance and succession among the R\u0101j\u0101s. In 1821 the Government ruled that his interference should be chiefly confined to matters of a political nature; to the suppression of feuds and animosities prevailing between the R\u0101j\u0101s of adjoining Mah\u0101ls, or between the members of their families, or with their subordinate feudatories; to the correction of systematic oppression and cruelty on the part of the R\u0101j\u0101s or their officers; to the cognizance of any apparent gross violation by them of their duties of allegiance and subordination; and generally to important points, which might lead, if not attended to, to violent and\ngeneral outrage and confusion or to contempt of the paramount authority of the British Government. Several local Acts were passed, such as Act XX of 1850, for settling boundary disputes. But the whole system was changed in consequence of a ruling of the Calcutta High Court in 1882, which held that the Tributary States did not form part of British India. After prolonged correspondence the decision was accepted as final by the Secretary of State, and a special Act, called the Tributary Mahals of Orissa Act (XI of 1893), was passed to indemnify certain persons and to validate acts done by them in the Mahals, and to admit of certain sentences passed there being carried into effect in British India. The relations between the British Government and the Tributary States are governed mainly by the sanads granted in similar terms to all the chiefs in 1894. They contain ten clauses reciting the rights, privileges, duties, and obligations of the chiefs, providing for the settlement of boundary disputes, and indicating the nature and extent of the control of the Superintendent, who is also the Commissioner of the Orissa Division.\n\nExcept in Mayurbhanj, which, under its present enlightened ruler, is governed on British lines, the States are administered by the chiefs in a more or less primitive fashion, generally with the help of a diwan, who in many cases exercises full authority.\n\nDuring the minority of a chief or in the rare case of his gross incapacity, the management of the State is undertaken by Government under the supervision of the Superintendent. Five States are thus now under Government management: namely, Narsinghpur, Dhenkanal, Pal Lahara, Nayagarh, and Barambha.\n\nThe chief of each State has his own court with civil and criminal powers, which he exercises himself or delegates to his diwan or manager. Under the terms of the sanad of 1894, he tries all criminal cases occurring in his territory, except those in which Europeans are concerned, and heinous offences, such as murder, homicide, dacoity, robbery, and torture, which he must commit to the Superintendent of the Tributary Mahals, or to such of his assistants as the latter may direct. Sentences passed by the chiefs in criminal cases are regulated by the instructions issued from time to time by the Bengal Government, and, unless specially extended, may not exceed in the case of imprisonment a term of two years, in the case of fines a sum of Rs. 1,000, and in the case of whipping 30 stripes. In his criminal jurisdiction the Superintendent exercises the powers of a High Court in the Tributary States. In civil matters the chief has full authority, subject to the general control of the Superintendent. The three largest States have outlying subdivisions: namely, Mayurbhanj two, Keonjhar two, and Dhenkanal one.\n\nSince the rearrangements of 1905, a separate officer has been appointed Political Agent for the Orissa States, who is subordinate to the Commissioner.\nsubdivisional officers are vested with limited revenue, criminal, and civil powers.\n\nOwing to the general absence of subinfeudation and of large estates, land disputes are simple and few in number, and civil litigation is practically confined to petty suits regarding bonds and small trade transactions. Various kinds of oaths are in vogue for eliciting the truth. Criminal cases consist mainly of burglaries and thefts; dacoities take place occasionally, and murders are by no means uncommon, but riots seldom occur. The people are on the whole truthful, peaceable, and law-abiding, the only exception being the P\u0101ns, who, being landless and indolent, live from hand to mouth and furnish the greater part of the jail population. Some of the aboriginal tribes are impulsive and excitable; and there have been several instances of risings, the most notable of which are the Bhuiy\u0101 rebellions of 1862 and 1891 in Keonjhar, and the Khond rebellion of 1894 in Nayagarh.\n\nNo reliable statistics of the income and expenditure of these States are available, except for May\u016brbhanj and the five States under Government management. Such figures as have been obtained will be noticed in the separate account of each State. The principal source of income is the land revenue, which is supplemented by excise, stamps, judicial fines, and licence fees from various minor monopolies. In some of the States the forests yield a handsome profit. The excise revenue consists of the licence fees from out-stills, and for g\u0101nja and opium shops; these are settled yearly on the basis of auction sales, but there is a general want of supervision and very little is done to force up prices. Excisable articles are thus very cheap, and they are often smuggled into the adjoining British Districts. The chiefs formerly derived no revenue from g\u0101nja, which was allowed to grow wild; but in 1896 they were induced to put a stop to its cultivation and to introduce the R\u0101jsh\u0101hi drug, under an arrangement which has proved lucrative to themselves, while it has effectually suppressed g\u0101nja smuggling. Some of the States have introduced the stamp and court fee rules. Stamps are supplied to them at cost price. The fees charged are below the rates prevailing in British territory. The miscellaneous revenue of the States is derived from several minor sources, such as fines and fees, sal\u0101mis or nazar\u0101nas, and licence fees for the sale of various forest products. According to a time-honoured custom, large sums are levied as m\u0101gan, or voluntary contributions, on the occasion of the marriage, birth, or death of a chief, or of some near member of his family.\n\nThe land settlement is extremely simple, and approximates closely to the system which existed in the Districts of Orissa proper under the Hindu dynasties. The abstract ownership vests in the R\u0101j\u0101 or hereditary chief, but the right of occupancy remains with the actual\ncultivator. So long as he pays his rent, his possession is undisturbed; but alienation by sale, gift, or mortgage is subject to the permission of the chief. No intermediate rights in the soil exist, except in the case of service tenures and other beneficiary grants. The revenue assessed on the holding of each ryot is based on measurement by a standard pole and a rough classification of the soil, or on an approximate estimate of the produce of the land; the assessment is generally revised every ten or fifteen years. Land revenue is collected through sarbar\u0101hk\u0101rs, of whom there is one or more for each village. They are paid by commission ranging from 5 to 15 per cent., and in some cases have j\u0101g\u012br lands besides. In some of the States the aboriginal races pay no revenue, but are assessed at a certain rate per house or per plough, which is subject to revision every three or five years. The revenue is supposed to bear some relation to out-turn, but the mode of calculation is often very crude. Formerly the whole or a part of the rent used to be realized in kind; but this led to much oppression and discontent, and cash payments have, under pressure from Government, now become the rule. On an average the rate per acre of rice lands varies from Rs. 1-2 to Rs. 2, and for miscellaneous crops from 2 annas to R. 1. A ryot's holding does not ordinarily exceed 5 acres.\n\nThe police of the Tributary States consisted in 1903\u20134 of 173 officers and 871 men. In Keonjhar and May\u016brbhanj European officers are in charge of the police force. The rural police is divided into two classes, paiks and chaukid\u0101rs, both remunerated by small j\u0101g\u012br grants. The former are employed on guard and escort duties, and form an ornamental appendage to a chief's following. They are sometimes a source of danger by reason of their number and influence, which the chiefs are now trying to reduce. The chaukid\u0101rs are the rural police proper, and look after crime in the villages.\n\nThe States have their own jails in Bar\u0101mb\u0101, Narsinghpur, Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, Daspall\u0101, May\u016brbhanj, T\u0101lcher, Keonjhar, Athmallik, and Athgarh; these are of masonry, but elsewhere they are merely mud huts within mud enclosures. They generally have sufficient accommodation, but are without proper sanitary arrangements. The prisoners are employed on extra-mural labour; discipline is badly enforced, and there is seldom any provision for exacting penal labour. Escapes are not uncommon. Long-term prisoners are sometimes sent to British jails, where the chiefs pay for their maintenance.\n\nEducation is very backward, but in late years there has been steady progress, especially in primary education. Only 3\u00b73 per cent. (6\u00b74 males and 0\u00b72 females) could read and write in 1901. The States of Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l and May\u016brbhanj, which are the most advanced, maintain a large number of schools, including a high school. The number of pupils in all the States increased from 14,505 in 1883 to 17,176 in 1900\u20131.\nIn 1903\u20134, 22,108 boys and 1,188 girls were at school, being respectively 15.1 and 0.8 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 1,356, of which 20 were secondary, 1,130 primary, and 206 special schools. The total expenditure was Rs. 1,20,000, of which Rs. 20,000 was paid by Government, Rs. 54,000 by the several States, and Rs. 43,000 was met from fees. No special institutions exist for the aboriginal races, but primary schools have been opened in a few of their central villages, where 2,705 boys were under instruction in 1904.\n\nAll the States except Tigiri\u0101 maintain dispensaries in charge of civil hospital assistants or, in two cases, of Assistant Surgeons. In Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l a female hospital, under a qualified lady doctor, was opened in 1900\u20131. In all the States combined, 23 dispensaries gave medical aid in 1904 to 684 in-patients and 103,177 out-patients, at an expenditure of Rs. 29,000, including the cost of establishment and medicines. The dispensaries are fairly well equipped, but they suffer from want of professional supervision. The people have not yet learnt to appreciate the European system of medical treatment, but in surgical cases they readily resort to the hospitals.\n\nInoculation has been stopped in the States, but vaccination has not yet been made compulsory, and is making very slow progress. Here, as in British Orissa, the people have strong prejudices against it, and so also have the chiefs, with the exception of the enlightened rulers of May\u016brbhanj, Nilgiri, Hindol, and Athgarh, who have not hesitated to introduce vaccination in their own families. In 1903\u20134, in all the States (excluding Khandpar\u0101) 45,000 persons, or 23 per 1,000 of the population, were vaccinated. The work is generally carried on by paid or licensed operators under the supervision of the medical officer in charge of the State dispensary, and in some States sub-inspectors of vaccination have been appointed. A class has been opened in the Cuttack medical school, where each State sends one or more men annually to receive practical training in vaccination. The course lasts for six weeks, and the successful students are employed as vaccinators in their own States.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xix, pp. 195\u2013314 (1877).]\n\nOrissa Canals.\u2014A system of canals situated chiefly in Cuttack District, Bengal, but serving also a portion of Balasore District. The canals derive their supply mainly from the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b river, but partly also from the Br\u0101hm\u0101n\u012b and Baitar\u0101n\u012b. The first proposal to employ the rivers of Orissa and Midnapore for irrigation was made by General Sir Arthur Cotton, who was deputed to visit Bengal in 1858 to advise on the control of the flood-waters of the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b. He recommended the construction of a complete system of irrigation and navi-\ngation canals, following the principles then being carried out in the deltas of the God\u0101vari and Kistna. He estimated that an area of 3,516 square miles might thus be irrigated, and that navigation might be opened up between Orissa, Midnapore, and Calcutta, for a sum of 130 lakhs. Here, as elsewhere, Sir Arthur Cotton attached special importance to making the canals navigable; and he pointed out how completely Orissa was cut off from the rest of India, without roads, railways, or harbours, and traversed by a succession of formidable and unbridged rivers. In 1860 the East India Irrigation and Canal Company was formed for the purpose of carrying out the works in Orissa, and water was first supplied for irrigation in 1865. The works, however, were not sufficiently advanced to be of any real use in the terrible famine of 1866, though they supplied an excellent form of relief labour in the distressed Districts. Before this it had become evident that the original estimate would be largely exceeded; and as the company found difficulty in raising further funds, the Government of India purchased the whole of the works for the sum of 109 lakhs, and in 1869 the company ceased to exist.\n\nFrom the first, irrigation in Orissa made very slow progress. Those who had enthusiastically quoted the success of the Madras irrigation schemes seem to have forgotten that there the annual rainfall does not exceed 40 inches, while in Orissa it amounts to 60 inches. The works, however, proceeded; and in 1873 it was decided to provide for an irrigable area of 1,781 square miles in Orissa (exclusive of Midnapore), at an estimated cost of 441 lakhs. This area was to include 781 square miles in the Balasore and Puri sections of the scheme, which had not then been put in hand and were soon after abandoned. The works completed up to 1902-3 commanded a cultivable area of 900 square miles, the maximum discharge of the canals being 6,058 cubic feet per second; and 22 miles of distributaries and minor channels were added to the system in 1903-4. They consist of seven weirs across river channels with an aggregate length of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, constituting, with the canal head-sluices and entrance locks, the most extensive system of head-works of any canal system in India. There are four canals, with their respective distributaries: namely, the High-level canal; the Kendr\u0101p\u0101ra canal, with its extensions, the Gobri and Pat\u0101mundai canals; the T\u0101ldanda canal; and the M\u0101chgaon canal.\n\nThe High-level canal was designed to provide a navigable trade route between Cuttack and Calcutta, and also to irrigate the country through which it passes. It starts from above the left flank of the weir across the Bir\u016bp\u0101, one mile below the departure of that river from the main stream of the Mah\u0101n\u0101di, and runs thence along the foot of the hills north-eastwards, through Cuttack and Balasore Districts. The original scheme was to carry the canal across the District of\nMidnapore to meet the Hooghly river at Ulub\u0101ria, below Calcutta, a total distance from the starting-point of 230 miles. The section between Midnapore town and Ulub\u0101ria was opened throughout for traffic in 1873; but this is known as the MIDNAPORE CANAL, and forms an independent work distinct from the Orissa Canals system.\n\nThe Orissa delta is divided by the rivers which traverse it into two main sections. The tract between the main stream of the Mah\u0101nadi and the Br\u0101hman\u012b is irrigated by the Pat\u0101mundai canal on the north and the Kendr\u0101p\u0101ra canal on the south, the Gobri canal forming a connecting link between them to the east. Both these systems draw their supply of water from the south flank of the anicut across the Birup\u0101, which also feeds the High-level canal. Another anicut across the main stream of the Mah\u0101nad\u012b feeds the T\u0101ldanda and M\u0101chgaon canals, which water the north and south edges of the tract between the Mah\u0101nadi and K\u0101tj\u016bri. All these canals maintain a high level along the banks of the rivers, which are always higher than the intermediate alluvial tracts.\n\nCanal-irrigation was first ready in 1865; but cultivators were slow to avail themselves of it, as they were afraid that irrigation would be made an excuse for the enhancement of rents and revenue. More than one proclamation was published to allay their apprehensions, but a more effective inducement to take water was the gradual reduction of the rate from Rs. 5 and Rs. 3 to Rs. 1\u20138 per acre. The rainfall is generally sufficient to bring the crops to maturity, though it fails occasionally, so that artificial irrigation is necessary only in exceptionally dry years. The policy adopted has been to induce the cultivators to take long leases on favourable terms; and this is proving successful, the area irrigated having steadily increased, until in 1903\u20134 it reached 328 square miles. There were in that year altogether 205 miles of main canals for irrigation and navigation, 96 miles of canals for irrigation only, and 1,166 miles of distributaries and minor channels. The main canals are navigable, and the estimated value of the cargo carried in 1902\u20133 was 63 lakhs, the tolls realized aggregating Rs. 69,000. The capital outlay up to March 31, 1904, was 265 lakhs, and in 1903\u20134 the gross revenue was 4\u00b73 lakhs and the net revenue Rs. 45,000.\n\nThe Orissa Canals have never paid their way. The water rate was until recently only Rs. 1\u20138 per acre, and the receipts for both navigation and irrigation barely cover the working charges and do not touch the interest, the annual charges for which exceed 10 lakhs. The water rate has recently been increased to Rs. 1\u201312 per acre, with the object of rendering the canals self-supporting, and the receipts rose from 3\u00b75 lakhs in 1901\u20132 to 4\u00b73 lakhs in 1903\u20134. During the same period the traffic on the canals increased, though owing to the reduction of tollage rates the actual earnings were not greater.\nOrissa Coast Canal.\u2014A navigable canal situated chiefly in Balasore District, but partly also in Midnapore District, Bengal, forming a continuation of the Hijli Tidal Canal. The canal, which has a length of 130 miles, connects the Rasulpur river with the Subarnarekh\u0101, and proceeds thence to the Matai and Dh\u0101mra rivers. The canal was commenced in 1880, and opened for traffic in 1885. The estimated value of the cargo carried in 1902\u20133 was 19\u00b74 lakhs. There has been a great falling off in the navigation receipts since the opening of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, to which most of the rice and other goods traffic has been diverted. The capital outlay up to March 31, 1904, was 44\u00b78 lakhs; the gross revenue during the year was Rs. 34,000, and there was a loss on the year's working of Rs. 32,000.\n\nOsmanabad District (formerly called Naldrug).\u2014District in the west of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, bounded by the Bombay Districts of Ahmadnagar and Sholapur on the north, west, and south; by Bh\u012br and B\u012bdar Districts on the north and east; by the Akalkot State of Bombay on the south; and by Gulbarga District on the south-east. It encloses the detached B\u0101rsi t\u0101luk of Sholapur District, and lies between 17\u00b0 35' and 18\u00b0 40' N. and 75\u00b0 16' and 76\u00b0 40' E., with a total area of 4,010 square miles; but the area of the kh\u0101lsa and sarf-i-kh\u0101s (crown) lands is only 2,627 square miles, the rest being paig\u0101h and j\u0101gir. A range of hills, which enters the District at the north-west corner from Ahmadnagar, and continues to the south-east, divides it into two portions: a plateau to the north-east and east, and lowlands to the west, south-west, and south. The t\u0101luks of W\u0101si, Owsa, Kalam, and parts of Tuljapur, Osmanabad, and Naldrug are situated on the plateau; the remainder of the District on the lowlands. The general slope of the plateau is from south-west to north-east. The land rises from Tuljapur towards Osmanabad; thence it begins to descend gradually towards the north-east, terminating in the valley of the river M\u0101njra.\n\nThe most important river is the M\u0101njra, which runs due east along the northern boundary as far as the north-eastern corner of the Owsa t\u0101luk, where it takes a southerly direction before entering B\u012bdar District. Its length in Osmanabad is about 58 miles. Other streams which traverse portions of the District are the S\u012bna and its tributary the Kheri, the Tirna, and the Borna, which all run in a south-easterly direction, the S\u012bna forming part of the boundary between Osmanabad and Bh\u012br District.\n\nThe geological formation is the Deccan trap. There is no forest in the District, and the trees that are found consist of bab\u016bl (Acacia arabica), n\u012bm, mango, and several species of Ficus.\n\nThe country, being devoid of forests, contains no large game of any\nnote; but antelope and hares are found in small numbers, as are also wolves, hyenas, and wild hog. Among game-birds, partridges, quail, and wild pigeons are common; and where there is a tank, wild duck may be seen during the cold season.\n\nClimatically, the District may be divided into three portions: the first, containing the Naldrug and Owsa taluks, is hot but dry; the second, consisting of Tuljapur and Osmanabad, is cool and somewhat damp; while the third comprises Wasi, Kalam, and Parenda, the climate being humid. Generally speaking, the temperature of the plateau is much pleasanter than that of the plain.\n\nThe annual rainfall for the twenty-one years ending 1901 averaged 33 inches. The amount received in 1897 (14 inches) and in 1899 (20 inches) was abnormally scanty, and resulted in the great famine of 1900.\n\nThe District has been under Muhammadan rule since the beginning of the fourteenth century, when it was annexed to the empire of Delhi by Al\u00e2-ud-d\u00een Khilji. On the foundation of the Bahmani kingdom, it fell to that power, and when that monarchy in turn dissolved, to the Sultans of Ahmadnagar and Bijapur. The conquest of the Deccan by Aurangzeb reunited it to Delhi, till the foundation of the Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d State in the early part of the eighteenth century. It was ceded to the British Government with the Raich\u00fbr Do\u00e2b under the treaty of 1853, but was restored to the Niz\u00e2m in 1860.\n\nThe District contains six places of archaeological interest. The fort of Naldrug, a fortified town on the Bori river, and the head-quarters of the taluk of that name, belonged to a Hindu R\u00e2j\u00e2 during the fourteenth century. The J\u00e2ma Masjid in the Owsa taluk is built in the Bijapur style of architecture, with a dome and fa\u00e7ade of cusped arches. Groups of caves known as the D\u00e2bar Lena, Cham\u00e2r Lena, and L\u00e2chandar Lena lie around the town of Osmanabad (Dh\u00e2r\u00e2seo), the first-mentioned group being Jain and Vaishnava excavations. Roughly the caves may be assigned to the period A.D. 500 to 650. Hasangaon, 40 miles north-west of Naldrug, contains two large caves in a solitary hill, which were Br\u00e2hmanical rock shrines. Parenda, an old fortress, 64 miles north-west of Naldrug, was erected by Mahm\u00fbd G\u00e2v\u00e2n, the celebrated minister of the Bahmani Sultan, in the fifteenth century. Tuljapur, a town 20 miles north-west of Naldrug, is a famous place of Hindu pilgrimage, and contains a temple dedicated to the goddess Bhav\u00e2ni. There are very interesting Buddhist remains at Thair (Ter), 12 miles north-east of Osmanabad, which has been identified as the site of Tagara, a city of great antiquity mentioned by Ptolemy.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the District, including the\nlarge j\u0101girs, is 866. The population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 543,402, (1891) 649,272, and (1901) 535,027. The towns are Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, the head-quarters, Tulj\u0101pur, Thair, Owsa, L\u0101t\u016br, and Moram. About 89 per cent. of the population are Hindus, and 84 per cent. of them speak Mar\u0101th\u012b. The following table exhibits the principal statistics of population according to the Census of 1901:\n\n| T\u0101luk       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d   | 380                 | 2               | 78       | 72,176     | 189                       | -16.5                                           | Not available                          |\n| Kalam       | 303                 | 70              |          | 38,030     | 125                       | -27.1                                           |                                       |\n| W\u0101si        | 342                 | 75              |          | 47,484     | 138                       | -26.9                                           |                                       |\n| Owsa        | 370                 | 104             |          | 61,436     | 166                       | -19.4                                           |                                       |\n| Tulj\u0101pur    | 403                 | 71              |          | 55,385     | 137                       | -16.2                                           |                                       |\n| Naldrug     | 353                 | 57              |          | 53,487     | 151                       | -8.1                                            |                                       |\n| Parenda     | 476                 | 106             |          | 56,912     | 119                       | -16.9                                           |                                       |\n| J\u0101girs, &c. | 1,383               | 296             |          | 150,117    | 118                       | -16.4                                           |                                       |\n| District total | 4,010               | 860             |          | 535,027    | 133                       | -17.4                                           | 16,579                                |\n\nIn 1905 W\u0101si was merged in Kalam, and Naldrug in Tulj\u0101pur. In its present form the District thus consists of only five t\u0101luks\u2014Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Kalam, Tulj\u0101pur, Owsa, and Parenda\u2014besides the two large paig\u0101h il\u0101kas of Ganjoti and Loh\u0101r\u0101, and the j\u0101girs of Bh\u016bm and W\u0101lwad.\n\nThe most numerous caste is that of the cultivating K\u0101pus (Telugu) or Kunbis (Mar\u0101th\u0101), who number 205,000, or 38 per cent. of the total. The Dhangars or shepherds number 28,700, the Mah\u0101rs or village menials about 51,000; and the M\u0101ngs or Cham\u0101rs, leather-workers, 36,000. The V\u0101nis or trading castes number 42,000 altogether, and the Br\u0101hmans 18,000. The population engaged in agriculture is 310,000, or nearly 58 per cent. of the total. Christians in 1901 numbered 50, all of whom were natives.\n\nThe entire District is situated in the trap area, and most of its soil consists of the fertile regar or black cotton soil, interspersed with red and white or sandy soils. In the t\u0101luks of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Kalam, W\u0101si, and Parenda the black cotton soil predominates, favouring the cultivation of rabi or cold-season crops to a larger extent than in the remaining t\u0101luks, where reddish and sandy soils are met with to a greater extent, producing chiefly the kharif or rainy season crops. Next to the regar in fertility is the masab or mixture of white and reddish soils, and last comes the kharab or sandy soil. Regar produces white jow\u0101r, gram, wheat, and cotton; in the masab soils yellow jow\u0101r, b\u0101jra, and pulse are grown,\nwhile the kharab is generally utilized for garden produce, which needs heavy manuring in order to produce a good crop, the soil being naturally poor. The soils at the foot of the range of hills running across the District are especially fertile, containing the rain-washed detrital matter from the rocks above, and having all the properties of alluvium.\n\nThe tenure of lands is mainly ronewari. In 1901, out of a total area of 2,627 square miles of khalsa and crown lands, 1,813 were cultivated, of which only 76 were irrigated. Cultivable waste and fallows occupied 648 square miles, while 166 were not available for cultivation. The staple food-grain is jowar, grown on 70 per cent. of the net area cropped. Wheat, rice, and bajra are next in importance, the areas under each being respectively 75, 37, and 29 square miles. Cotton is grown in all the taluks, and the total area occupied by it is about 56 square miles. Sugar-cane is raised in small quantities with well-irrigation, the area under this crop being slightly less than 10 square miles.\n\nSince the last settlement in 1883, which resulted in the taking up of all the available lands by the ryots, no extension of holdings has been possible. The ryots have shown no interest in the introduction of new varieties of seed or of improved agricultural implements.\n\nNo particular breed of cattle is characteristic of the District, but those found are strong and robust, and well suited for deep ploughing, which is essential to the heavy loamy and argillaceous soils prevalent. Sheep and goats of the common kind are reared. Ordinary ponies are to be had for from Rs. 20 to Rs. 30; but the better sort, well-known for their staying powers and sure-footedness, fetch as much as Rs. 100. For some years past, the State has kept two Arab stallions at Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d and one at Parenda, for the purpose of improving the local breed.\n\nThe irrigated area amounts to only about 76 square miles, supplied by wells, of which 8,800 are in good repair. Such tanks as exist are used for drinking purposes only, while the beds of the rivers are too low to permit of their water being used for cultivation.\n\nThere are no minerals of any economic value, beyond the ordinary granite and basaltic rock, used in building and road-metalling. Near Katri, K\u0101mta, and Wadgaon in the Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d taluk, reddish earth is found, which is used by the Hindus for plastering floors.\n\nNo important industry is carried on in the District. Coarse cotton cloth and dhotis, saris, and cholis used to be manufactured locally, but for some years past cloth of all kinds and yarn have been imported at cheaper rates. The shepherds usually manufacture blankets from the wool of their sheep, which are sold at from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 apiece. At L\u0101t\u016br in the Owsa taluk, which is a large trade centre, a small ginning-mill was erected in 1889, and two more have been started since 1901. There\nare no regular tanneries, but the Cham\u0101rs generally prepare leather for the water-buckets, largely used for irrigation purposes.\n\nThe chief exports consist of jow\u0101r, other cereals and pulses, cotton, oil-seeds and oil, chillies, cattle, sheep, bones and horns, tobacco, leather, and tarvar bark. The principal imports are salt, salted fish, opium, spices, silver, gold, copper and brass utensils, refined sugar, iron, kerosene oil, sulphur, raw silk, and silk and cotton cloth of all kinds.\n\nThe chief centre of commerce is L\u0101t\u016br, from which almost the whole of the imported articles are distributed throughout the District. Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d is next in importance. The principal trading castes are the V\u0101nis, M\u0101rw\u0101ris, Komatis, and Bh\u0101tias, who also engage in banking business. In all the t\u0101luks weekly bazars are held, where a brisk trade is carried on.\n\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway line passes through a minute portion of the t\u0101luk of Tulj\u0101pur. B\u0101rsi, in the Bombay District of Shol\u0101pur, on the B\u0101rsi Light Railway, is the nearest station to the District head-quarters, from which it is 32 miles distant. There are two stations on the same line at the villages of Sendri and Uptai in the Parenda t\u0101luk.\n\nThe total length of roads in the District is 272 miles, of which 144 miles are metalled and 128 miles unmetalled. The principal roads are: L\u0101t\u016br to Doki, Vermal\u0101 to Amba in Bh\u012br District, B\u0101rsi to Shol\u0101pur, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d to T\u0101ndulw\u0101di, Parenda to B\u0101rsi, and Naldrug to T\u0101ndulw\u0101di.\n\nNo reliable records exist of any famines prior to the restoration of the District by the British in 1860, with the exception of what has been said by Colonel Meadows Taylor in his *Story of My Life*, regarding the distress that prevailed during 1854\u20135 owing to the influx of famine-stricken people from the adjoining tracts. The great famine of 1877\u20138 affected one t\u0101luk only, while in 1896\u20137 a portion of the District suffered. In 1897 the local rainfall was less than half the usual quantity, and in 1899 less than two-thirds; and the District, which had suffered from previous failure of crops, was among those most severely affected during the famine of 1900. Both the kharif and the rabi crops failed, and at one time about one-fifth of the total population were in receipt of relief. An attack of cholera supervened, and the Census of 1901 showed a decrease of 17.3 per cent. in the population. The District also lost about 40 per cent. of its cattle, and the total cost of the famine to the State amounted to 22 lakhs.\n\nThe District forms two subdivisions: one comprising the t\u0101luks of Kalam, Owsa, and Parenda under the Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r; and the other consisting of the t\u0101luks of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d and Tulj\u0101pur under the Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r, the First\nT\u0101lukd\u0101r having a general supervision over the work of all his subordinates. Each t\u0101luk is under a tahsild\u0101r.\n\nThe District civil court is presided over by a Judge styled the N\u0101zim-i-D\u012bw\u0101ni. The subordinate civil courts are those of the tahsild\u0101rs of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Tuljapur, and Parenda, and of a Munsif for the t\u0101luks of Owsa and Kalam. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the chief magistrate, and the District Civil Judge is also a joint-magistrate, who exercises powers as such in the absence of the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r from head-quarters. The Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs and the tahsild\u0101rs exercise magisterial powers of the second and third class. Serious crime is not heavy in ordinary years, but in times of scarcity dacoities and cattle-thefts increase in proportion to the severity of the season.\n\nNothing is known of the revenue history of the District, beyond the fact that Malik Ambar\u2019s revenue system was in force from the beginning of the seventeenth century. His settlement was based upon an actual survey of the lands, and upon the productiveness of the soil. Villages were formerly leased by the State to revenue farmers, who received 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) annas per rupee for collection. So far as is known, the revenue has always been collected in money and never in kind. In 1866 the subdivisions of the District were formed, though they have been much altered since by frequent transfers. In 1883 a revenue survey was completed, and an assessment fixed for thirty years. The rates fixed approximated to those in the adjoining Bombay Districts of Ahmadnagar and Sholapur. The enhancement of revenue which resulted from the survey was 1\u00b72 lakhs, or over 11 per cent., the revenue having risen from 10\u00b722 to 11\u00b74 lakhs. The average assessment on \u2018dry\u2019 land is R. 1\u20130 (maximum Rs. 2\u20130, minimum R. 0\u20131), and on \u2018wet\u2019 land Rs. 3\u20130 (maximum Rs. 5\u20130, minimum R. 1\u20130).\n\nThe land revenue and total revenue of the District for a series of years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|        | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|\n| Land revenue | 10,21 | 11,67 | 11,80 | 11,77 |\n| Total revenue | 10,41 | 12,79 | 22,19 | 12,71 |\n\nSince 1888 a local cess of one anna in the rupee has been levied on land revenue for local purposes. Boards have been formed in every t\u0101luk, except Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, consisting of official and non-official members, with the tahsild\u0101rs as chairmen. A District board with the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r as president supervises the working of the t\u0101luk boards, as well as the Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d municipality. A small conservancy establishment is maintained at all the t\u0101luk head-quarters. The local cess in 1901 yielded Rs. 87,500, one-fourth of which was set apart for local works and the municipal establishments.\nThe First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the head of the police, with a Superintendent (Mohtamim) as his executive deputy. Under him are 8 inspectors, 41 subordinate officers, 376 constables, and 35 mounted police. These are distributed among 16 police stations, and guard the t\u0101luk treasuries. A small special police establishment, called the rakhw\u0101li, guards carts carrying merchandise, and any cattle or animals that bivouac at certain appointed places. This force is paid out of funds collected from the cartmen and owners of cattle at fixed rates. There is a District jail at Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, besides lock-ups in the outlying t\u0101luks. Only short-term prisoners are now kept in the District jail, those whose terms exceed six months being sent to the Central jail at Gulbarga.\n\nOsm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d occupies a fairly high position as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 3.1 per cent. (6 males and 0.12 females) could read and write in 1901. There were 44 public educational institutions in 1903. Of these, 12 were State and 32 local board schools. The number of pupils under instruction in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903 was 947, 2,055, 3,407, and 2,839 respectively, including 74 girls in 1903; no information is available regarding private schools. Of the 12 schools managed by the Educational department, 3 were girls' schools with 77 pupils, and 5 were secondary boys' schools. The first State school was opened in 1866, and the local board schools were started after the establishment of the local boards in 1888. The total amount spent on education in 1901 was Rs. 26,000, of which Rs. 16,600 was met from State funds and the remainder from Local funds; of this sum 52 per cent. was devoted to primary schools. The fee receipts for the year were Rs. 1,102.\n\nThe District has one hospital and three dispensaries, with accommodation for 40 in-patients. In 1901, 23,900 cases were treated, of whom 104 were in-patients, and 391 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 10,800, of which Rs. 9,400 was paid by the State, and the balance by the local boards.\n\nIn 1901 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 1,516, or 3 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is gaining favour with the people, though slowly.\n\n**Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d T\u0101luk.**\u2014Crown t\u0101luk in the centre of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, formerly known as Dh\u0101r\u0101seo. Its area, including j\u0101girs, is 417 square miles; and the population in 1901 was 77,533, compared with 92,829 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. It contains two towns, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d (population, 10,607), the head-quarters of the District and t\u0101luk, and Thair (7,327); and 87 villages, of which 9 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 amounted to 1.5 lakhs. Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d is composed wholly of regar or black cotton soil.\n\n**Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and t\u0101luk of\nOsm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in $18^\\circ 11'$ N. and $76^\\circ 3'$ E., 43 miles north of Shol\u0101pur and 32 miles east of B\u0101rsi town. Population (1901), 10,607. It lies in the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, and was formerly known as Dh\u0101r\u0101seo. The offices of the First, Second, and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs, the District engineer, Customs Superintendent, and the District civil court are all located here. Besides these, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d contains several schools, a State and a British sub-post office, and a dispensary. While the District was temporarily ceded to the British, from 1853 to 1860, the head-quarters were removed here from Naldrug, owing to the healthy climate of the place. It is a great centre of trade. Two miles north-east of the town is a group of seven caves, four of which are Jain, while the others are probably Vaishnav.\n\n**Osm\u0101nnagar.**\u2014A t\u0101luk formerly in N\u0101nder District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 290 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u016bgirs, was 37,667, compared with 48,355 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The land revenue in 1901 amounted to 1.2 lakhs. In 1905 the t\u0101luk was broken up, part being transferred to Biloli, and part to Kandah\u0101r.\n\n**Ottappid\u0101ram.**\u2014North-east t\u0101luk of Tinnevelly District, Madras, lying between $8^\\circ 41'$ and $9^\\circ 22'$ N. and $77^\\circ 41'$ and $78^\\circ 23'$ E., with an area of 1,072 square miles. The population in 1901 was 358,568, compared with 342,145 in 1891; the density is nearly 335 persons per square mile. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, Tuticorin (population, 28,048) and Ettaiv\u0101puram (8,788); and 394 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 3,45,000. By far the largest portion is zam\u012bnd\u0101ri land, the estates comprised in it including Ettaiv\u0101puram, the biggest in the District. It is almost entirely a wide plain of black cotton soil, though to the west and south a considerable area is red sand and loam. Rainfall is very scanty and there is little \u2018wet\u2019 cultivation, but cotton is grown very largely and sent to Tuticorin for export.\n\n**Ot\u016br.**\u2014Village in the Junnar t\u0101luka of Poona District, Bombay, situated in $19^\\circ 16'$ N. and $73^\\circ 59'$ E., about 50 miles north-north-west of Poona city. Population (1901), 6,392. Towards the close of Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule the tract of country round Ot\u016br was much desolated by inroads of Kh\u0101ndesh Bhils, for security against whom a high fort was built at Ot\u016br. In the neighbourhood are two temples: one dedicated to Keshav Chaitanya, the gur\u016b or spiritual preceptor of the celebrated Tuk\u0101r\u0101m; and the other a shrine of the god Mah\u0101deo, in whose honour an annual fair, attended by about 2,000 persons, is held in August or September. Ot\u016br contains one boys\u2019 school with 287 pupils and one girls\u2019 school with 54.\n\n**Ouchterlony Valley.**\u2014A beautiful valley in the G\u016bdal\u016br t\u0101luk of the Nilgiri District, Madras, lying between $11^\\circ 23'$ and $11^\\circ 30'$ N. and\n76\u00b0 26' and 76\u00b0 33' E., 39 square miles in extent, and at an average elevation of 3,000 feet above sea-level, below the south-western wall of the Nilgiri plateau. It takes its name from Colonel J. Ouchterlony, R.E., who made the first survey of the Nilgiris in the fourth decade of the last century and wrote a valuable memoir upon the District. The valley is now an important centre of coffee, tea, and cinchona cultivation, though the whole neighbourhood has suffered severely from the depression in the planting industry and few of the many Europeans who once resided in it remain. The area under coffee is nearly 4,000 acres, the Guyned estate alone containing an unbroken block of 800 acres in full bearing. The population in 1901 was 5,265.\n\n**Oudh (Awadh)**\u2014A British Province, forming part of the United Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 34' and 28\u00b0 42' N. and 79\u00b0 41' and 83\u00b0 8' E., with an area of 23,966 square miles. Population (1901), 12,833,077. The name is a corruption of that of the ancient city of Ajodhy\u0101 (Ayodhy\u0101), which became the seat of a local governor under the early Muhammadan rulers. Oudh is bounded on the north by the State of Nep\u0101l, and on all other sides by the Province of Agra. The Gorakhpur and Benares Divisions lie on the east, the Bareilly and Agra Divisions on the west, and the Allah\u0101b\u0101d Division on the south. The river Ganges forms the greater part of the south-western boundary.\n\nOudh includes portions of two of the great natural divisions of Upper India. The three northern Districts of Kher\u012b, Bahraich, and Gond\u0101 stretch up into the submontane tract lying below the Him\u0101layas, while the remainder of the Province lies in the central portion of the Gangetic plain. The northern boundary of Bahraich and Gond\u0101 runs for 60 miles along the low hills which mark the first rise above the level of the plain; but the submontane tract or tarai is chiefly distinguished by its greater slope and excessive moisture, due to a heavier rainfall and the drainage from the outer ranges of the Him\u0101layas. In the northern portion of the Province there are large areas of forest land. Geologically, the whole of Oudh is classified as Gangetic alluvium. No rock or stone is found except kankar (nodular limestone), which is used for metalling roads. Gold is obtained in very small quantities by washing sand in the rivers in the north of the Province. Salt was extensively manufactured during native rule, but the industry has been prohibited for many years. The flora is described in the article on the United Provinces.\n\nThe country slopes from north-west to south-east, and the drainage follows the same line, being divided into two great river systems, those of the Gogra and Ganges, which ultimately unite in Bengal. The\n\n---\n\n1 This article deals only with matters in which Oudh differs from the rest of the United Provinces, to the article on which reference should be made for other details.\nProvince may thus be divided into two tracts separated by the Gogra. On the north-east the Districts of Bahraich and Gond\u0101 form a triangular area, a portion of which is drained by the R\u0101pt\u012b, with a course roughly parallel to that of the Gogra, into which it falls in Gorakhpur District, while the greater part of the drainage is carried directly into that river. The rest of the Province is roughly rectangular in shape, and lies between the Gogra and the Ganges. Through the centre of this portion flow the Gumt\u012b and its southern tributary the Sai, which carry off most of the drainage into the Ganges. It is only in the northern Districts of Kher\u012b and Sit\u0101pur that the Gogra obtains an increase to its volume through the S\u0101rd\u0101 and its branches. The numerous shallow ponds or jhils, of which the D\u0101har Lake is the most important, form a more valuable source for irrigation than the rivers.\n\nThe general aspect of the Province, except during the hot season when the land is bare, is that of a rich expanse of waving and very varied crops, interspersed with numerous ponds or shallow lakes, mango groves, and bamboo clumps. The villages lie thickly scattered, consisting of low cottages surrounded by patches of garden-land. The dense foliage of mango plantations marks the site of almost every little homestead. Mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), plantains, guavas, and jack-fruits add further beauty to the village plots. The scenery, as a whole, has few claims to attention, except so far as trees and water may occasionally combine to produce a pleasing effect; but the varied colouring of the ripe crops, the sky, and the groves or buildings, often charm the eye under the soft haze of a tropical atmosphere.\n\nThe legendary accounts of Oudh centre round Ajodhy\u0101 or Awadh, the city from which the Province takes its name. This was the capital of Kosala, the kingdom of Dasaratha of the Solar race, father of R\u0101ma, from which the hero went forth into exile with his wife Sit\u0101 and his brother Lakshmana, and to which he returned in triumph after the defeat of R\u0101vana, king of Ceylon. Many places in Oudh are visited by pilgrims on appointed days as connected with the story. After the death of R\u0101ma the kingdom was divided into Northern Kosala, ruled by his son, Lava, at Sr\u0101vasti; and Southern Kosala, ruled by another son, Kusa. No approximate date can be assigned to whatever may be historical in the story of the R\u0101m\u0101yana.\n\nIn the Buddhist literature of the centuries immediately before the Christian era, Sr\u0101vasti figures as an important place at which Gautama spent many years. Its exact site is disputed, but the kingdom of which it was the capital certainly included part of Oudh north of the Gogra. The rest of the Province still preserves many remains of the Buddhist faith, which have not been thoroughly examined. An inscription of\nthe twelfth or thirteenth century found at Set Mahet in Gond\u0101 and Bahraich Districts shows that Buddhist tenets were held as late as that date, but the Chinese pilgrims in the fifth and seventh centuries lament that the faithful were even then few.\n\nLittle more is known of Oudh up to the rise of the Guptas of Magadha, who gradually extended their dominions westward from Patna in the fourth century A.D., and according to the Pur\u0101nas took S\u0101ketam or Ajodhy\u0101. The once populous tract north of the Gogra relapsed into jungle, and the ancient city of Sr\u0101vast\u012b was deserted by the seventh century.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Th\u0101rus who are still found in the tarai descended from the hills in the eighth or ninth century; and legend tells of a line of Somavansi kings, the last of whom, Suhil Deo, fought with Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r. In these dark ages, while the R\u0101jput clans were rising into importance, Western Oudh must have been subject to the rulers of Kanauj or Katehr, and Eastern Oudh to Benares, till this was absorbed in the great kingdom of Kanauj.\n\nThe raid of Mahm\u016bd Ghaznivid, in 1018\u20139, extended from Kanauj through part of Southern Oudh; and there are many tombs in the Province, said to be those of warriors who fell in the expedition of his canonized nephew, Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r, the tomb of the saint himself being at Bahraich. It was nearly two centuries later, however, before Muhammad Ghori\u2019s general, Kutb-ud-din, finally defeated Jai Chand of Kanauj in 1194, and thus broke up the last great Hindu kingdom. Not long afterwards the Bhars, a dark-skinned aboriginal race still existing as a low caste, rose into importance in Southern Oudh and in Bundelkhand, but were crushed in 1247; and the history of the Province for nearly 500 years is a part of the general history of the kingdom of Delhi. There were local governors at Ajodhy\u0101, Bahraich, Sandila, M\u0101nikpur, and other places, who often found it difficult to maintain their authority; for in Oudh, as in Bundelkhand, the Hindus were never thoroughly subdued, as they were at an early date in the Do\u0101b and later in Rohilkhand. In 1394 Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n was made governor of Kanauj, Oudh, Kar\u0101, and Jaunpur, and soon afterwards assumed independence. For more than eighty years the Province formed part of the great Shark\u012b (or Eastern) kingdom of Jaunpur, and shared in the struggle with Delhi, which ended with the fall of Jaunpur in 1478. In the south-western corner Tilok Chand, head of the Bais R\u0101jputs, gradually rose to power and became the greatest noble in Oudh, with a large tract owning his sway, known as Baisw\u0101r\u0101.\n\nAfter B\u0101bar had gained a footing in Hindust\u0101n by his victory at P\u0101nipat in 1526, and had advanced to Agra, the defeated Afgh\u0101n house of Lod\u012b still occupied the Central Do\u0101b, Oudh, and the eastern Districts of the present United Provinces. In 1527 B\u0101bar, on his\nreturn from Central India, defeated his opponents in Southern Oudh near Kanauj, and passed on through the Province as far as Ajodhy\u0101, where he built a mosque in 1528, on the site renowned as the birthplace of R\u0101ma. The Afgh\u0101ns remained in opposition after the death of B\u0101bar in 1530, but were defeated near Lucknow in the following year. The Mughal power was, however, still far from secure; and Sher Kh\u0101n (afterwards Sher Sh\u0101h), the new leader of the Afgh\u0101ns, gradually increased his influence till in 1540, by his victory at Kanauj, he compelled Hum\u0101y\u016bn to fly from India. For five years the country was at rest; but on the death of Sher Sh\u0101h in 1545 the Afgh\u0101n power began to fall to pieces, and Hum\u0101y\u016bn returned in 1555. Under Akbar a redistribution of the empire into provinces took place. Oudh was formed into a S\u016bbah or province, containing five sark\u0101rs or divisions and thirty-eight mah\u0101ls or parganas. The provincial forces consisted of 7,640 cavalry, 168,250 infantry, and 59 elephants. Awadh or Ajodhy\u0101 was then one of the principal cities in India, and Lucknow was rising in importance. Akbar's government was not established without a struggle; and in 1565 the j\u0101g\u012brd\u0101rs Iskandar Kh\u0101n of Ajodhy\u0101 and Kh\u0101n Zam\u0101n of Jaunpur revolted and took Lucknow, but were soon defeated. It is noticeable that in the list of Akbar's grandees only three belonged to Oudh, one of whom was a Hindu, the celebrated Todar Mal.\n\nThe rule of the Mughal emperors was uneventful for Oudh during the next 150 years, when the chief centre of interest lay in the Deccan. Local prosperity may be inferred from the rise in revenue, which was 50 lakhs in 1594 and 83 lakhs about 1720, while the measured area had increased from 9,933 to 18,577 square miles. In the struggles for the succession to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n and Aurangzeb Oudh played no important part. When, however, the Mughal empire fell to pieces, small states arose, the rulers of which obtained practical independence. Among these Oudh took the first place; and its importance dates from the appointment about 1724 of Muhammad Amin, originally a merchant from Khor\u0101s\u0101n, to be governor of Oudh, with the titles of Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n and Burh\u0101n-ul-mulk. The new governor was a great soldier, who soon reduced those of the local Hindu chieftains who opposed him. He built a house a few miles west of Ajodhy\u0101, round which grew up the new town of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d; but most of his time was spent elsewhere, fighting at one time against the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and at another against N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, or fulfilling the duties of his office as Waz\u012br of the empire. Deputies managed his two provinces of Oudh and Allah\u0101b\u0101d, and on the whole ruled well under his guidance.\n\nHe was succeeded in 1739 by his nephew and son-in-law, Safdar Jang, who had been his deputy at Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, and was an able statesman. Under both these rulers the Province enjoyed great prosperity, and\nforts, wells, and bridges were constructed. In 1745 Safdar Jang quarrelled with Ali Muhammad, who was then consolidating the Rohillas on the western boundary of Oudh; and thus commenced the long struggle which was to end in the addition of Rohilkhand to Oudh. When the old Niz\u0101m of the Deccan died in 1748, he was succeeded in his office as Waz\u012br of the empire by Safdar Jang. Then followed a war with the Path\u0101n chief of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, which resulted in Safdar Jang\u2019s invoking the assistance of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who afterwards became a menace to his own province. The immediate result, however, was that the Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d territory became practically dependent on Oudh. In 1754 the emperor Ahmad Sh\u0101h deprived Safdar Jang of his office as Waz\u012br, and aided by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s successfully drove him back to Oudh when he attempted, with the help of the J\u0101ts, to seize Delhi. In the same year Safdar Jang died and was succeeded by his son, Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, who removed the capital for a time to Lucknow, which had first become a considerable town in the time of Sher Sh\u0101h. He was engaged almost at once in conjunction with the Rohillas in repelling the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who had been summoned by the new Waz\u012br, Gh\u0101z\u012b-ud-d\u012bn, and were now looked on as a common enemy of the states of Hindust\u0101n. When the prince Al\u012b Gauhar (afterwards Sh\u0101h Alam II) escaped from Delhi, he was received by Shuj\u0101-ud-daula and advised to proceed against Bengal, where the British power was increasing. In 1761 Shuj\u0101-ud-daula fought by the side of the other Muhammadan chiefs in the great battle at P\u0101n\u012bpat, and soon afterwards Sh\u0101h Alam gave up his fruitless contests with the British, and retired to Allah\u0101b\u0101d. Here he was under the control of Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, who was appointed to the office of Waz\u012br, which henceforth became hereditary in his family. After the massacre at Patna in 1763, Mir K\u0101sim and his lieutenant, Sumr\u016b, fled to Oudh and were joined by the emperor and Shuj\u0101-ud-daula; but the allied troops failed to take Patna and were completely defeated by the British at Buxar in 1764. Sh\u0101h Alam, who had taken no part in the fighting, went over to the British, while Shuj\u0101-ud-daula fled through Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Lucknow to Bareilly. He obtained some help from the Path\u0101ns, and even from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and again faced the British in 1765 near J\u0101jm\u0101u in Cawnpore District, but suffered defeat a second time. By the treaty then proposed, the British were to obtain the greater part of the present Benares Division, and Sh\u0101h Alam was to be placed in possession of the rest of Oudh. The Court of Directors, however, refused to sanction this arrangement, and everything was restored to Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, except the districts south of the Ganges (now Cawnpore, Fatehpur, and Allah\u0101b\u0101d), which were made over to the emperor. Shuj\u0101-ud-daula also undertook to pay the British a contribution of 50 lakhs. About this time he moved his court back to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, where he built a fort and greatly increased the\nprosperity of the city. In 1769 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s returned to Hindust\u0101n and assumed a most threatening attitude. Two years later, the emperor disregarded the advice of the British and joined them, leaving Allah\u0101b\u0101d in charge of Shuj\u0101-ud-daula. The danger to Oudh and the British was imminent, and when the Mar\u0101th\u0101s extorted a grant of the Allah\u0101b\u0101d territory from Sh\u0101h Alam, British troops were sent to occupy Chun\u0101r and Allah\u0101b\u0101d. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s pressed on, and in 1773 Sir Robert Barker marched to guard the frontiers of Oudh and Rohilkhand under a guarantee of a lakh of rupees a month. British troops aided in driving the Mar\u0101th\u0101s out of Rohilkhand, and later in the year Warren Hastings met Shuj\u0101-ud-daula at Benares. The result was the cession to the Wazir of the Allah\u0101b\u0101d territory, which was taken from the emperor because of his grant of it to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, while the Wazir paid the Company 50 lakhs and undertook to pay 25 lakhs a year, besides the cost of a brigade of British troops to be stationed on the borders of his territories. A permanent British Resident was appointed for the first time at his court, and these arrangements may be said to mark the conversion of Oudh into a state dependent on the Company. Shuj\u0101-ud-daula now made fresh efforts to reduce the Rohillas, who had been intriguing with the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and had refused to pay for the help given them in 1772. The Council at Calcutta hesitated, but finally sent troops; and in 1774 Rohilkhand was added to Oudh, with the exception of the present R\u0101mpur State, which was left in the hands of a Rohilla chief.\n\nShuj\u0101-ud-daula died in 1775, and was succeeded by his son, Asaf-ud-daula, who was incapable and inclined to debauchery. He was at once required to cede to the Company the zam\u012bnd\u0101ri of Benares, and to pay more for British troops. His personal extravagance was great, and he demanded large sums from his mother, the Bahu Begam. The court was now finally removed to Lucknow, and Fyz\u0101b\u0101d began to decline, while most of the state suffered from his failure to exercise any personal authority and from the quarrels of his subordinates. In 1781 a new treaty was made by Warren Hastings, under which the British troops in Oudh were reduced to one brigade and one regiment, and the Naw\u0101b was authorized to resume j\u0101g\u012brs or grants of land. Asaf-ud-daula took advantage of this to confiscate the j\u0101g\u012brs of his mother and grandmother, and by imprisoning their chief officers extorted large sums of money from them. Warren Hastings's share in these transactions was one of the counts in his subsequent impeachment. His approval of the resumption of the j\u0101g\u012brs was, however, justified by the behaviour of the Begams, who had raised the whole of Eastern Oudh against the British when the \u00e9meute at Benares took place in 1781.\n\n1 Warren Hastings's Insurrection at Banaris, Appendix, p. 8 (Roorkee reprint, 1853).\nAsaf-ud-daula died in 1797, and was succeeded\u2014after a short interval, during which his reputed son, Waz\u012br Ali, ruled\u2014by his half-brother, Sa\u0101dat Ali Kh\u0101n, who concluded a treaty ceding to the Company the fort of Allah\u0101b\u0101d and promising an annual subsidy of 76 lakhs, while the British in return undertook the entire defence of Oudh. Four years later, after the threatened attack by Zam\u0101n Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni, Rohilkhand and other parts of the Oudh territories were in a state of anarchy, and it was feared that Sindhia would seize the opportunity to attack the state. The Naw\u0101b, therefore, executed a fresh treaty giving up the so-called Ceded Provinces\u00b9, which left him with the area now called Oudh, surrounded on all sides by British territory except on the north, where the Gurkhas ruled. Sa\u0101dat Ali Kh\u0101n died in 1814, having been a good ruler compared with his predecessor. In particular, he attempted to reform the revenue administration, one of his chief difficulties being the resumption of grants made by previous rulers. At his death the treasury contained 14 crores of rupees, though all establishments had been paid up to date and there were no debts.\n\nThe history of his successors is a miserable record. The only redeeming feature of the period is the occasional employment as minister of the capable Mahd\u012b Ali Kh\u0101n, who had been trained under Sa\u0101dat Ali. Gh\u0101zi-ud-d\u012bn Haidar, son of Sa\u0101dat Ali, was allowed to assume the title of king or Sh\u0101h in 1819, and was the first to strike coin in his own name. He spent four crores of the treasure left by his father, and was succeeded in 1827 by his son, Nas\u012br-ud-d\u012bn Haidar, a debauchee, who aped English manners and left only 70 lakhs when he died in 1837. An attempt was then made to place a putative son on the throne; but a few of the Company\u2019s sepoys were sufficient to quell the disturbance that arose, and the uncle of the late king succeeded as Muhammad Ali Sh\u0101h. He died in 1842 and was followed by his son, Amjad Ali Sh\u0101h (died 1847). In 1850 it was estimated that W\u0101jid Ali Sh\u0101h, the last king, was spending more than 20 lakhs annually over and above the whole revenue of the state, while the allowances of his officials and his family were greatly in arrears. Muhammad Ali Sh\u0101h had made some attempts at reform in the administration of justice and the revenue system; but Mahd\u012b Ali Kh\u0101n, whom he recalled for the purpose, was then an old man, and nothing came of them.\n\nOpen resistance to the king\u2019s officials and defiance of all law and order were the ordinary rule. Chronic anarchy and oppression had reduced the people of Oudh to extreme misery, and reform by its\n\n\u00b9 The present Gorakhpur Division, most of the Bareilly Division, and the Districts of Allah\u0101b\u0101d, Cawnpore, Fatehpur, Et\u0101wah, Mainpuri, Etah, and Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, the south of Mirz\u0101pur, and the Tarai parganas of the Kumaun Division.\nnative rulers had long been hopeless. In 1828 the Resident had reported that only British assumption of administration could save the country from ruin, and in 1834 the Court of Directors had authorized this step; but it was averted for the time by the improvement effected by Mahdi Ali Khan. In 1856 affairs had come to such a pass that a treaty was proposed to the king, which provided, on liberal terms to himself and his heirs, for the cession of his state to the Company. The king, however, refused to sign it; and accordingly, in February, 1856, the British Government assumed to itself the government of Oudh, exclusively and for ever. A provision of 12 lakhs a year was offered to the king, which he accepted in October, 1859, and separate provision was sanctioned for his collateral relatives. Wajid Ali Shah was allowed to retain the title of king of Oudh till his death in 1887, when the title ceased absolutely, and the pecuniary allowances were reduced. On its annexation, Oudh was constituted into a Chief Commissionership, and organized on the model of administration which had been adopted in the Punjab eight years previously. Troops had been moved in, and one British infantry regiment held Lucknow, while Native regiments garrisoned Sitapur, Fyzabad, Sultanpur, Bahraich, Daryabad, Salon, and Secora. The first year after annexation passed on the whole quietly.\n\nThe annexation had, however, caused considerable discontent among important classes. The talukdars feared, with more or less reason, the loss of position and estate. The sepoys, who were largely recruited from the Province, anticipated the curtailment of the exceptional privileges which they had enjoyed while their homes were in native territory. The rebellion began in Oudh a fortnight after the outbreak at Meerut gave the signal for a general rising. In March, 1857, Sir Henry Lawrence had assumed the administration at Lucknow; and on May 30 five of the Native regiments broke into mutiny. The remainder of the events connected with the siege and recovery of the capital are narrated in the article on Lucknow City, and need only be briefly mentioned here. For some time the talukdars, with few exceptions, took no active part in the revolt; several of them did noble service in saving the lives of fugitives; but the native garrisons of the out-stations followed the example of their comrades at Lucknow, and by the middle of June the Residency at Lucknow was the only spot in the Province under the British flag. On July 4 Sir Henry Lawrence died from wounds caused by a shell. For twelve weeks the little Lucknow garrison was besieged by an overwhelming body of mutineers, till relieved by Outram and Havelock on September 25. In spite of this reinforcement, the British force found itself too weak to fall back upon Cawnpore, and the siege continued till raised by Sir Colin Campbell on November 17. The women and children were\nthen escorted to Cawnpore by the main body, while General Outram held the outlying post of the Alamb\u0101gh with a small garrison. Lucknow itself remained in the hands of the rebels, who fortified it carefully under the direction of the Begam\\(^1\\) of Oudh. Early in 1858 General Franks organized a force at Benares for the reconquest of the Province, and cleared the south-eastern Districts of rebels. At the same time Jang Bah\u0101dur, the minister of Nep\u0101l, assisted the British with a body of 8,000 Gurkhas, and twice defeated the insurgents with great slaughter. On the last day in February Sir Colin Campbell crossed the Ganges and marched on Lucknow. Occupying the Dilkush\u0101 palace on March 5, he effected a junction with Franks and the Nep\u0101lese army, and began the siege the next day. The city was captured after a desperate resistance, and the work of reorganization of the Province began. Early in April Sir Hope Grant marched with a column north-west of Lucknow, and soon afterwards General Walpole passed through Hardoi. In May the rebels who threatened the Cawnpore road were dispersed, and in June the Begam\u2019s army, which was threatening Lucknow, was defeated. General Grant marched to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d in July and then south to Sult\u0101npur, while a force co-operated from Allah\u0101b\u0101d. The military police, which had been reorganized, and a Sikh contingent under R\u0101j\u0101 Randh\u012br Singh of Kap\u016brthala did valuable service; and when the Commander-in-Chief took the field in November, 1858, the rebellion collapsed at once, and Oudh was pacified by the end of the year.\n\nOudh is rich in ancient sites, but none of these has yet been regularly explored, except the mounds at Set Mahet in Gond\u0101 and Bahraich Districts, which yielded important Buddhist and Jain remains. Opinions are divided as to whether this is the site of the ancient city of Sr\u0101vasti. Popular belief associates many places with the aboriginal Bhars, of whose history little is known. At Ajodhy\u0101, which is connected with the legendary history of the Solar race, the Hindu temples are all of modern date. The early Muhammadan period is chiefly represented by traditions of the religious incursion of Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r, whose tomb at Bahraich was built early in the thirteenth century, or 200 years after his death. The mosque of B\u0101bar at Ajodhy\u0101, and the remains of a few buildings erected by the S\u016bri Path\u0101ns, may also be mentioned. The Mughals have left few memorials in the Province; and the chief buildings now standing are those erected by the Naw\u0101bs and kings of Oudh in the last quarter of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries, at Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Lucknow. The earlier buildings of this period are not unpleasing; but the style degenerated, and the later edifices are vulgar in the extreme.\n\n\\(^1\\) Wife of W\u0101jid Ali Sh\u0101h, the last king, and mother of Birjis Kadar, who assumed the throne.\nOudh has probably the densest rural population of any equal area in the world. The first Census taken in 1869 returned a total population of 11.2 millions, on an area of 24,000 square miles, yielding an average of 468 persons per square mile; but defects in the procedure probably caused the figures to be exaggerated. In 1881 the population was returned at 11.4 millions, the central Districts having suffered from famine. Ten years later there had been an increase to 12.7 millions, and all parts of the Province showed an increase in prosperity. The famine of 1896-7 caused distress in southern and western Oudh, especially in Hardoi and R\u0101\u0113 Bareli, but the total population increased to 12.8 millions in 1901. Statistics of the population in 1901 for each of the twelve Districts included in the two Divisions of Lucknow and Fyz\u0101b\u0101d will be found in the article on the United Provinces. The average density was 535 persons per square mile; but in single Districts the figure varied from 820 in Lucknow and 704 in Fyz\u0101b\u0101d to 305 in Kheri. Central Oudh is the most thickly populated portion, while the submontane Districts are less crowded, but are filling up rapidly. Emigration to distant parts of India and to the colonies is becoming considerable. Partabgarh and R\u0101\u0113 Bareli Districts in southern Oudh send the largest numbers to Assam, while the northern Districts of Gond\u0101 and Fyz\u0101b\u0101d supply emigrants to the colonies. The principal city in the Province is Lucknow, which has a population of 264,049, including the cantonments, and is larger than any city in India except the three Presidency towns and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. Fyz\u0101b\u0101d (with Ajodhy\u0101) has a population of 75,085; but there are only three other towns, Bahaich (27,304), Sit\u0101pur (22,557), and Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d (20,036), whose population exceeds 20,000. The absence of large cities and towns is remarkable, and the agricultural population forms nearly 73 per cent. of the total.\n\nThe proportion of Hindus to Musalm\u0101ns in the total population of Oudh is much the same as in the Province of Agra, though the Musalm\u0101ns are numerically a little weaker and are found to a larger extent in towns. Out of 1.7 millions of Musalm\u0101ns more than 62,000 are Shiahs, the largest numbers being in Lucknow city, where the sect of the former kings still has many followers.\n\nExcept in Hardoi District, where a dialect of Western Hind\u012b is spoken, the language of the whole of Oudh is the Awadh\u012b dialect of Eastern Hind\u012b, an old form of which was used by Tulsi D\u0101s, the author of the vernacular version of the R\u0101m\u0101yana which has been termed the Bible of Upper India. The dialect is still a favourite vehicle for verse, as its forms are more suitable to the indigenous metres than Urd\u016b or Hindust\u0101n\u012b, which is used for prose or in conversation by educated people.\nThe caste system is described in the article on the United Provinces. In rural tracts more respect is paid to the higher castes than in the Do\u0101b, and the prejudices of Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs against touching a plough are recognized by their landlords, who allow them privileged rates of rent. Br\u0101hmans number 1\u00b74 millions, and Ah\u012brs and Cham\u0101rs 1\u00b73 millions each. Among the cultivating classes may be mentioned the Kurm\u012bs (0\u00b79 million), and Lodhas and Muraos (0\u00b74 million each); and among lower castes the P\u0101s\u012bs, numbering nearly a million, who are largely employed as toddy-drawers, chauki-d\u0101rs, and labourers.\n\nNo metalled roads existed in Oudh at the time of annexation, except that from Cawnpore to Lucknow. After the pacification in 1858 the first lines of communication to be taken up were roads from Allah\u0101b\u0101d to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and from Lucknow to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d. With the extension of railways the roads have become only of local importance. The main line and a loop of the broad-gauge Oudh and Rohilkhand State Railway pass from north-west to south-east through Oudh south of the Gogra, while an important branch connects Lucknow with Cawnpore, and a line from Allah\u0101b\u0101d through Part\u0101bgarh and Sult\u0101npur to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d has recently been opened. The submontane Districts are well served by the narrow-gauge Bengal and North-Western (Company) line and the Lucknow-Sit\u0101pur (State) Railway.\n\nOudh remained a separate administration until February, 1877, when the offices of Chief Commissioner of Oudh and Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces were united. Since 1902 the title of Chief Commissioner has merged in that of Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces. In revenue matters the Chief Commissioner remained the principal authority till after the passing of Act XX of 1890, under which the control of the North-Western Provinces Board of Revenue was extended to Oudh. For most administrative purposes there is now no difference between the Provinces of Oudh and Agra. The principal exceptions are in the land revenue system, especially in its relation to tenures, the rent law, and the judicial system, each of which will now be described.\n\nOn the acquisition of what is now the Province of Agra, the policy adopted was to set aside the officials who, during the decline of Mughal power, had acquired quasi-proprietary rights and an hereditary position. The official zam\u012bnd\u0101rs of Bengal had been tried and found wanting, and an attempt was made to engage for the payment of revenue with the actual occupiers of the soil. In several Districts a double proprietary right was found, the holder of the superior right being called a talukd\u0101r. The relation of the talukd\u0101r to the subordinate proprietor was, however, largely a temporary arrangement due to the disturbed state of the\ncountry; and the subordinate proprietors were therefore invested with full proprietary rights, subject, in some cases, to the payment of an allowance to the talukd\u0101rs, who were confirmed only in their ancestral estates. The same policy was applied to Oudh on annexation, though the circumstances were not identical. The talukd\u0101rs then held 23,543 villages in the Province out of 36,721. A summary settlement was made in 1856, which recognized the rights of the talukd\u0101rs in 13,640 villages with a revenue of 35 lakhs, and set them aside in 9,903 villages with a revenue of 32 lakhs. The Mutiny broke out in May, 1857, and on the restoration of order in 1858 the policy was completely reversed. In the first place, the proprietary right in practically all the land of the Province was declared to be confiscated on account of rebellion. This proclamation was severely censured in India and in England, but was justified on the ground that the change in policy required the cancellation of existing rights. Only five\\(^1\\) talukd\u0101rs had remained loyal; their rights were maintained, and they were subsequently rewarded with large additional grants and a permanent settlement. The other talukd\u0101rs and landholders were called on to submit, and a liberal measure of indulgence was promised to those who came forward promptly and helped to restore order. Though order had not been completely restored, owing to the suspicion of the talukd\u0101rs regarding the real intentions of Government, summary settlements were commenced in 1859 and 22,658 villages were settled with talukd\u0101rs. This reversal of the former policy became the subject of much discussion. Lord Canning in April, 1858, described the majority of the talukd\u0101rs as men, distinguished neither by birth, good service, nor connexion with the soil, who had acquired their position by holding office under a corrupt government; but at the same time he justified the new policy by declaring that the village proprietors had shown themselves unfit for the position in which they had been put. In October he was of opinion that the action of the latter had almost amounted to an admission that they did not value independent rights, and that the talukd\u0101ri system was \u2018the ancient, indigenous, and cherished system of the country.\u2019 More complete inquiries than were then possible have shown that neither of these statements was altogether correct. With some notable exceptions the majority of talukd\u0101rs at annexation were not officials, but belonged to families connected with the soil. Many of them were the descendants of hereditary chiefs, whose authority had long been acknowledged over wide tracts of country. So far as the talukas represented these chieftainships, or the territory held by a body of clansmen with their R\u0101j\u0101 as its head, they were no doubt ancient and indigenous. In its later form, how-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The proclamation of March, 1858, mentioned six, but one was found later to have rebelled.\never, when the system had developed under a weak and corrupt government, it is more correctly described as one of convenience, as far as the village proprietors were concerned, than as a cherished institution. Alm\u0101s Al\u012b, the capable minister of Naw\u0101b Sa\u0101dat Al\u012b Kh\u0101n at the end of the eighteenth century, took pains to engage directly with the village occupiers in the part of the Province under his control. For fifty years afterwards a weak central government made few attempts to control its corrupt officials or to keep the peace among the talukd\u0101rs. The petty R\u0101j\u0101s, constantly fighting with each other or with the officials, were interested in attaching to themselves village communities who could aid them with fighting men, while the latter gained by voluntarily including their villages in talukas, as the talukd\u0101rs paid revenue direct to Lucknow and the extortions of the collectors were avoided. Thus by 1856 many of the estates held by representatives of old families had grown far beyond their original limits, by voluntary accessions, by the conquest of weaker neighbours, or by the crushing of the village proprietors. In addition there were the comparatively few large talukas put together by court favourites, officials, or bankers.\n\nThe summary settlement of 1859 restored the status of 1856, regardless of the methods by which estates had been acquired, except where estates were permanently confiscated for murder or the refusal to submit. The same year a declaration was issued that those talukd\u0101rs with whom a settlement had been made had acquired permanent, heritable, and transferable rights in their talukas. Formal certificates (sanads) announcing this were drawn up and distributed. An Act to define the rights of talukd\u0101rs and to regulate the succession to their estates was subsequently passed (The Oudh Estates Act, 1869). The result has been to give the talukd\u0101rs absolute powers of disposal of their property, either in their lifetime, or by will\\(^1\\), notwithstanding the limits imposed by Hindu or Muhammadan law. Most estates descend in case of intestacy to a single heir under a law of primogeniture, the rules of which are contained in section 22 of the Oudh Estates Act, but others are subject to the ordinary law of inheritance.\n\nThe talukd\u0101rs, like the large landholders in all parts of India, have had their troubles. Debts before annexation and mismanagement afterwards involved many of their estates, and in 1870 an Act was passed for their relief. The estates of those who applied to come under its operation were vested in managers, and as a consequence all civil suits and the execution of decrees against such estates were suspended. In all, forty-seven estates with a rental of 25 lakhs were brought under the Act; but three were released almost at once. The remaining\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) When all heirs are disinherited, the will has effect only if executed more than three months before the death of the testator and registered within one month of the date of execution.\nforty-four properties were found to be indebted to the amount of 32 lakhs. The working of the Act, while favourable to the talukd\u0101rs, gave rise to well-founded complaints by creditors. Mortgagees in possession could be ousted, and interest was reduced to not more than 6 per cent. In 1873 it was proposed to make Government loans, so as to free those estates which were certainly capable of repaying them with 5 per cent. interest in twenty years; but two years later it was decided that all private debts should be paid off by loans from Government. More than $26\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs was advanced, and the cost of management was reduced by making Deputy-Commissioners responsible for it. The later administration of the Act was thus similar to the operations of the Court of Wards.\n\nIn 1894 the talukd\u0101rs asked that the Act of 1870 might be revived, and also raised the question of making estates inalienable. Discussion followed, and in 1900 an Act was passed providing that talukd\u0101rs and grantees in whose estates the rule of primogeniture is in force may apply for permission to bring their estates under the Act. If property is encumbered it may only be 'settled' (or entailed) with the consent of all the encumbrancers, or when Government is satisfied that their interests will not suffer. The 'settlement' may be declared irrevocable, or, if this is not done, it may be cancelled with the sanction of Government. The effect of the Act is to make the holder of a 'settled' estate incapable of alienating or encumbering it; leases may be given only for seven or, with the District officer's sanction, for fourteen years; a testator may only bequeath 'settled' property as a whole, and must bequeath it to an heir. Up to the end of 1904 five estates had been 'settled' under the Act, all but one irrevocably.\n\nThe terms of the sanads of 1859 reserved to the Government power to take such measures as it might think fit to protect the inferior proprietors and village occupants, and an acute controversy took place which was not settled till 1866. In regard to the subordinate proprietors, the dispute was whether rights should be recognized only so far as they were actually enjoyed in 1856, or whether the enjoyment in previous years of rights subsequently lost should be held to give a valid claim. It was soon decided that the settlement courts and not the civil courts should adjudicate on disputed cases, and should be allowed to hear claims to sub-proprietary rights based on enjoyment of rights as far back as 1844 or twelve years before annexation. The definition of what should be considered an enjoyment of rights proved more difficult, and there was hopeless disagreement over the rights of tenants. In the latter case the question turned on whether there was any custom by which length of tenure gave a right of occupancy. An inquiry was held, the results of which were differently interpreted. Finally, in 1866, it was found possible to dispose of the two matters together by\nwhat is known as the Oudh Compromise. The talukd\u0101rs agreed to the detailed rules drawn up for the guidance of the settlement courts in dealing with claims to sub-proprietary rights, which were embodied in Act XXVI of 1866 and later executive orders. It was at the same time decided that tenants who had held proprietary rights within thirty years of annexation should receive occupancy rights, while no other tenant-right was recognized.\n\nIn Oudh the Government demand for revenue has from the first been nominally half of the net rental \u2018assets.\u2019 Where both superior and inferior proprietary rights exist, the settlement was made with the superior proprietor or talukd\u0101r. It was then decided by the settlement court whether a sub-settlement should be made with the inferior proprietor or not. The latter is called a sub-settlement holder where this was done, and his rights include the power of transfer. In other cases the right awarded was a permanent, heritable, but not transferable lease at a rent fixed by the settlement court. The sub-settlement holder or permanent lessee manages the area in which he has rights, and pays rent (which includes the Government demand) to the talukd\u0101r. If he falls into arrears, the talukd\u0101r may either sue in the rent courts or apply to the District officer to collect the rent for him.\n\nIt has been shown that the proposal to grant occupancy rights in Oudh based on long holding was given up. By Act XIX of 1868, however, tenants who had possessed proprietary rights within thirty years of annexation, and had lost them when annexation took place, received a heritable, but not a transferable, right of occupancy in the land held by them in the village or estate where they were formerly proprietors. This right includes protection from eviction, except for non-payment of arrears of rent, and carries with it a privileged rate of rent which cannot be enhanced beyond a rate $12\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. below that paid in the neighbourhood by tenants with no right. When the revenue law was consolidated, Acts XVII and XVIII of 1876 granted a similar right to landholders whose proprietary or under-proprietary rights were transferred for arrears of land revenue, or in execution of decree after the passing of these Acts, in respect of as much of the land in their cultivating occupancy at the time of transfer as the District officer might determine. Important changes were introduced by the United Provinces Acts III and IV of 1901. Ex-proprietors who acquire rights under these Acts enjoy a privilege in rent of four annas in the rupee (or one-fourth), and by the latter Act the right was extended to persons whose proprietary or under-proprietary rights had been transferred by voluntary alienation. The right acquired under these Acts is called ex-proprietary, and it accrues only in land continuously cultivated by the ex-proprietor for twelve years before the date of the transfer, or in sir, or homestead land. In Oudh sir means\nland which had been recognized as sir, or had been cultivated continuously by a proprietor or under-proprietor, for seven years before the passing of the Oudh Rent Act, 1886.\n\nIt had been asserted in the great controversy that there was no danger in Oudh of rack-renting, as the land was not fully cultivated, and tenants were in demand instead of competing for holdings. The population had, however, been underestimated, for while in 1859 it was guessed at between 5 and 8 millions, the Census of 1869 showed it was about 11\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) millions. The extent of the protection afforded by the grant of occupancy rights was overestimated. Instead of these forming 15 to 20 per cent. of the cultivating classes, they were found to number less than one-half per cent. By 1873 the number of notices of ejectment of ordinary tenants had attracted attention, and annual inquiries showed that these notices were being largely used as a means to enhance rents. In 1881 the views expressed by the Famine Commission on the relations between landlord and tenant in Northern India led to further inquiry; and the estate of one talukdar was sequestrated on the ground that he had enhanced rents excessively and discouraged cultivation, and thus committed a breach of the conditions of his sanad, which directed him to promote the agricultural prosperity of his estate. The order was cancelled by the Government of India; but at the same time more information was called for on the state of Oudh, and a careful inquiry was made in 1882-3. This showed that there had been a considerable enhancement of rent during the thirteen or fourteen years which had elapsed since settlement. In the villages selected the average incidence of rent had increased by nearly 25 per cent., the increase varying from 14 per cent. in Gond\u0101 to over 49 per cent. in Part\u0101bgarh. There was a general feeling that the tenants should be placed in a more secure position, and that enhancement should bar a further increase for a certain time. The remedies to be applied were the subject of much discussion, which resulted in the Oudh Rent Act of 1886. Under this law all tenants without a right of occupancy obtained the statutory right to retain the holdings occupied by them when the Act was passed, at the rent then payable, for a period of seven years from first occupation or from the last change in the rent or area of the holding. After each period of seven years rent may be enhanced within a limit of 6\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) per cent. On the death of a tenant his heir may complete the period of seven years then current, after which the landlord may make a fresh contract for rent without the 6\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) per cent. limit; but this in turn becomes subject to the septennial revision described above. A statutory tenant may be ejected at the close of a seven years' period; but unless the tenant is ejected because he has refused to pay a legal enhancement, a penal court fee of half the annual rent not exceeding Rs. 25 is levied, and in\nany case the new rent may not exceed the old by more than $6\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent. This Act has worked well, though it has not entirely prevented enhancements beyond the legal limit. In many cases such enhancements have been borne without complaint where rents were inadequate; but the tenantry have shown themselves ready to come forward freely where real injustice is done, and they are certainly better protected than they were before.\n\nThe judicial system in Oudh is separate from that of Agra. Up to 1879 the ordinary non-regulation system prevailed, according to which the same officials exercised civil, revenue, and criminal powers. In that year it was modified, and under the Oudh Civil Courts Act of 1879 Subordinate Judges and Munsifs were appointed for civil work. The Commissioners of Divisions continued to be Divisional, Civil, and Sessions Judges till April, 1891, when District Judges were appointed and two Commissionerships were abolished. The highest court of appeal is that of the Judicial Commissioner, who was in 1905 assisted by one permanent and one temporary Additional Judicial Commissioner. District Magistrates, as in most non-regulation Provinces, can pass sentences of imprisonment up to a limit of seven years. The principal statistics of civil litigation are given below. Civil suits proper are more numerous proportionately to the population than in Agra, but tend to decrease, while rent suits are fewer, but are increasing.\n\n|                                | Average for ten years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------|------|\n| Suits for money and movable property | 48,433                           | 48,389                           | 38,641 | 39,144 |\n| Title and other suits            | 7,956                            | 7,307                            | 8,568 | 7,697 |\n| Rent suits                       | 31,966                           | 34,889                           | 37,363 | 49,658 |\n| Total                           | 87,455                           | 90,585                           | 84,572 | 96,499 |\n\n[Sleeman, *Journey through Oude* (1858); Hoey, *Memoirs of Delhi and Fyzabad* (1885 and 1889); Irwin, *The Garden of India* (1880); McLeod Innes, *Lucknow and Oudh in the Mutiny* (1902); Gubbins, *Mutinies in Oudh* (1858); Blue Books of 1856, 1857, 1858, 1859, 1861, and 1865; Papers relating to Under-proprietary Rights and Rights of Cultivators in Oudh (Calcutta, 1867); Conditions of Tenantry and Working of Rent Law in Oudh (Allahabad, 1883).]\n\n**Owsa Taluk (Aus)**.\u2014Eastern taluk of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 478 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 71,365, compared with 88,484 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The taluk has two towns, Owsa (population, 6,026), the head-quarters, and L\u0101t\u016br.\n(10,479), a great commercial centre, besides 130 villages, of which 26 are j\u0101g\u012br. The M\u0101nja river separates it on the north from Bh\u012br and on the east from Bidar District. Near the village of Gharosa, 11 miles east of Owsa, is a small range of hills. The land revenue in 1901 was 1\u00b77 lakhs.\n\n**Owsa Town (Aus\u0101).**\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 18\u00b0 15' N. and 77\u00b0 30' E. Population (1901), 6,026. Malik Ambar, the Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h\u012b minister, captured the fort here and named it Ambarpur, which was corrupted into Amr\u0101pur. The fort is square in shape, surrounded by a double wall and a moat all round, and is said to have been built by the Bij\u0101pur kings. It contains a large gun, 18 feet long, with the name of Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h engraved on it. Most of the old buildings are in ruins, but an extensive underground building measures 76 by 50 feet, the roof of which forms the bottom of a large cistern. An old mosque was built during Aurangzeb\u2019s viceroyalty of the Deccan, as appears from an inscription it bears. The town is a flourishing centre of the grain trade, the exports being sent to Shol\u0101pur and B\u0101rsi.\n\n**Oxus** (or Amou Dary\u0101).\u2014A famous river of Central Asia, the historic frontier between Ir\u0101n and Tur\u0101n, which may be defined as the drainage channel of the huge mountain system which, roughly speaking, is bounded on the north by Russian territory, on the south by the Hindu Kush and the Koh-i-B\u0101ba, and on the east by the P\u0101mir. A thousand streams and rivers contribute their snow-fed waters to form the great river, which rolls sluggishly along between ancient Bactria and modern Bokh\u0101ra till it empties itself into the Aral Sea. The source of the Oxus has been much disputed. In his book *The P\u0101mir and the Source of the Oxus*, Lord Curzon states that the true source is to be found in the great glacier at the head of the P\u0101mir-i-W\u0101kh\u0101n. There the river, known as the Ab-i-W\u0101kh\u0101n, issues from two ice caverns in a rushing stream. About 25 miles below it is joined by the stream generally called the Sarhad or Little P\u0101mir river, which rises in the low plateau that lies at the south-western end of Lake Chakmak, on the Little P\u0101mir. The next important affluent flows in, also on the right bank, from the Great P\u0101mir, where it rises in Lake Victoria. This is the river which was assumed by Wood to be the true parent stream of the Oxus. It is commonly marked on maps as the P\u0101mir river, although the title Panja or Ab-i-Panja, which the main stream commonly bears below Kila Panja, is by some applied to this upper branch. About 160 miles below the confluence at Kila Panja, after the river has made a great bend to the north at Ishkashim, it receives from the east, at Kila W\u0101mar, the river which is known in its upper reaches as the Murgh\u0101b, and higher again as the Aksu. This stream originally emerges from the eastern end of Lake Chakmak on\nthe Little P\u0101mir, and throws a great loop round the Middle P\u0101mirs on the north, as the Panja encircles them on the south. Some authorities hold that the Aksu or Murgh\u0101b should be regarded as the main river, on the ground that the Greek name Oxus is a corruption of the Turki Aksu, that the entire length of the Aksu-Murgh\u0101b is greater than that of the Panja, and that it receives a larger number of tributaries in its course.\n\nFrom Kila Panja to K\u0101mi\u0101b, a distance of 600 miles, the Oxus forms the boundary between Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and Bokh\u0101ra. From its southern watershed, draining from south to north, the river, below the confluence of the Panja and Aksu-Murgh\u0101b, receives, on the extreme east, the Kokcha, which, rising in the Hindu Kush south of Jirm, defines the position of a route connecting Chitr\u0101l with Faiz\u0101b\u0101d; and the Surkh\u0101b or Kund\u016bz, which by means of two branches\u2014the Andar\u0101b from the east and the Surkh\u0101b proper from the west\u2014connects the Kh\u0101wak pass and B\u0101mi\u0101n with the Oxus, north-west of Kh\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d. Proceeding west, we next come to a series of rivers which belong to the Oxus basin, but are either expended in cultivation or lost in the plains. These are the Tashkurg\u0101n, which flows to the town of that name and is, like the Surkh\u0101b, important in connexion with great trade routes; the Band-i-Am\u012br, which drains the northern slopes of the Koh-i-B\u0101ba; and the S\u0101r-i-Pul and the Kais\u0101r or Maimana, which have their sources in the Band-i-Turkist\u0101n.\n\nThe Oxus is navigable by boats of light draught throughout a great portion of its length; and a flotilla of Russian steamers plies regularly during the summer between Urganj in Khiva and the Faiz\u0101b\u0101d Kila in Bokh\u0101ra, a distance of nearly 750 miles.\n\n**Oyster Rocks** (or Devgad).\u2014A cluster of islands about a mile in length east to west, in North Kanara District, Bombay, 2 miles west of K\u0101rw\u0101r. The north-west island, the highest, is 138 feet above the sea, and at a distance of a cable's length from the shore there is a depth of seven fathoms. On the top of this island, in 14\u00b0 49' N. and 74\u00b0 4' E., a lighthouse has been built. It is a round tower of white granite, 72 feet high and 210 feet above mean sea-level. The light is a fixed white dioptric of order 1, which in clear weather can be seen for 20 miles.\n\n**Pa-an Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Thaton District, Lower Burma, consisting of the PA-AN and HLAINGEBWE townships.\n\n**Pa-an Township.**\u2014Township in Thaton District, Lower Burma, lying between 16\u00b0 33' and 17\u00b0 26' N. and 97\u00b0 27' and 98\u00b0 0' E., with an area of 730 square miles. It is a narrow strip of country, running northwards from immediately above Moulmein to the borders of Salween District. The Salween river crosses it diagonally in the centre, and in the north and south forms respectively its eastern and\nwestern border. The population was 76,481 in 1891, and 76,591 in 1901. The people, who are mainly Karens, reside in 277 villages. The head-quarters are at Pa-an, a village of 2,851 inhabitants, on the left bank of the Salween. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 188 square miles, paying Rs. 1,64,000 land revenue.\n\n**Pab.**\u2014A range of mountains in Baluchist\u0101n, occupying the south-eastern corner of the Jhalaw\u0101n country and the Las Bela State, between 24\u00b0 53' and 27\u00b0 36' N. and 65\u00b0 50' and 67\u00b0 11' E. Its general direction is north and south from the centre of the Jhalaw\u0101n country to the sea; on the east it is bounded by the valley of the Hab river, and on the west by the Hingol and its tributary the Arra. Locally, the name Pab is applied only to the backbone of the range; but the generic term may appropriately be extended to the whole mass, which is in the form of a cow's udder, the Khude or Khudo, Mor, and H\u0101l\u0101 hills, together with the backbone already mentioned, forming the teats. Within these ranges, reckoning from east to west, lie the valleys of S\u0101r\u016bna and Kanr\u0101ch and the Las Bela plain. The drainage is carried off by the Por\u0101li, Hab, and Hingol rivers. The greatest length of the range is 190 miles and the breadth about 70 miles. The highest point, Phar\u0101s, is 7,759 feet above sea-level. The numerous limestone ridges generally rise precipitously on their eastern sides, but possess a more gradual slope to the west. The inhabitants are chiefly Mengal Br\u0101huis, with some J\u0101mots and Bh\u0101kras in the south. Besides flock-owning, their principal means of subsistence is the export of pish (Nannorhops Ritchiana) to Sind. Olive grows in the higher parts and acacia in the lower. Rich grazing grounds for camels, sheep, and goats occur. Copper is reported to be obtainable in the Mor hills. The principal passes are the L\u0101r Lak, Ch\u016bri pass, B\u0101r\u0101n Lak, and Jau Lak. Towards the southern extremity of the range, in Las Bela, is the shrine of Sh\u0101h Bil\u0101wal.\n\n**P\u0101bna District.**\u2014District in the south-east corner of the R\u0101jsh\u0101hi Division, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 23\u00b0 49' and 24\u00b0 45' N. and 89\u00b0 1' and 89\u00b0 53' E., with an area of 1,839 square miles. It lies within the angle formed by the confluence of the Ganges or Padm\u0101 and the Brahmaputra or Jamun\u0101, which constitute its southern and eastern boundaries, the latter separating it from Mymensingh and Dacca and the former from Nadi\u0101 and Far\u012bdpur; on the west and north-west it is bounded by R\u0101jsh\u0101hi, and on the north by Bogra.\n\nThe general aspect is low and flat. The head-quarters subdivision which forms the south-western half of the District is, like the adjoining portion of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi, an area of silted-up river beds, obstructed drainage, and marshy swamps. The Sir\u0101jganj subdivision, on the other hand, more closely resembles the neighbouring portion of Bogra, in that the\ndrainage is not so much impeded by the high banks of deserted river-beds.\n\nThe river system is constituted by the Padm\u0101 and the Brahmaputra, together with their interlacing offshoots and tributaries. The chief offshoot of the Padm\u0101 is the Ich\u0101mat\u012b (1), which flows past the town of P\u0101bna. The Hur\u0101s\u0101gar, which represents the partially dried-up channel of an old river, is now the principal offshoot of the Jamun\u0101. In its course it meets the Phuljhur, and after joining the Baral and Ich\u0101mat\u012b, ultimately reunites with the Jamun\u0101. The whole District is intersected by a network of minor watercourses, which render every part of it accessible by water during the rainy season, and is seamed by deserted beds of large rivers which are generally dry except in the rains. Alluvion and diluvion are constantly taking place, the river channels perpetually swinging from side to side of their sandy beds.\n\nDeep swamps abound; but the only sheets of water which can be called lakes are the Chalan B\u012bl, which covers large portions of the Raiganj and Ch\u0101tmohar th\u0101nas, and the Bara, Son\u0101p\u0101t\u012bla, G\u0101jna or Gandhahasti, and Ghugudah bi\u015bs, which are respectively 12, 6, 12, and 4 square miles in area.\n\nThe District is covered by recent alluvium, consisting of sandy clay and sand along the course of the rivers, and fine silt consolidating into clay in the flatter parts of the river plain.\n\nWhere the ground is not occupied by the usual crops of North Bengal, it is covered with an abundant natural vegetation. Deserted river-beds, ponds, and marshes, and streams with a sluggish current have a copious vegetation of Vallisneria and similar plants. Land subject to inundation has usually a covering of Tamarix and reedy grasses; and in some parts, where the ground is more or less marshy, Rosa involucrata is plentiful. Few trees occur on these inundated lands; the most plentiful and largest is Barringtonia acutangula. There are no forests; trees are few in number and often stunted in growth, and the waste land is, for the most part, covered with grasses such as Imperata arundinacea and Andropogon aciculatus. Among the trees, the most conspicuous are the red cotton-tree (Bombax malabari-cum) and the jack-tree (Artocarpus integrifolia). The villages are often embedded in thickets or shrubberies of semi-spontaneous and more or less useful trees.\n\nLeopards and wild hog are common; the latter are numerous and of large size, and \u2018pig-sticking\u2019 has long been a favourite sport of European residents and visitors.\n\nThe climate is very equable. The mean temperature increases from 64\u00b0 in January to 83\u00b0 in April; it then remains almost constant till September, and falls to 72\u00b0 in November and to 65\u00b0 in December. The highest average maximum is 94\u00b0 in April, the lowest average\nminimum $51^\\circ$ in January, and the average mean for the year $77^\\circ$. Rainfall is seldom excessive; the annual fall averages 61 inches, of which nearly 8 inches fall in May, 11 inches in each of the months of June, July, and August, and 9 inches in September.\n\nHeavy floods occurred in the head-quarters subdivision in the years 1888, 1889, and 1890, when the roads in P\u0101bna town were seriously damaged. Cyclones are not uncommon; in September, 1872, a violent storm swept over the District, which levelled native houses and fruit trees in all directions, sunk more than 100 country boats at Sirajganj, and wrecked several large steamers and flats. The earthquake of 1885 did considerable damage to masonry buildings, but the shock of 1897 was still more severely felt. At Sirajganj the upper storey of the subdivisional office, the jail, and the post office were wrecked, and almost every other masonry building was more or less severely shaken, while in P\u0101bna town brick buildings were much damaged. Fissures opened, and sand was thrown up in various places, while many wells were choked.\n\nCunningham believes that the name of P\u0101bna is derived from the old kingdom of Pundra or Paundravardhana, the country of the Pods, whose capital was at Mah\u0101sth\u0101n in the adjoining District of Bogra. The recent history of the District is practically the same as that of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi, from which it was separated in 1832, when the need for a more efficient administration was beginning to demand recognition. In that year a Joint-Magistrate was stationed at P\u0101bna town; but he remained partly subordinate to the Collector of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi, and many of the landowners long retained the privilege, as it was deemed, of paying their revenue into the R\u0101jsh\u0101hi treasury. It was not until 1859 that the covenanted official in charge of P\u0101bna received the full title of Magistrate-Collector. In 1845 the subdivision of Sirajganj was formed, and it has since developed into by far the most important portion of the District. Frequent changes have taken place in the limits of P\u0101bna. In 1862 the large subdivision of Kushtia, south of the Padma, was transferred to Nadi\u0101, and in 1871 the river was constituted the southern boundary of the District.\n\nP\u0101bna is notorious for the agrarian riots of 1873; and though these disturbances were rapidly suppressed, and never assumed a serious character, they are important because they led to the exhaustive discussion of tenant-right which culminated in \u2018the ryots\u2019 Charter,\u2019 the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885. The quarrel arose owing to the purchase by absentee zamind\u0101rs of lands which had formerly belonged to the Nator Raj\u0101. From the first the relations between the new-comers and their ryots were unfriendly; the zamind\u0101rs attempted to enhance the rents and also to consolidate customary cesses with the rent, and\ndisputes arose over the proper length of the local measuring-pole. In 1873 the tenantry banded themselves together into leagues pledged to resist oppression, which gradually assumed the form of a 'no rent' agitation. The combination spread throughout the District and beyond its limits, and led to serious breaches of the peace. Prompt action was, however, taken, and the disturbances were suppressed in a fortnight with the help of armed police.\n\nThe population of the present area increased from 1,210,470 in 1872 to 1,310,604 in 1881, to 1,361,223 in 1891, and to 1,420,461 in 1901. The Sirajganj subdivision is healthy; but the drainage is obstructed in the south-west of the District, which was devastated by fever epidemics a quarter of a century ago and is still notoriously unhealthy, the vital statistics uniformly showing an excess of deaths over births. Deaf-mutism is prevalent in the Sirajganj subdivision. The chief statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Pabna       | 882                 | 1              | 1,658    | 586,749    | 665                       | -2.1                                            | 30,356                                 |\n| Sirajganj   | 957                 | 1              | 2,062    | 833,712    | 871                       | +9.4                                            | 37,118                                 |\n| District total | 1,839             | 2              | 3,720    | 1,420,461  | 772                       | +4.8                                            | 67,474                                 |\n\nThe two towns are Pabna, the head-quarters, and Sirajganj. The density of population is greater than in any other District of North Bengal. The south-west of the District is unhealthy and decadent, except in the Pabna thana, where the growing importance of S\u0101ra, the terminus of the northern section of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, has led to a rapid growth of the population. In Sirajganj the greatest development took place in Raiganj (11.6 per cent.), where immigrants from Chota Nagpur, locally called Bun\u0101s, are busy clearing the jungle. The jute trade at Sirajganj attracts a large number of up-country labourers, especially from the United Provinces. The vernacular of the District is the dialect known as Northern Bengali. Muhammadans number 1,062,914, or almost exactly three-fourths of the population; Hindus with 357,065 account for practically all the remainder.\n\nThe Musalmans are returned chiefly as Shaikhs (928,000), Jol\u0101h\u0101s (84,000), and Kulus (25,000), who are probably all the descendants of local converts from the lower Hindu castes. Among the Hindus Namas\u016bdras or Chand\u0101ls, with a strength of 49,000, constitute the\nmost numerous caste; and next come M\u0101los (32,000), K\u0101yasths (30,000), and Sunris (28,000). Of the whole population 68\u00b71 per cent. are supported by agriculture, 16\u00b78 per cent. by industry, 1\u00b72 per cent. by commerce, and 1\u00b77 per cent. by the professions.\n\nTwo Christian missions are at work, the South Australian Baptist Mission at P\u0101bna and the Tasmanian Baptist Mission at Sirajganj; but neither has made much progress in proselytism. The number of native Christians is only 40.\n\nThe soil is enriched by annual deposits of silt from the Padm\u0101 and Jamun\u0101 rivers, and is consequently extremely fertile. No less than two-thirds of the net cropped area is estimated to yield two crops annually, and many lands yield three crops in the year.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste |\n|-------------|-------|------------|-----------------|\n| P\u0101bna       | 882   | 577        | 56              |\n| Sirajganj   | 957   | 654        | 61              |\n| **Total**   | **1,839** | **1,231** | **117**         |\n\nRice, which is cultivated over an area of 1,081 square miles, constitutes the staple crop throughout the District. Of the total food-supply, the winter rice forms about three-fifths and the early rice a seventh, while most of the remainder is furnished by cold-season second crops, such as pulses, which are grown on 226 square miles. Early and winter rice are sown in April and May, the former being usually grown on high lands and the winter and spring crops on low lands, but the early and winter crops are sometimes grown on the same class of land and even together. The early rice is reaped in August and September, while the winter rice is not garnered till November, December, or January. Of recent years jute has risen into the second place in the District agriculture, and now covers 219 square miles. Rape, mustard, and other oilseeds are extensively cultivated, and some sugar-cane, wheat, barley, and other miscellaneous food-crops are also grown. The cultivators are prosperous, and as a rule there is little need for advances under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts; but Rs. 21,000 was advanced under the former and Rs. 2,500 under the latter Act in 1897\u20138, when there was a partial crop failure.\n\nThe local cattle are small and poor, and there is a great dearth of good pasture. Two up-country bulls have been introduced by Government for breeding purposes.\nSince the closing of the jute-mills at Sirajganj, the manufacture of gunny cloths and bags has ceased; but in spite of the extensive importation of cheap European piece-goods, several kinds of cotton cloth are still woven by hand, and as recently as 1890 the out-turn of the fine cotton and silk fabrics from Chotadhul and Dogachi was valued at $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs. These fabrics compare with those of Dacca, Farasdanga, Santipur, and other historic seats of the industry, and well-to-do people prefer them to machine-made cloth because of their finer texture. Fine grass and reed mats made of sitalpata (Phrynum dichotomum) are extensively prepared, and are exported to neighbouring Districts. Pottery and brass and bell-metal articles are also made to a small extent. The country paper industry at Kalita has almost died out, killed by competition with the Bally and other paper-mills. In the village of Chatmohar thirty or forty persons are employed on the manufacture of shell bracelets. Sirajganj is the chief seat of the jute-baling industry in North Bengal, and 14 presses are employed there; there are also 5 presses at Berai.\n\nA large amount of trade passes through the District, the agricultural produce of neighbouring Districts being exchanged here for salt, piece-goods, and other European wares. Otherwise the trade is almost entirely with Calcutta. The chief exports are jute, of which 72,000 tons were exported in 1903-4, rice, pulses, and mustard. Quantities of loose jute are brought from Rangpur, Mymensingh, and Bogra to the presses at Sirajganj, where it is pressed into bales for export via Calcutta. The principal imports are European piece-goods, salt, and kerosene oil from Calcutta, rice from Dinajpur and Bogra, and tobacco from Rangpur. The most important trade centres are Pabna Town, Sirajganj, Berai, Ulapara on the Hurasagar, Dhapari on the Padma, and Pangasi on the Ichamati. The chief trading castes are Sahas, Tantis, and Telis, who are among the wealthiest residents in Pabna town; but at Sirajganj the principal native merchants are Marwaris. Seven European firms are engaged in the jute business at Sirajganj and two at Berai. The greater portion of the Calcutta trade is dispatched by country boat or steamer via the Sundarbans; but a considerable quantity of jute is also consigned to Kushtia or Goalundo, whence it is carried by the Eastern Bengal State Railway.\n\nThe only railway which touches the District is the northern branch of the Eastern Bengal State Railway (metre gauge), which runs across its south-western corner for about 5 miles to the terminus at Sara on the north bank of the Padma. Including 246 miles of village roads, the District contains 881.5 miles of roads maintained by the District board, of which only 7$\\frac{1}{2}$ miles are metalled. The many rivers, bilis, marshes, and low lands render it impossible, without very great\nexpense, to construct proper roads, and most of those that exist are little more than tracks. A raised road from P\u0101bna to S\u0101ra can, however, be used throughout the year; and a metalled road, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length, leads from P\u0101bna to B\u0101jitpur on the Padm\u0101. Most of the th\u0101nas are connected with P\u0101bna by raised roads, though there are breaks in places owing to floods.\n\nThese roads are little used as trade routes on account of the excellent water communications. Both the Padm\u0101 and the Brahmaputra are navigable by native boats of the largest size and also by steamers, and the Baral and the Hur\u0101s\u0101gar by boats of 4 tons burden throughout the year; the other minor watercourses are navigable during the rainy season. The Phuljhur, which was formerly navigable throughout its course, has formed shallows at Nalk\u0101 and Ul\u0101p\u0101ra, which make it impassable for heavily laden craft. The Dh\u0101nb\u0101ndi, which passes through Sir\u0101jganj, is connected with the Siml\u0101 kh\u0101l and ultimately with the Jamun\u0101 by the K\u0101ta kh\u0101l, and with the P\u0101ng\u0101si river and the Phuljhur by the Telkupi kh\u0101l; these artificial channels are, however, navigable only during the rains. On the Brahmaputra a daily mixed service of steamers runs between Goalundo and Phulchar\u012b Gh\u0101t, calling for goods and passengers at several stations in the District, and the Goalundo-Assam mail stops at Sir\u0101jganj. The services which ply up the Padm\u0101 call at four stations, N\u0101zirganj, S\u0101tb\u0101ria, B\u0101jitpur (for P\u0101bna town), and S\u0101ra. A ferry steamer aided by a District board subsidy runs between B\u0101jitpur and Kushtia, and there are 63 other ferries of less importance.\n\nP\u0101bna is not liable to famine; but in 1874 and again in 1897 there was some local scarcity, and relief works on a small scale were opened by Government.\n\nFor general administrative purposes the District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at P\u0101bna and Sir\u0101jganj. At head-quarters the staff subordinate to the Magistrate-Collector consists of three Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, one Sub-Deputy-Collector, and two k\u0101nungs. In charge of the Sir\u0101jganj subdivision is a covenanted civilian, assisted by a Deputy-Collector, a Sub-Deputy-Collector, and a k\u0101nungo.\n\nThe civil courts are those of the District and Sessions Judge, who also pays quarterly visits to Bogra, a Sub-Judge, an additional Sub-Judge, and two Munsifs stationed at P\u0101bna, and two Munsifs and an additional Munsif at Sir\u0101jganj. The criminal courts include those of the Sessions Judge, District Magistrate, and the above-mentioned magistrates. Frequent disputes arise in connexion with the possession of the valuable lands which are continually being formed by the changes in the courses of the great rivers, and these often culminate in riots. The District is notorious for both land and river dacoities,\nand a large gang which had been a terror to traders for many years was broken up in 1900.\n\nThe early revenue history is that of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi District. The current land revenue demand in 1903-4 was 4.06 lakhs, payable by 1,915 estates, of which 1,786 with a demand of 3.59 lakhs were permanently settled, 72 paying Rs. 23,000 were temporarily settled, and the remainder were managed direct by Government. The subdivision of real property has been going on rapidly; and there are now no less than 538 permanently settled estates which pay less than Rs. 10 as land revenue, and 754 which pay between Rs. 10 and Rs. 100. The incidence of land revenue is very light, being only R. 0-7-4 on each cultivated acre; and, although rents likewise rule low owing to the success with which the ryots have resisted enhancements, the land revenue is only 19 per cent. of the estimated rental payable to the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs. Rice lands pay from Rs. 2-4 to Rs. 4-3 an acre in the west of the District, and from Rs. 3 to Rs. 6 in Sirajganj. Jute lands are rented at from Rs. 6 to Rs. 9.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 3,190  | 3,91   | 4,00   | 4,06   |\n| Total revenue  | 7,33   | 8,55   | 10,04  | 10,49  |\n\nOutside the municipalities of P\u0101bna and Sirajganj, local affairs are managed by the District board, with subdivisional local boards. In 1903-4 the income of the District board was Rs. 1,25,000, of which Rs. 57,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,28,000, including Rs. 56,000 spent on public works and Rs. 40,000 on education.\n\nThe District contains 8 th\u012bnas or police circles and 8 outposts. In 1903 the police force subordinate to the District Superintendent consisted of 2 inspectors, 27 sub-inspectors, 27 head constables, and 349 constables; and the village watch consisted of 2,332 chaukid\u0101rs, grouped in unions under 209 daffad\u012brs. The District jail at P\u0101bna has accommodation for 257 prisoners, and a lock-up at Sirajganj for 34.\n\nOnly 4.8 per cent. of the population (9 males and 0.4 females) could read and write in 1901. The total number of pupils under instruction decreased from about 23,500 in 1883-4 to 19,882 in 1892-3, but rose again to 24,513 in 1900-1, while 26,184 boys and 1,398 girls were at school in 1903-4, being respectively 24.6 and 1.3 per cent. of those of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 660, including an Arts college, 64 secondary schools, and 571 primary schools. The expenditure on\neducation was 1.75 lakhs, of which Rs. 14,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 32,000 from District funds, Rs. 1,800 from municipal funds, and Rs. 1,04,000 from fees. The chief educational institutions, including a technical school, are at P\u0101bna town.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 12 dispensaries, of which 3 had accommodation for 50 in-patients. At these the cases of 65,000 out-patients and 742 in-patients were treated during the year, and 2,192 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 20,000, of which Rs. 5,000 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 4,000 from Local and Rs. 3,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 7,000 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the municipalities of P\u0101bna and Sirajganj. During 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 46,000, or 33 per 1,000 of the population. There has not been much progress in recent years, but cases of small-pox are rare.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. ix (1876).]\n\nP\u0101bna Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of P\u0101bna District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 23\u00b0 49' and 24\u00b0 21' N. and 89\u00b0 1' and 89\u00b0 45' E., with an area of 882 square miles. The population in 1901 was 586,749, compared with 599,319 in 1891. The subdivision is a tract of silted-up river-beds, obstructed drainage, and marshy swamps, and the decline of the population is due to the consequent unhealthiness of the climate. It contains one town, P\u0101bna (population, 18,424), the head-quarters; and 1,658 villages. The density of population, 665 persons per square mile, is considerably less than in the adjoining subdivision of Sirajganj, where more favourable conditions prevail. The chief centres of trade are P\u0101bna town and S\u0101ra.\n\nP\u0101bna Town.\u2014Head-quarters of P\u0101bna District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 24\u00b0 1' N. and 89\u00b0 16' E., on the Ich\u0101mat\u012b. Population (1901), 18,424. P\u0101bna was constituted a municipality in 1876. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 22,000 and Rs. 19,500 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 31,000, of which Rs. 8,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), and Rs. 7,000 from conservancy rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 30,000. The town was formerly liable to floods, but is now protected by an embankment, a mile in length, along the bank of the Ich\u0101mat\u012b. It contains the usual public buildings; a second-class jail has accommodation for 257 prisoners, the principal jail industries being oil-pressing, brick-making, surki-pounding, and carpet- and cloth-weaving. The chief educational institutions are the high school managed by Government; the technical school at which engineering, surveying, drawing, and practical carpentry are taught; and the P\u0101bna Institution with the status of a second-grade college.\n\nPachaimalais ('Green hills').\u2014A hill-range on the borders of\nTrichinopoly and Salem Districts, Madras, lying between $11^\\circ 9'$ and $11^\\circ 29'$ N. and $78^\\circ 31'$ and $78^\\circ 51'$ E., due north of Trichinopoly city. Their total area is 177 square miles, of which 105 are in the Musiri and Perambalur taluks of Trichinopoly and the rest in the Atur taluk of Salem. They attain a height of 2,500 feet above the level of the sea, and their greatest length from north to south is about 20 miles. In shape the range has a slight resemblance to an hour-glass, being nearly cut in two by ravines of great size and depth opening to the north-east and south-west. Of the two parts into which it is thus divided, the north-eastern is the larger and has a generally higher level than the south-eastern. A striking characteristic of the range is the great steepness of the western slopes as compared with those on the east, which latter are rarely precipitous and are broken by several long spurs which project far into the low country. The climate of the Pachaimalais is notoriously malarious.\n\nThe 'reserved' forests on the hills cover an area of 80 square miles, and consist largely of usilai (Albizia amara), vengai (Pterocarpus Marsupium), teak, black-wood (Dalbergia latifolia), sandal-wood, and bamboos. The minor products of the hills are myrabolams (Terminalia Chebula); vembadampattai (Ventilago madraspatana), a bark from which a red dye is extracted; the fruit of the hill gooseberry (Rhodomyrtus tomentosa), and honey. The only large game on the range are a few leopards and bears.\n\nThe inhabited portion is entirely in the Musiri taluk. This comprises 3 villages\u2014Vannadu, Tambaranadu, and Kombai\u2014containing in the aggregate 68 hamlets and 6,529 inhabitants. The people call themselves Kanchi Vellalas, and say they migrated to these hills from Conjeeveram (compare the account of the Malaiyalis on the Shevaroy Hills) at the time of a severe famine. The crops they cultivate do not differ materially from those grown on the plains. There is no 'wet' cultivation, but an unirrigated variety of rice is raised. The jack-tree (Artocarpus integrifolia) is also extensively grown.\n\nThe cultivated land is divided into two classes: ulavakudu, land capable of being ploughed; and punalkudu, or land which cannot be ploughed and the cultivation of which is carried on by grain being dibbled in among trees and rocks wherever a few feet of soil is to be found. These two kinds of land are assessed at 8 annas and 4 annas respectively per acre. The cadastral survey of the hills is in progress. A forest road runs from the Turaiyur-Atur road to the foot of the hills, and thence a bridle-path leads to a forest resthouse on the plateau, the total length of both being 8 miles.\n\nPachamb\u0101.\u2014Village in the Giridih subdivision of Hazaribagh District, Bengal, situated in $24^\\circ 13'$ N. and $86^\\circ 16'$ E., 3\u00bd miles from Giridih railway station. Population (1901), 3,510. Pachamb\u0101 is the\nhead-quarters of the Free Church of Scotland Mission to the Sant\u0101ls, and contains a dispensary and schools. An annual fair is held here in the month of K\u0101rtik.\n\nPachbhadra.\u2014Head-quarters of a district of the same name in the State of Jodhpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25^\\circ 55' N.$ and $72^\\circ 15' E.$, about 5 miles east of the Pachbhadra station on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway. Population (1901), 3,194. The town has a post office and a vernacular school. The fresh-water supply fails nearly every summer, and water has to be imported by railway. The place is also one of the hottest in India, the thermometer sometimes rising to $122^\\circ$ in the shade. Five miles west of the town is the well-known salt source, which was leased by the Jodhpur Darb\u0101r to the British Government in 1878 for an annual sum of 1.7 lakhs. The Government hospital here supplies medical aid to the people of the town. The salt lake has an area of about 10 square miles and, unlike that at S\u0101mbhar, is not dependent on the rainfall for the production of salt, as the brine springs are perennial. The yearly out-turn is about 35,000 tons. The method of manufacture is peculiar to the locality. Pits of an average length of 230 feet with their banks sloped to an angle of $45^\\circ$ are dug in the bed to a depth of about 11 feet until the subterranean springs of brine have been tapped, and these become filled to a depth of about 3 feet with a strong brine. Crystallization is promoted by throwing branches of the thorny mor\u0101li (Lycium europaeum) into the pits as soon as the formation of an overset of salt indicates that precipitation has commenced. During the great heat of April, May, and June, the evaporation of the brine is very rapid; and as this proceeds and salt is precipitated, more brine flows in until the pit is filled with salt to a depth of about 3 feet, which takes place in two years. The salt is then ready for removal, and, having been cut out in sections, the crystals are shaken off the thorny branches and stored in oblong heaps on the bank. The out-turn from a pit averages about 370 tons every second year, and crop after crop is thus obtained. Almost all the salt manufactured here is removed by the Jodhpur-Bik\u0101ner Railway, which has a branch line running from B\u0101lotra to the works.\n\n[F. Ashton, \u2018The Salt Industry of R\u0101jput\u0101na\u2019 in The Journal of Indian Art and Industry, vol. ix, January, 1901.]\n\nP\u0101chet.\u2014Hill in M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, Bengal. See P\u0101nchet.\n\nPachheg\u0101m.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nPachmarh\u012b.\u2014Sanitarium in the Soh\u0101gpur tahsil of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District, Central Provinces, situated in $22^\\circ 28' N.$ and $78^\\circ 26' E.$, on a plateau of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range, 32 miles from Pipari\u0101 station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Pachmarh\u012b is connected with Pipari\u0101 by a metalled road, along which there is a mail tonga-service. The plateau of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills on which the town stands, at an elevation\nof just over 3,500 feet, has an area of 23 square miles, the greater part of which is covered with forest. The census population in March, 1901, was 3,020 persons; but at this time of year Pachmarhi is comparatively empty, and it is probable that during the season the number of residents is doubled. The plateau, which is Government property, was acquired in 1869 and 1871, and soon afterwards the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces began to reside here during the summer months. Its advantages as a sanitarium were first discovered by Captain Forsyth, the author of *The Highlands of Central India*, in 1857; and the name of the shooting box which he built for himself on the plateau, and called Bison Lodge, is still preserved by a house erected subsequently on the same site. The name is a corruption of *panch mathi*, or 'five huts,' and properly belongs to a small hill in the open part of the plateau in which five caves have been constructed. There is some reason for supposing that these are Buddhist, but Br\u0101hmanical tradition has annexed them as one of the places at which the five P\u0101ndava brothers sojourned during their wanderings. The prevailing rock is a coarse gritty sandstone of great depth, which succumbs readily to denudation; and the steep ravines and gorges that have been formed by the action of water produce some strikingly picturesque pieces of scenery. Of the 23 square miles of which the plateau is composed, 19 are classed as forest. This area is managed principally with a view to the preservation and enhancement of the natural beauties of scenery. The forest growth is generally thin and interspersed with numerous grass glades of park-like appearance. *S\u0101l* (*Shorea robusta*) is the principal timber tree, and there is also a quantity of *harr\u0101* (*Terminalia Chebula*) and *jamun* (*Eugenia Jambolana*). Several peaks fringe the plateau, of which the principal are Dh\u016bgarh (4,454 feet), Mah\u0101deo (4,384 feet), and Chaur\u0101garh (4,317 feet). Owing to its moderate elevation, Pachmarhi affords only a partial relief from the heat of the plains. The mean temperature in May, the hottest month, is 85\u00b0, and the maximum occasionally rises to over 100\u00b0. Still, except for a short period during the middle of the day, the heat is never oppressive. During the second half of September and October, after the cessation of the rains, the climate is delightfully cool and bracing, the mean temperature in the latter month being 69\u00b0. The rainfall is heavy, averaging 77 inches annually, nearly the whole of which is received between June and September.\n\nPachmarhi was constituted a municipality in 1886. The municipal receipts and expenditure during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 3,700 and Rs. 3,500 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 28,000, including a Government grant of Rs. 22,000. There is also a cantonment, which includes five square miles on the eastern or Pipari\u0101 side of the plateau. The receipts and expenditure of the\ncantonment fund during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 4,200, and in 1903-4 were Rs. 14,000 and Rs. 12,000 respectively, the former figure including a grant of Rs. 6,000 from the Military Department. No regular garrison is located at Pachmarhi, but a convalescent d\u00e9p\u00f4t is maintained for eight months in the year for the British regiment stationed at Jubbulpore. Pachmarhi is also the site for a school of musketry; and three classes for the instruction of officers, each lasting for two months, are held annually.\n\n**Pachora Taluka.**\u2014Taluka of East Kh\u00e2ndesh District, Bombay, including the petty subdivision or peth\u0101 of Bhadgaon, lying between 20\u00b0 28' and 20\u00b0 50' N. and 74\u00b0 57' and 75\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 542 square miles. It contains three towns, Pachora (population, 6,473), the head-quarters, Nagar Devla (6,050), and Bhadgaon (7,956); and 186 villages. The population in 1901 was 125,336, compared with 115,270 in 1891. The increase was due to immigration from Ahmadnagar and other famine-stricken regions. The density, 231 persons per square mile, is much above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 3\u00b79 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 26,000. Pachora consists of a fairly wooded valley, lying between the S\u0101tm\u0101l\u0101 range to the south and low ranges of hills in the north. The climate is healthy. The only perennial stream is the Girn\u0101. Irrigation is carried on by means of the Jamda Canal. The annual rainfall averages 30 inches.\n\n**Pachora Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in East Kh\u00e2ndesh District, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 40' N. and 75\u00b0 22' E., 35 miles south-east of Dh\u016blia, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 6,473. There is a flourishing trade in cotton; and the town contains 5 ginning factories, 4 cotton-presses, a dispensary, and 3 schools with 257 pupils, of which one, with 38 pupils, is a girls\u2019 school. The American Alliance Mission has a branch here.\n\n**Padaung.**\u2014Township in the Shwedaung subdivision of Prome District, Lower Burma, lying to the west of the Irrawaddy, separating it from the Arakan Yoma, between 18\u00b0 21' and 18\u00b0 57' N. and 94\u00b0 41' and 95\u00b0 13' E., with an area of 1,019 square miles. The population was 52,073 in 1891, and 51,712 in 1901, including about 6,000 Chins, practically all of whom reside in villages on the slopes of the Arakan Yoma. There are 216 villages, the head-quarters being at Padaung (population, 2,260), on the right or west bank of the Irrawaddy. A good deal of cutch is manufactured, but only a small proportion of the land is under cultivation, owing to its hilly nature. In 1903-4 the area cultivated was 75 square miles, paying Rs. 64,000 land revenue.\n\n**Padavedu.**\u2014Village in the Polur taluk of North Arcot District,\nMadras, situated in $12^\\circ 40'$ N. and $79^\\circ 7'$ E. Population (1901), 2,382. This deserted place is one of the most interesting in the District. Though it now contains few inhabitants, tradition says that it was the capital of a powerful dynasty which for many hundreds of years held sway in this part of the country. Perhaps it was a chief city of the Kurumbas, who are declared to have been of old a powerful clan. It was 16 miles in circumference, and full of the remains of temples, resthouses, and fine private residences. Its extent may be judged by the fact that the present villages of Sandav\u0101sal, where the fair or sandai of the old town was held, and Pushpagiri, the site of its flower market, are 4 miles apart. The place is traditionally declared to have been entombed by a shower of dust and stones which overwhelmed the whole of its magnificent buildings. Jungle now covers almost the whole area. Two extensive but ruined forts stand upon the plain, and another upon a peak of the Jav\u0101di Hills which overlooks the village. The two principal temples in Padavedu are dedicated, one to a goddess called Renuk\u0101mb\u0101l, and the other to R\u0101masw\u0101mi. The former is the more celebrated, and is still visited by large crowds on Fridays in the month of Adi.\n\nPadh\u0101na.\u2014Village in the District and tahsil of Lahore, Punjab, situated in $31^\\circ 28'$ N. and $74^\\circ 40'$ E. Population (1901), 6,210. It is administered as a 'notified area.'\n\nP\u0101din\u0101lk\u1e47\u0101d.\u2014Western taluk of Coorg, Southern India, lying between $12^\\circ 6'$ and $12^\\circ 31'$ N. and $75^\\circ 22'$ and $75^\\circ 48'$ E., with an area of 400 square miles. The population in 1901 was 28,620, compared with 28,219 in 1891. It contains 57 villages. The entire west is skirted by the high range of the Western Gh\u0101ts, including the lofty peak of Tadiandamol (5,729 feet), the highest point in Coorg, and the Per\u016br and Srimangala peaks. The Cauvery has its source in the north-west, and runs across the middle of the taluk in a south-easterly direction. The north is bounded in some parts by the Nujikal river. There is little arable land, but plenty of hilly grass and forest land, with the largest and most productive cardamom jungles. Rice cultivation is so deficient that even the largest farms are not able to produce sufficient for their own consumption. The ryots in general have to buy rice for six months in the year, and their chief reliance has been on the produce of their cardamom and coffee gardens. Tavun\u0101d in the north-west contains some of the wildest tracts in Coorg. In the forests which cover the western declivities of the Gh\u0101ts are found the jungle tribe called K\u0101du Maratis, who live by kumri or shifting cultivation; and the Kadavas or Bodavas, the attire of whose women is only a few leaves, but these it is said they change four times a day. The settled population of this n\u0101d consists almost entirely of Tulu Gaudas. There are many sacred forests called Devara-k\u0101du in the taluk, which\nhave for ages remained intact. But some of these rich tracts have been cautiously invaded and planted with coffee, a share of the produce being paid towards the worship of the deities despoiled in order to avert their wrath.\n\nPadma.\u2014The name of the main stream of the Ganges in the lower part of its course between the off-take of the Bh\u0101girathi river in $24^\\circ 35' N.$ and $88^\\circ 5' E.$ and the south-eastern corner of Dacca District, where it joins the Meghn\u0101 in $23^\\circ 13' N.$ and $90^\\circ 33' E.$, after a course of 225 miles.\n\nPadman\u0101bh\u0101m.\u2014Village in the Bimlipatam tahsil of Vizagapatam District, Madras, situated in $17^\\circ 59' N.$ and $83^\\circ 20' E.$ The large temple here has much local celebrity; but Padman\u0101bh\u0101m is chiefly of interest as the scene of the battle between Viziar\u0101ma R\u0101z, R\u0101j\u0101 of Vizianagram, and the Company's forces under Colonel Prendergast on July 10, 1794. Viziar\u0101ma R\u0101z was defeated and slain, and with him fell most of his retainers and the principal chiefs of the country, the British loss being only 13 killed and 61 wounded.\n\nPadman\u0101bhapuram (Palpan\u0101veram).\u2014Town in the Kalkulam taluk of Travancore State, Madras, situated in $8^\\circ 15' N.$ and $77^\\circ 24' E.$, about 32 miles south of Trivandrum. Population (1901), 3,257. This was the most important of the ancient capitals of Travancore. It is surrounded by a square fortification, now fast going into ruins, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circumference, constructed about 1757 under the supervision of a Flemish captain named De Lannoy. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101's palace within is the most attractive feature of the town. It is the head-quarters of the Padman\u0101bhapuram district, and contains the magistrate's and Munsif's courts and other public offices.\n\nP\u0101dra T\u0101luka.\u2014Western taluka of the Baroda pr\u0101nt, Baroda State, with an area of 196 square miles. The population fell from 92,328 in 1891 to 73,395 in 1901. The taluka contains one town, P\u0101dra (population, 8,289), the head-quarters; and 82 villages. It is a plain with numerous trees, bounded on the north and south by two rivers, the Mah\u012b and Dh\u0101dhar. The soil is mainly of three kinds: gor\u0101t or light red, black, and bes\u0101r, a mixture of the two. The gor\u0101t, which constitutes nearly three-fourths of the whole, is very rich. The chief crops produced are b\u0101jra, m\u0101th, jow\u0101r, tal, tuver, d\u0101ngar, cotton, wheat, gram, and tobacco. In 1904\u20135 the land revenue was Rs. 3,94,000.\n\nP\u0101dra Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Baroda State, situated in $22^\\circ 14' N.$ and $73^\\circ 5' E.$, 14 miles from the city of Baroda. Population (1901), 8,289. The town is on the narrow-gauge railway line running from here through Baroda to Dabhoi. It contains Munsif's and magistrate's courts, Anglo-vernacular and vernacular schools, and a dispensary. The munici-\npality receives an annual grant of Rs. 1,700 from the State. The only industries carried on are a little cloth-printing and dyeing; but as P\u0101dra is the centre of a number of prosperous villages there is a fair amount of trade, and the market is well attended. The town is historically interesting as being the place of detention of some well-known members of the Gaikw\u0101r family; in particular, Malh\u0101r Rao Gaikw\u0101r was confined here just before he exchanged his prison for a throne.\n\nPadraun\u0101 Tahsil.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of Sidhu\u0101 Jobn\u0101, lying between 26\u00b0 31' and 27\u00b0 18' N. and 83\u00b0 43' and 84\u00b0 26' E., with an area of 921 square miles. Population fell from 605,551 in 1891 to 595,706 in 1901. There are 1,285 villages and three towns\u2014Amw\u0101 Kh\u0101s (population, 8,918); Padraun\u0101 (7,031), the tahsil head-quarters; and Bansgaw\u0101 (5,009). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 5,37,000, and for cesses Rs. 86,000. The density of population, 642 persons per square mile, is about the District average. The tahsil extends from the s\u0101l forests in the north to the rich, well-cultivated tract in the centre of the District. It is bounded in places on the north-east by the Great Gandak, which occasionally shifts its channel; and on the west by the Little Gandak. Smaller streams cross the tahsil, flowing usually from north-west to south-east. Padraun\u0101 produces sugar-cane, rice, and kodon, and also a considerable amount of indigo. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 675 square miles, of which 86 were irrigated. Wells supply five-eighths of the irrigated area, and tanks, swamps, and rivers the remainder.\n\nPadraun\u0101 Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 54' N. and 83\u00b0 59' E. Population (1901), 7,031. The town consists of three parts, called Padraun\u0101, Chhaoni, and S\u0101hibganj. The latter is now the chief market. Padraun\u0101 was identified by General Cunningham with P\u0101w\u0101, the last halting-place of Gautama Buddha before his death; but the identification has been abandoned. It is the residence of a Kurmi landholder known as the Rai of Padraun\u0101, who holds a large estate in the north of the District, and maintains a dispensary here. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,300. There is a school with 73 pupils.\n\nPadwa.\u2014Tahsil in the Agency tract of Vizagapatam District, Madras. It is situated on the northern slope of the Eastern Gh\u0101ts, and consists of a plateau with an average elevation of 3,000 feet, traversed by several hill ranges which attain heights considerably greater, Arma (5,500 feet) and Sinkram (5,300 feet) being the loftiest peaks in the range. The upper slopes of the hills are as a rule open and covered with high 'bison-grass,' which is annually burnt by the hill\ntribes. The area of the tahsil is 1,383 square miles, with a population in 1901 of 64,415, compared with 58,995 in 1891, chiefly hill tribes with a considerable admixture of Telugus. They live in 1,418 villages. The head-quarters are at Padwa village. The tahsil belongs almost equally to the M\u0101dugula, Jeypore, and P\u0101chipenta zamind\u0101rs. Among the places of interest in it may be mentioned the great limestone cave at Borra, which contains a Saivite shrine and from which a stream emerges and runs down a gorge of remarkable beauty 300 feet deep; and Paderu, the former head-quarters of the tahsil and the original home of the M\u0101dugula zamind\u0101rs.\n\nPagan Subdivision.\u2014Southern subdivision of Myingyan District, Upper Burma, containing the townships of PAGAN, SALE, and KYAUK-PADAUNG. The head-quarters are at Nyaungu, adjoining Pagan on the river bank.\n\nPagan Township.\u2014Central township of Myingyan District, Upper Burma, lying along the Irrawaddy, between $20^\\circ 53'$ and $21^\\circ 20'$ N. and $94^\\circ 49'$ and $95^\\circ 16'$ E., with an area of 582 square miles. The soil is poor, and chiefly produces early sesamum, pulse, and jow\u0101r. The population was 49,606 in 1891, and 56,971 in 1901, distributed in one town, Nyaungu (see PAGAN VILLAGE) (population, 6,254), the head-quarters, and 189 villages. In 1903\u20134 the area cultivated was 150 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 77,000.\n\nPagan Village.\u2014An ancient ruined capital of the Burmese empire, situated in $21^\\circ 10'$ N. and $94^\\circ 53'$ E., on the left bank of the Irrawaddy, in Pagan township, towards the south-west of Myingyan District, Upper Burma, in the neighbourhood of the small town of Nyaungu. Population (1901), 6,254. The name Pagan has been applied somewhat loosely to a number of Burmese capitals established at different times in the neighbourhood of the present village. The earliest of these is said to have been founded about the second century of the Christian era, near a village now known as Taungye, and was called Pugama. Other capitals, known as Thiripyitsaya and Tampawadi, were built later, close by the first site; and finally about the ninth century the site near the present village of Pagan was selected, and remained the head-quarters of the Pagan kings till the overthrow of the dynasty in the thirteenth century (see MYINGYAN DISTRICT). The ruins of the city walls and the traces of the old moat are still to be seen near the village now known as Pagan or Old Pagan. In ancient times the capital was guarded by four concentric brick walls, each with twelve gates. A moat lay on its northern, southern, and eastern faces, while the western side was protected by the Irrawaddy. When first founded the city appears to have been well watered and well wooded, as there are indications that the rainfall must have been sufficiently copious for extensive rice cultivation. The deficiency of the rains in\nlater times can only be ascribed to abnormal deforestation, due to the demand for fuel used in making bricks for the innumerable pagodas and other religious buildings for which Pagan is famous.\n\nThe most notable of the thousands of shrines, now more or less ruined, are the Bupay\u0101 pagoda, the Manuha temple, the Nanpay\u0101 temple, the Shwezigon pagoda, the Nagayon pagoda, the Ananda temple, the Shwegugyi pagoda, the Thatbyinnyu and Sulamani temples, and the Gawdawpalin, Damayazika, and Mahabawdi pagodas. Pyu Saw Ti, the third king of Pagan, is credited with the founding of the Bupay\u0101, one of the most conspicuous, said to have been built to commemorate the complete eradication by the founder of a troublesome *bu* (gourd) creeper which had been found a serious obstacle to the cultivation of cereals. The Manuha pagoda, situated 2 miles south of Pagan, is reputed to have been raised by Manuha, a king of Thaton, who was brought as a captive to Pagan by Anawrata, the most famous of its kings. It contains a gigantic recumbent image of Buddha. The Nanpay\u0101, close to it, is the receptacle of some fine specimens of stone sculpture. The Shwezigon pagoda at Nyaungu is the only notable gilded shrine. Its plinth is adorned with terra-cotta tiles, and within its enclosure are deposited Talaing and Burmese inscriptions of great historical value. It was begun by Anawrata and finished in 1090 by his son Kyansittha. The king employed Indian architects on the Nagayon pagoda (built in 1064), the prototype of the famous Ananda temple, founded in 1090. This latter is Pagan's best-known shrine, and contains stone sculpture of exquisite workmanship and interesting terra-cotta tiles. Its plan, in the form of a Greek cross, and its architecture, which recalls the Jain style, are unique. Alaungsithu, grandson of Kyansittha, founded the Shwegugyi pagoda in 1141, after the model of the sleeping chamber of Buddha, and the Thatbyinnyu pagoda in 1144. The latter is modelled on the lines of the temples of Northern India and has five storeys. Four miles south-west of Nyangu are the Sulamani pagoda resembling the Thatbyinnyu temple, and the Gawdawpalin and Damayazika pagodas built by the famous Narapadasithu (1167\u20131204). His successor, Nandaungmya Min, built the Mahabawdi pagoda after the model of the temple at Buddh Gay\u0101 in Bengal, the only specimen of its kind to be found in Burma. Pagan is a well-known resort for Buddhist pilgrims and foreign tourists, and a museum has been built within the precincts of the Ananda temple for the exhibition of antiquities found in the neighbourhood. Pagan, or more properly speaking Nyaungu, was at one time a municipality. Since 1903, however, the affairs at Nyaungu have been controlled by a town committee consisting of three members, who in 1903\u20134 administered a fund the income of which amounted to Rs. 6,900 and the expenditure to Rs. 10,000.\nPah.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nPah\u0101s\u016b.\u2014Town in the Khurja tahsil of Bulandshahr District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 10' N. and 78\u00b0 5' E., 24 miles south of Bulandshahr town. Population (1901), 5,603. Part\u0101b Singh, one of the first Bargujar immigrants, made it his head-quarters. Pah\u0101s\u016b was the chief town in a mah\u0101l under Akbar, and at the end of the eighteenth century was conferred with a j\u0101g\u012br of 54 villages by Sh\u0101h Alam II on the Begam Sumr\u016b for the support of her troops. After her death in 1836, it was held for a time by Government and then granted in 1851 to Mur\u0101d Ali Kh\u0101n, a descendant of Part\u0101b Singh. His son, Naw\u0101b Faiz Ali Kh\u0101n, K.C.S.I., behaved with conspicuous loyalty during the Mutiny, and was afterwards commander-in-chief and prime minister of Jaipur State. Since his death in 1894, his son, Naw\u0101b Faiy\u0101z Ali Kh\u0101n, C.S.I., has served as a member of the Supreme and Provincial Legislative Councils, and is now a minister of state in Jaipur. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 900. The Naw\u0101b maintains a dispensary and an Anglo-vernacular school, and there is a primary school with 95 pupils.\n\nPahr\u0101.\u2014One of the Chaube J\u0101g\u012brs in Central India, under the Political Agent in Baghelkhand, with an area of about 27 square miles, and a population (1901) of 3,535. The estate was granted in 1812 to S\u0101lig R\u0101m Chaube, son of R\u0101m Kishan of K\u0101linjar. Maksudan Pras\u0101d, who was j\u0101gird\u0101r in 1857, assisted the British to the utmost of his power. His successor, the present j\u0101gird\u0101r, Rao Bah\u0101dur R\u0101dha Charan J\u016b, succeeded by adoption in 1868, receiving powers in 1879. He was educated at the R\u0101jkum\u0101r College at Nowgong. Of the total area, 6 square miles, or 22 per cent., are cultivated. The revenue is Rs. 13,000. A small force of 100 infantry, 10 cavalry, and 4 gunners with two brass cannon is maintained. The chief place is Chaubepur, situated in 25\u00b0 6' N. and 80\u00b0 48' E., 20 miles from Karw\u012b station on the Jh\u0101nsi-M\u0101nikpur section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 878.\n\nPaig\u0101h Estates.\u2014A group of estates in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, comprising 23 taluks dispersed over the Districts of B\u012bdar, Nander, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Gulbarga, Medak, Atr\u0101f-i-balda, and Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, and a few scattered villages in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Warangal, Mahb\u016bbnagar, and Nalgonda. They consist of 1,273 villages and towns, with an aggregate area of 4,134 square miles and a total revenue of about 40 lakhs. These estates belong to the representatives of three deceased noblemen, Sir Asm\u0101n Jah, Sir Khurshed Jah, and Sir Vik\u0101r-ul-Umar\u0101. The table on the next page shows details of the estates according to the Census of 1901.\n\nThe history of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d paig\u0101h nobles dates back to the reign of Akbar. Mull\u0101 Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn, the founder of the family, came to\nShikoh\u0101b\u0101d from Lahore during the reign of that emperor. His son, Muhammad Bah\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, was appointed head of the treasury at Akbar\u0101b\u0101d (Agra) in Aurangzeb\u2019s reign. Muhammad Abul-Khair Kh\u0101n, the founder\u2019s grandson, attracted the attention of Naw\u0101b Asaf J\u0101h, with whom he came to the Deccan, and, after having served as deputy-S\u016bbahdar of M\u0101lw\u0101, finally settled at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. In 1743 he was sent against B\u0101pu Naik, a Mar\u0101\u1e6dha chief, who was levying chauth in these territories, and defeated him. Subsequently he held the deputy-S\u016bbahd\u0101rship of Kh\u0101ndesh and Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. He died at Burh\u0101npur in 1749, leaving an only son, Abul Fateh Kh\u0101n, who received the title of Tegh Jang from Naw\u0101b Niz\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n. Further distinctions and titles were bestowed upon him, among them being that of Shams-ul-Umar\u0101, which became the family title. He commanded 10,000 cavalry, which formed the beginning of the paig\u0101h forces, for the maintenance of which the estates were originally granted. Abul Fateh Kh\u0101n died at P\u0101ngal while accompanying the expedition against Tip\u016b, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad Fakhr-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, who received his grandfather\u2019s name of Abul-Khair Kh\u0101n. In 1800 he married a daughter of the Niz\u0101m, and thus the family became allied for the first time to the ruling house of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. In 1827 the title of Am\u012br-i-Kab\u012br, or \u2018premier noble,\u2019 was bestowed upon him. Fakhr-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n was a great patron of learning, and a good mathematician, being the author of Sittu-i-shamsia, a work on physics, mechanics, astronomy, &c. He built the Jah\u0101n-num\u0101 and many other palaces, and died in 1855, leaving five sons.\n\n| Names          | Number of taluks | Area in square miles | Number of villages | Population, 1901 |\n|----------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Sir Asm\u0101n J\u0101h  | 7                | 1,232                | 396                | 265,194         |\n| Sir Khurshed J\u0101h | 8              | 1,512                | 468                | 268,902         |\n| Sir Vik\u0101r-ul-Umar\u0101 | 8            | 1,390                | 409                | 240,315         |\n| Total          | 23               | 4,134                | 1,273              | 774,411         |\n\nThe third son, Rafi-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, who succeeded his father as Am\u012br-i-Kab\u012br, was appointed co-regent with Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang on the death of the Niz\u0101m Afzal-ud-daula Bah\u0101dur in 1869, the present Niz\u0101m being then only three years old. This office he held till his death in 1877, when his younger brother Rash\u012bd-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n succeeded him as co-regent, receiving the titles of Shams-ul-Umar\u0101 and Am\u012br-i-Kab\u012br. The paig\u0101h j\u0101girs and estates were subsequently divided between two branches of the family, one represented by Sir Asm\u0101n J\u0101h, a grandson of Fakhr-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, and the other by Rash\u012bd-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, who died in 1881, leaving two sons, Sir Khurshed J\u0101h and Sir Vik\u0101r-ul-Umar\u0101.\nWhen the present Niz\u0101m attained his majority, he conferred the title of Am\u012br-i-Akbar on Sir Asm\u0101n Jah. This nobleman became minister of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d in 1888, and after six years of office retired in 1893, and was succeeded as minister by Sir Vik\u0101r-ul-Umar\u0101. Sir Asm\u0101n Jah died in 1898, leaving an only son, Naw\u0101b Muin-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, who is now the sole representative of this branch of the family. Sir Vik\u0101r-ul-Umar\u0101 resigned the office of minister in 1901, and died early in 1902, leaving two sons, Naw\u0101b Sult\u0101n-ul-mulk Bah\u0101dur and Naw\u0101b Wali-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur. Sir Khurshed Jah, who survived his brother for only a year, has also left two sons, Naw\u0101b Shams-ul-mulk Zafar Jang Bah\u0101dur and Naw\u0101b Im\u0101m Jang Bah\u0101dur.\n\n**Pail Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil in the Amargarh niz\u0101mat of the Pati\u0101la State, Punjab. See S\u0101hibgarh.\n\n**Pail Town** (or S\u0101hibgarh).\u2014Head-quarters of the S\u0101hibgarh tahsil, Amargarh niz\u0101mat, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 43' N. and 76\u00b0 7' E., 34 miles north-west of Pati\u0101la town. Population (1901), 5,515. The town is of some antiquity, and tradition says that 700 years ago some Hindu Khattris of the Seoni section settled here at the suggestion of Sh\u0101h Hasan, a Muhammadan fak\u012br. In digging its foundations they found a p\u0101el, or ornament worn by women on the feet, whence its name. In 1236 the rebellious Malik, Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn J\u0101ni, was killed at Nakaw\u0101n in the district of Pail by the partisans of the Sult\u0101n Raziya, daughter of Altamsh. In the time of Akbar the district was a pargana of Sirhind. The town is an important religious centre, famous for its tank, the Gang\u0101 S\u0101gar, and a temple of Mah\u0101deo, called the Dasn\u0101m k\u0101 Akh\u0101ra. It also possesses some fine buildings, and its position on an elevated site gives it an imposing appearance. Its trade is inconsiderable, but country carts and carved doorways are made in some numbers. The town contains a high school and a dispensary.\n\n**Pail\u0101n\u012b.**\u2014Northern tahsil of B\u0101nd\u0101 District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying south of the Jumna, between 25\u00b0 32' and 25\u00b0 55' N. and 80\u00b0 14' and 80\u00b0 40' E., with an area of 362 square miles. The population fell from 88,544 in 1891 to 80,524 in 1901. There are 121 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,49,000, and for cesses Rs. 23,000. The density of population, 222 persons per square mile, is slightly above the District average. The Ken, after forming part of the western boundary, turns eastwards and crosses the tahsil till it joins the Jumna. The tahsil contains a good deal of light soil, and near the Jumna there are deep ravines. In 1902\u20133 the area under cultivation was 188 square miles; there is practically no irrigation, but the Ken Canal, when completed, will serve part of this tahsil.\nP\u0101kaur Subdivision.\u2014Eastern subdivision of the Sant\u0101l Parganas District, Bengal, lying between $24^\\circ 14'$ and $24^\\circ 49'$ N. and $87^\\circ 23'$ and $87^\\circ 55'$ E., with an area of 683 square miles. The western portion of\n\nPain\u0101.\u2014Town in the Deoria tahs\u012bl of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 16'$ N. and $83^\\circ 47'$ E., on the left bank of the Gogra. Population (1901), 5,029. The inhabitants plundered a Government commissariat train during the Mutiny, in punishment for which the village was confiscated and bestowed on the R\u0101j\u0101 of Majhuli. Most of the inhabitants are boatmen, who live by conveying traffic along the Gogra between Barhaj and Patna. A primary school has 81 pupils.\n\nPaingang\u0101.\u2014River in Ber\u0101r and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. See Pengang\u0101.\n\nPaithan T\u0101luk.\u2014Southern t\u0101luk of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 453 square miles. Its population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 57,021, compared with 57,133 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famines of 1897 and 1899-1900. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Paithan (population, 8,638), the head-quarters; and 142 villages, of which 12 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 2.1 lakhs. The river God\u0101vari forms the southern boundary, and the t\u0101luk is composed of black cotton soil.\n\nPaithan Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in $19^\\circ 28'$ N. and $75^\\circ 24'$ E., on the north bank of the God\u0101vari. Population (1901), 8,638. Paithan, the Pratisth\u0101n of the ancients, is one of the oldest cities in the Deccan, and is associated with many historic events. Asoka sent missionaries to the Petenikas, who were probably the inhabitants of the country round this place, while inscriptions of the second century B.C., in the caves at Pitalkhara near Ch\u0101lisgaon, refer to the king and merchants of Pratisth\u0101n. According to Ptolemy this was the capital of Pulum\u0101yi II, the Andhra king (138-70), and the author of the Periplus describes it as a great centre of trade. Paithan is said to have been the birthplace and capital of S\u0101liv\u0101hana, with whom is connected the era that bears this name; but it is probable that S\u0101liv\u0101hana is a corruption of S\u0101tav\u0101hana, the title of the Andhra kings. Almost all traces of the ancient city have disappeared. The modern town contains numerous Hindu temples with exquisite wood-carvings. The sect of M\u0101nbhau was founded at Paithan about the middle of the fourteenth century. The tenets of this sect prescribe the exclusive worship of Krishna, the disregard of all caste rules, and a life of mendicancy. Some of the present followers of the creed follow ordinary pursuits, while those who adhere to the stricter rule wander about as beggars, clothed in black. (See R\u012btpur.) Silk and cotton s\u0101ris and other silk fabrics are made at Paithan, which is a trade centre of some importance.\nthe subdivision is a sharply defined belt of hilly country stretching southwards; it contains some cultivated valleys, but much of the land is rocky and sterile. The eastern portion is a flat alluvial country, where rice is largely cultivated. Its population in 1901 was 238,648, compared with 230,256 in 1891. It contains 1,055 villages, of which P\u0101kaur is the head-quarters; but no town. The subdivision, which has a density of 349 persons per square mile, contains part of the sparsely inhabited Daman-i-koh Government estate, but the P\u0101kaur th\u0101na in the east is fertile and densely populated.\n\nP\u0101kaur Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in the Sant\u0101l Parganas District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 38' N. and 87\u00b0 50' E. Population (1901), 1,519.\n\nP\u0101kh\u0101l T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk in Warangal District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 1,320 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101g\u012brs, was 39,030, compared with 36,719 in 1891. It is very thinly populated, owing to large forests and a malarious climate. The t\u0101luk contained 195 villages, of which 3 are j\u0101g\u012br, Narsampet (population, 1,803) being the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 1.2 lakhs. In 1905 some villages were added from the Warangal t\u0101luk, and the northern portion became a separate t\u0101luk called T\u0101rvai. The P\u0101kh\u0101l Lake, 13 square miles in area, is situated 8 miles east of Narsampet. The river Muner flows out from this lake. Rice is largely grown near tanks. The aboriginal tribes of Gonds and Koyas numbered 4,696 and 4,826 respectively in 1901.\n\nP\u0101kh\u0101l Lake.\u2014An extensive lake in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 17\u00b0 57' N. and 79\u00b0 59' E., in the P\u0101kh\u0101l t\u0101luk of Warangal District, and enclosed on the north, south, and east by ranges of low and densely wooded hills. It was made by throwing a dam across the P\u0101kh\u0101l river, which here cuts its way between two low hills. It is the largest artificial piece of water in the State, the length and breadth being 8,000 and 6,000 yards, while the dam is more than 2,000 yards long, and the water covers an area of nearly 13 square miles. Several channels convey water from the lake to some distance for irrigation. At the centre of the dam are the ruins of a small pavilion known as the chab\u016btra of Shit\u0101b Kh\u0101n. The lake abounds with fish, otters, and crocodiles, and the surrounding country contains game of all descriptions. The average depth of the water is between 30 and 40 feet.\n\nPakhli.\u2014An ancient sark\u0101r or district of the Mughal S\u016bbah of the Punjab, now included in the Haz\u0101ra District of the North-West Frontier Province. Pakhli roughly corresponds with the ancient Uras\u0101, the \u1f08\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1 or \u1f48\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1 which Ptolemy places between the Bidaspes (Jhelum) and the Indus. Its king was named Arsakes in the time of Alexander. Hiuen Tsiang found it tributary to Kashmir. In the Kashmir chronicle called the R\u0101jatarangin\u012b, it appears, now as a\nseparate kingdom, now as tributary to that State. In it lay Agror, the ancient Atyugrapura. In B\u0101bar\u2019s time this tract was held by the Khakha and Bambha tribes, whose chiefs had been the ancient rulers of the country east of the Indus, but had been driven out by the Gibari Sult\u0101ns of B\u0101jaur and Sw\u0101t; and the tract derives its name from Pakhli, one of these conquerors. In the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b it is described as bounded on the east by Kashmir, on the south by the country of the Gakhars, on the west by Attock, and on the north by Kator (Chitr\u0101l). Under Durr\u0101n\u012b rule Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n was chosen as chief of Pakhli, then a dependency of Kashmir. He founded the fort of Garhi Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n, which was the head-quarters of Az\u0101d Kh\u0101n\u2019s rebellion against Tim\u016br Sh\u0101h. Early in the nineteenth century Pakhli comprised three districts: Mansehra in the south and south-east, Shinkiari (subdivided into Kandhi and Maid\u0101n) in the north-east, and Bh\u012br-Kand in the centre. The valleys of K\u0101g\u0101n, Bhogarmang, and Agror were dependent on it.\n\nPakokku Chin Hills.\u2014Administered area in Burma. See Chin Hills, Pakokku.\n\nPakokku District.\u2014District in the Minbu Division of Upper Burma, lying between 20\u00b0 48\u2032 and 22\u00b0 50\u2032 N. and 93\u00b0 59\u2032 and 95\u00b0 24\u2032 E., with an area of 6,210 square miles. It is pear-shaped, tapering off towards the north, and is bounded on the north by the Upper and Lower Chindwin Districts; on the east by the Chindwin and Irrawaddy rivers, which separate it from Sagaing and Myingyan Districts; and on the south by Minbu District; the lofty barrier of the Chin Hills forms its entire western border. The District is divided into two roughly equal parts east and west by the masses of the Pondaung and Tangyi ranges, which rise to about 3,000 or 4,000 feet in the north, and diminish in the south to about 2,000 feet. In the extreme west between the Pondaung and the Chin Hills lies a long narrow valley, running north and south, and divided towards its southern end by a watershed. The country to the north of this divide is drained by the Myittha, which rises in the Pakokku Chin Hills, enters the District from the west, and flows northwards into the Upper Chindwin District, and by the Myittha\u2019s southerly affluent, the Maw. The valley to the south of the watershed is for the most part drained by the Yaw river and its numerous tributaries. East of the Pondaung is a strip of country, 15 miles in width in the north and widening to 45 miles in the south, bounded on the east by the Tangyi hills, which run in a general southerly direction right down the centre of the District. The whole of it is watered by the Yaw river, which comes in from the west, bends southwards, and flows into the Irrawaddy in the extreme south of the District. North of the point where the Yaw enters this strip is the valley of the Kyaw;\nsouth of this point the ground rises from the river into a mass of hills and narrow valleys, only the southern edge of which is inhabited to any extent. To the east of the central stretch of hill and valley the country varies considerably. Near the Irrawaddy and Chindwin are large alluvial plains, transformed in places into lagoons by the annual rise of the rivers. Behind these plains the surface rises gradually, and becomes more and more broken as it approaches the hills, the whole area being arid, and water being very difficult to obtain. In this portion of the District is a small isolated range running north and south, and culminating in the Shinnadaung, 1,757 feet in height, about 20 miles due north of Pakokku town.\n\nThe eastern portion is covered with the alluvium deposited by the Irrawaddy and Chindwin. On the west of the Irrawaddy soft sandstones of Upper Tertiary (pliocene) age occupy a large area; they are characterized by the presence of fossil wood in large quantities, and in the Yaw Valley by mammalian bones. On the right bank of the Irrawaddy opposite Pagan the miocene (Pegu) beds are brought up by an anticlinal fold, and form a long narrow ridge running north and south parallel with the river. It is here, in the neighbourhood of Yenangyat, that the petroleum area is situated. Twelve oil-sands have been recognized in this region, all occurring in the lower or Prome stage of the miocene beds.\n\nThe flora of the arid areas in the east of the District is of the type common to the dry zone of Upper Burma, and includes cactus and other vegetation that thrives without much moisture. In the hills in the west bamboos and teak are common, and stretches of pine forest occur on the higher ridges.\n\nBarking-deer, sambhar, bears, wild hog, leopards, tsine or hsaing (Bos sondaicus), and pyaung (bison) are always to be found in the jungles of the District. Wild elephants often appear on the slopes of the remoter ridges, and the thick forests which clothe the hill ranges are a resort for tigers.\n\nThe dry part of the District east of the Pondaung is healthy, but hot. West of the Pondaung the rainfall is much heavier, and the heat is not so oppressive; but during the rains dense fogs are frequent in the valleys, which are excessively malarious, especially at the beginning and end of the wet season. Few visitors escape fever, and the residents themselves are not free from this scourge. What is known as Yaw fever is of an even more virulent type than the well-known fever of Arakan, and frequently attacks those who have returned to the valleys from the healthier parts of the District. The cold season is crisp and pleasant; but during April, May, and June the thermometer in the dry parts rises considerably above 100\u00b0, as much as 107\u00b0 being by no means an uncommon record. A temperature of 118\u00b0, recorded\nin the Pakokku courthouse, has so far been looked upon as the maximum.\n\nThe rainfall in the dry parts of the District is light and capricious; and here there is always a great scarcity of water, which in many places has to be carted for miles. The villages in the interior of the Pakokku and Myaing townships, particularly in the latter, have to depend almost entirely on tanks for their water-supply. West of the Pondaung the rainfall is much higher, but the distribution is uneven; the Kyaw valley enjoys a fairly ample supply, while the Gangaw township receives somewhat less, and the share of the Tilin township is even smaller. The average of the five years ending 1902 was 23 inches in Pakokku, 35 inches in the central portion (Pauk), and 48 inches in the Myittha valley (Gangaw).\n\nPrior to the annexation of Upper Burma, Pakokku was only a small fishing village, and its *thugyi* was under the control of the *wun* of Pakangyi. Though legends give what seem obviously fanciful origins for its name, it is not even mentioned in old maps, and the Irrawaddy Flotilla steamers only commenced to make it a place of call of recent years. Formerly all steamers called at Kunywa, 4 miles above Pakokku, where one of the branches of the Chindwin river joins the Irrawaddy, as for a long time Pakokku was cut off from the main channel by a huge sandbank, and Kunywa was then the main trading centre. In 1885, however, the sandbank disappeared, the river resumed its old course opposite Pakokku, and from that time trade steadily found its way thither, while Kunywa shrank into an unimportant village. The rise and growth of Pakokku have been particularly marked since the British occupation.\n\nUnder Burmese rule the Pakangyi *kayaing* corresponded with the present Pakokku District, and included the *wun*-ships of Pakangyi, Yaw Lemyo, and Pagyi Taik. At the time of annexation the area now forming the District was part of Pagan and Myingyan. During 1886 it was in a very unsettled state, as the greater part of it was dominated by the Shwegyobyu prince, who had been joined by the local Burman official, the *Kayaingwun* of Myingyan. A column was sent up in 1886 to deal with the insurgents, civil officials were stationed at Pakangyi, and two small posts were built at Pakokku and Yesagyo. The rebels were restrained to a certain extent by a military post at Myaing, but this part of the District was not at peace till a post was established at Pakangyi. The Pagan District was abolished and the Pakokku District formed in 1888 with its head-quarters at Pakokku. The Yaw country in the west was still unsettled even then, being overrun by two of the Shwegyobyu pretender\u2019s adherents, an influential local official called Ya Kut and a dacoit leader called Tha Do. Both were got rid of, however, during the course of the year.\nOld pagodas abound in the District. The most noticeable in the neighbourhood of Pakokku are the Shwegu pagoda in the town itself, the Tangyiswedaw pagoda opposite Pagan on the Irrawaddy, and the shrines at Kunywa, Shinmadaung, and Thamaing. The first mentioned is supposed to occupy the site of the shrine erected by Alaungsithu, king of Pagan, over the grave of his queen, who died in childbirth. Grants of wutugan land were made in 1887 to the trustees of the Tangyiswedaw pagoda, as well as to those of three famous images of Gautama known as the Sithushin, the Shinmadaung, and the Datpaung Myezu at Pakangyi in the Yesagyo township. The Tangyiswedaw pagoda is said to have been erected by Anawrata of Pagan to enshrine a tooth of Gautama brought by him from China; the three Pakangyi images are of sandal-wood, and date back to the early years of the twelfth century. They are reputed to have been put up by Narapadisithu, the famous warrior king of Pagan. They were removed to Mandalay in 1884, but were restored to Pakangyi two years later.\n\nOpposite Thamadaw in the Pauk township, on the west bank of the Yaw river, are two famous pagodas, the Shwepaunglaung and Shwe-moktaw, which mark the site of a small pagoda said to have been erected by Dhamathawka, king of Pagan in 1091. They were restored by Narapadisithu a century later, and the anniversary of their restoration in the month of Tabaung used to be regularly celebrated by a festival till the time of the British occupation. The festival is now being revived.\n\nThe population increased from 311,959 in 1891 to 356,489 in 1901.\n\n**Population.**\n\nIts distribution in the latter year is shown in the following table:\n\n| Township | Area in square miles | Number of towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Persons able to read and write |\n|----------|----------------------|----------------|---------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Pakokku  | 386                  | 1              | 223     | 68,344     | 177                       | - 4                                                          | 18,158                         |\n| Yesagyo  | 564                  | 238            |         | 87,797     | 156                       | + 63                                                         | 23,950                         |\n| Myaing   | 825                  | 295            |         | 71,976     | 87                        | + 53                                                         | 14,260                         |\n| Pauk     | 1,490                | 190            |         | 41,021     | 28                        | + 12                                                         | 8,223                          |\n| Saw      | 1,200                | 117            |         | 19,868     | 17                        | - 11                                                         | 5,066                          |\n| Seikpyu  | 550                  | 152            |         | 31,100     | 56                        | - 34                                                         | 4,527                          |\n| Gangaw   | 698                  | 118            |         | 24,200     | 35                        | + 7                                                          | 6,069                          |\n| Tilin    | 488                  | 120            |         | 12,183     | 25                        | + 11                                                         | 2,744                          |\n\nDistrict total | 6,210 | 1 | 1,453 | 356,489 | 57 | + 14 | 82,997\n\nThe table shows that there has been a slight increase since 1891 in the townships bordering on the Chin Hills in the north-west of the District; a diminution in the southern townships, from which the people\nappear to have moved to some extent to the better irrigated tracts in the north of Minbu; and a substantial rise in the north-east, which has had the benefit of immigration from Myingyan and elsewhere. In the valleys of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin the population is dense, but in the hills to the west the villages are scattered. Burmese is spoken by 96 per cent. of the people.\n\nThe majority of the population is Burman or quasi-Burman. About 6,500 Chins occupy the western townships in the valleys of the Yaw and Myittha rivers. The Taungthas, who numbered 5,700 in 1901, inhabit the Yaw country and are peculiar to the District. In dress the men resemble the Burmans, but the women are distinguished by a white petticoat and a dark plaid sash of cotton worn under the jacket round the body from chest to hips. Their dialect is distinct from that of the other residents of the Yaw tract, and contains words which have an affinity with the Baungshe or Lai dialect of the Chins. They profess both Buddhism and nat-worship, are industrious, and make good agriculturists. No very satisfactory theory as to their origin has yet been put forward. The Yaws of the same region, who speak or spoke a dialect of their own, are now practically indistinguishable from their Burman neighbours. They have a reputation as magicians. Natives of India numbered in 1901 only 1,997, Hindus predominating. More than half of this total are engaged in trade in Pakokku town, or have found employment in the Yenangyat oil-fields as traders and coolies. The number of persons returned as directly dependent on agriculture in 1901 was 221,494, or 62 per cent. of the total population. Of this number, 50,562 in the western hill areas were dependent on taungya cultivation.\n\nThere are less than 200 Christians, of whom 106 are natives. The only Christian mission is that of the Wesleyans at Pakokku town.\n\nThe alluvial soil is rich in the riverain and island lands, which produce peas, chillies, tobacco, gram, beans, and a number of other vegetables. In the highlands away from the river it is sandy in composition, with an admixture of red clay and gravel, and fit for ya cultivation only. The surface of the country is in general undulating and hilly, abounding in ravines and nullahs leading into the various streams. The system of cultivation is uniform throughout the District. The fields are tilled with a four-toothed harrow, lengthwise once, then diagonally once, and again breadthwise once. After this the surface is treated with a three-toothed harrow, first diagonally, then lengthwise or breadthwise, and again diagonally; finally the soil is made even with the harrow stock. For paddy-fields wooden harrows are used with teeth 8 inches long; for upland fields the length of the teeth is increased to 12 inches.\n\nThe crops are of the ordinary dry zone kind. Kaukyin (early) rice,\nmaize, early sesamum, and taungya rice are sown in May and June and reaped in December. For the kaukkyi rice crop operations commence in June and finish in January, while lu (millet), cotton, jowar, late sesamum, wheat, and gram are sown from July to October and reaped from December to February. The last named is a specially important staple in Pakokku. Maize is grown to a great extent, not only for the sake of the grain, but for the inner leaves of the sheath, which are used as wrappers for cheroots. This substance when ready for the market is called pet, and large quantities of it are exported. The kyun (or island) crops are sown from September to December in the rich alluvial soil the rivers leave behind them as they fall, and are reaped in March and April. They consist of various kinds of pulse, tobacco, and vegetables. The mayin or hot-season rice crop is planted from December to February in low-lying inundated hollows, and reaped in March and April.\n\nThe following are the main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134, in square miles:\n\n| Township   | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests |\n|------------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| Pakokku    | 386        | 124        | ...       |         |\n| Yesagyo    | 564        | 134        | 2         |         |\n| Myaing     | 825        | 215        | ...       |         |\n| Pauk       | 1,490      | 42         | 6         |         |\n| Saw        | 1,200      | 23         | 9         | 3,785   |\n| Seikpyu    | 559        | 107        | 3         |         |\n| Gangaw     | 698        | 22         | 1         |         |\n| Tilin      | 488        | 6          | 1         |         |\n| **Total**  | **6,210**  | **673**    | **22**    | **3,785** |\n\nThe staple crop is jowar, which covered 319 square miles in 1903\u20134, and forms the chief means of subsistence of the inhabitants of the poorer parts of the District. Rice, the food-grain of the people in the towns and the richer rural areas, was grown on 157 square miles. Gram occupied 30,000 acres, between one-third and one-half of the total for the whole Province. Pulse of various kinds covered about 33,000 acres, maize 23,200, and sesamum 32,600; and 4,900 acres were under tobacco. Garden cultivation is but little practised; but some betel-vines are grown in the Yesagyo township.\n\nCultivation is being extended generally; but it varies with the rainfall of the year, and depends to some extent on the manner in which the islands left by the river as it falls form in the channel. This island land is eagerly sought by the villagers for the cultivation of rice, maize, wheat, tobacco, and various kinds of vegetables, and differs from year to year in position and extent. The local cultivators do nothing to improve the quality of their crops, and there has been no experimental cultivation to speak of in the District. American maize was grown for\na time tentatively, but the husk proved too coarse for cheroot-covers. Virginia and Havana tobacco have also been tried in some parts, but can command no market value, as the flavour is disliked by the Burmans. Advances are made under the Agriculturists' Loans Act to villagers who have lost their plough cattle by disease, or have suffered in consequence of a bad harvest. The people appear fully to understand and appreciate the advantages to be derived from these loans, which during the past few years have averaged about Rs. 10,000 annually.\n\nThere are no special breeds of cattle or other live-stock; but the District produces fairly good beasts, and about 500 head of cattle are exported annually to Lower Burma, where they are readily sold for high prices. No special grazing grounds are set apart for cattle, the jungles near the villages supplying all that is needed for the greater part of the year, though in the interior, where fodder and water are scarce, the feeding and watering of the live-stock is by no means an easy matter in the hot season.\n\nChannels or canals are dug by the villagers to irrigate their fields from the beds of the Yaw and Myittha rivers. The level of the streams is raised by means of a dam constructed of branches of trees and plaited bamboo work, and plastered over with mud and stones. The stream may carry away the dam from time to time, but the agricultural community re-erect the obstruction, each cultivator who has irrigable land subscribing his quota of labour. An artificial water-way, known as the Saw myaung, was constructed in the Yesagyo township by the people about forty years ago, to let the water from the Chindwin river on to their lands. It was in time neglected and allowed to silt up, but on a representation from the villagers in 1903 a portion of it was redug near Pakangyi with satisfactory results. This canal irrigates a large natural depression about 8 miles by 2, extending near the river from Yesagyo to Kunywa in the Pakokku township. Tanks and wells are not utilized for irrigation purposes. The area irrigated in 1903\u20134 was 22 square miles, practically all rice land, of which 19 square miles drew their supplies from private canals. About two-thirds of the irrigated area lies in the Pauk and Saw townships, the rest being situated for the most part in Yesagyo and Seikpyu. There are fisheries in the Pakokku, Seikpyu, and Yesagyo townships, formed by the overflow from the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin. They furnish most of the fishery revenue, which in 1903\u20134 amounted to nearly Rs. 11,000.\n\nIn the Myaing and Pakokku townships, and over the greater part of the Seikpyu township, forest vegetation is not prolific. What there is belongs to the class generally known as dry forest, with stunted and scrubby growth. Farther to the north and west the forest passes gradually into the upper mixed class,\nand becomes moister, but is dotted with patches of ingyin (Pentacme siamensis). In the drainage of the Yaw, teak is plentiful not only on the lower slopes of the Chin Hills, but also on the watershed of the Yaw and Maw rivers and on the Pondaung range north of $21^\\circ 30' \\text{N.}$; natural regeneration, however, is not good. All over this area cutch is plentiful, and padauk (Pterocarpus indicus) is well represented.\n\nA noticeable feature of the Yaw forests is the prevalence of than (Terminalia Oliveri). The Gangaw forests to the east of the Maw and Myittha rivers are very rich in teak; but to the west of these streams large stretches of indaing or ingyin forest occur, and teak is confined to the beds of the streams. Padauk, cutch, and pingado (Xylia dolabriformis) are plentiful in the Gangaw subdivision, and pines are found in places on the hills. Throughout the District myinwa (Dendrocalamus strictus) is the prevailing bamboo, but lin and kyaathaung (Bambusa polymorpha) are found here and there on the moister slopes.\n\nThe Maw and Myittha are useful for floating timber; but the Yaw, owing to silting in its lower reaches, is very uncertain. The forest division contains 1,266 square miles of 'reserved,' 51 of protected, and 2,583 of unclassed forest. Of the 'reserved' forest, 115 square miles are in the Chin Hills outside the limits of the District. The gross forest receipts in 1903-4 were Rs. 1,22,000, and the net revenue Rs. 56,000.\n\nEarth-oil is found in workable quantities at Yenangyat on the right bank of the Irrawaddy, almost opposite Pagan, and has also been traced in small deposits elsewhere in the District.\n\nMinerals. The Yenangyat oil-wells were worked until twelve years ago by a few Burmans. Women then did most of the extraction, while men performed the necessary digging; but the process was clumsy and the out-turn inconsiderable. The oil-bearing tract has since that date been surveyed, and divided into blocks, each one mile square. The oil-fields at Yenangyat are now being worked by three concerns, whose total working staffs consist of about 20 Europeans and 600 Burmans and natives of India. In all, 32 blocks are at present held by the Burma Oil Company under leases from Government, 11 by the Rangoon, and 8 by the Minbu Oil Company. Prospecting licences have also been granted to the Minbu and Burma Oil Companies and to others. The royalty paid in 1901-2 on the oil extracted amounted to Rs. 1,43,000. The industry is expanding rapidly, and in 1903-4 the petroleum revenue had risen to Rs. 2,93,000. Coal crops out at many places on both sides of the Pondaung range and also near Myaing, but all the seams are too shallow to be worth working. There are salt springs near Yemyet, about 17 miles west of Pakokku, near Pindaung, west of Pauk, and at several places in the Yaw country; but the out-turn\nis insignificant. Sandstone is quarried at Taungu near the Shinmadaung, and steatite in the neighbourhood of Saw. The former yields a royalty of Rs. 1,000 to Government annually. Sandstone from the Taungu quarries is found all over Pakokku, and in many adjacent Districts, in the form of paving-stones, well-copings, pagoda ornaments, troughs, and the like. There are steatite or soapstone quarries on the Kadin stream about 6 miles west of Saw. They are difficult of access and are now being worked by a native of India. Near Myaing are traces of old iron-workings, but the ore is not judged worth extracting now. Iron used to be mined at Tonbo near Chaungzongyi in the Myaing township, and also at Tonbo in the Wethet circle of the Tilin township; and an attempt has been made to revive the iron industry at the latter place, but without success. Gold-washing on a small scale was carried on up to the time of annexation in the Bahon stream at Chaungzongyi in the north of the District.\n\nThe principal handicrafts are boat-building at Pakokku, and cart-building at Myotha in the Myaing township. The boat-building industry is very extensive, and supplies the wants of a good many of the Irrawaddy population. Myotha furnishes carts to the whole of Pakokku, as well as to adjacent areas. Hand rice-mills and brass-work are turned out at Pakokku town, and cotton- and silk-weaving is carried on to some extent in various parts of the District. The silk industry is mainly in the hands of the Taungthas and Chins of the Gangaw subdivision, but is not profitable, as the silk turned out is coarse and inferior in quality to that imported from Mandalay. The dyeing and weaving of the well-known Yaw waistcloths is, however, carried to the length of a fine art, for which the people in those parts of the District are famous all over Burma. Silk as well as cotton enters into the composition of these garments. The dark-blue dye that forms one of their chief characteristics is prepared from a plant of the indigo species which is cultivated locally. The principal products of the brass-workers of Pakokku are small bells and lime-boxes, made of different alloys of brass variously arranged. When ready for the final process they are placed in a heated earthen vessel underground, when the colour of the various alloys becomes changed, apparently by oxidization, the result being a neat inlaid pattern. Similar work is also produced in alloys of gold or silver; but there is no ready market for it, and the workers cannot afford to sink capital in unsold goods. Pottery and wood-carving are carried on at Pakokku town, but not to any great extent. A good deal of mat-weaving is done, but only for local use. The jaggery industry is an important one. Jaggery sugar is manufactured by boiling down the\nunfermented juice of the toddy-palms, which abound in the drier areas. The male trees are the first to be tapped, in February and March. In May the female trees begin to fruit and their sap is then drawn off. There is an oil refinery at Yenangyat, worked by the Burma Oil Company, and another at Kywede village in the Pakokku township, owned by a Burman.\n\nAll the trade of the Yaw country and a good deal of that of the Chindwin valley passes through Pakokku. The principal exports are timber, hides, petroleum, cutch, yawpet (the leaves or covering of the maize cob), and jaggery. Timber, petroleum, and hides are sent to Rangoon for exportation; cutch and yawpet to Lower Burma for consumption. The principal imports are cleaned rice, ngapi, and salted fish from Lower Burma, and foreign salt from Rangoon. The centre of trade is Pakokku town, whence goods are shipped by the Irrawaddy Flotilla steamers or distributed overland through the District. A certain amount of bartering goes on between the Chins and the people of the plains, beeswax, honey, lac, and a kind of cane called wanwe being exchanged for salt, fowls, and Burmese cotton blankets.\n\nThere are no railway lines. The chief roads maintained from Provincial funds are: the Pakokku-Kan road, 166\u00bd miles; the Saw-Zigat road (Saw to Kawton), 43 miles; the Haka-Kan road (from Yeshin camp to Kan), 11\u00bd miles; the Saw-Kyetchedaung mule track, 19 miles; the Pauk-Yawdwin road, 53 miles; the Pakokku-Myaing road (via Kaing), 26 miles; the Pakokku-Yesagyo road, 26 miles; and the Mindat-Sakan Kanpetlet mule track, 32 miles. Those maintained from the District fund include the Kanhla-Myitche road, 14 miles; the Pakokku-Lingadaw road, 27 miles; the Myaing-Lingadaw road, 18 miles; the Yesagyo-Lingadaw road, 17 miles; and the Wadin-Sinzein road, 25 miles. All these are unmetalled, but bridged and drained. The Irrawaddy, the Chindwin, and the Myittha are all navigable waterways. The Myittha is navigable by country boats during the greater part of the year, from the Chindwin river up to Minywa a little south of Gangaw, and occasionally boats go still farther on into the Maw stream up to a village called Kinban. The distance from Kalewa (at the mouth of the Myittha in the Upper Chindwin District) to Minywa is about 180 miles by river, and from Minywa to Kinban about 15 miles. The steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company ply regularly on the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin. The express boats call at Pakokku town twice a week, and a steam ferry runs daily between Pakokku and Myingyan. The Chindwin steamers leave Pakokku for Kindat weekly, and for Monywa twice a week.\n\nThough the eastern half of the District is a typical stretch of dry\nzone country, there is no record of the occurrence of any serious famine. Scarcity has sometimes been experienced; indeed, when regard is had to the nature of the rainfall in the eastern tracts an occasional failure of crops owing to drought is inevitable, but any distress in the past it has been found possible to meet by means of a remission of taxation.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into three subdivisions: Pakokku, comprising the Pakokku, Yesagyo, and Myaing townships; Pauk, comprising the Pauk, Saw, and Seikpyu townships; and Gangaw, comprising the Gangaw and Tilin townships. The head-quarters staff is of the usual type. The Public Works division, with head-quarters at Pakokku, includes the Pakokku Chin Hills, there being two subdivisions within the District, Pakokku and Pauk. The Yaw Forest division, with head-quarters at Pakokku, also includes the Pakokku Chin Hills. An assistant commandant of military police is stationed at Pakokku.\n\nThe treasury officer, Pakokku, is also additional judge of the Pakokku township court, but there are no specially appointed judicial officers; the District officers\u2014Deputy-Commissioner and subdivisional and township officers\u2014perform judicial in addition to executive duties. The crime of the District presents no special features.\n\nThe revenue of Pakokku under Burmese rule consisted almost entirely of *thathameda*. Royal lands, it is true, sometimes paid rent, but little of it ever reached the royal coffers at Mandalay. The revenue now levied on state land is assessed at a share of the value of the produce of different kinds of crops\u2014rice at one-fifth and *jowar* at one-eighth. On *kyun* (or island) crops acre rates are levied, varying from Rs. 2 an acre on peas, *jowar*, maize, rice, and sesamum, to Rs. 7 an acre on sweet potatoes and onions. Variations in the land revenue receipts are brought about by the appearance and disappearance of islands in the Irrawaddy. There are a considerable number of *wuttugan* lands, i.e. lands dedicated in Burmese times to pagodas, the revenue of which is devoted to the upkeep of the shrines; and of *thugyisa* lands, or lands held by the village headmen rent-free during their term of office. Regular settlement operations are now in progress.\n\nThe growth of the revenue since 1890-1 can be gathered from the following table, which gives figures in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 77     | 1,62   | 1,29   |\n| Total revenue  | 7,38   | 10,69  | 12,30  |\n\nThe main source of revenue is *thathameda*, the demand for which\nin 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 7,24,000, a figure a good deal higher than for any other District in Upper Burma.\n\nThe only municipality is that of Pakokku, constituted in 1887. Yesagyo used to be a municipality, but the board was dissolved in 1892-3. The District fund is administered by the Deputy-Commissioner. In 1903-4 its income, derived from various local receipts, amounted to Rs. 15,000, the main item of expenditure being public works (Rs. 10,000).\n\nUnder the District Superintendent are an Assistant Superintendent and two inspectors in charge of the police in the three subdivisions. There are 11 police stations and 17 outposts; and the sanctioned strength of officers and men is 407, including 4 inspectors, 1 chief head constable, 12 head constables, 31 sergeants, and 357 constables of all grades. The military police belong to the Magwe battalion. Their strength is 150 rank and file, distributed in the three subdivisional head-quarters. They are officered by an assistant commandant, one s\u016bbahd\u0101r, and three jemad\u0101rs at head-quarters, and one jemad\u0101r at Pauk and Gangaw respectively.\n\nThe District jail at Pakokku has accommodation for 52 convicts and 20 under-trial prisoners. The only remunerative industry carried on is wheat-grinding for the military police. No carpentry or any other kind of industry is undertaken, and when there is no wheat-grinding the prisoners have comparatively little work to do; some are, however, employed in gardening. English and native vegetables are grown for the consumption of the prisoners, and some are sold in the local market to the public.\n\nThe proportion of literate persons in 1901 was 23.3 per cent. (46.8 males and 2.3 females). The number of pupils has risen from 1,949 in 1891 to 13,426 in 1901. In 1904 the District contained 8 secondary, 126 primary, and 737 elementary (private) schools, with an attendance of 11,818 (including 751 girls). The educational expenditure in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 24,100, Provincial funds contributing Rs. 21,000 and municipal funds Rs. 600, the balance of Rs. 2,500 being met from fees and subscriptions.\n\nThere are four civil hospitals, with accommodation for 73 in-patients; and 14,917 cases, including 687 in-patients, were treated at these institutions in 1903, while 425 operations were performed. The combined income of the hospitals amounted in that year to Rs. 12,500, towards which Provincial funds contributed Rs. 6,300, municipal funds Rs. 3,700, and the District fund Rs. 1,500. Besides these, a military police hospital at Pakokku town contains 64 beds, and costs about Rs. 500 per annum.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the Pakokku municipality. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 7,602, representing 21 per 1,000 of population.\nPakokku Subdivision.\u2014Eastern subdivision of Pakokku District, Upper Burma, comprising the Pakokku, Yesagyo, and Myaing townships.\n\nPakokku Township.\u2014Township of Pakokku District, Upper Burma, lying between $20^\\circ 55'$ and $21^\\circ 28'$ N. and $94^\\circ 43'$ and $95^\\circ 11'$ E., along the right bank of the Irrawaddy, with an area of 386 square miles. The population was 71,106 in 1891, and 68,344 in 1901, distributed in one town, Pakokku (population, 19,456), the head-quarters, and 223 villages. Along the river bank the country is flat; inland it is undulating. The rainfall is very meagre, but the population is fairly dense. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 124 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 1,85,000.\n\nPakokku Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District of the same name in Upper Burma, situated in $21^\\circ 20'$ N. and $95^\\circ 5'$ E., on the right bank of the Irrawaddy, a few miles below the point where the Chindwin runs into that river. It is a long straggling town of no great width, never extending more than three-quarters of a mile away from the stream, and thickly dotted with tamarind-trees. It is built on an alluvial bed, and there is a tradition that the river channel once ran where the town now stands. The eastern boundary of the urban area is a wide sandy nullah crossed by a bridge leading to a fine stretch of country, considerably higher than the native town, on which stands the civil station, with the courthouse, jail, and officers' residences. Two or three miles to the west of the town, along the river, the country lies low; and when the river is in flood the whole of this tract is inundated, the subsiding floods leaving extensive jhilis.\n\nThe history of the town dates from 1885, when the large sandbank which had till then cut it off from the river disappeared. In 1885-6 it was garrisoned by a company of native infantry in a stockade to the north, supported by two civil police outposts; and this force was greatly augmented during the disturbances of 1887, but was withdrawn when the country became quiet. The population of Pakokku in 1889 was estimated at from 5,000 to 8,000, but had increased to 19,972 in 1891, dropping slightly to 19,456 in 1901. It is thus, after Mandalay, the largest town in Upper Burma. The majority of the population are Burmans, but there are nearly 800 natives of India.\n\nPakokku is the great boat-building centre of Upper Burma. Most of the large cargo boats carrying rice to Lower Burma are built here. Till recently old-fashioned Burman designs have been adhered to; a new style of boat, called a tonkin, is now, however, being constructed by the local builders, resembling the ordinary cargo boat, but decked over and level keeled. It is used in the tidal creeks of Lower Burma. The principal local industries are silk-weaving, wood-carving, sesamum-oil pressing, and silver-work; and jaggery sugar is made from the\ntoddy-palms which abound in the District. Pakokku is the chief market for the Yaw and Chindwin trade, the imports consisting mainly of jaggery, hides, cutch, teak, and bamboos. The town is a regular port of call for the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company's steamers. The mail-boats leave for up-river stations as far as Mandalay and down-river stations as far as Rangoon twice a week, and for the Chindwin stations once a week. An additional service of two steamers a week plies to Monywa, and a daily launch goes to and from Myingyan.\n\nPakokku was constituted a municipality in 1887. The municipal receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged between Rs. 38,000 and Rs. 30,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 46,000, the principal sources of receipt being bazar rents (Rs. 20,000) and house tax (Rs. 11,100). The expenditure amounted to Rs. 48,000, the chief items being conservancy (Rs. 11,000) and roads (Rs. 7,000). The water-supply is obtained from the river and from wells. The municipality maintains 11 miles of metalled, and 8 miles of unmetalled roads. There is no municipal school, but the municipality gives Rs. 600 a year to the Wesleyan Anglo-veracular school in the town, and also supports a hospital.\n\nP\u0101kpattan Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Montgomery District, Punjab, lying between 29\u00b0 58' and 30\u00b0 38' N. and 72\u00b0 37' and 73\u00b0 37' E., with an area of 1,339 square miles. It is bounded on the south-east by the Sutlej. The population in 1901 was 121,776, compared with 111,971 in 1891. It contains one town, P\u0101kpattan (population, 6,192), the head-quarters, and 354 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 2,06,000. The tahsil lies wholly in the lowlands which stretch from the southern edge of the central plateau of the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b to the right bank of the Sutlej. The western half, except for a narrow strip along the river, is a vast waste. The eastern half is more fully cultivated, owing to the irrigation from the Kh\u0101nw\u0101h and Soh\u0101g and P\u0101ra canals.\n\nP\u0101kpattan Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Montgomery District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 21' N. and 73\u00b0 24' E., 29 miles south-east of Montgomery station on the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 6,192. P\u0101kpattan is the ancient Ajodhan, which probably derived its name from the Yaudheya tribe (the modern Johiyas). From a very early date it was a place of importance, as the principal ferry across the Sutlej and the meeting-place of the great western roads from Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n. The fort is said to have been captured by Sabuktagin in 977-8 and by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ghaznivid in 1079-80. The town owes its sanctity and modern name, 'the holy ferry,' to the shrine of the great Muhamadan saint Shaikh-ul-Isl\u0101m, Far\u012bd-ul-Hakkwa-ud-D\u012bn, Shakar Ganj (1173-1265), which was visited by Ibn Bat\u016bta (1334). The town was besieged\nby Shaikha, the Khokhar, in 1394, and in 1398 was visited by T\u012bm\u016br, who spared such of the inhabitants as had not fled, out of respect for the shrine of the saint. It was the scene of two of Khizr Kh\u0101n's victories over generals of the Delhi court (1401 and 1405). The shrine of B\u0101ba Far\u012bd attracts crowds of worshippers, its sanctity being acknowledged as far as Afghanistan and Central Asia. The principal festival is at the Muharram.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1867. During the ten years ending 1902\u20133 the income averaged Rs. 7,200, and the expenditure Rs. 7,000. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 8,400, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 7,300. P\u0101kpattan is a town of some commercial importance, importing wheat, cotton, oilseeds, and pulses from the surrounding villages, gur and refined sugar from Amritsar, Jullundur, and the United Provinces, piece-goods from Amritsar, Delhi, and Kar\u0101chi, and fruits from Afghanistan. The exports consist principally of cotton, wheat, and oilseeds. The town has a local manufacture of silk lungis and lacquer-work. It contains a vernacular middle school and a dispensary. From 1849 to 1852 it was the head-quarters of the District.\n\nP\u0101l State.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nP\u0101l Village (originally called R\u0101j\u0101pur).\u2014Village in the Kar\u0101d t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, lying on both banks of the T\u0101rli in 17\u00b0 29\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 2\u2032 E., about 20 miles north-west of Kar\u0101d town. Population (1901), 3,157. It is chiefly remarkable for a temple of Khandoba, where a fair attended by about 50,000 people of all classes is held every year. The temple, which was built in the fifteenth century, stands on the site of a legendary appearance by the god Khandoba to a favourite devotee, a milkmaid named P\u0101lai, in whose honour the village name was changed from R\u0101j\u0101pur to P\u0101l. The number of prominent historical families in the Deccan who have bestowed gifts on this temple shows the great veneration in which it is held. Every pilgrim entering the temple at the fair time has to pay a toll of \u00bc anna. The priests are Guravs and Br\u0101hmans, and connected with the temple are many Murlis or female devotees. The great fair is held in the month of Paush or December\u2013January. The pilgrims usually camp in the bed of the T\u0101rli, which at this time forms a large dry beach. The fair proper lasts three or four days, being the days during which the marriage ceremony of the god Khandoba is supposed to take place. Under Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule P\u0101l was a market town of some note on the main road from S\u0101t\u0101ra to Kar\u0101d. P\u0101l village and temple are closely connected with a celebrated exploit of Chitursing in February, 1799, in revenge for the defeat of his brother S\u0101h\u016b II., the S\u0101t\u0101ra R\u0101j\u0101. After worshipping at the temple with his small force of 600 infantry, he attacked R\u0101stia, who was encamped near S\u0101t\u0101ra with a body of 2,000 or 3,000 men, and dispersed them.\nP\u0101lakollu.\u2014Town in the Narasapur t\u0101luk of Kistna District, Madras, situated in 16\u00b0 31' N. and 81\u00b0 44' E., on the Narasapur canal, 6 miles from Narasapur town and 29 from Nidadavolu, the nearest railway station. Population (1901), 10,848. The Dutch opened a factory here in the middle of the seventeenth century, and for some time it was the head-quarters of their establishments on this part of the coast. It fell to the English in 1783, but the Dutch remained in possession on payment of a small quit-rent till 1804. The place was restored to Holland by the convention of 1814, but was finally ceded to the British in 1825. The most interesting relic of the Dutch occupation is the little cemetery in the heart of the town, which contains inscriptions dating back to 1662. The cultivation of the Batavian orange and pummelo, introduced by the Dutch settlers, is still a feature of the place. P\u0101lakollu is a flourishing town and the chief market of the Western Delta of the Godavari, the trade being chiefly in fruit, rice, and cotton yarn. Local affairs are managed by a Union panchayat.\n\nPal\u0101li.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nP\u0101lam.\u2014\u2018Crown\u2019 t\u0101luk in the south of Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 560 square miles. Including j\u0101g\u012brs, the population in 1901 was 92,182, compared with 104,904 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, Gang\u0101kher (population, 5,007) and Sonepet (5,759), both being j\u0101g\u012br towns; and 153 villages, of which 32 are j\u0101g\u012br, and P\u0101lam (3,306) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 3\u00b72 lakhs. The God\u0101vari river forms the northern boundary.\n\nPal\u0101mau (\u2018a place of refuge\u2019).\u2014District in the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Division of Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 20' and 24\u00b0 39' N. and 83\u00b0 20' and 84\u00b0 58' E., with an area of 4,914 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d and Gay\u0101; on the east by Gay\u0101, Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, and R\u0101nch\u012b; on the south by R\u0101nch\u012b and the State of Surguj\u0101; and on the west by Surguj\u0101 and the Mirz\u0101pur District of the United Provinces.\n\nThe District consists of a confused aggregation of hills, offshoots from the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, and of the valleys between them. The hills run in the main east and west, though many are at right angles to the general trend. They are highest in the south, where they adjoin the Surguj\u0101 plateau, and gradually decrease in size towards the north.\n\nThe District comprises four distinct tracts, which are roughly conterminous with the four old fiscal divisions or parganas. By far the largest is pargana Pal\u0101mau, which forms the greater portion of the District, consisting of jungle-clad hills and fertile but narrow valleys. Pargana Tor\u012b is an undulating but in many places highly cultivated tract, with a few large isolated hills; until recently it formed part of the head-quarters subdivision of R\u0101nch\u012b District, and its tenures,\npeople, and customs are quite distinct from those of Pal\u0101mau. *Par-\ngana* Belaunj\u0101 in its southern portion closely resembles Pal\u0101mau, but\ntowards the north it sinks into an extremely fertile valley into which\nthe Son yearly overspills. *Pargana* Japl\u0101, in the extreme north of the\nDistrict, is a tract almost devoid of hills and very similar to the alluvial\nportion of the District of Gay\u0101. The Son flows along the northern\nborder, but the most important river is the Koel. This rises in Barwe\nin R\u0101nch\u012b District, and after flowing nearly due west for about 24 miles,\nturns northwards, passing through the centre of Pal\u0101mau, and joins\nthe Son not far from the old fort of Roht\u0101sgarh; its chief affluents\nare the Aurang\u0101 and Am\u0101nat. The Kanhar flows in a north-westerly\ndirection along the Surguj\u0101 boundary, and eventually joins the Son in\nMirz\u0101pur District.\n\nThe characteristic formation of Pal\u0101mau is gneiss, of which all the\nmore important hill ranges are composed. It is of extremely varied\nconstitution, including granitic gneisses, mica schists, magnetite schists,\nhuge beds of crystalline limestone, &c. Along the north-west boundary\nof the District is the eastern termination of a large outcrop of Bij\u0101war\nslates, which extends westward for nearly 200 miles through Mirz\u0101pur\nand Rewah. The Lower Vindhyans, which rest unconformably upon\nthe Bij\u0101wars, are found along the valley of the Son, where representa-\ntives of the Garhbandh, porcellanic, and Khinjua groups are found;\nthe first mentioned contains two subdivisions, a lower one consisting\nof conglomerates, shales, limestones, sandstones, and porcellanites, and\nan upper band of compact limestone of 200 or 300 feet in thickness.\nThe rocks of the porcellanic group, which overlies the Garhbandh, are\nindurated, highly siliceous volcanic ashes; their thickness increases as\nthey approach the former centres of volcanic activity in the neighbour-\nhood of Kutumb\u0101, Nabinagar, and Japl\u0101. The shales and limestones\nof the Khinjua group are mostly concealed by alluvium along the banks\nof the Son. As the Vindhyans are unfossiliferous, their geological\nage cannot be exactly determined, but there is reason to think that\nthey may be as old as Cambrian.\n\nThe next formation, the Gondw\u0101na, contains numerous fossil plants,\nwhich determine its age partly as upper palaeozoic and partly as\nmesozoic. It is of great economic importance on account of the coal\nand iron ore which it contains. It comprises in Pal\u0101mau the Mah\u0101-\ndeva, P\u0101nchet, R\u0101niganj, Bar\u0101kar, and T\u0101lcher divisions. The rocks\nof this formation generally weather into low undulating ground, but\nthose of the Mah\u0101deva group rise into lofty hills. The coal-seams\nare restricted to the Bar\u0101kar and R\u0101niganj groups, which consist of\nalternating layers of shale and sandstone; the workable seams are\nfound chiefly in the Bar\u0101kar. The P\u0101nchet and Mah\u0101deva groups\nconsist principally of sandstones, and the T\u0101lcher mostly of shales;\nthe T\u00e1lchers, which are the oldest Gondw\u0101na rocks, contain at their base a conglomerate, consisting of large boulders embedded in clay, which is supposed to be of glacial origin. The Aurang\u0101, Hutar, and Daltonganj coal-fields are situated entirely in Pal\u0101mau, which also contains the western extremity of the large Karanpur\u0101 field. The boundaries of the coal-fields are usually faults, whose position is indicated by lines of siliceous breccia, and hot sulphurous springs are frequent along them. The best coal is that in the Daltonganj field.\n\nNear the southern edge of the District, the lofty flat-topped hills known as p\u0101ts are capped by great masses of laterite, resulting from the decomposition of basaltic beds of the Deccan trap formation. The largest of these is the vast Neturh\u0101t plateau west of the Koel river. A few intrusive dikes of the same formation occur in the Daltonganj and Hutar coal-fields.\n\nAlong the Son, especially below its confluence with the Koel, the rocks are concealed by deep alluvium, which merges into the alluvial formation of the Gangetic plain. Alluvial soil is scattered over many other parts of the District, and nearly everywhere contains in great abundance the calcareous concretions known as kankar\u00b9.\n\nThe rice-fields and their margins abound in marsh and water plants. The surface of the plateau land between the valleys, where level, is often bare and rocky; but where undulating, is usually clothed with a dense scrub jungle, in which Dendrocalamus strictus is prominent. The steeper slopes are covered with a dense forest mixed with many climbers. S\u0101l (Shorea robusta) is gregarious; among the other noteworthy trees are species of Buchanania, Semecarpus, Terminalia, Cedrela, Cassia, Butea, Bauhinia, Acacia, and Adina, which these forests share with the similar forests on the lower Him\u0101layan slopes. Mixed with them, however, are a number of characteristically Central India trees and shrubs, such as Cochlospermum, Soymida, Boswellia, Hardwickia, and Bussia, which do not cross the Gangetic plain. One of the features of the flowering trees is the wealth of scarlet blossom in the hot season produced by the abundance of Butea frondosa and B. superba.\n\nThe chief wild animals to be met with are tigers, bison, leopards, black bears, s\u0101mbar, chitra (spotted deer), chink\u0101r\u0101, four-horned deer, barking-deer, nilgai, antelope, and wild dogs. The Government \u2018reserved\u2019 forests form a shelter for game; and though tigers have\n\n\u00b9 Detailed descriptions of the Geology of Pal\u0101mau have been published in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey: the Hutar and Aurang\u0101 coal-fields, the gneiss, and the iron ores have been described by V. Ball, in vol. xv. part i; the Daltonganj coal-field by Th. Hughes in vol. viii, part ii; the Karanpur\u0101 coal-field by Th. Hughes in vol. vii, part iii; the Lower Vindhya generally by F. Mallet, vol. vii, part i; and the volcanic rocks of that series by E. Vredenburg, vol. xxxi, part i.\nprobably diminished in number of late years, bison and deer have considerably increased, in spite of the ravages committed by wild dogs.\n\nPal\u0101mau enjoys a moderate temperature, except during the hot months of April, May, and June, when the westerly winds from Central India cause great heat, combined with very low humidity. The mean temperature increases from $74^\\circ$ in March to $86^\\circ$ and $94^\\circ$ in April and May, the mean maximum from $88^\\circ$ in March to $107^\\circ$ in May and the mean minimum temperature from $59^\\circ$ in March to $81^\\circ$ in June. During these months humidity is lower in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur than in any other part of Bengal, falling in this District to $57$ per cent. in March, $46$ per cent. in April, and $51$ per cent. in May. The mean temperature for the year is $77^\\circ$, falling to $61^\\circ$ during the cold season, when the minimum temperature is $47^\\circ$. The annual rainfall averages $49$ inches, of which $6\\frac{1}{2}$ inches fall in June, $14$ each in July and August, and $8$ in September.\n\nReliable history does not date back beyond $1603$, when the Raksel R\u0101jputs were driven out by the Cheros under Bhagwant Rai, who took advantage of the local R\u0101j\u0101\u2019s absence at a ceremony at Surguj\u0101 to raise the standard of revolt. The Chero dynasty lasted for nearly $200$ years, the most famous of the line being Medni Rai surnamed \u2018the just,\u2019 who ruled from $1659$ to $1672$ and extended his R\u0101j into Gay\u0101, Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, and Surguj\u0101. The erection at Pal\u0101mau of the older of the two forts which form the only places of historical interest in the District is ascribed to him; the other, which was never completed, was begun by his son. These R\u0101j\u0101s apparently ruled as independent princes till between $1640$ and $1660$, when the Muhammadans made several attacks on them and forced them to pay tribute. In the latter year occurred the attack on Pal\u0101mau fort and its capture by Daud Kh\u0101n, which forms the subject of a large picture ($30$ feet by $12$) preserved by Daud\u2019s descendants and described in detail by Colonel Dalton in the *Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal*, $1874$. In $1722$ the ruling R\u0101j\u0101, Ranjit Rai, was murdered, and Jay Kishan Rai, descended from the younger son of a former R\u0101j\u0101, was placed upon the throne. A few years afterwards Jay Kishan was shot in a skirmish, and his family fled to Megr\u0101 in Bih\u0101r. Here they took refuge with one Udwant R\u0101m, a k\u0101nungo, who in $1770$ took Gop\u0101l Rai, grandson of the murdered R\u0101j\u0101, to Patna and presented him to Captain Camac, the Government Agent, as the rightful heir to the Pal\u0101mau R\u0101j. Captain Camac promised the assistance of the British Government and, after defeating the troops of the ruling R\u0101j\u0101, gave a sanad for five years to Gop\u0101l Rai and two of his cousins. From this time Pal\u0101mau was included in the British District of R\u0101mgarh. A year or two later, Gop\u0101l Rai was sentenced to imprisonment for being concerned in the murder of the k\u0101nungo who had helped him to power.\nHe died at Patna in 1784, and in the same year died Basant Rai, who had succeeded to the gaddi on his imprisonment. Chur\u0101man Rai succeeded; but by 1813 he had become insolvent, and Pal\u0101mau was sold for arrears of revenue and bought in by Government for the amount due. Three years later old disturbances between the Kharw\u0101rs and Cheros were renewed, and Pal\u0101mau was given to the Deo family in Gay\u0101 as a reward for their services in helping to quell them. Their r\u00e9gime, however, was unpopular, and in a year the country was in open rebellion. So Government was again forced to take up the management of the estate, giving the Deo family as compensation a reduction of Rs. 3,000 in the Bih\u0101r revenue payable on their estates in Bih\u0101r. In 1832 the Kharw\u0101rs and Cheros again broke out in rebellion, but this rising was soon put down. There were no further troubles until the Mutiny of 1857, when the Kharw\u0101rs rose against their R\u0101jput landlords; and the mutineers of the R\u0101mgarh Battalion, taking refuge in Pal\u0101mau, made common cause with Nil\u0101mbar and Pit\u0101mbar Singh, two malcontent landholders. The 26th Madras Native Infantry and a portion of the R\u0101mgarh Battalion which had remained loyal defeated the insurgents at the Pal\u0101mau forts. Nil\u0101mbar and Pit\u0101mbar Singh were taken prisoners and hanged. In 1834 Pal\u0101mau was included in the District of Loh\u0101rdag\u0101 (now R\u0101nch\u012b), and was only formed into a separate District in 1892.\n\nThe population of the present area increased from 423,795 in 1872 to 551,075 in 1881, to 596,770 in 1891, and to 619,600 in 1901. The striking increase between 1872 and 1881 is attributable partly to the greater accuracy of enumeration in 1881, and partly to the impetus given to enlightened management of estates, and consequently to the extension of cultivation, which followed the settlement of the Government estates made in 1869\u201370. The northern part of the District is healthy, but not the southern portion. The population is contained in 3,184 villages and two towns, Daltonganj, the head-quarters, and Garw\u0101. The District is very sparsely inhabited, the number of persons per square mile being only 126. The density is greatest in the alluvial valleys along the course of the north Koel and Am\u0101nat rivers and on the right bank of the Son. Elsewhere, and especially in the south and west, the country is wild and inhospitable, and is inhabited mainly by forest tribes, who eke out their precarious crops of oilseeds, maize, and cotton with the blossoms of the mahu\u0101 tree and other products of the jungle. There is some emigration to Assam. Only 7,000 persons enumerated there in 1901 were entered as natives of Pal\u0101mau: but it is believed that, owing to the recent creation of the District, many of the Pal\u0101mau emigrants returned their birthplace as Loh\u0101rdag\u0101, and were therefore assigned to the category of those born in R\u0101nch\u012b. All but about 6 per cent. of the\npopulation speak Hindi, in most cases a patois of the Bhojpuri dialect known as Nagpuri, which has borrowed some of its grammatical forms from Chhattisgarhi; 3.5 per cent. speak Oraon, a language of the Dravidian family; and 2.7 per cent. speak dialects of the Mund\u0101 family, chiefly Mund\u0101ri, Birjia, and Korw\u0101. Of the total, 86 per cent. are Hindus, 8.4 per cent. Muhammadans, and 4.2 Animists. Those returned as Hindu include large numbers of semi-Hinduized aborigines.\n\nThe largest tribes and castes are Bhuiy\u0101s (73,000), Kharw\u0101rs (42,000), and Ahirs: among other Dravidian tribes distinctive of this neighbourhood may be mentioned the Bhogt\u0101s, Korw\u0101s, Nagesias, and Parhaiy\u0101s. The Cheros were at one time a dominant race in South Bihar; they are known in Pal\u0101mau District as 'the 12,000,' it being popularly asserted that at the beginning of their rule in Pal\u0101mau they numbered 12,000 families. Agriculture supports 72 per cent. of the population, industries 11.7 per cent., and the professions 0.8 per cent.\n\nChristians number 7,908, of whom 7,897 are natives. Nearly all reside in the Mahu\u0101d\u0101nd th\u0101na, where a Roman Catholic mission is at work and has built a church and a school.\n\nThe rabi and bhadoi crops, especially the former, are very precarious, owing to the lightness and uncertainty of the rainfall, and the rapidity with which all water runs off to the main streams. The rice crop is even more precarious, except where means of storing up water to irrigate the fields have been provided. A few of the more enlightened zamind\u0101rs have done a great deal to this end, by throwing embankments across the natural slope of the country and diverting small streams to fill these rude reservoirs; much has also been done by Government in the estates under its direct management. Rice lands have all to be laboriously constructed by terracing off favourable hollows or filling up the beds of streams with the earth from their banks. For agricultural purposes the District consists broadly of two interlacing zones. The first consists of the valleys of the Am\u0101nat, the Koel, and the Son, and contains stretches of fertile clay covered with rice, sugar-cane, and various rabi crops. The second comprises the hilly areas which are generally covered with a thin loose gravelly soil; and the population is chiefly dependent for its sustenance on the bhadoi crops. The most fertile soil is a black friable clay known as keval, found in abundance in the valleys and also, though without any great depth, in the uplands. It is very retentive of moisture and produces good crops of rice, wheat, and barley: in many cases khes\u0101ri (Lathyrus sativus) is grown on it after the rice has been harvested.\n\nIn 1903-4 the cultivated area was estimated at 577 square miles, current fallows at 588 square miles, and other cultivable waste at\n1,072 square miles. Rice, which is the staple crop in the valleys, is grown on 238 square miles, the winter crop being the most important; maize covers 55 square miles; while other cereals, including marua, gram, barley, wheat, millets such as kodon, s\u0101wan, and gondli, and pulses, chiefly rahar and khes\u0101ri, cover an area of 335 square miles. The chief miscellaneous crops are sugar-cane, oilseeds, cotton, and poppy.\n\nCultivation is extending fast, and it is estimated that in the Government estates the increase amounted to 9 per cent. in the seven years ending 1903. In private estates the further spread of cultivation depends on the degree to which the individual landlords attend to the wants of their ryots in the matter of irrigation. Spasmodic attempts have been made to improve the quality of crops by the selection of seed, but greater success has attended the introduction of new varieties; and sugar-cane, chillies, linseed, potatoes, and gram are being grown more extensively than they were a few years ago. No use was made of the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts till 1896, but in the six following years Rs. 1,40,000 was advanced, most of which has been repaid. In 1902-3 the operations were further extended, Government advancing Rs. 20,000 to zam\u012bnd\u0101rs under the former and Rs. 38,000 to tenants under the latter Act.\n\nThe cattle are poor; they are grazed in the jungles, and in the hot months large numbers are sent to the high lands in the south and south-west and to the Surguj\u0101 State, where pasture is abundant.\n\nIrrigation is mainly confined to the construction of reservoirs or b\u0101ndhs, the more useful and valuable of which are filled by the waters of diverted streams. Great skill is often shown in planning and carrying out these schemes, and water is frequently carried by means of rude channels and raised embankments for a distance of 6 or 7 miles. These works are extraordinarily remunerative, and seldom yield a profit of less than 20 to 25 per cent. It is estimated that half the area under rice is irrigated in this manner; practically the only other crops irrigated are sugar-cane, poppy, chillies, and garden produce.\n\nThe District contains 260 square miles of forest, of which 188 square miles are 'reserved' forest under the management of the Forest department, and the remainder are 'protected' forests under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner. The latter comprise the surplus area left in each Government village after allotting to the tenants for extending cultivation twice as much waste as there is cultivated land. The 'reserved' forests lie chiefly in the south of the District, the Barasand, the largest block, extending over 89 square miles to the south of the Koel river. The most valuable tree is the s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), which grows best in the more fertile soil along the foot of the hills. It is here found in places almost pure;\nhigher up mixed species become more abundant, and on the sides and tops of the hills, where the soil is poorer, s\u0101l ceases to exist. Other valuable trees are satin-wood (*Chloroxylon Swietenia*), ebony (*Diospyros melanoxylon*), and black-wood (*Dalbergia latifolia*), which are found in the mixed forest above the s\u0101l, but not in sufficiently large size to ensure a steady revenue. The majority of the forests are remote from the railway, and revenue is at present chiefly derived from bamboos, which are generally sold at Rs. 2 per 1,000. Other minor products of limited importance are *sabai* grass (*Ischaemum angustifolium*), lac, and the fruit of the *mahua* tree; gum kino is being experimentally extracted from the *Pterocarpus Marsupium* for use in dyeing and tanning. The receipts from the 'reserved' forests in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 5,000. There are extensive private forests, but these are as a rule less valuable than those belonging to Government, the landlords having only lately begun to preserve them. Plantations of *mahua*, teak, mahogany, *kusum*, and *divi-divi* plants have been made, but have not as yet gone beyond the experimental stage.\n\nThe most important coal-field is that of Daltonganj, where the coal-bearing rocks in the valley of the North Koel river extend over an area of about 30 square miles, and the coal contains a good proportion of carbon. The Aurang\u0101 field has an area of 97 square miles and contains numerous coal-seams, some of large size, but the quality of the coal is indifferent. The Hutar field, which lies to the west of the Aurang\u0101, has an area of about 79 square miles; the coal is somewhat inferior to that of Daltonganj. The B\u0101ran-Daltonganj branch of the East Indian Railway now taps the Daltonganj field, and has brought the coal within reach of Cawnpore and other large manufacturing centres in the United Provinces. Mines were opened in 1902 at R\u0101jhara and Singr\u0101; the former mine was first worked in 1857, but it had been closed owing to difficulties of transport. The coal is worked by means of pits and inclined planes; the output in 1903 was 34,000 tons and on the average 1,200 hands were employed; the labourers are for the most part Cheros and other local men. An immense quantity of iron ore is found all over the District, especially in the neighbourhood of the coal-fields. It is of three kinds: magnetite occurring in the gneiss, siderite with brown and red hematite in the Gondw\u0101na, and red and brown hematite in the laterite. The ores from the Gondw\u0101na are the most valuable. At present they are worked only to a small extent by some of the jungle tribes, and the out-turn is barely enough to satisfy local requirements. Limestone, sandstone, laterite, and graphite also exist, but difficulties of transport have hitherto prevented their being utilized. Copper has been found, but not in sufficient quantities to be worked profitably.\nArts and manufactures exist only in the most primitive form; and artisans do no more than supply the local demand for cotton cloth, brass utensils, silver and lac ornaments of the rudest kind, blankets, tat cloths for pack-bullock bags, rude country guns which sell at R. 1 for each span length of the barrel, and steel and iron for the manufacture of ploughs and t\u0101ngis, a rude kind of axe. Gh\u012b is made, tasar silkworms are reared, and lac is produced for export.\n\nThe chief exports are hides, lac, gh\u012b, oilseeds, bamboos, catechu, and coal; and the chief imports are European piece-goods, salt, brass-ware, sugar, tobacco, kerosene oil, and rice; gh\u012b, mustard, and hides are brought in from Surguj\u0101. Except in the neighbourhood of the railway stations, where carts are used, the trade is carried by pack-bullocks. Most of the exports are sent in the first instance to Gay\u0101 or Dinapore. The chief trade centres are Garw\u0101, Daltonganj, Harihar-ganj, Husain\u0101b\u0101d, Pathr\u0101, and Chandw\u0101. Barter is a common form of trading and affords great opportunities for profit to the middleman.\n\nThe Daltonganj section of the East Indian Railway (opened in 1902) runs for 55 miles within the District. The District contains 322 miles of road (of which 26 are metalled), and 38 miles of village tracks. The principal lines are from Daltonganj to Gay\u0101 District via Harihar-ganj and Man\u0101tu, to R\u0101nchi, to the extreme south of the District through the Government forests, and to Mirz\u0101pur and Husain\u0101b\u0101d via the important market of Garw\u0101; a good road from Garw\u0101 in the direction of Surguj\u0101 is under construction. Quicksands in the Koel and its great breadth are extremely unfavourable to the development of the country west of that river.\n\nP\u0101lamau was visited by famine in 1897 and again in 1900. On the former occasion the number of workers relieved was 488,668 (in terms of one day) and on the latter 219,740; the numbers gratuitously relieved were 453,941 and 81,774 respectively. In 1897, 15,000 maunds of Burma rice were imported under a Government bounty of 8 annas per maund, and the leading zamind\u0101rs rendered loyal assistance in the relief of their tenantry. The total expenditure by Government was Rs. 1,19,000 in 1897 and Rs. 30,000 in 1900.\n\nThe subdivisional system has not yet been introduced; and the administration of the whole District is carried on from Daltonganj, where the staff consists of the Deputy-Commissioner and two Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors.\n\nThe principal civil and criminal court is that of the Judicial Commissioner of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, who is stationed at R\u0101nchi. The local criminal courts are those of the Deputy-Commissioner and the two Deputy-Magistrates. The Deputy-Commissioner has special powers\nunder section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and is also ex-officio Subordinate Judge of the District. A Munsif is stationed at Pal\u0101mau for the disposal of civil work. The crimes most characteristic of Pal\u0101mau are petty dacoities committed by the Korw\u0101s, a semi-savage tribe of the neighbouring Native State of Surguj\u0101, and the poisoning of cattle for the sake of their hides.\n\nIn 1773 the Pal\u0101mau pargana was settled with Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Gop\u0101l Rai for five years at a revenue of Rs. 5,000, rising to Rs. 12,000 in the third year. It was then settled for ten years at an annual revenue of Rs. 15,000. In 1812 the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, Chur\u0101man Rai, was in arrears to the extent of Rs. 55,000, and the pargana was put up to public auction and bought in by Government for the amount due, thus becoming a Government estate. From that period to 1839, with the exception of the period during which Pal\u0101mau was given over to the Deo R\u0101j\u0101s, the land revenue demand was sicca Rs. 25,000, of which Rs. 13,000 was payable by the j\u0101gird\u0101rs under the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 and Rs. 12,000 was assessed on the kh\u0101lsa villages under direct management. In 1839 the kh\u0101lsa villages were settled with the farmer for twenty years at Rs. 12,000, and the rent payable by the j\u0101gird\u0101rs was raised to Rs. 16,000. In 1859 the kh\u0101lsa villages were summarily settled for three years for Rs. 22,000, and in 1863 a thirty years\u2019 settlement was concluded with the farmer for Rs. 36,000. This arrangement continued till 1896, when a new settlement for fifteen years was made direct with the ryots. At the same time the j\u0101gird\u0101rs were recognized as holders of permanently settled estates, the sum they were then paying to Government as the representative of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Pal\u0101mau being fixed as the revenue payable in perpetuity. The current demand of land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,07,000, of which Rs. 27,000 was payable by 255 permanently settled estates, Rs. 1,400 by 4 temporarily settled estates, and the remainder by the Government estates. The incidence of land revenue is only 4 annas per cultivated acre; the average rental is Rs. 2-14-4, but the amount varies with the nature of the land cultivated, the means for irrigating it, and its situation in the District. The best rice land lets for Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 an acre in parts of the Garw\u0101 and Patun th\u0101nas; Rs. 6 in the Government estates; and Rs. 4 to Rs. 6 in the south of the District. The best bhadoi and rabi lands fetch only Rs. 6 to Rs. 8 an acre, while in the Government estates the maximum rate is Rs. 3. In some parts as much as Rs. 10 per acre is charged for land growing sugar-cane. The average area in possession of a tenant may be roughly estimated at 5\u00b76 acres.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and total revenue since the formation of the District (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\u2014\nOutside the municipality of Daltonganj, local affairs are managed by the District board. Its income in 1903-4 was Rs. 80,000, of which Rs. 37,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 96,000, including Rs. 55,000 spent on public works.\n\nThe District contains 10 police stations and 11 outposts. The force subordinate to the District Superintendent in 1903 consisted of 2 inspectors, 19 sub-inspectors, 24 head constables, and 213 constables. There was also a rural police force of 147 daffad\u0101rs and 1,109 chaukid\u0101rs, including 54 gh\u0101tv\u0101ls who are maintained to patrol the roads at the passes over the hills. A District jail at Daltonganj has accommodation for 124 prisoners.\n\nEducation is very backward, only 1.9 per cent. of the population (3.7 males and 0.1 females) being able to read and write in 1901; but since the constitution of the District in 1892 the number of pupils has increased from 4,317 to 8,328 in 1903-4, of whom 1,024 were girls. In the latter year 15.9 per cent. of boys and 2.1 per cent. of girls of school-going age were at school. Of the 332 educational institutions, 11 provided for secondary and 311 for primary education, and there was a training school. The most important institution is the high school at Daltonganj. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 50,000, of which Rs. 15,000 was contributed from Provincial revenues, Rs. 19,000 from District funds, and Rs. 13,000 from fees.\n\nThe District contains 4 dispensaries, of which that at Daltonganj has accommodation for 20 in-patients. Altogether, the cases of 12,495 out-patients and 341 in-patients were treated at these institutions in 1903, and 534 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 5,000, of which Rs. 1,700 was met from Government, Rs. 2,500 from local funds, Rs. 400 from municipal funds, and Rs. 1,100 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is not compulsory except in Daltonganj. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was only 18,000, or 29.3 per 1,000 of the population. The mortality from small-pox is higher than in most Bengal Districts.\n\n[Sir W. W.

P\u0101lamicottah was fortified under the native rulers, and its defences were intact at the time when it passed into the hands of the British. It subsequently formed the base of their operations during the Polig\u0101r Wars. The fort was not dismantled until comparatively recently, when the garrison of one or more native regiments which had been stationed here ever since the British occupation was finally withdrawn. The population of the town in 1901 was 39,545: namely, 23,548 Hindus, 13,052 (or a third of the total) Musalm\u0101ns, and the rest (2,945) Christians. The high proportion of Musalm\u0101ns is accounted for by the inclusion within municipal limits of the suburb of Melap\u0101laiyan on the bank of the river, which is inhabited almost wholly by Labba\u00efs, engaged in trade, agriculture, and carpet-making. P\u0101lamicottah was constituted a municipality in 1866. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 31,000 and Rs. 30,800 respectively. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 48,400 and Rs. 47,000. Most of the income is derived from taxes on land and houses and from tolls. The town stands in an excellent situation and possesses a dry and healthy climate, but has no supply of water which can be depended upon throughout the year. Proposals are being made to remedy this defect, but no definite scheme has yet been formulated. Being the head-quarters of the District, P\u0101lamicottah contains all the usual offices. It is also the chief centre of the Christian missions in Southern India, and possesses a large number of educational and other philanthropic institutions established by the various mission agencies. Of these, the Sarah Tucker College for girls and the school for the deaf and dumb deserve special mention. There are also two high schools for boys, besides other secondary schools. It is the residence of the Bishop of Tinnevelly.\n\nP\u0101lanpur Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 49' and 32\u00b0 29' N. and 76\u00b0 23' and 77\u00b0 2' E., with an area of 443 square miles. The tahsil lies wholly in the hills, extending from the Dhaola Dh\u0101r on the north to the Be\u0101s on the south. It is traversed by a number of tributaries of the Be\u0101s. The population in 1901 was 132,955, compared with 129,599 in 1891. It contains 113 villages, of which P\u0101lanpur is the head-quarters.

It is bounded on the north by the Udaipur and Sirohi States\nof R\u0101jput\u0101na: on the east by the Mah\u012b K\u0101ntha Agency; on the south by the State of Baroda and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r; and on the west by the Rann of Cutch. The head-quarters of the Agency are at P\u0101lanpur Town.\n\n### General Statistics for Each State in the Agency\n\n| State                  | Caste, tribe, or race of the ruling chief | Area in square miles (approximate) | Number of villages | Population, 1901 | Revenue (1903\u20134) | Tribute |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|\n|                        |                                          |                                   |                    |                 | From land.      | Total.  |\n| 1st Class States       |                                          |                                   |                    |                 | Rs.             | Rs.     |\n| P\u0101lanpur               | Muhammadan, Path\u0101n                       | 1,766                             | 511                | 222,627         | 2,10,094        | 7,29,199 |\n| R\u0101dhanpur              |                                          | 1,150                             | 160                | 61,548          | 2,70,668        | 5,28,658 |\n| 4th Class States       |                                          |                                   |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| Th\u0101rad                 | V\u0101ghela R\u0101jput                          | 940                               | 157                | 49,264          | 19,879          | 51,257  |\n| 5th Class States       |                                          |                                   |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| V\u0101v                    | Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jput                          | 380                               | 25                 | 8,286           | 2,440           | 11,647  |\n| Jurisdictional Talukas not classified |                                          |                                   |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| Malek Jor\u0101war Kh\u0101n     | Muhammadan                              | 10                                |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| Th\u0101kurs of Th\u0101ra       | V\u0101ghela R\u0101jputs                         | 14                                |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| V\u0101ghela Kh\u0101nji of Diodar |                                         | 12                                |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| V\u0101ghela Chamansingh of Diodar |                                     | 13                                |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| Ravaji Lakha\u1e47ji of S\u0101ntalpur |                                    | 1                                  |                    |                 |                 |         |\n| Th\u0101na Circles          | K\u0101nkrej                                 | 810                               | 92                 | 38,829          | 33,972          | 34,472  |\n|                        | Diodar, including Terv\u0101da and Bh\u0101bbar   | 361                               | 114                | 31,107          | 40,000          | 42,485  |\n|                        | V\u0101r\u0101hi                                  | 300                               | 51                 | 13,151          | 15,000          | 40,000  |\n|                        | V\u0101v, including Suig\u0101m                   | 377                               | 53                 | 19,330          | 17,855          | 18,107  |\n|                        | S\u0101ntalpur, including Ch\u0101\u1e0dchat           | 303                               | 39                 | 12,082          | 15,175          | 15,175  |\n|                        | Deesa Cantonment                        | 3                                  |                    | 11,047          |                 |         |\n| Total                  |                                          | 6,393                             | 1,253              | 467,271         | 6,57,779        | 15,36,983|\n\n* Some of the figures of area given in this column differ from those given in the Census Report of 1901, being based upon more recent and more correct information.\n\n\u2020 Tribute varies.\n\n\u2021 Not available.\n\nFor the most part the country is a sandy, treeless plain, with, in some places, waving sandhills, and between them valleys of black clay. To the north and north-east, bordering on Sirohi, lies an extremely wild and picturesque tract, covered with rocks and forest-clad hill ranges, outliers from the Abu and J\u0101sor hills. Some of these hills are of considerable height; chief among them is J\u0101sor, about 3,500 feet above the sea, a hill of gneiss with outbursts of granite, situated about 18 miles north of P\u0101lanpur town. J\u0101sor hill is well suited for a sanitarium, except that its water-supply is scanty.\nThe chief rivers are the Ban\u0101s and Saraswati. The Ban\u0101s, rising in Dhebar Lake, among the hills of Udaipur, flows west past the town and cantonment of Deesa, and falls into the Rann of Cutch by two mouths. Except when in flood, the Ban\u0101s may almost everywhere be forded. Its chief tributaries are the Sipu and B\u0101l\u0101r\u0101m. It is not utilized for irrigation, though by building dams much of the water might be stored. The Saraswati, a small but sacred stream, rising in the Mahi K\u0101ntha hills, crosses the eastern corner of the Agency. Close to the hills the water is near the surface, but gradually sinks into the sandy western plains. Towards the Rann, water is especially scarce and brackish, and in this tract a year of scanty rainfall causes great hardship.\n\nThe rocks are metamorphic gneiss and mica schist, with upheavals and outbursts of red and grey granite. The fauna do not differ materially from those found in the adjacent British Districts.\n\nFrom March to June the heat is great, the thermometer in the shade rising to $113^\\circ$ in May; the hot winds are so fierce that they keep even the people of the country from travelling during the daytime. From September to November the country is unhealthy, both Europeans and natives suffering from fevers of a bad type. The cold in January, when the temperature falls to $50^\\circ$, is at times very great, but it does not last long. The rains begin in July and are heaviest in August and September. The annual rainfall averages 30 inches at P\u0101lanpur, 26 at Thar\u0101d, and 16 at R\u0101dhanpur. Except in the hills, the P\u0101lanpur States are liable to drought.\n\nOn December 15, 1882, an earthquake occurred, with minor shocks and rumbling noises at intervals of a few days, ceasing in April, 1883. The damage done to buildings was estimated at $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs. In 1896\u20137 the plague broke out at P\u0101lanpur, and since then the most seriously affected localities have been P\u0101lanpur and Deesa cantonment. During the famine of 1899\u20131900 many cattle died in the Agency. The condition of the people has also been much reduced by the years of scarcity which followed that famine.\n\nThe territory included in the Agency of P\u0101lanpur has, like the more central parts of Gujar\u0101t, passed during historical times under the sway of the different R\u0101jput dynasties of Anhilv\u0101da (746\u20131298), the early Khilji and Tughlak Sh\u0101hi dynasties of Delhi (1297\u20131403), the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d Sult\u0101ns (1403\u20131573), the Mughal emperors (1573\u20131757), the Mar\u0101th\u0101s (1757\u20131819), and lastly the British. British connexion with P\u0101lanpur dates from 1809, with R\u0101dhanpur from 1813, and with the remaining States, except K\u0101nkrej, from 1819. When much harassed with freebooting raids from Sind, the chiefs prayed the British Government to help them, offering to pay a share of the charges incurred in restoring order. The\nconnexion of K\u0101nkrej with the British Government dates from 1819-20, when the Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101 Agency was formed. It continued part of Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101 till, in 1844, on account of its nearness to P\u0101lanpur, it was transferred to the P\u0101lanpur Agency.\n\nThe State of P\u0101lanpur, from which the Agency takes its name, is said to have been called Prahl\u0101dan P\u0101tan, after a Ponw\u0101r conqueror, Prahl\u0101dan Deo, and to have been repeopled in the fourteenth century by P\u0101lansi Chauh\u0101n. P\u0101lanpur and Deesa were conquered about 1600 by Afgh\u0101ns of the Loh\u0101ni stock known as Jh\u0101loris. This family, though it lost Jh\u0101lor in 1699, has held P\u0101lanpur almost continuously until the present day. The State of R\u0101dhanpur, once the property of the V\u0101ghelas, and named after a Baloch, R\u0101dhan Kh\u0101n, was entrusted to the B\u0101bi governor J\u0101far Kh\u0101n in 1693, and has remained with the B\u0101bis since that date. Thar\u0101d, originally ruled by Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jputs, was conquered by the Musalm\u0101ns at the end of the twelfth or early part of the thirteenth century, when the ruling family was relegated to V\u0101v, which it still holds. Passing in succession to the Jh\u0101loris and the B\u0101bis of R\u0101dhanpur, it was handed back in 1759 to the V\u0101ghela K\u0101nji, chief of Morv\u0101da, in whose family it still remains.\n\nIn 1821 the British Government agreed that in the case of Thar\u0101d no tribute should be exacted until the revenue had increased one-half, when one-third of the increase was to be paid. This arrangement remained in force until 1825, when all these States were freed from tribute. In 1826 further agreements, partly in supersession of the former ones, were signed and delivered to the British Government, wherein the chiefs promised to allow no Kol\u012bs, R\u0101jputs, or armed men of other districts to live in their territories without informing the British Government; to give up to the British and Baroda Governments any robbers and peace-breakers who had sought shelter in their domains; to help with all their forces in suppressing the Khosas and other freebooters, and to commit no irregularities in the neighbouring districts. The chiefs have also subscribed to the opium engagement of 1822. At first the relations of the British Government with these States were purely political; but as the Superintendent held the position of universal arbiter, it soon (1820) became necessary to place subordinate officers called agents, k\u0101rkuns, in the small States, with a view of collecting information and keeping order. The k\u0101rkuns have since developed into th\u0101nad\u0101rs or commandants of posts, officers invested with certain fixed civil and criminal powers. At the beginning of British management these districts were the haunt of daring freebooters, some of them people of the country, others Khosas from Sind. Though the States are still backward and tillage spreads slowly, disorder has been stopped and considerable progress made.\n\nThe population at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 508,526,\nThe decrease in the last decade is due to the severity of the famine of 1899-1902. The average density is 73 persons per square mile; the number of towns 3, and of villages 1,188\\(^1\\). The towns are P\u0101lanpur, R\u0101dhanpur, and Deesa. Distributed according to religion, Hindus form 85 per cent. of the total, Musalm\u0101ns 10 per cent., and Jains 5 per cent. Br\u0101hmans (22,000) are numerous, following the literary professions and occasionally holding land. The majority of the population consist of Kunbis (66,000), Rajputs (22,000), and Kol\u012bs (99,000), who are landowners and cultivators throughout the Agency. There is a large shepherd caste, the Rab\u0101ris (30,000), who are nomadic. Among the artisans, Cham\u0101rs, numbering 28,000, stand first. The principal languages are Gujar\u0101t\u012b and Western Hindi.\n\nThe soil of the Agency is of three kinds: the black, suited for cotton, rice, millets, wheat, and (if there be water) sugar-cane; a light soil, suited for the different kinds of pulse; and sandy, growing pulses and the palmyra palm. The country has been partly surveyed, but the exact cultivated area is unknown: it may be roughly stated that about three-fifths of the whole is cultivated, the remaining two-fifths about equally divided between cultivable and uncultivable land. Except on irrigated tenures, manure is not generally used. Holdings vary from 8 to 50 acres and upwards. Most of the land is in the hands of holders of service lands. Skilled husbandmen are comparatively few in number, and the majority of them are hampered with debt, and are more or less in the hands of the village money-lenders. The soil produces the usual Gujar\u0101t cereals and pulses, cotton in the rich black soil of the Sami t\u0101luka of R\u0101dhanpur and the V\u0101r\u0101hi and S\u0101ntalpur t\u0101lukas, san-hemp, and m\u016bng. Sugar-cane and a small quantity of tobacco are also grown in P\u0101lanpur.\n\nThe bullocks of K\u0101nkrej have been highly esteemed since the time of Akbar. They are the finest animals of their kind in Gujar\u0101t. Buffaloes, cows, sheep and goats, camels, horses, and asses are also bred in both P\u0101lanpur and R\u0101dhanpur. Stallions are maintained, which covered 82 mares in 1903-4.\n\nThe large forests in the north and north-east of the Agency might, if well managed, yield a considerable revenue. The chief trees are the khair (Acacia Catechu), s\u0101lar (Boswellia thurifera), bel (Aegle Marmelos), bor (Zizyphus Jujuba), jinjhara (Bauhinia racemosa), and karanj (Pongamia glabra). The Bhils and Kol\u012bs gather beeswax, gum, and honey, and sell them to V\u0101nis or Memons. A considerable number of cattle are pastured in these forests, and still more in the valley of the Ban\u0101s.\n\n\\(^1\\) This is the figure at the last Census, which took no account of unpopulated villages.\nThe bamboo thickets are in places very fine, especially on the top of the J\u0101sor hill.\n\nSeveral minor industries exist, such as the extraction of oil from rosha grass, and the preparation of bobbins from khimi wood. Salt-petre is also prepared locally. A cotton-ginning factory is working at Sami; and at Singam, a village near the Rann, good leather-work is prepared.\n\nThe chief exports are: saltpetre, grain, rapeseed, castor, sesamum, cotton, attar of champa (Michelia Champaca) and of keora (Pandanus odoratissimus), cattle, and gh\u012b; imports: tobacco, fruit, spices, molasses, sugar-candy, sugar, cotton and silk cloth. The value of the whole trade, which is about equally divided between exports and imports, is estimated at from 40 to 45 lakhs in ordinary years. The exports go chiefly to M\u0101rw\u0101r, Cutch, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Gujar\u0101t, and Bombay. The imports come from Central and Upper India, Bombay, Kaira, M\u0101rw\u0101r, Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and P\u0101li. Trade is carried on at permanent markets, the leading centres being P\u0101lanpur, R\u0101dhanpur, Deesa, Sami, and Munjpur. Except 2 miles of metalled roads and 4 miles unmetalled recently constructed in the town of P\u0101lanpur, only cross-country tracks exist. Avenues of trees are maintained on 3\u00bd miles, and for 17 miles on the P\u0101lanpur-Deesa road, which is in a state of disrepair. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway crosses the north-east corner for about 48 miles, with a branch 17 miles long from P\u0101lanpur to Deesa; but the principal line is the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d to Delhi.\n\nThere are in all sixteen British post offices in the Agency. Rural messengers are also employed to carry letters to and from the different States.\n\nThe years held in remembrance as times of scarcity and famine are 1747, 1756, 1785, 1791, 1804, 1813, 1825, 1834, 1839, 1842, 1849, and 1890\u20131902. Of these, the severest were the famines of 1813 and of 1899\u20131902. To such straits were the people brought in 1813 that some are said to have lived on human flesh; and in such numbers did they die that the survivors could not carry away the dead. Villages were left desolate, and parts of the country, formerly cultivated, have ever since lain waste. The price of grain rose to 3 seers per rupee. The whole Agency suffered severely from famine in 1899\u20131902. Relief measures were commenced in September, 1899, and were closed in October, 1902. The highest daily average number of persons in receipt of relief was 92,348 in July, 1900. Cattle died in great numbers. More than 20 lakhs was spent on famine relief during the year 1899\u20131900, involving the States in debts amounting to 18 lakhs: namely, P\u0101lanpur 9 lakhs, R\u0101dhanpur 3 lakhs, and other States 6 lakhs.\nThe chiefs of P\u0101lanpur and R\u0101dhanpur States are invested with full criminal and civil powers, and in matters of revenue are almost independent; but the sanction of the Political Agent is required for the trial of British subjects for capital offences. Over them the Political Agent exercises only a general supervision; but in the remaining eight petty States k\u0101rkuns, now called th\u0101nad\u0101rs, five in number, are invested with power to try second-class criminal cases and to decide civil suits up to Rs. 500 in value. There are also one European and two native Political Assistants who have higher powers; and above them is the Political Agent, who is the highest executive and judicial authority. But in important criminal cases appeals lie to the Commissioner of the Northern Division, and in murder cases and important civil matters to the Bombay Government. In P\u0101lanpur and R\u0101dhanpur towns there are local courts, from whose decision a final appeal lies to the chiefs in person, who follow codes of their own, based on British Indian laws. The chiefs of Thar\u0101d and V\u0101v have power in criminal cases to award three and two years\u2019 imprisonment, and to fine up to Rs. 5,000 and 2,000 respectively. In civil suits they exercise jurisdiction up to a value of Rs. 10,000 without appeal. The commonest forms of crime are theft, cattle-stealing, and hurt.\n\nThe gross revenue of the Agency is 15 lakhs, drawn from four chief sources: land (7 lakhs), customs (3\u00bd), excise (1\u00bd), and miscellaneous cesses including judicial receipts (3). The expenditure is 14 lakhs, chiefly devoted to administrative and domestic purposes. The P\u0101lanpur State, the Th\u0101kur of Th\u0101ra, and the t\u0101lukas under K\u0101nkrej th\u0101na pay a tribute of Rs. 46,202 to the Gaikw\u0101r. Transit duties were abolished throughout the Agency in 1887.\n\nExcept in the unusual case of persons holding land hereditarily (karam jodia), who have an occupancy right or batta, land is almost everywhere in the hands of tenants-at-will, most of whom, in the State villages, hold direct from the chief, and in cadet (bh\u0101y\u0101d) or proprietary (mulgir\u0101sia) villages from the cadet or proprietor. The cultivator has no power to dispose of his holding by sale or otherwise. Rent-free service lands (pasaita) and lands granted in charity are sometimes sublet to peasants who pay rent to the original holders. On such lands the State does not receive the ordinary assessment, but under the name of sal\u0101mi the original holder makes the State a yearly payment, fixed at from 25 to 30 per cent. of the gross produce. In some villages the assessment on tobacco, pepper, and the early crops is paid in money at rates fixed on the number of ploughs, while in others the revenue is collected under the crop share (bh\u0101gbatai) system. The share due to the State is fixed on a rough estimate by a State official and the village p\u0101tel. In P\u0101lanpur and R\u0101dhanpur States the\nrents are collected by village accountants under the control of revenue tahsild\u0101rs, who are again subordinate to the chief's revenue minister. In other parts of the Agency, except Thar\u0101d and V\u0101v, where the chief's share of the revenue is collected by officials appointed for the purpose, the proprietors themselves realize the revenue with the help of village officials. Survey operations are now in progress.\n\nOf the several works constructed since 1875 in the Agency, the chief are the Goodfellow Hospital, the High School, and the Jackson Hall at P\u0101lanpur, the Scott Canal and Harris Clock-tower at R\u0101dhanpur, and several roads. There are four municipalities\u2014at P\u0101lanpur, Deesa, Tckra, and R\u0101jpur\u2014the latter two places being suburbs of Deesa cantonment; and all of them are administered as departments of the State. Their income is derived from octroi duty.\n\nThere is a large British cantonment at Deesa, the income of which in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 35,000 and the expenditure Rs. 32,000. At present one native infantry regiment is stationed there. The chiefs of the Agency maintained in 1903\u20134 a military force of 861 men, consisting of 266 mounted and 655 foot-soldiers, and a permanent foot and mounted police force of 4,794, of whom 2,935 were in P\u0101lanpur and 752 in R\u0101dhanpur. The Agency contains one Agency jail, five State jails, and six th\u0101na lock-ups, which had in 1903\u20134 a daily average of 288 prisoners.\n\nThe States decided in June, 1882, to defray all educational expenses, receiving in return all school fees, and agreed that the expenditure should be regulated by the proposals of the Bombay educational department. In the P\u0101lanpur Agency 20,206 persons were returned as literate in 1901, 8 per cent. of the male population being able to read and write. The Agency contained in 1903\u20134 a high school, 2 middle schools, 70 primary schools, and 17 private schools, or a total of 90, compared with 30 and 110 in 1881 and 1891 respectively. The total number of pupils was 3,298, of whom 222 were girls. The cost of education was Rs. 27,000.\n\nAbout 40,000 persons received medical relief at 4 hospitals and 13 dispensaries in 1903\u20134. The cost of maintenance amounted to Rs. 28,880. About 12,000 persons were vaccinated in the same year.\n\n**P\u0101lanpur State.**\u2014State in the P\u0101lanpur Agency, Bombay, lying between 23\u00b0 57' and 24\u00b0 41' N. and 71\u00b0 51' and 72\u00b0 45' E., with an area of 1,766 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the R\u0101jput\u0101na States of Jodhpur and Sirohi; on the east by Sirohi and D\u0101nta States, the Ar\u0101valli range forming the boundary; on the south by Baroda; and on the west by other States under the P\u0101lanpur Agency. The length from east to west is 60 miles, and from north to south 45 miles.\n\nThe southern and eastern portions are undulating and tolerably well\nwooded. Towards the north the country becomes mountainous, with much forest; the villages are far apart, and generally poor and small; the hills afford excellent pasture; and the forests contain many useful timber trees. The State is watered by the Ban\u0101s river, which runs through its entire length, and by the Saraswati, which crosses a portion of its eastern tracts. The climate is dry and hot, and fever is prevalent. The rainfall in 1903 was 25 inches. The temperature ranges from $51^\\circ$ to $91^\\circ$ in January and from $80^\\circ$ to $113^\\circ$ in May.\n\nThe chief, or, as he is entitled, the D\u012bw\u0101n, of P\u0101lanpur is descended from the Loh\u0101nis, an Afgh\u0101n tribe who were subsequently known in history as Jh\u0101loris, and who captured Jh\u0101lor from the Chitor R\u0101jputs in the fourteenth century. On their first arrival they were vassals of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d; and during the disturbances which marked the fall of that monarchy, Ghazni Kh\u0101n Jh\u0101lor endeavoured to rouse Northern Gujar\u0101t to arms on behalf of Muzaffar Sh\u0101h, the last Ahmad\u0101bad Sult\u0101n. For this action he was imprisoned by Akbar, but was subsequently (1589\u201390) reinstated at Jh\u0101lor, and seven years later received the title of Diw\u0101n and the government of Lahore for successfully repulsing an invasion of the Afgh\u0101n tribes. During his rule his brother Malik F\u012broz Kh\u0101n took P\u0101lanpur and Deesa, making the former his head-quarters. Ghazni Kh\u0101n was succeeded in 1614 by his son P\u0101h\u0101r Kh\u0101n, who yielded place in 1616 to Malik F\u012broz Kh\u0101n, the conqueror of P\u0101lanpur. Subsequently (1699) Jh\u0101lor and S\u0101chor, the possession of which had been confirmed by Aurangzeb in 1682, were taken from the family, which thenceforth fixed its seat at P\u0101lanpur. The connexion of the British Government with the State dates from 1809, in which year the chief was murdered by a body of factious nobles, and his infant son was placed on the throne by the British under the regency of an uncle. Constant dissensions, however, occurred between uncle and nephew until 1817, when the former broke into open revolt, peace being eventually restored by a British force which stormed the town of P\u0101lanpur and replaced the young chief on the throne. The task of administration was then entrusted to a Political Superintendent, and a local force of 250 men was raised to prevent further breaches of the peace. This arrangement was enforced until 1874, when the control of the Political officer, particularly over the State's expenditure, was relaxed. The levy was maintained until 1891.\n\nThe chief is entitled to a salute of 11 guns, and has power to try any persons for all offences, except British subjects, whose cases require the sanction of the Political Agent. The family hold a patent or sanad guaranteeing any legitimate succession according to Muhammadan law, and follow the rule of primogeniture in point of succession.\n\nThe population of the State was 215,972 in 1872, 234,402 in 1881,\n274,864 in 1891, and 222,627 in 1901. It contains one town, P\u0101lanpur, and 510 villages. The density of population is 70 persons per square mile. Hindus number 183,495, Muhammadans 26,452, and Jains 12,602.\n\nTo the north and west the soil is light and sandy, needing little water but usually yielding only one crop a year. To the south and east, towards the hills, the soil is a rich black capable of giving three crops a year with a good rainfall. For the first crops slight rain is sufficient, but in the case of the late harvest heavy rain is required, when the yield is very abundant. The principal products are wheat, rice and other grains, and sugar-cane. Four stallions are maintained at P\u0101lanpur for horse-breeding purposes.\n\nThe high roads from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d to P\u0101li in M\u0101rw\u0101r, and from Anmad\u0101b\u0101d to Nasir\u0101b\u0101d, Ajmer, Delhi, Agra, and Deesa, pass through the State. A considerable trade in cotton, cloth, grain, raw sugar, and rice is carried on with P\u0101li, Dholera, Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and R\u0101dhanpur.\n\nThe chief enjoys a gross revenue of 7\u00b73 lakhs, and pays a tribute of Rs. 38,461\u20138\u20137 to the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda. Land revenue in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2\u00b71 lakhs, and excise revenue to Rs. 55,000. No transit duties are levied. The chief maintains, at an annual cost of about 1\u00bc lakhs, a force of 161 horse and 440 foot. The police force of the State consisted in 1903\u20134 of 2,935 men, regular and irregular.\n\nThe State maintains 22 schools attended by 1,244 pupils, besides 31 girls. About 12,200 persons received relief at hospitals and dispensaries in 1903\u20134. The number of persons vaccinated in the same year was 11,800.\n\nP\u0101lanpur Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in Bombay, situated in 24\u00b0 10' N. and 72\u00b0 28' E., at the junction of the P\u0101lanpur-Deesa branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway with the main line. Population (1901), 17,799. It is the head-quarters of the P\u0101lanpur Political Agency, and the residence of the D\u012bw\u0101n or chief of P\u0101lanpur State. The town, lying low, is hidden and commanded by a circle of hillocks. It is surrounded by a brick-and-mortar wall, built in 1750 by Diw\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101nji, from 17 to 20 feet high, 6 feet thick, and 3 miles in circuit. The two suburbs of Jainpura and T\u0101jpura are surrounded by a ditch, once 12 feet deep and 22 feet broad. The houses are irregular and closely packed, and, with few exceptions, the streets and lanes are narrow and dirty. The supply of water, chiefly from wells, is unwholesome. The public health is not good, lung diseases and fevers being very prevalent.\n\nP\u0101lanpur is a very old settlement. It is mentioned in the eighth century as the place where Vanar\u0101j\u0101 (746\u201380), the founder of the Ch\u0101vada dynasty of Anhilv\u0101da, was brought up. Early in the thirteenth century it appears as Prahl\u0101dan P\u0101tan, the capital of Prahl\u0101dan Deo of\nthe Ponw\u0101r house of Chandr\u0101vati. Afterwards falling waste, it was in the fourteenth century repeopled by P\u0101lansi Chauh\u0101n, from whom it takes its present name. P\u0101lanpur contains a hospital, a school, and a library.\n\nP\u0101l\u0101r (or Kshira-nadi, the \u2018milk river\u2019).\u2014A river of Southern India, which has its reputed source on Nandidroog, in the Kolar District of Mysore. From near Kaiv\u0101ra it turns south-east and leaves Mysore in the east of the Bowringpet taluk (Kolar). Entering the North Arcot District of Madras it bends to the north-east after descending the Gh\u0101ts, and flows into the Bay of Bengal near Sadras (Chingleput District). Its length in Mysore is about 47 miles, the entire drainage of the catchment basin, 1,036 square miles, being utilized for cultivation. Of the tanks on it, the largest are Betamangala and R\u0101mas\u0101gara in the Bowringpet taluk, the former being the source of water-supply for the Kolar Gold Fields. In Madras the length of the river is about 183 miles. There is some reason to believe that it once flowed to the sea from the valley through which now runs the Korttalaiy\u0101r, a stream which reaches the Bay of Bengal to the north of Madras City.\n\nThe chief tributaries of the P\u0101l\u0101r are the Ponne, which joins it on the left bank in North Arcot, and the Cheyy\u0101r, which joins it on the other bank in Chingleput District. On its banks are the towns of V\u0101niyamb\u0101di, Vellore, Arcot, and Chingleput. The first of these was greatly damaged by a sudden flood which swept down the river in 1903, causing the loss of hundreds of lives. Near Arcot the river is crossed by a dam built in 1857, and designed to give an improved supply to the old native channels which fed a large series of reservoirs in those parts. It was breached in 1874, but was subsequently restored, and is now 2,634 feet in length. The dam and the improved channels cost 21 lakhs and add to the supply of about 270 existing reservoirs, some of which are in Chingleput District; but they do not water any great extent of fresh land, and if the receipts from the irrigation which existed before they were constructed be deducted they are worked at a great loss. In Chingleput District about 50,000 acres are watered from the river, which feeds a series of tanks.\n\nThe Palar is crossed by railway bridges at Mailpati (North Arcot District), and between Padalam and Kolat\u016br in Chingleput.\n\nPal\u0101sb\u0101ri.\u2014Village in the Gauh\u0101ti subdivision of K\u0101mr\u016bp District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 8' N. and 91\u00b0 32' E., on the south bank of the Brahmaputra, 15 miles west of Gauh\u0101ti town. The M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants of the place purchase lac and a little cotton from the hill tribes, and mustard seed, rice, silk, and a little jute from the villagers of the neighbourhood. There is a flourishing market, in which all sorts of country produce, especially poultry and vegetables,\nare procurable. The public buildings include a dispensary and an English middle school. The river steamers call regularly at Pal\u0101sb\u0101ri ghat.\n\nPal\u0101sni.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nPal\u0101svihir.\u2014Petty State in the D\u0101ngs, Bombay.\n\nPalaungs.\u2014A Mon-Anam hill people, found mostly in the uplands to the north of the Northern Shan States, and in the east of the Ruby Mines District of Upper Burma. The Northern Shan State of Tawngpeng may be looked upon as the centre of the Palaung country. The majority of the inhabitants of the State are Palaungs, the Sawbwa is a Palaung, and most of the scattered Palaung tribes found outside the State claim to have come originally from within its limits. Among the Shans the name for the Palaungs is Kunloi ('highlanders') : their name for themselves is Ta'ang. The main division of the people is into Palaungs proper and Pales. The Palaungs proper are confined to the country immediately surrounding Namhsan, the capital of Tawngpeng; all clans outside this limited area are, properly speaking, Pales. No distinction was made between Palaungs proper and Pales at the Census of 1901. The total of Palaungs enumerated was 56,866, of whom about half were inhabitants of the Northern Shan States. In addition, about 7,500 were found in the 'estimated' areas of North Hsenwi. The Palaungs are Buddhists, and very zealous in their support of the priesthood. As a people they are peaceable and retiring, and neither mix nor intermarry freely with their Shan neighbours. The men have adopted the Shan dress; the women wear ordinarily a jacket, skirt, hood, and cloth leggings. The full dress, especially in the case of the Katurr and other pure Palaung clans, is elaborate and very brightly coloured, velvet figuring largely in its composition. The distinctive feature of the Pale women's attire is the skirt, striped horizontally in red and blue, the width of the stripes varying, with the clan, from an inch to a foot or more. The Pale woman's hood is ordinarily white, and smaller than the full-dress hood of the Palaung. In some of the Pale clans living farthest from Tawngpeng no hood is worn by the women; occasionally the head-dress is a bag, not unlike a stocking cap, into which the head is inserted. Coiffure varies; in full dress girls occasionally wear their hair over their shoulders; the Kwanhai women part their hair in the middle; in almost every clan a considerable proportion of the elderly females are close-cropped. The Palaungs build their villages almost invariably at a considerable elevation above the ground. Their houses are sometimes of a very large size and accommodate several families. They practise taungya (shifting cultivation), but are best known for their culture of tea, for which the hills of Tawngpeng and the surrounding country are admirably adapted. The greater part of the indigenous\ntea industry east of the Irrawaddy is in their hands. The Palaung language belongs to the Mon-Anam sub-family; it is isolating, atonic, and full of gutturals, and is closely allied to the vernaculars of the Was of trans-Salween territory, the Riangs of the Southern Shan States, and the Hkamuks of Siam. There are various dialects, but no great divergence of speech.\n\n[C. C. Lowis, *A Note on the Palaungs* (Rangoon, 1906).]\n\n**Pal\u0101veram.**\u2014Town in Chingleput District, Madras. See **Pall\u0101varam.**\n\n**Palaw.**\u2014Northernmost township of Mergui District, Lower Burma, bordering on Tavoy District. It lies on the mainland between $12^\\circ 20'$ and $13^\\circ 28' N.$ and $98^\\circ 33'$ and $99^\\circ E.$, and includes the inhabited islands of Mali (known generally as Tavoy Island) and Cabosa, as far out as $97^\\circ 53' E.$ Its total area is 785 square miles, hilly throughout, and forest-clad. The population was 19,447 in 1891, and 22,442 in 1901, about a third speaking Karen and the rest a dialect of Burmese differing from that in use at Mergui, and unintelligible to an ordinary Burman. There are 115 villages and hamlets. The head-quarters are at Palaw, a village of about 2,000 inhabitants (1901), and a port of call for a fortnightly coasting steamer from Moulmein, exporting rice, fish-paste, salt, and jaggery. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 37 square miles, mostly under rice, yielding Rs. 39,100 land revenue.\n\n**P\u0101ldeo.**\u2014One of the Chaube J\u0101girs in Central India, under the Political Agent in Baghelkhand, with an area of about 28 square miles. P\u0101ldeo was granted to Daryau Singh, the head of the K\u0101linjar Chaube family, in 1812. The present holder is Chaube Jagat Rai, who received the title of Rao Bah\u0101dur as a personal distinction in 1903. Population (1901), 8,598. The j\u0101gir comprises 18 villages, and has a revenue of Rs. 26,000, part of which is derived from the sale of diamonds, obtained at two villages in the estate. The chief place is Naigaon or Naugaon, situated in $25^\\circ 11' N.$ and $80^\\circ 49' E.$, 24 miles south of K\u0101linjar. Population (1901), 826.\n\n**Pale.**\u2014South-western township of the Lower Chindwin District, Upper Burma, lying between $21^\\circ 48'$ and $22^\\circ 10' N.$ and $94^\\circ 25'$ and $94^\\circ 55' E.$, with an area of 458 square miles. The population was 25,608 in 1891, and 31,241 in 1901, distributed in 252 villages. The head-quarters are at Pale (population, 1,113), close to the eastern border. The country is level in the east, becoming hilly as the Pondaung range is approached, and is well watered. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 55 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 76,300.\n\n**P\u0101lej.**\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b Kantha, Bombay.\n\n**Paletwa.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Northern Arakan District, Lower\nBurma, situated in $21^\\circ 18' N.$ and $92^\\circ 51' E.$, on the west bank of the Kaladan river. Paletwa is an insignificant village with a population (1901) of 481, perched on a high bank well above the stream, in a narrow gorge. The civil station consists of an office for the Deputy-Commissioner, a police station, a hospital, lines for the military police, and a few residences for the officers stationed at head-quarters. It is traversed by metalled pathways connecting the various eminences on the hill-side on which the houses and offices are built. There is a small wharf on the river bank below the village, alongside of which the Arakan Flotilla Company's steam-launches moor. On the bank are several fine groves of teak, the remains of an early plantation.\n\n**P\u0101lgh\u0101t Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Malabar District, Madras, consisting of the P\u0101lgh\u0101t and Ponn\u0101ni t\u0101luks.\n\n**P\u0101lgh\u0101t T\u0101luk.**\u2014Southernmost t\u0101luk of Malabar District, Madras, lying between $10^\\circ 25'$ and $10^\\circ 57'$ N. and $76^\\circ 25'$ and $76^\\circ 51'$ E., with an area of 643 square miles. It contains 113 amsams, or parishes. The population increased from 372,133 in 1891 to 390,098 in 1901. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 4,94,000. The only place of importance besides P\u0101lgh\u0101t (population, 44,177), the head-quarters, is the village of Kollangod. The t\u0101luk lies in the remarkable break in the Western Gh\u0101ts which is known as the P\u0101lgh\u0101t Gap; on the north it is bounded by spurs which run up to the Nilgiri plateau, while on the south it is faced by the great Anaimalai Hills. The forests which lie at the foot of these two masses of hill are some of the densest in the Presidency.\n\n**P\u0101lgh\u0101t Town** (P\u0101lk\u012bdu, 'jungle of p\u0101l trees').\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and t\u0101luk of the same name in Malabar District, Madras, situated in $10^\\circ 46'$ N. and $76^\\circ 39'$ E., 335 miles by rail from Madras city.\n\nIt lies on the main road from Malabar to Coimbatore and the east coast, in the curious gap in the Western Gh\u0101ts to which it gives its name: and its position as key to the West Coast has always made it a place of importance both strategically and commercially. The P\u0101lgh\u0101t fort is said to have existed from very ancient times, but little is known of the early history of the place. The P\u0101lgh\u0101t Achchan was originally a tributary of the Zamorin, but he had become independent before the beginning of the eighteenth century. In 1757 he sent a deputation to Haidar Ali praying for help against an invasion threatened by the Zamorin. Haidar seized the opportunity of gaining such an important position as P\u0101lgh\u0101t, and from that time to 1790 the fort was continually in the hands of the Mysore Sult\u0101ns or the British. It was first taken by the latter in 1768, when Colonel Wood captured it during his raid on Haidar Ali's fortresses, but it was retaken by Haidar a few months later. It was again captured by Colonel Fullarton in\n1783, but abandoned next year. In 1790 it was finally captured by Colonel Stuart, and from that time was used as a base for the operations which ended in the storming of Seringapatam. The fort continued to be garrisoned till the middle of last century. It is now used for the taluk office.\n\nP\u0101lgh\u0101t is the second largest town in Malabar, its population in 1901 being 44,177, of whom 37,285 were Hindus, 5,535 Musalm\u0101ns, and 1,342 Christians. It is the centre in Malabar of the Pattars or east-coast Br\u0101hmans. It was made a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1900 averaged Rs. 62,000. In 1903-4 the income and expenditure were Rs. 80,000 and Rs. 79,900 respectively, the chief sources of income being the taxes on houses and land and the fees at the Victoria College. The Victoria College is one of the most successful second-grade colleges in the Presidency. It was founded as a school in 1866, and in 1888 was raised to the rank of a college and affiliated to the Madras University. In March, 1904, 488 students were on the rolls, of whom 138 were in the college department. There are also in the town religious and educational establishments belonging to the Roman Catholic and German missions. P\u0101lgh\u0101t is the centre of the grain and miscellaneous trade between East Malabar and the adjoining Districts, and is a growing town. It contains two large bazars and a permanent market, in which a brisk trade is done in food-grains, tobacco, oil, and cloths, and in the grass mats for which the town is celebrated. There is also considerable trade in timber, which is brought down from the P\u0101lgh\u0101t and Walavan\u0101d forests and exported by rail.\n\nP\u0101li (or M\u0101rw\u0101r P\u0101li).\u2014Head-quarters of a district of the same name in the State of Jodhpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 25\u00b0 47' N. and 73\u00b0 19' E., on the right bank of the B\u0101ndi river, and on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway. Population (1901), 12,673. In the town are a post office, an Anglo-veracular school, and a hospital. The principal industries are copper-working, ivory-carving, dyeing, and cotton-printing. The town comprises an ancient and a modern quarter, each containing several temples. The most noteworthy are that of Somn\u0101th, with an inscription dated A.D. 1143, and that of Naul\u0101kha, which is remarkable for having a mosque within its courtyard (probably erected to preserve it from Muhammadan vandalism). P\u0101li was held by a community of Br\u0101hmans in grant from the Param\u0101ra and Parih\u0101r R\u0101jputs till the advent of the R\u0101thors from Kanauj (about 1212), when Rao Si\u0101hj\u012b became its master. Before the construction of the railway it was an important trade centre, and in 1836 was visited by an outbreak of plague, the germs of which are supposed to have been imported in silks from China.\n\nP\u0101lit\u0101na State.\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bom-\nbay, lying between $21^\\circ 23'$ and $21^\\circ 42'$ N. and $71^\\circ 31'$ and $72^\\circ$ E., with an area of 289 square miles. It is bounded on the south by Baroda territory, and on the north, east, and west by Bhaunagar territory. The Shetrungji river, with its tributaries the R\u0101javal and Kh\u0101ri, passes through the State. The climate is hot, and fever is prevalent. The annual rainfall averages about 25 inches.\n\nThe family of the chief is descended from Sh\u0101hji, second son of Sejakji, the chief of Bhaunagar being descended from the eldest son, and the chief of L\u0101thi from the third. The ruler executed the usual engagements in 1807.\n\nThe family was for many years engaged in a dispute with the Jains concerning the control of Shetrunga hill (see P\u0101lit\u0101na Town). This hill, which rises above the town of P\u0101lit\u0101na, is covered with Jain temples, and is the resort of innumerable pilgrims. Inquiry seems to show that, many years before the Gohel chiefs established themselves in Sur\u0101shtra, the Jains worshipped in Shetrunga. They produce an imposing array of deeds from the Mughal emperors and viceroys, ending with one from prince Mur\u0101d Baksh (1650), which confers the whole district of P\u0101lit\u0101na on S\u0101ntid\u0101s the jeweller and his heirs. The firm of S\u0101ntid\u0101s supplied Mur\u0101d Baksh with money for war when he went with Aurangzeb (1658) to fight D\u0101r\u0101 at Agra and assume the throne. On the decay of the Mughal power jurisdiction over P\u0101lit\u0101na fell into the hands of the Gohel chief, a tributary of the Gaikw\u0101r. While, therefore, the whole mountain is regarded as a religious trust, it is under the jurisdiction of the chief, for whose protection the Shr\u0101waks have long paid a yearly subsidy. Under a decision of Major Keatinge's in 1863, the representatives of the Jain community had to pay a lump sum of Rs. 10,000 per annum for ten years to the chief, in lieu of his levying a direct tax of Rs. 2 a head on all pilgrims visiting the shrines, with the proviso that a scrutiny lasting two years, or longer if necessary, might be demanded by either side at the termination of that period, with a view to ascertain whether the yearly sum of Rs. 10,000 was more or less than the right amount. The chief demanded such a scrutiny in 1879, and, due arrangements having been made, the count of pilgrims commenced on April 23, 1880. The claims of the chief were settled for forty years by an annual payment of Rs. 15,000, commencing from 1886. A decision of the British Government, given in March, 1877, while it upholds the chief's legitimate authority, secures to the sect its established possessions, and maintains the sacred isolation of the hill.\n\nThe chief is a Hindu of the Gohel clan of R\u0101jputs, and is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. The family hold a sanad authorizing adoption; in matters of succession the rule of primogeniture is followed. Since the death of the last Th\u0101kur S\u0101hib in 1905, the State has\nbeen administered by Government, owing to the minority of the present chief.\n\nThe population at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 51,476, (1881) 49,271, (1891) 60,848, and (1901) 52,856. Hindus number 44,456, Musalmans 4,328, and Jains 4,047. During the last decade the population decreased by 15 per cent., owing to the famine of 1899-1900. The State contains one town, P\u0101lit\u0101na, the capital; and 90 villages.\n\nIn 1903-4 the State contained 183 square miles of land under cultivation, of which 9 square miles were irrigated. The principal crops are grain, sugar-cane, and cotton. Horse-breeding is carried on in the State paddocks, the aim being to breed from the pure K\u0101thi stock. There are two good metalled roads in the State, one from P\u0101lit\u0101na to Songad and the other from P\u0101lit\u0101na to Gariadhar. There are two cotton-ginning factories.\n\nP\u0101lit\u0101na ranks as a second-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. During the lifetime of the late chief there were five courts for the administration of civil and criminal justice, and he had power to try his own subjects in capital cases. The gross revenue is estimated at 6\u00bd lakhs, chiefly derived from land. The State pays a tribute of Rs. 10,364 jointly to the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda and the Naw\u0101b of Jun\u0101garh. No transit dues are levied. There is one municipality, at P\u0101lit\u0101na Town, with an income (1903-4) of about Rs. 4,500. An armed police force of 113 men, including mounted and foot police, was maintained in 1905. In 1903-4 the jail contained a daily average of 26 prisoners, and there were 19 schools with 1,088 pupils. The State has a hospital and one dispensary, which treated 20,000 persons in 1903-4; and 1,330 persons were vaccinated in the same year.\n\nP\u0101lit\u0101na Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 31' N. and 71\u00b0 53' E., at the eastern base of the famous Shetrunga (Satrunjaya) hill; distant from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d 120 miles south-west, and from Bombay 190 north-west. Population (1901), 12,800. It was formerly the chief town of a Mughal pargana.\n\nShetrunga hill, to which reference has been made in the article on P\u0101lit\u0101na State, is sacred to Adin\u0101th, a T\u012brthankar or hierarch of the Jains. It is 1,977 feet above sea-level. The top is divided into two peaks, but the valley between has been partly built over by a wealthy Jain merchant. The entire summit is covered with temples, among which the most famous are those of Adin\u0101th, Kum\u0101r P\u0101l, Vimalasah, Sampriti R\u0101j\u0101, and the Chaumukh. This last is the most lofty, and can be clearly distinguished at a distance of over 25 miles. Shetrunga is the most sacred of the five sacred hills of the Jains. Mr. Kinloch Forbes in the R\u0101s M\u0101la describes it as the 'first of\nall places of pilgrimages, the bridal hall of those who would win everlasting rest'; and adds:\n\n'There is hardly a city in India, through its length and breadth, from the river of Sind to the sacred Ganges, from Himalaya's diadem of ice peaks to the throne of his virgin daughter, Rudra's destined bride, that has not supplied at one time or other contribution of wealth to the edifices which crown the hill of P\u0101lit\u0101na. Street after street, square after square, extend these shrines of the Jain faith, with their stately enclosures, half-palace, half-fortress, raised in marble magnificence upon the lonely and majestic mountain, and, like the mansions of another world, far removed in upper air from the ordinary tread of mortals.'\n\nOwing to the special sanctity of Shetrunga, Jains from all parts of India are anxious to build temples on the hill; and all members of the Jain faith feel it a duty to perform, if possible, one pilgrimage here during their life.\n\nThe following description of this wonderful temple-hill is condensed from an account by Dr. Burgess:\n\n'At the foot of the ascent there are some steps with many little canopies or cells, a foot and a half to three feet square, open only in front, and each having in its floor a marble slab carved with the representation of the soles of two feet (charana)\u2014very flat ones, and generally with the toes all of one length. A little behind, where the ball of the great toe ought to be, there is a diamond-shaped mark divided into four smaller figures by two cross lines, from the end of one of which a waved line is drawn to the front of the foot. Round the edges of the slab there is usually an inscription in Devan\u0101gari characters, and between the footmarks an elongated figure like a head of Indian corn with the point slightly turned over. These cells are numerous all the way up the hill, and a large group of them is found on the south-west corner of it behind the temple of Adiswar Bhagw\u0101n. They are the temples erected by poorer Shr\u0101waks or Jains, who, unable to afford the expense of a complete temple, with its hall and sanctuary enshrining a marble murti or image, manifest their devotion to their creed by erecting these miniature temples over the charana of their Jinas or Arhats.\n\n'The path is paved with rough stones all the way up, only interrupted here and there by regular flights or steps. At frequent intervals also there are resthouses, more pretty at a distance than convenient for actual use, but still deserving of attention. High up we come to a small temple of the Hindu monkey-god Hanum\u0101n, the image bedaubed with vermilion in ultra-barbaric style. At this point the path bifurcates\u2014to the right leading to the northern peak, and to the left to the valley between, and through it to the southern summit. A little higher up, on the former route, is the shrine of Hengar, a Musalm\u0101n p\u012br, so that Hindu and Moslem alike contend for the representation of their creeds on this sacred hill of the Jains.\n\n'On reaching the summit of the mountain the view that presents\nitself from the top of the walls is magnificent in extent: a splendid setting for the unique picture\u2014this work of human toil we have reached. To the east, the prospect extends to the Gulf of Cambay near Gogha and Bhavnagar; to the north it is bounded by the granite range of Sihor and the Cham\u0101rdi peak; to the north-west and west the plain extends as far as the eye can reach, except where broken due west by the summits of Mount Girn\u0101r\u2014revered alike by Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, the latter of whom claim it as sacred to Nemin\u0101th, their twenty-second T\u012brthankar. From west to east, like a silver ribbon across the foreground to the south, winds the Shetrunj\u012b river, which the eye follows until it is lost between the Tal\u0101ja and Khokara hills in the south-west. But after this digression let us return to the scene beside us. How shall I describe it? It is truly a city of temples, for, except a few tanks, there is nothing else within the gates, and there is a cleanliness withal, about every square and passage, porch and hall, that is itself no mean source of pleasure. The silence, too, is striking. Now and then in the mornings you hear a bell for a few seconds, or the beating of a drum for as short a time, and on holidays chants from the larger temples meet your ear; but generally during the after-part of the day the only sounds are those of vast flocks of pigeons that rush about spasmodically from the roof of one temple to that of another, apparently as an exercise in fluttering and just to keep their wings in use. Parroquets and squirrels, doves and ringdoves abound, and peacocks are occasionally met with on the outer walls. The top of the hill consists of two ridges, each about 350 yards long, with a valley between: the southern ridge is higher at the western end than the northern, but this is in turn higher at the eastern extremity. Each of these ridges, and the two large enclosures that fill the valley, are surrounded by massive battlemented walls fitted for defence. The buildings on both ridges, again, are divided into separate enclosures, called t\u016bks, generally containing one principal temple, with varying numbers of smaller ones. Each of these enclosures is protected by strong gates and walls, and all gates are carefully closed at sundown.\n\nA description of one of these t\u016bks must suffice here, but the reader who wishes to pursue the subject will find an account of the other temples in Mr. Burgess's Notes of a Visit to Satrunjaya Hill (Bombay, 1869). The t\u016bk now to be described is that of Khartarvasi, of which the principal temple is that of the Chaumukh or 'four-faced' Jaina occupying the centre.\n\n'It is,' says Mr. Burgess (op. cit.), 'a fine pile of the sort, and may be considered a type of its class. It stands on a platform raised fully 2 feet above the level of the court, and 57 feet wide by about 67 in length, but the front of the building extends some distance beyond the end of this. The body of the temple consists of two square apartments, with a square porch or mandap to the east, from which a few steps ascend to the door of the antar\u0101la or hall, 31 feet square inside, with a vaulted roof rising from twelve pillars. Passing through this we enter by a large door into the shrine or garbha griha, 23 feet square, with\nfour columns at the corners of the altar or throne of the image. Over this rises the tower or vim\u0101na to a height of 96 feet from the level of the pavement. The shrine in Hindu temples is always dark and entered only by the single door in front. Jain temples, on the contrary, have very frequently several entrances. In this instance, as in that of most of the larger temples, besides the door from the antar\u0101la, three other large doors open out into porticoes on the platform\u2014a veranda being carried round this part of the building from one door to another. The front temple has also two side doors opening upon the platform. The walls of the shrine, having to support the tower, are very thick, and contain cells or chapels opening from the veranda; thus the doors into the shrine stand back into the wall. There are ten cells and some of them contain little images of Tirthankars; those at the corners open to two sides. The pillars that support the veranda deserve notice. They are of the general form everywhere prevalent here\u2014square columns, to the sides of which we might suppose very thin pilasters of about half the breadth had been applied. They have high bases, the shafts carved with flower patterns each different from its fellow, the usual bracket capitals slanting downwards on each side and supporting gopis, on whose heads rest the abacus\u2014or rather these figures, with a sort of canopy over the head of each, form second and larger brackets. The floors of the larger temples are of beautifully tesselated marble\u2014black, white, and yellowish brown. The patterns are very much alike, except in details, and consist chiefly of varieties and combinations of the figure called by the Jains nandivarta\u2014a sort of complicated square fret\u2014the cognizance of the eighteenth Jaina. The shrine contains a sinhasan or pedestal for the image; in this temple it is of the purest white marble, fully 2 feet high and 12 square. Each face has a centre panel, elaborately carved, and three of less breadth on each side, the one nearer the centre always a little in advance of that outside it.\n\nOn the throne sit four large white marble figures of Adin\u0101th, not especially well proportioned, each facing one of the doors of the shrine. These are large figures, perhaps as large as any on the hill; they sit with their feet crossed in front, after the true Buddha style, the outer side of each thigh joining that of his fellow, and their heads rising about 10 feet above the pedestal. The marble is from Mokhrano in M\u0101rw\u0101r, and the carriage is said to have cost an almost incredible sum. The aspect of these, and of all the images, is peculiar; frequently on the brow and middle of the breast there is a brilliant, set in silver or gold, and almost always the breasts are mounted with one of the precious metals, while there are occasionally gold plates on the shoulders, elbow, and knee-joint, and a crown on the head\u2014that on the principal one in the Motisah being a very elegant and massive gold one. But the peculiar feature is the eyes, which seem to peer at you from every chapel like those of so many cats. They appear to be made of silver overlaid with pieces of glass, very clumsily cemented on, and in every case projecting so far, and of such a form, as to give one the idea of their all wearing spectacles with lenticular glasses over very watery eyes in diseased sockets.\n\nThe original temple in this t\u016bk is said to date back to a king\nVikrama; but whether he of the Samvat era, 57 B.C., or Harsha Vikram\u0101ditya, about A.D. 599, or some other, is not told. It appears to have been rebuilt in its present form about A.D. 1619 by Seva Somji of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, for we read thus: \"Samvat 1675, in the time of Sultan N\u016br-ud-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br, Saw\u0101i Vijaya R\u0101j\u0101, and the princes Sultan Khushru and Khurma, on Saturday, Bais\u0101kh Sudi 13th, Devr\u0101j and his family, of which were Somji and his wife, R\u0101j\u0101ldevi, erected the temple of the four-faced Adin\u0101th,\" &c. A stair on the north side leads to the upper storey of the tower. This temple is said to contain a hundred and twenty-five images.\n\nFergusson, in his History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, has the following remarks on the Jain temple-cities, with special reference to this the greatest of them all:\n\n\"The grouping together of their temples into what may be called 'cities of temples' is a peculiarity which the Jains practised to a greater extent than the followers of any other religion in India. The Buddhists grouped their stupas and vih\u0101ras near and round sacred spots, as at S\u0101nchi, Maniky\u0101la, or in Pesh\u0101war, and elsewhere; but they were scattered, and each was supposed to have a special meaning, or to mark some sacred spot. The Hindus also grouped their temples, as at Bhuvaneswar or Benares, in great numbers; but in all cases, so far as we know, because these were the centres of a population who believed in the gods to whom the temples were dedicated, and wanted them for the purpose of their worship. Neither of these religions, however, possesses such a group of temples, for instance, as that at Satrunjaya, or P\u0101lit\u0101na as it is usually called, in Gujar\u0101t. No survey has yet been made of it, nor have its temples been counted; but it covers a large space of ground, and its shrines are scattered by hundreds over the summits of two extensive hills and the valley between them. The larger ones are situated in tiiks or separate enclosures, surrounded by high fortified walls; the smaller ones line the silent streets. A few ratis or priests sleep in the temples and perform the daily services, and a few attendants are constantly there to keep the place clean, which they do with the most assiduous attention, or to feed the sacred pigeons, who are the sole denizens of the spot; but there are no human habitations properly so called within the walls. The pilgrim or the stranger ascends in the morning and returns when he has performed his devotions or satisfied his curiosity. He must not eat, or at least must not cook, his food on the sacred hill, and must not sleep there. It is a city of the gods, and meant for them only, and not intended for the use of mortals.\n\nJaina temples and shrines are, of course, to be found in cities where there are a sufficient number of votaries to support a temple, as in other religions; but beyond this, the Jains seem, almost more than any other sect, to have realized the idea that to build a temple, and to place an image in it, was in itself a highly meritorious act, wholly irrespective of its use to any of their co-religionists. Building a temple is with them a prayer in stone which they conceive to be eminently acceptable to the deity, and likely to secure them benefits both here and hereafter.\"\n'It is in consequence of the Jains believing to a greater extent than the other Indian sects in the efficacy of temple-building as a means of salvation that their architectural performances bear so much larger a proportion to their numbers than those of other religions. It may also be owing to the fact that nine out of ten, or ninety-nine in a hundred, of the Jain temples are the gifts of single wealthy individuals of the middle classes, that these buildings generally are small and deficient in that grandeur of proportion that marks the buildings undertaken by royal command or belonging to important organized communities. It may, however, be also owing to this that their buildings are more elaborately finished than those of more national importance. When a wealthy individual of the class who build these temples desires to spend his money on such an object, he is much more likely to feel pleasure in elaborate detail and exquisite finish than in great purity or grandeur of conception.\n\n'All these peculiarities are found in a more marked degree at P\u0101lit\u0101na than at almost any other known place, and, fortunately for the student of the style, extending through all the ages during which it flourished. Some of the temples are as old as the eleventh century, and they are spread pretty evenly over all the intervening period down to the present century. But the largest number, and some of the most important, are now in course of erection, or were erected in the present century, or in the memory of living men. Fortunately, too, these modern examples by no means disgrace the age in which they are built. Their sculptures are inferior, and some of their details are deficient in meaning and expression; but, on the whole, they are equal, or nearly so, to the average examples of earlier ages. It is this that makes P\u0101lit\u0101na one of the most interesting places that can be named for the philosophical student of architectural art, inasmuch as he can there see the various processes by which cathedrals were produced in the Middle Ages, carried on on a larger scale than almost anywhere else, and in a more natural manner. It is by watching the methods still followed in designing buildings in that remote locality that we become aware how it is that the uncultivated Hindu can rise in architecture to a degree of originality and perfection which has not been attained in Europe since the Middle Ages, but which might easily be recovered by following the same processes.'\n\nP\u0101liy\u0101d.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nPalk Strait.\u2014Palk Bay is a gulf lying between the east coast of the Madras Presidency and the northern part of Ceylon, in about 9\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 N. and 79\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 E. It is named after Robert Palk, Governor of Madras (1755\u201363). The gulf is bounded by Point Calimere and the coast of Tanjore to the northward and westward; by Adam's Bridge and the islands at either end of it to the south; and by the northern part of Ceylon and the adjacent islands to the east. The Dutch recognized three channels leading between Point Calimere and the northern end of Ceylon into Palk Bay; but probably only one of these can be considered safe for large ships. This is the Palk Strait.\nShoals, currents, sunken rocks, coral reefs, and sandy spits abound on either side, rendering the passage one of some difficulty and danger. The north-east monsoon often sweeps down the Strait into Palk Bay with great fury, and there is frequently a heavy and confused swell at the southern end near P\u0101mban Island. The effect of the south-west monsoon is, however, little felt.\n\nAn account of the scheme for opening a channel for ocean steamers from Palk Strait to the Gulf of Manaar will be found under P\u0100MBAN.\n\nP\u0101lkole.\u2014Town in Kistna District, Madras. See P\u0100LAKOLLU.\n\nP\u0101lkonda Hills (p\u0101l, 'milk,' and kond\u0101, 'a hill,' said to be so called from the excellent grazing upon them).\u2014Range of mountains in Cuddapah District, Madras, lying between $13^\\circ 36'$ and $14^\\circ 25'$ N. and $78^\\circ 16'$ and $79^\\circ 15'$ E.; average elevation above the sea, about 2,000 feet; highest point, Buttaid, 3,060 feet. Starting from the sacred hill of Tirupati, the hills run north-west through Cuddapah District for 45 miles and then turn nearly due west, passing across to the frontier of Anantapur. The latter portion is sometimes called the Sesh\u0101chalam range. Mr. Gribble describes these hills as follows in the Cuddapah Manual:\n\n'This is not only the largest and most extensive of all the Cuddapah ranges, but it also presents very marked features, and differs in appearance from the others. The Tirupati hill is 2,500 feet above the sea, and the P\u0101lkonda range continues at about the same uniform height very nearly throughout the whole of its extent. There are very few prominent peaks; and at a distance of a few miles it presents the appearance, to any one standing on the inside portion, of a wall of unvarying height, shutting the country in as far as the eye can reach. The top of this range is more or less flat, forming a table-land of some extent. On both sides the slopes are well clothed with forests, which near the railway are especially valuable, and form the important B\u0101lapalle, Yerraguntlakota, and Kod\u016br Reserves. A noticeable feature in this range, and especially on its south-western slopes, is the manner in which the quartzite rocks crop out at the summit. The rock suddenly rises perpendicularly out of the slope, and is wrested and contorted into various fantastic shapes, which not unfrequently give the appearance of an old ruined castle or fort. These hills were in former days a favourite resort of dacoits or gang-robbers, probably because they are not so feverish as the other hills of the main division. They are now nearly free from these pests of society. Wild beasts, however, are still to be found.'\n\nTigers are occasionally seen; of leopards there are a large number, and they are very destructive; a few s\u0101mbar are to be found and some bears, but the hills have been too much exploited to afford a good field for sportsmen.\n\nP\u0101lkonda T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk in Vizagapatam District, Madras, lying\nbetween $18^\\circ 22'$ and $18^\\circ 47'$ N. and $83^\\circ 31'$ and $83^\\circ 56'$ E., on the extreme eastern boundary of the District, part of it falling within the Agency limits. Its total area is 502 square miles. The ordinary tracts are thickly peopled, and cultivated with rice, indigo, pulses, and grain crops, irrigated from the N\u0101g\u0101vali river. The Agency portion is hilly and forest-clad, and contains about 56 square miles of 'reserved' forest. The population of the ordinary tracts in 1901 was 215,376, compared with 201,331 in 1891, living in two towns, P\u0101lkonda (population, 10,615), the t\u0101luk head-quarters, and R\u0101zam (5,096); and 334 villages. In the Agency tract the population in 1901 was 11,245 persons (chiefly Savaras), compared with 11,824 in 1891, living in 106 villages. The greater part of the t\u0101luk is held on ryotw\u0101ri tenure, but large areas belong to the R\u0101j\u0101s of Bobbili and Vizianagram. A considerable proportion of the ryotw\u0101ri land is irrigated, chiefly from tanks. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,04,000.\n\nWhen the Northern Circ\u0101rs were ceded to the British in 1765, the t\u0101luk was a zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b, feudatory to the R\u0101j\u0101 of Vizianagram. From 1796 onwards there were constant disputes and attempted disturbances, and finally in 1832 the zam\u012bnd\u0101r of P\u0101lkonda broke into open rebellion. This was put down with the aid of troops, and the zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b was then declared forfeit to Government and the male members of the family were imprisoned. From 1833 to 1846 the estate was managed by the Collector, as also (from 1811) was the neighbouring estate of Honjaram, which had been purchased by Government for arrears of revenue. In 1846 an arrangement was made with a European firm at Madras, whereby the two estates of P\u0101lkonda and Honjaram were leased to them for Rs. 1,31,000. This arrangement lasted till 1892, when Government resumed direct management, the two estates being amalgamated to form the ryotw\u0101ri portion of the t\u0101luk.\n\nP\u0101lkonda Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Vizagapatam District, Madras, situated in $18^\\circ 36'$ N. and $83^\\circ 46'$ E., at the crossing of the roads passing from P\u0101rvatipuram to the coast, and from the low country, through the S\u012btampeta pass, to Ganj\u0101m District, and thus a place of some local importance. The population, which is increasing slowly, numbered 10,615 in 1901.\n\nP\u0101lkot.\u2014Town in the Gumla subdivision of R\u0101nchi District, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 52'$ N. and $84^\\circ 39'$ E. Population (1901), 3,246. It is one of the principal trade centres in the District, and the head-quarters of a police circle, and has given its name to a pargana.\n\nPalladam T\u0101luk.\u2014Central t\u0101luk of Coimbatore District, Madras, lying between $10^\\circ 47'$ and $11^\\circ 21'$ N. and $77^\\circ 1'$ and $77^\\circ 30'$ E., with an\narea of 741 square miles. Population increased from 270,390 in 1891 to 300,904 in 1901. It contains one town, Tirupp\u016br (population, 6,056); and 193 villages, including Palladam (3,187), the headquarters. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 4,87,000. It is a flat and dreary plain without hills or forests. The only river is the Noyil. The irrigated area is larger than in any other taluk in the District, but nearly all of this is served by wells, with which it is better supplied than any other. There is much black cotton soil in the south and south-west, and the area under cotton is larger than anywhere else in the District. Cholam is by far the most widely grown crop, and some tobacco is raised with irrigation from wells. The rainfall is very small, averaging only about 20 inches annually.\n\nPalladam Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Coimbatore District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 0' N. and 77\u00b0 17' E. Population (1901), 3,187. There are large tracts of black cotton soil in the neighbourhood, and the town has three cotton-presses. It also contains the ruins of an old fort.\n\nP\u0101l Lahar\u0101.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 9' and 21\u00b0 41' N. and 85\u00b0 0' and 85\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 452 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the State of Bonai; on the east by Keonjhar; on the south by T\u0101lcher; and on the west by B\u0101mra. The east and north of the State are occupied by hills. A magnificent mountain, Malayagiri (3,895 feet), the loftiest peak in the Orissa States, towers above the lesser ranges. The agricultural products consist of the usual coarse grains and oilseeds. Nothing worthy of the name of trade is carried on. There is some excellent s\u0101l (Shorea robusta) in the northern hills, but no means of conveying it to a market.\n\nP\u0101l Lahar\u0101 was formerly feudatory to Keonjhar, and its chief still pays a tribute or quit-rent into the office of the Superintendent of the Tributary Mah\u0101ls, where it is placed to the credit of Keonjhar. The State has a revenue of Rs. 29,000, and its tribute payable to Government is Rs. 267. The population increased from 19,700 in 1891 to 22,351 in 1901, distributed among 265 villages. The density is 49 persons per square mile, or less than in any other of the Orissa States. Hindus number 20,770, Animists 1,540, and Muhammadans 41, the most numerous castes being Ch\u0101sas (5,000) and P\u0101ns (4,000). The leaf-wearing Ju\u0101ngs are still met with in the outskirts of the Malayagiri range. The old Midnapore-Sambalpur road passes through the north of the State. The village containing the R\u0101j\u0101's residence is connected with T\u0101lcher and Angul by a fair-weather road of recent construction. The State maintains an upper primary and seven lower primary schools, and a dispensary.\nPall\u0101varam.\u2014Town and cantonment in the Saidapet t\u0101luk of Chingleput District, Madras, situated in $12^\\circ 59'$ N. and $80^\\circ 10'$ E., on the South Indian Railway, 3 miles south of St. Thomas\u2019s Mount. Population (1901), 6,416. It used to be called the Presidency Cantonment, native troops being kept here for garrisoning and protecting Madras city. The temperature of the place is high, but it is far from being unhealthy, and water is good and abundant. Pall\u0101varam is now a place of residence for European pensioners and a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for native infantry. It used to contain several tanneries, but the industry has declined in consequence of the introduction in America of the superior process of chrome tanning.\n\nPalm\u0101.\u2014Deserted Jain settlement, situated within a few miles of Pur\u016blia and near the K\u0101sai river in the head-quarters subdivision of M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, Bengal. The principal temple stands on a mound covered with stone and brick, the d\u00e9bris of buildings. There are several sculptures of nude male figures standing on pedestals and under canopies, with Egyptian head-dresses, the arms hanging down straight by their sides, the hands turned in and touching the knees. There can be no doubt that these images represent the T\u012brthankaras of the Jains.\n\nPalmaner T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk in the west of North Arcot District, Madras, lying between $12^\\circ 46'$ and $13^\\circ 17'$ N. and $78^\\circ 25'$ and $78^\\circ 49'$ E. Area, 439 square miles; population in 1901, 51,575, compared with 48,135 in 1891; number of villages, 91. Demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4, Rs. 92,000. The t\u0101luk is situated upon the Mysore plateau, about 2,500 feet above sea-level. It is consequently much cooler than the lower parts of the District, and in the winter months the mornings are quite sharp. There is a large extent of jungle. Though devoid of railway communication, the t\u0101luk is well provided with roads. The head-quarters are at the village of the same name.\n\nPalmaner Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in North Arcot District, Madras, situated in $13^\\circ 13'$ N. and $78^\\circ 46'$ E. Population (1901), 4,850. Palmaner stands on the plateau of Mysore at a height of 2,247 feet above sea-level, and is much cooler than the lower parts of the District. It has accordingly always been a sanitarium for the North Arcot officials, and before the route to the Nilgiris was opened up was resorted to also by Europeans from Madras. It contains several excellent bungalows. Some of the gorges and valleys in the hills round about are beautiful. A favourite resort is Gangamma\u2019s valley, where a small stream falls from a height of about 200 feet into a deep pool shut in on all sides but one by precipitous walls of rock.\n\nPalmyras Point.\u2014Headland in the Kendr\u0101p\u0101ra subdivision of Cuttack District, Bengal, situated in $20^\\circ 46'$ N. and $86^\\circ 59'$ E., and\nconstituting a landmark for vessels making for the Hooghly from the south.\n\n**Paln\u0101d.**\u2014T\u0101luk in the extreme west of Gunt\u016br District, Madras, lying between $16^\\circ 10'$ and $16^\\circ 44'$ N. and $79^\\circ 14'$ and $80^\\circ$ E., with an area of 1,041 square miles. The population in 1901 was 153,638, compared with 142,011 in 1891, living in 96 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 4,35,000. The head-quarters were recently transferred from D\u0101chepalle to Guruz\u0101la. The t\u0101luk is a more or less elevated tract, intersected by numerous mountain torrents and almost surrounded by low outliers from the Eastern Gh\u0101ts. Bounded on the north and west by the Kistna river, which is here both narrow and swift, and fringed on the south and east by hills and jungles, it is a somewhat inaccessible spot, and its history and natural conditions differ considerably from those of the rest of the District. Most of the cultivation is \u2018dry,\u2019 and after the first rains the country forms a grazing ground for the herds of the ryots of the Kistna delta. The climate is extremely variable, the heat being very great in the summer months, while comparatively low temperatures are registered after the monsoons are over.\n\n**Palni T\u0101luk.**\u2014T\u0101luk in the Dindigul subdivision in the north of Madura District, Madras, lying between $10^\\circ 8'$ and $10^\\circ 43'$ N. and $77^\\circ 15'$ and $77^\\circ 55'$ E., with an area (including the Kodaik\u0101nal t\u0101luk, which formerly belonged to it) of 599 square miles. The population in 1901 was 214,972, compared with 195,050 in 1891. It contains one town, Palni (population, 17,168), the head-quarters; and 117 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 2,96,000, of which Rs. 48,000 was peshkash paid by zam\u012bnd\u0101ri estates. The t\u0101luk is bounded on the south by the Palni Hills. It is almost all unirrigated, but patches of \u2018wet\u2019 land are supplied by about 50 tanks, by the rivers Shanmukhanadi and Nang\u0101nji, and by the Nallatanga stream. Compared with other parts of the District, it is not well protected from famine.\n\n**Palni Hills.**\u2014Range of hills in Madura District, Madras, connected with the Western Gh\u0101ts and forming part of that mountain system. They lie between $10^\\circ 1'$ and $10^\\circ 26'$ N. and $77^\\circ 14'$ and $77^\\circ 52'$ E., running out from the main line of the Gh\u0101ts (which here consists of the Anaimalai and Travancore Hills) in a north-easterly direction. They are about 54 miles in length and about 15 miles wide on the average, occupying an area of 800 square miles. They get their English name from the town of Palni, which lies just to the north of them; the native appellation is Var\u0101hagiri, or \u2018boar hill.\u2019 They consist of two well-marked divisions, the more eastern of which averages from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height and is known as the Lower Palnis, while the western has a mean elevation of 7,000 feet and in one place,\nVemb\u0101di Shola Hill, rises to 8,218 feet above the sea. The favourite sanitarium of Kodaik\u0101nal, which stands on the southern edge of the central portion of the range, is about 7,200 feet in elevation.\n\nThe Palnis consist entirely of Archaean plutonic rocks of the charnockite family. On the south side these often end in steep, sheer precipices, but on the north they slope more gradually down to the plains.\n\nIn general appearance the upper ranges greatly resemble the Nilgiris. They have the same grass-covered downs with the same thick, green woods nestling in their many wrinkles, and variety in the scenery is afforded by the same bold peaks raising their shoulders above the surrounding lower levels. The annual rainfall is 65 inches, compared with an average of 47 inches at Ootacamund; but it is more evenly distributed, so that Kodaik\u0101nal avoids the three arid months at the beginning of the year which wither the vegetation at Ootacamund, but at the same time is less damp and boasts a clearer atmosphere. Though slight frosts are common in December and January, the climate is also milder on the whole.\n\nThe forests on the higher levels contain some teak and black-wood, and on the lower slopes Pterocarpus is common; but difficulties of transport are considerable. English fruit and vegetables grow readily at Kodaik\u0101nal, and on the Lower Palnis nearly 6,000 acres are cultivated with coffee, mostly with the aid of European capital. There is only one regular gh\u0101t up the hills, and that is the bridle-path which leads to Kodaik\u0101nal from the south. The foot of this is 30 miles from the station of Ammayan\u0101yakkan\u016br on the South Indian Railway, and visitors always go to the sanitarium by this route. The hills on that side are so steep that the construction of a cart-track up them would present considerable difficulties; 'traces' have been made for roads to the summit from other directions, but hitherto lack of funds has prevented their construction.\n\nThe Palnis are inhabited by several indigenous communities, but these are immigrants from the low country who do not differ in physical characteristics from their fellow castemen who still reside on the plains. The most noteworthy of them are the Paliyans, who are also found on the Anaimalais and the Western Gh\u0101ts where they run through Tinnevelly. They are described as a miserable jungle-folk, who have no settled habitations, dwell in crevices in rocks or the rudest of huts, and live upon leaves, roots, vermin, and honey.\n\nThe other inhabitants of the range subsist mainly by cultivation. Rice is one of the chief crops; and the skill with which the mountain streams are diverted so as to irrigate successions of narrow terraces excavated down the slopes of the hills is a strong testimony to the ingenuity and industry of the people.\nPalni Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Madura District, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 28' N. and 77\u00b0 31' E., 34 miles west of Dindigul, and 69 miles north-west of Madura city. The population in 1901 was 17,168. Palni was created a municipality in 1886. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 14,300 and Rs. 13,800 respectively. In 1903-4 the income, most of which was derived from tolls and the taxes on houses and land, was Rs. 20,400; and the expenditure was Rs. 20,000. The chief object of interest is an ancient temple to Subrahmanya, which is resorted to by crowds of devotees from many parts of Southern India and especially from Malabar. The town at present suffers from lack of railway communication, but several schemes for remedying this are under consideration.\n\nP\u0101loncha Samasth\u0101n.\u2014A samasth\u0101n or tributary estate in the south-east of Warangal District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, consisting of six sub-t\u0101luks, with an area of about 800 square miles, and a population (1901) of 38,742. The revenue is said to be only Rs. 70,000, and the tribute paid to the Niz\u0101m is Rs. 45,875. The estate further receives an annual sum of Rs. 4,716 as deshmukh's fees from the Niz\u0101m, and the R\u0101j\u0101 owns the estates of Bhadr\u0101chalam and Rekapalli in the God\u0101vari District of Madras.\n\nThe estate appears to have existed before the reign of Prat\u0101p Rudra of Warangal, who conferred the title of Ashwarao on the R\u0101j\u0101 in appreciation of the latter's horsemanship, ashwa in Sanskrit meaning 'horse.' After the capture of Warangal by the Musalm\u0101ns, the king of Delhi bestowed the parganas of Hasan\u0101b\u0101d and Sankargiri (P\u0101loncha) upon Anappa Ashwarao in 1324, and these remained in possession of the family for eighteen generations till 1698. In 1769 Narsinha Ashwarao was killed in battle by Zafar-ud-daula, who plundered the R\u0101j\u0101's treasury and took possession of all the documents and ancient sanads engraved on copper-plates. In 1798 the Niz\u0101m granted a sanad to Venkatr\u0101m Ashwarao, with the stipulation that he should maintain 2,000 cavalry and 3,000 foot soldiers; but this condition did not long remain in force. Internal feuds and dissensions between the two principal branches of the family now commenced, and continued till 1858, when Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang, the minister of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, put an end to them by granting a fresh sanad to R\u0101j\u0101 Sit\u0101r\u0101m Chandra. At the same time the two t\u0101luks of Bhadr\u0101chalam and Rekapalli, situated along the left bank of the God\u0101vari, were taken over by the British Government. The R\u0101j\u0101, who had contracted heavy debts and had mortgaged the samasth\u0101n to a banker, died without issue. The banker collected the revenue of the State for twelve years, and at the end of that period filed a suit and obtained a decree for 6 lakhs. The Niz\u0101m paid the banker 3 lakhs in cash, sanctioned the transfer of the two\nt\u0101luks of Mall\u016br and Ramanjavaram in lieu of the balance, and confiscated the estate. The R\u0101j\u0101's mother died in 1875, but before her death she had adopted the present R\u0101j\u0101, who was her daughter's son. After a prolonged inquiry, the British Government restored the two t\u0101luks of Bhadr\u0101chalam and Rekapalli to the R\u0101j\u0101, who also received 6 t\u0101luks from the Niz\u0101m on payment of the 3 lakhs advanced to the banker. From 1324 to the present time twenty-eight R\u0101j\u0101s have ruled in succession. P\u0101loncha was originally the head-quarters of the samasth\u0101n, after which Bhadr\u0101chalam was for some time the residence of the R\u0101j\u0101, but Ashwaraopet has now become the capital.\n\nThe samasth\u0101n is very unhealthy and malarious, owing to a large portion of it being covered with thick jungle. The God\u0101vani river crosses it from north-west to south-east, dividing it into two portions, that along the right being in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, and that along the left in the Madras Presidency. The bed of the river is so deep that its waters cannot be used for irrigation.\n\nP\u0101loncha T\u0101luk.\u2014Easternmost t\u0101luk of Warangal District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 1,297 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 31,329, compared with 32,757 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains 89 villages, of which 48 are j\u0101gir, and Borgamp\u0101d (population, 3,200) is the head-quarters. This is a very thinly populated t\u0101luk, containing a large forest tract, and is very malarious. The land revenue in 1901 was only Rs. 16,000. The God\u0101vani river forms its eastern boundary, separating it from the God\u0101vani District of Madras on the east. The aboriginal tribes of Gonds and Koyas number 4,480 and 10,055 respectively. Situated to the east is the samasth\u0101n of P\u0101loncha, with a population of 38,742, 62 villages, and an area of about 800 square miles.\n\nPalt\u0101.\u2014Village in the Barrackpore subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 48' N. and 88\u00b0 22' E., on the left bank of the Hooghly river, 2 miles above Barrackpore. Population (1901), 2,038. At Palt\u0101 are situated the water-works of the Calcutta Corporation. The water is pumped up from the Hooghly river and filtered, and flows to Calcutta in pipes. At this place also the grand trunk road from Calcutta crosses the Hooghly.\n\nP\u0101lus.\u2014Village in the T\u0101sgaon t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 5' N. and 74\u00b0 31' E., on the Kar\u0101d-T\u0101sgaon road, about 10 miles north-west of T\u0101sgaon town. Population (1901), 5,070. The place consists of one broad market street and a few small lanes. The Kistna canal ends in the surrounding lands. The soil is rich, and sugar-cane is abundantly grown in the irrigated, and a good deal of cotton in the unirrigated fields.\n\nPalwal Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Gurgaon District, Punjab, lying between 27\u00b0 51' and 28\u00b0 16' N. and 77\u00b0 11' and 77\u00b0 34' E., with an area of 382\nsquare miles. It is bounded on the east and south by the United Provinces, the river Jumna forming the eastern boundary. The population in 1901 was 172,557, compared with 149,740 in 1891. It contains the two towns of Palwal (population, 12,830), the headquarters, and Hodal (8,142); and 187 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 3.2 lakhs. The parganas of Palwal and Hodal, which make up the present tahsil, were once held by General de Boigne. They were assigned by the British Government, and lapsed on the deaths of the assignees in 1813 and 1817. The tahsil is well wooded, and consists of a fertile plain watered by the Agra Canal.\n\nPalwal Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Gurgaon District, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 9' N. and 77\u00b0 20' E., on the grand trunk road between Delhi and Muttra, and also on the Delhi-Agra branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 12,830. A good road leads to Sohna (17 miles), whence the road is metalled to Gurgaon. Palwal is a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for the cotton of the surrounding country, and a cotton-ginning factory has recently been set up, which employed 207 hands in 1904. Hindu tradition identifies Palwal with the Apelava of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, which is said to have been restored by Vikram\u0101ditya. The mosque at Palwal is supported by pillars, which bear traces of Hindu idols defaced in the time of Altamsh in 1221. An elegant domed tomb of red sandstone, just outside the town on the Muttra road, is said to have been built by a fakir, who levied an impost for this purpose of one slab on every cart-load of stone which passed from Agra to Delhi for the building of the fort of Salimgarh. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 15,000 and 14,700 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 16,800, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 22,100. It maintains a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\nP\u0101mban.\u2014The island of P\u0101mban is part of the R\u0101mn\u0101d Estate in Madura District, Madras. Its central point is in 9\u00b0 16' N. and 79\u00b0 18' E.; and it lies between the mainland of Madura District on the west and Ceylon on the east, being separated from the former only by a narrow passage or channel which opens on the north into the waters of Palk Strait and on the south into the Gulf of Manaar. The island is about 11 miles long by 6 wide. The eastern half is merely a narrow strip of sand running down to join Adam's Bridge; and the remainder is based on rock of coral formation, and is chiefly covered by thorny acacias or by swamp, there being little cultivation of any kind. The chief town is R\u0101meswaram, noted for its ancient temple.\n\nThe town of P\u0101mban, which is said to derive its name from the\ntortuous, snake-like course of the above-mentioned channel, which it overlooks, is situated at the western extremity of the island in $9^\\circ 17' N.$ and $79^\\circ 14' E.$, and is one of the two largest seaports in Madura District. In 1901 the population was 3,462. A lighthouse rises 97 feet above high-water mark, showing a light visible at a distance of 12 or 14 miles. It is one of the chief points of departure for emigrants and other passengers to Ceylon, and it also receives the numerous pilgrims who visit the shrine at R\u0101meswaram. The Ceylon Government has an emigration d\u00e9p\u00f4t here. The number of passengers and pilgrims who arrive at it has increased considerably since the opening of the railway from Madura to Mandapam, on the mainland opposite the channel. The inhabitants of the town are chiefly engaged as sailors, pilots, and divers. The climate is considerably cooler than that of the mainland, and the town was formerly used as a health-resort by European officials. The ruins of a Dutch fort are still to be seen.\n\nP\u0101mban Passage or Channel is a partly artificial channel which runs between the western extremity of P\u0101mban Island and the mainland of India, connecting Palk Strait and the Gulf of Manaar. It has been deepened by the Government in order to allow sea-going ships to pass along by this quicker and more sheltered route instead of having to go round the island of Ceylon. Geological evidence tends to show that in former times the gap was bridged by a continuous isthmus; and until it was deepened the passage was quite impracticable for ships, being obstructed by two parallel ridges of rock reaching just above high-water mark and about 140 yards apart, the space between which was occupied by a confused mass of rocks lying for the most part parallel to the ridges in horizontal strata of sandstone formation. The first proposal to deepen this channel for traffic was made by Colonel Manuel Martinez, who brought the matter to the notice of Mr. Lushington, then Collector of the Southern Provinces and afterwards Governor of Madras. Nothing, however, was done until 1822, when Colonel De Havilland recommended the institution of a regular survey, which was entrusted to Ensign (afterwards Sir Arthur) Cotton, whose name is honourably associated with other great engineering projects in Southern India. Cotton\u2019s opinion was favourable; but other matters diverted the attention of Government until 1828, when Major Sim was instructed to undertake experiments in blasting and removing the rocks. His reports will be found at length in the *Journal of the Royal Geographical Society* (vol. iv). The first scientific marine survey of the channel was conducted in 1837 by Lieutenants Powell and Ethersey of the Indian Navy, assisted by Lieutenants Grieve and Christopher. The charts made on this occasion still remain the standard authority. Operations for deepening and widening the channel were begun in 1838 and continued for many years. It is now about 80 feet wide, 14 feet deep as a minimum, and\n4,232 feet in length, and is used to a large extent by coasting vessels. Navigation through it requires care, as the current is sometimes very strong.\n\nIt has now come to be recognized that, if ocean steamers are ever destined to run north of the island of Ceylon, the best route will be a ship canal across the island of P\u0101mban. It has been already mentioned that the Madura-P\u0101mban railway has been carried as far as the point on the mainland which faces P\u0101mban town. Proposals are now under consideration to bridge the channel and to carry the railway across it to R\u0101meswaram; to cut a canal through P\u0101mban Island large enough to take sea-going ships; to establish a ship-basin in one part of this canal and connect it with the railway; and eventually to continue the railway across Adam's Bridge to Ceylon. Details of these schemes have not yet been worked out; but it is anticipated that the completion of the first part of them would result in the creation of a port on the island which would attract much shipping, since the new route would afford a much shorter passage between the southern extremity of the Indian Peninsula and the ports along the north-east coast than the present voyage round Ceylon. P\u0101mban Island would form a natural breakwater which would enable large ships to anchor in still water during either monsoon\u2014to the north when the south-west wind was blowing and to the south during the north-east current. There is a depth of 6 fathoms close to the shore of the island on both the north and the south.\n\nP\u0101m\u012bdi.\u2014Town in the Gooty t\u0101luk of Anantapur District, Madras, situated in $14^\\circ 57' N.$ and $77^\\circ 36' E.$, 14 miles south of Gooty town, on the north bank of the Penner river. Population (1901), 10,657. The town is unhealthy, as its situation is low and the neighbourhood is covered with 'wet crops' irrigated from the river. There is a large colony of Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101 cotton-printers here; and P\u0101m\u012bdi chintzes are well-known throughout the Ceded Districts, and are exported in large quantities to other parts of the peninsula and to Burma. The printers are Rang\u0101ris by caste; and their handiwork, if coarse in execution, is most effective, owing to the boldness of its design and the richness of the deep-red colour (a vegetable dye) which is the foundation of almost all the patterns.\n\nPamsanngut.\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u0101si Hills, Eastern Bengal and Assam. The population in 1901 was 288, and the gross revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 50. The principal products are potatoes and millet.\n\nPan\u0101t\u012brtha.\u2014Name for the upper course of the J\u0101duk\u0101ta river in Eastern Bengal and Assam.\n\nPanch\u0101la.\u2014An ancient kingdom of Northern India, forming the centre of the Madhya-Desa or 'middle country.' There were two\ndivisions: Northern Panch\u0101la, with its capital at Ah\u012bchhatra or Adikshetra, in Bareilly; and Southern Panch\u0101la, with its capital at Kamp\u012bl, in Farrukhabad. They were divided by the Ganges, and together reached from the Him\u0101layas to the Chambal. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata we find the P\u0101ndava brothers, after leaving Hastin\u0101pur (in Meerut District) and wandering in the jungles, coming to the tournament at the court of Drupada, king of Panch\u0101la, the prize for which was the hand of his daughter, Draupadi. The scene of the contest is still pointed out west of Kampil, and a common flower in the village lanes bears the name of draupadi. In the second century B.C. Northern Panch\u0101la appears to have been a kingdom of some importance, for coins of about a dozen kings inscribed in characters of that period are found in various parts of it, but not elsewhere. It has been conjectured that these were the Sunga kings who, according to the Pur\u0101nas, reigned after the Mauryas; but only a single name, Agni Mitra, is found both in the Pur\u0101nic lists and on the coins, though many others are compounds with Mitra ('friend'). The coins point to an absence of Buddhistic tendencies. Var\u0101ha Mihira, the Sanskrit geographer of the sixth century A.D., mentions a people, the Panch\u0101las, who evidently inhabited the region described above.\n\n[Lassen, Ind. Alt., vol. i, p. 598; Cunningham, Coins of Ancient India, p. 79; Fleet, Ind. Ant., 1893, p. 170.]\n\nPanch\u0101nnagr\u0101m.\u2014Government estate in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal. It comprises the suburbs of Calcutta, and is so named from the 55 villages which the estate originally comprised; these were in 1757, according to Holwell, 'taken from the Twenty-four Parganas adjoining to Calcutta in order to extend its bounds.' The area is 26 square miles, and the land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,07,000. A portion of the estate pays a fixed rate of Rs. 3 per bigha (about one-third of an acre), and in the remainder rates fluctuate according to the position and advantages of the land. A list of the 55 villages originally included in the estate will be found on pp. 53 and 54, Part I of the Calcutta Census Report, 1901.\n\nPanch\u0101vada. Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nP\u0101nchet.\u2014Hill in the head-quarters subdivision of M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 37' N. and 86\u00b0 47' E., half-way between Raghun\u0101thpur and the junction of the Bar\u0101kar and D\u0101modar rivers. It is 3 miles long, stretching from north to south in a long rounded ridge, and has a height of 1,600 feet above sea-level. A fort containing the ruins of many temples, tanks, &c., was once the main seat of the R\u0101j\u0101 of P\u0101nchet. A large gathering takes place annually at a temple on the side of the hill.\n\nP\u0101nchgani.\u2014Health resort in the Wai t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 55' N. and 74\u00b0 48' E., on the Surul-Mah\u0101-\nbaleshwar road, 4,378 feet above sea-level, about 10 miles west of Wai and 11 miles east of Mah\u0101baleshwar. Population (1901), 1,312. The village lies with five others on a spur of the Western Gh\u0101ts, which juts out at Mah\u0101baleshwar and terminates about a mile from Wai. Situated to the lee of Mah\u0101baleshwar and about 200 feet lower, it escapes the heavy rain and mist of the outer range, which are carried away into the valleys to the north and south. It is also happily shielded from the east wind, by being built under a large extent of table-land. The magnificent scenery of the Kistna valley, extending for many miles from east to west, with its numerous hamlets, highly cultivated fields, and picturesque river, can be seen along the whole northern ridge of the mountain. Though less extensive, the southern aspect is even more beautiful.\n\nConsidered as a sanitarium, P\u0101nchgani stands almost unrivalled. With a temperature like that of Mah\u0101baleshwar, it has the advantage over that charming health resort of being comfortably habitable throughout the year. The climate is cool, salubrious, and comparatively dry. The annual rainfall averages 56 inches, or about a fifth of that of Mah\u0101baleshwar. The temperature varies from $55^\\circ$C at 6 a.m. in December to $96^\\circ$ at 2 p.m. in March. The mean temperature at noon is $71^\\circ$ and the mean daily range only $6^\\circ$. The European settlement was founded by private enterprise, chiefly through the energy and zeal of the late Mr. John Chesson, who, in 1854, began farming here on a small scale. By 1862 there were six substantial houses built by Europeans, and a yearly grant of Rs. 2,000 was made to the station by Government in that year.\n\nThe station is managed by a Superintendent with magisterial powers, and has, besides his office, a market, an unaided high school for European and Eurasian boys, two aided schools for European and Eurasian girls, and a dispensary. The high school, which is managed by a committee in connexion with the Diocesan Board of Education, was originally opened in 1876, and reopened in 1880 by the Bishop of Bombay. This school is the only one of its sort permanently located in the Western Gh\u0101ts for European boarders. Nurseries are attached to the station, where experiments have been made in planting exotic and other trees and shrubs and in cultivating English potatoes, which, with the peach, the pear, and the blackberry, thrive in the mild climate. The coffee of P\u0101nchgani has been favourably reported on by London brokers. Here, too, the heliotrope and myrtle grow in wild profusion. The sweet-brier, so rarely met with in India, flowers; and the eye of the traveller from the dusty plains below is gladdened with the sight of lanes bordered with festoons of hedge-roses and honeysuckle. P\u0101nchgani, always beautiful, is at its best in August and September, when the fairy pimpernel, the buttercup, and the wild sweet-pea cover\nthe hill-side, while the springy turf of the table-lands is thickly carpeted with the velvety blue-bonnet and the more delicate star-grass.\n\n**P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls** (or 'Five Subdivisions').\u2014District in the Northern Division of the Bombay Presidency, lying between $22^\\circ 15'$ and $23^\\circ 11'$ N. and $73^\\circ 22'$ and $74^\\circ 29'$ E., with an area of 1,606 square miles. It consists of two separate parts, divided by a broad strip of the B\u0101riya State of the Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101 Agency. Of these, the western portion is bounded on the north by the States of L\u016bnav\u0101da, Sunth, and Sanjeli; on the east by B\u0101riya State; on the south by Baroda State; and on the west by Baroda State, the P\u0101ndu Mehw\u0101s, and the Mah\u012b river, which separates it from Kaira District. The eastern portion is bounded on the north by the States of Chilk\u0101ri and Kush\u0101lgarh; on the east by Western M\u0101lw\u0101 and the river An\u0101s; on the south by Western M\u0101lw\u0101; and on the west by the States of Sunth, Sanjeli, and B\u0101riya.\n\nThe two sections of the District differ considerably in appearance. That to the south-west (except a hilly area covered with dense forest, comprising the P\u0101v\u0101garh hill) is a level tract of rich soil; while the other portion is much more rugged and includes many varieties of soil, from fertile twice-cropped valleys to barren stony hills. In some of the western villages, the careful tillage, the well-grown trees, and the deep sandy lanes bordered by high hedges overgrown with tangled creepers recall the wealthy tracts of Kaira. In other parts are wide stretches of woodland and forest, or bare and fantastic ridges of hills without a sign of tillage or population.\n\nThough there are many streams and watercourses, the District has no large river, except the Mah\u012b, which touches it on the north-west. The An\u0101s and P\u0101nam occasionally dry up in the hot season. The District is, however, sufficiently supplied with water. The Orw\u0101da lake near the P\u0101nam river is said never to have been dry, and to have a pillar in the centre visible only in times of extreme drought.\n\n**P\u0101v\u0101garh** in the south-west corner of the District is the only mountain of any size. It rises 2,500 feet from the plain in almost sheer precipices, and has a rugged and picturesque outline on the summit, which is strongly fortified, and was formerly a place of much consequence.\n\nExcept in its south-west corner, no detailed inquiry into the geology of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls has been made. In the eastern division, though black and clay soils occur, the surface is chiefly a somewhat shallow light-red soil much mixed with gravel. The rocks are believed to be mainly metamorphic with a few trap outliers. In the western division, near Godhra, all the surface rocks are metamorphic, and in other places metamorphic rocks alternate with beds of quartzite sandstone. The\ngeological survey of the south-west of the District shows two chief geological features: the great volcanic mass of P\u0101v\u0101garh, and a group of semi-metamorphic beds, chiefly quartzite or quartzite sandstone, known as the Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner beds. P\u0101v\u0101garh is an isolated outlier of the Deccan trap, all that remains of a range of basaltic lavas and ash-beds that stretched south to the R\u0101jp\u012bpla hills. Unlike those to the southeast, the P\u0101v\u0101garh traps lie perfectly flat. Their mineral character is in many parts peculiar. Of the numerous terraces below the upper flat of the hill, some are ordinary basaltic lava-flows; but many are of a light purple clay-rock rare in other places. Somewhat cherty in appearance and containing small crystals of glassy felspar, this rock is sometimes mottled purple and grey. It is almost always distinctly marked by planes of lamination parallel to the stratification, sometimes so finely as to be more like an ordinary shale than a volcanic rock. Similar beds are very rare in the Deccan trap, and no other instance of their development on so large a scale has been observed in Western India. The group of quartzite sandstone beds has been traced for about 20 miles east of P\u0101v\u0101garh and for 7 or 8 miles south of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner. The other beds are mostly slates, conglomerates, and limestones, ferruginous bands occasionally occurring. There are hot springs 10 miles west of Godhra at Tuva, where Kolis and Bhils assemble in March to worship Mah\u0101deo.\n\nThe most prominent trees of the District are the mango, mahu\u0101, tamarind, r\u0101yan (Mimusops hexandra), and banyan, which give the country a park-like appearance. In addition to the banyan or vad (Ficus bengalensis), other members of the fig family are met with, such as the pipri (Ficus Tsiela), the umbar or gular (F. glomerata), and the pipal (F. religiosa). In the K\u0101lol t\u0101luka rows of palmyra palms, many of them encircled by a pipal, at once attract notice. Teak and kh\u0101kra (Butea frondosa) are common. The gum of the latter is gathered by the Naikdas, who manufacture rope from its roots. Among other common trees are the samra (Prosopis spicigera), karanj (Pongamia glabra), bor (Zizyphus Jujuba), aduso (Ailanthus excelsa), simal (Bombax malabaricum), and shamla (Eriodendron anfractuosum). The commonest shrubs are the onkla (Alangium Lamarckii), and the sit\u0101phal or custard-apple (Anona squamosa). Of climbing shrubs, the kavaj (Mucunna pruriens), gavria (Canavalia ensiformis), and Ipomoea sepia with its pale pink flowers are of frequent occurrence. The lotus is found in the marshes. Among Labiatae and Amarantaceae the most noticeable are Leucas linifolia, L. Cephalotes, Celosia argentea, and Achyranthes aspera. The milk-bush (Euphorbia Tirucalli) and prickly-pear (Opuntia nigricans) are common in hedges.\n\nWhen in 1861 the District was taken over by the British Government, big game of all sorts and many kinds of deer abounded. Wild\nelephants were common three centuries ago, and fifty years back tigers were numerous. The number is now greatly reduced. Snakes are common throughout the District, especially in and near Godhra.\n\nIn healthiness the climate varies greatly. The well-tilled parts, K\u0101l\u014dl in the west and Dohad in the east, would seem to be free from any special form of sickness, and to be healthy for new-comers as well as for the local population. Godhra, surrounded by large areas of forest and waste, though fairly healthy for residents, is a trying climate for strangers. The hot and rainy seasons have a depressing effect on Europeans. The mean temperature is $83^\\circ$.\n\nIn the eastern division the rains are late in their arrival. H\u0101l\u014dl petha has the heaviest average fall (41 inches); the lowest is in Dohad (30). The average rainfall at Godhra town is 38 inches, mainly received during the south-west monsoon. The rainfall is generally heavier than in other Gujar\u0101t Districts, owing to the proximity of the R\u0101jpipla hills.\n\nThe history of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls is the history of the city of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner, now a heap of ruins. During the Hindu period Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner, founded about the end of the eighth century, was a stronghold of the Anhily\u0101da kings and of the Tu\u0101r dynasty. The Chauh\u0101ns followed the Tu\u0101rs, and retained possession of it and of the surrounding country until the appearance of the Muhammadans under Mahm\u016bd Begara in 1484. From this time until 1536 Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner remained the political capital of Gujar\u0101t. In 1535 Hum\u0101y\u016bn pillaged the city, and in the following year the court and capital were transferred to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s under Sindhia overran and annexed the District in the middle of the eighteenth century; and it was not until 1853 that the administration was transferred to the British. In 1861 ownership was also transferred, and Sindhia received compensation for the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls in lands near Jh\u0101nsi. At this date the District was placed under the Political Agent for Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101. In 1864 the revenue was made payable through Kaira; and in 1877 the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls were formed into a distinct Collectorate. Since 1853 the peace has been twice disturbed\u2014once in 1858 by an inroad of mutineers, under T\u0101nt\u012b\u0101 Top\u012b; and a second time in 1868, when the Naikd\u0101s (said to be the Muhammadan descendants of the population of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner) rose, but were dispersed by Captain Macleod and a detachment of the Poona Horse. The chief criminal, Joria, was hanged.\n\nThere are few remains of archaeological interest in the District. On the hill of P\u0101v\u0101garh are the ruins of the S\u0101t Mahal or \u2018seven-storeyed palace,\u2019 from which the ladies of the zan\u0101na used to witness the pleasures of the chase; the M\u0101chi Haveli or \u2018terrace palace,\u2019 Makai Koth\u0101r or \u2018maize storehouse,\u2019 and the Navl\u0101kh Koth\u0101r or \u2018nine-lakh\ngranaries.' The summit is occupied by a famous shrine of K\u0101lika M\u0101ta; and there are some mediaeval temples on the hill. The J\u0101ma Masjid of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner is known for its massive grandeur and perfect finish (1414), and some finely decorated mosques and tombs are buried in the adjacent jungle.\n\nThe District contains 4 towns and 689 villages. At the last four enumerations the population was: (1872) 240,743; (1881) 255,479; (1891) 313,417, and (1901) 261,020. The decrease in 1901 was due to the famine of 1900, which pressed with great severity on Bhils and other wild tribes of the District. The three principal towns in the District are: Godhra, the head-quarters, Dohad, and Jalol. The taluka areas and population are as follows:\n\n| Talukas | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|---------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Dohad   | 607                 | 1              | 114      | 58,887     | 150                       | -14                                             | 3,096                                  |\n| Jalol petha | 98               |                |          | 31,931     |                           | -35                                             | 1,307                                  |\n| Godhra  | 585                 | 1              | 225      | 96,406     | 165                       | -10                                             | 5,680                                  |\n| Jalol   | 414                 | 1              | 80       | 39,964     | 178                       | -15                                             | 3,255                                  |\n| Jalol petha | 172             |                |          | 33,832     |                           | -17                                             | 1,482                                  |\n\nDistrict total 1,606 4 689 261,020 163 -17 14,820\n\nOf the total population, 210,521, or 80 per cent., are Hindus, and 21,349, or 5 per cent., Muhammadans. Gujarati is spoken by 97 per cent. of the inhabitants.\n\nAmong the Hindus the most numerous castes are Kolis (49,000) and Patelias (10,000). The majority of the aboriginal tribes are Bhils, who number 98,000, or 37 per cent. of the total population; other aborigines number 8,000, nearly all Naikd\u0101s. Until recent years the aboriginal tribes were turbulent, and much addicted to thieving and drunkenness. The Bhils, as a rule, now cultivate the same fields continuously, although many still practise nomadic tillage on patches of forest land, which they abandon after a year or two. Formerly, they never entered a town except to plunder, but now they crowd the streets, selling grain, wood, and grass. The Naikd\u0101s are found only in the wildest parts, chiefly in Jalol, and are employed as labourers and woodcutters; a few practise nomadic tillage. The Bhils and Naikd\u0101s do not live in villages, but each family has a separate dwelling; and they are still prone to move from place to place for superstitious reasons. The agricultural population of the District is being steadily strengthened by an immigration of Kunbis from neighbouring tracts. These now amount to 2.4 per cent. of the whole, and are chiefly found in the\nwestern portion. The Muhammadan population consists largely of the trading Bohr\u0101s and a caste of oilmen known as Gh\u0101nchis (7,000). These men, as their name implies, are generally oil-pressers; but in former times they were chiefly employed as carriers of merchandise between M\u0101lw\u0101 and the coast. The changes that have followed the introduction of railways have in some respects reduced the prosperity of these professional carriers, and the Gh\u0101nchis complain that their trade is gone. Much of the best cultivated land in the neighbourhood of Godhra and Dohad is in their hands; and, though turbulent on occasions, they are, as a class, so intelligent, pushing, and thrifty, that there seems little reason to doubt that before long they will be able to take advantage of some opening for profitable employment.\n\nThe District is an agricultural one, more than 71 per cent. of the people depending on the land. Of the rest, 11 per cent. are supported by industries and 9 per cent. by general labour. Trade is in the hands of the Bani\u0101s (7,000) and Bohr\u0101s (5,000), the latter monopolizing the very considerable timber business. The Bani\u0101s are well represented in all villages of any size.\n\nIn 1872 there were only 24 Christians, representing European officers and their servants. According to the Census of 1901 there were 489 native Christians, mostly in the Dohad t\u0101luka (329); and 17 Europeans and Eurasians. The Irish Presbyterian Mission has stations at Dohad and Jh\u0101lod, and the American Methodist-Episcopal Mission works at Godhra. The Salvation Army has been working in Dohad and Jh\u0101lod since 1890. The Irish Presbyterian Mission maintains altogether 9 schools, of which 4 in Jh\u0101lod are for Bh\u012bls, 4 orphanages, and 2 agricultural settlements at Dohad and R\u0101jespur, on which the boys of the schools are settled after two years' training. The American Mission maintains a girls' school and 10 village schools. Marriages according to Christian rites have been solemnized between 19 couples of Bhil converts.\n\nThe soil of the District differs considerably from that of Western Gujar\u0101t. There are great varieties of soil: alluvial in the north-west of Godhra; m\u0101l, a dull black soil, to the south of Godhra; and beyond that a large tract of light gor\u0101du land. The soil of the eastern division is both light and black, and, owing to the abundance of water, is very productive. An area of about 40,000 acres is capable of bearing two crops\u2014maize followed by gram or wheat\u2014without irrigation.\n\nThe tenures of the District are ryotw\u0101ri (41 per cent.), t\u0101lukd\u0101ri (25 per cent.), mehw\u0101si (6 per cent.), and leasehold (9 per cent). About 18 per cent. consists of in\u0101m and j\u0101gir estates. The chief statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134 are shown in the following table, in square miles:\u2014\nMaize is the staple food-crop of the District (161 square miles), and is especially important in the Dohad taluka. Next in importance is bajra (81), grown chiefly in K\u0101l\u014dl and Godhra. The other crops largely cultivated are rice (67), gram (63), and sesamum (65). Gram is mainly produced in Dohad and Godhra. Rice is of inferior quality. Tur and castor are also grown, as well as small quantities of sugar-cane in Godhra and K\u0101l\u014dl, and til (sesamum) is sown in partly cleared or new fields. Since 1902 cotton has been raised in K\u0101l\u014dl and H\u0101l\u014dl. During the decade ending 1903-4, 9.5 lakhs was advanced to cultivators for improvement of land and the purchase of seed and cattle, of which 4.6 lakhs was lent in 1900-1 and nearly 2 lakhs in 1901-2.\n\nLittle care is taken in breeding cattle. The bullocks are poor, small, and weak, but hardy and active, and can work on the poorest fare. Horses are small and poor, the result of careless breeding and bad keep. Goats are fairly plentiful. Sheep are few and are confined to Dohad; they are of poor breed.\n\nThe fields are watered from rivers, tanks, and wells, the total area irrigated in 1903-4 being 3 square miles. Wells supplied 1,660 acres, tanks 125, Government canal 12, and other sources 3 acres. There are altogether 2,582 wells, 3 tanks, and one Government work, the Muvalia tank. From rivers water is drawn by means of rough wooden lever-lifts (dhekudis), costing about Rs. 3 to set up. As springs are found close to the surface, wells are seldom sunk deeper than from 15 to 30 feet.\n\nThe P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls form the only District in Gujar\u0101t with a large forest area. Till 1860 the produce of these forests was in little demand, and much damage had been done to them by previous neglect. There remains in consequence little timber of any size. In 1866 the construction of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway raised the value of timber. Efforts were then made to introduce a more efficient system of management. The District possesses 331 square miles of forest, and the forest revenue amounted in 1903-4 to 1\u00bd lakhs. The timber and firewood are chiefly exported, about 40 per cent. of the former and 20 per cent. of the latter being consumed locally. Except the flowers of the mahu\u0101, the minor produce is of little consequence. The flowers are gathered for export, while the tree also supplies food and drink to the Bhils, and furnishes excellent timber. The rayan\ngrows in beautiful clusters, and its fruit forms the chief food of the poorest classes.\n\nCompared with other Gujar\u0101t Districts the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls are rich in minerals. The hills contain iron, lead, manganese, and mica. Iron ore is found in the village of P\u0101lanpur in the H\u0101lol t\u0101luka and near J\u0101mbughoda and Shivr\u0101jpur in H\u0101lol, but is not worked. Mining for manganese on a large scale is now being carried on in H\u0101lol by a European firm. Lead ore occurs in N\u0101rukot, but is too poor in silver to repay the cost of working. Tale is quarried near the N\u0101rukot hills. A useful sandstone for paving is found at B\u0101jarw\u0101da, and the common Godhra granite, a very durable stone, is worked 9 miles from P\u0101li station.\n\nThe through trade of the District was once very flourishing, especially after the reduction of transit duties; but the opening of the M\u0101lw\u0101 line of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 State Railway into Central India from Khandw\u0101 interfered for a time with this traffic. The recently constructed railway from Godhra to Ratl\u0101m has now revived it. The chief exports to Gujar\u0101t are grain, mahu\u0101 flowers, timber, and oilseeds; the chief imports from Gujar\u0101t are tobacco, salt, coco-nuts, hardware, and piece-goods. Timber is the chief article of export, and most of it comes from the B\u0101riya and Sanjeli forests. The only industry of any importance is the making of lac bracelets at Dohad. Dohad is also looked upon as a granary in time of necessity for M\u0101lw\u0101, Mew\u0101r, and Gujar\u0101t.\n\nThe Anand-Godhra branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway and the Godhra-Ratl\u0101m-Nagda Railway pass through the District from west to east, connecting Godhra with Anand on the west and Dohad on the east. The former traverses the District for 15 miles, the latter for 39 miles. A chord-line from Baroda to Godhra, which was opened in 1904, traverses the District for 17 miles. There are four main roads, one connecting L\u016bnav\u0101da with Godhra, while another runs from the railway at Sunth Road to the Sunth border. The old road running parallel to the railway line from Anand to Dohad is still maintained where it passes through this District, and a branch of it, metalled and bridged, connects Jh\u0101lod with the railway at Limkheda in B\u0101riya. There is a bridged but unmetalled road from Godhra to K\u0101l\u014dl and H\u0101l\u014dl, and thence across to the J\u0101mbughoda frontier. A metalled road from Limbdi through Dohad to the Ali-r\u0101jpur frontier has recently been completed. The total length of roads in the District in 1903\u20134 was: metalled, 82 miles; unmetalled, 68 miles. Of the former, 45 miles of Provincial roads and 37 miles of local roads are maintained by the Public Works department. Avenues of trees are planted along 38 miles.\n\nIn 1845 the maize crop was destroyed by locusts. During the twenty\nyears ending 1879 want of rain caused scarcity and distress on five occasions, 1853, 1857, 1861, 1864, and 1877. The District again suffered in 1899. Relief works were opened in September, 1899, and continued till October, 1902. The highest daily average relieved was: on works, 71,204 (July, 1900); and gratuitously, 75,188 (August). It is calculated that nearly 300 persons and over 200,000 cattle died from privation in 1899-1902. The cost of relief measures in this and the adjacent District of Kaira was 88 lakhs. Remissions of land revenue amounting to over 35 lakhs were granted in the two Districts. Advances to agriculturists amounted to 8\u00bd lakhs in the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls alone.\n\nIn the Godhra and K\u0101l\u014dl t\u0101lukas crops are occasionally injured by mildew, insects, or frost; and in 1903-4 the early crops suffered severely from locusts.\n\nFor purposes of administration the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls form a non-regulation District under the charge of an officer styled the Collector, who is also Political Agent, Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101. The District is divided into two divisions, in charge of an Assistant and a Deputy-Collector respectively. There are three t\u0101lukas, Doh\u0101d, Godhra, and K\u0101l\u014dl, and two pethas or petty subdivisions, Jh\u0101lod and H\u0101l\u014dl.\n\nFor civil judicial purposes the District is included in the jurisdiction of the Judge of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, while since 1905 it has been part of the Broach Sessions Division. There are two Sub-Judges for civil work, at Doh\u0101d and Godhra, and eight officers to administer criminal justice. The commonest forms of crime are theft of cattle and house-breaking, in both of which the aboriginal tribes are proficient.\n\nBefore the management of the District was taken over by the British, the chief revenue contractor recovered the revenue under several systems. Villages in the hands of large landholders paid a lump sum fixed on an estimate of their probable revenue. Others were represented by their headmen, who were responsible for an amount fixed on a rough estimate of what the village could afford to pay. Some villages were leased in groups to sub-contractors on five-year leases, with yearly increasing rents. In other cases the division of crops and levy of a plough cess fixed by the revenue superintendent, or desai, varied according to the caste of the cultivator from Rs. 2 to Rs. 15 a plough, or, at the rate of 7 acres to a plough, from 4 annas to Rs. 2 an acre. When spice, sugar-cane, and other rich crops were grown, an extra cess was levied. In villages where a division of crops was in force the Government share varied from a third to a half. When the British took over the management in 1853, the Government respected the position of the large landlords, t\u0101lukd\u0101rs, and th\u0101kurs, who were chiefly Kolis owning estates varying from one village to forty or fifty. These\nvillages were valued, and a certain proportion of the full assessment was fixed as the rent for a period of years. The alienations of Government villages were inquired into and settled on an equitable basis. The transit duties and other vexatious levies of the former government were abolished. On the transfer of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls from Sindhia in 1861, they were in the first instance placed under the Political Agent for Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101. In the same year the survey settlement of H\u0101l\u014dl, Dohad, and Jh\u0101lod was carried out, to be followed in 1870 by the survey settlement of Godhra and K\u0101l\u014dl. A resettlement of the District has been in progress since 1903. The original survey found that the cultivated area was 1\u00b74 per cent. in excess of that recorded, and the settlement enhanced the total revenue from 1\u00b787 to 2\u00b702 lakhs. The present average assessment per acre of 'dry' land is R. 0-10-5 (maximum Rs. 2, minimum R. 0-14); of rice land, Rs. 2-3 (maximum Rs. 2-8, minimum R. 1); and of garden land, Rs. 2-12 (maximum Rs. 4-7, minimum Rs. 1-9).\n\nCollections of land revenue and total revenue, which are still paid through Kaira, have been as follows, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                  | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue     | 2,84   | 95     | 2,75   |\n| Total revenue    | 3,10   | 1,04   | 3,94   |\n\nOutside the municipalities of Godhra and Dohad, local affairs are managed by the District board and the three taluka boards of Godhra, K\u0101l\u014dl, and Dohad. The Local funds yielded in 1903-4 a revenue of Rs. 58,000, and the expenditure amounted to Rs. 68,000, of which about Rs. 15,000 was spent on roads and buildings and Rs. 6,000 on water-works. The chief source of income is the land cess.\n\nThe District Superintendent has the control of the police administration, assisted by 2 inspectors and 7 chief constables. There are 5 police stations. The force in 1904 numbered 504 men, working under 118 head constables, besides 8 mounted police under 2 daffad\u0101rs. There are 5 subsidiary jails and 3 lock-ups in the District, with accommodation for 73 prisoners. The daily average prison population in 1904 was 43.\n\nThe P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls stand eighth among the Districts of the Presidency in the literacy of their population, of whom 5\u00b77 per cent. (10\u00b75 males and 0\u00b78 females) were able to read and write in 1901. In 1855-6 there were only 7 schools attended by 327 pupils; by 1881 the number of schools had risen to 39 and of pupils to 2,794. In 1890-1 there were 6,499 pupils, and in 1900-1, 5,902. Private and public schools in 1903-4 numbered 124, attended by 5,628 pupils, including 1,071 girls. Of the 112 public institutions, one is managed by the\nEducational department, 96 by local boards, and 12 by municipalities, while three are unaided. These institutions include a high and middle school and 111 primary schools. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 48,000, of which Rs. 5,000 was derived from fees. Of the total, 83 per cent. was devoted to primary schools.\n\nIn 1904 the District possessed 1 hospital and 5 dispensaries. The Dohad civil hospital, established in 1870, was transferred to Godhra many years ago. These institutions contain accommodation for 69 in-patients. The total treated in 1904 numbered 36,000, including 702 in-patients. The expenditure was Rs. 10,000, of which Rs. 2,800 was met from Local and Rs. 500 from municipal funds.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 8,522, representing a proportion of 33 per 1,000, which is much above the average for the Presidency.\n\n[Sir J. M. Campbell, *Bombay Gazetteer*, vol. iii (Kaira and Panch Mahals) (1879).]\n\n**Pandare.** \u2014 Village in the Bhimthadi taluka of Poona District, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 8' N. and 74\u00b0 31' E. Population (1901), 5,254. The Nira Canal runs through the village, which is noted both for its sugar-cane industry, employing 2,000 labourers and yielding annually about 5 lakhs, and also for its stone, which is especially adapted for engraving. It contains one school with 80 boys.\n\n**Pandavgarh** (or Pandu Fort).\u2014Fort in the Wai taluka of Satara District, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 N. and 73\u00b0 45' E., 4,177 feet above sea-level, 4 miles north-west of Wai. The fort is said to have been built by the Kolhapur Silahara chief, Bhoj II (1178-93) of Panhala. About 1648 it is mentioned as being in the charge of a Bijapur Mokasd\u00e4r stationed at Wai. In 1673 it was taken by Sivaji. In 1701 Pandavgarh surrendered with Chandan Vandan to Aurangzeb's officers. In 1713 Balaji Viswanath, afterwards the first Peshwa, though closely pursued by Chandrasen Jadhav, the Maratha general or Senapati, managed to reach Pandavgarh. He was besieged here for a time by Chandrasen Jadhav's troops, who were withdrawn when Raja Sahu ordered an advance on Satara. During Trimbakji Denglia's insurrection in 1817, Pandavgarh was taken by the insurgents. It surrendered in April, 1818, to a detachment of the 9th Native Infantry Regiment under Major Thatcher. There are a few rock-cut caves at Pandavgarh, situated on a small south-east projection of the fort within the limits of Dhavdi village.\n\n**Pandharpur Taluka.** \u2014 Taluka of Sholapur District, Bombay, lying between 17\u00b0 29' and 17\u00b0 56' N. and 75\u00b0 6' and 75\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 478 square miles. There are two towns, Pandharpur (population, 32,405), the head-quarters, and Karkamb (5,571); and 83 villages. The population in 1901 was 91,928, compared with 91,261 in 1891.\nThe density, 192 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 1.5 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 10,000. Pandharpur is an open waving plain, almost bare of trees. The chief rivers are the Bh\u012bma and the M\u0101n. Along the river banks the soil is mostly deep black, and to the east of the Bh\u012bma it is especially rich. On the high-lying land the soil is shallow, black and grey, gravelly or barad. The climate is dry, and the rainfall scanty and uncertain.\n\n**Pandharpur Town.\u2014** Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Sholapur District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 41' N. and 75\u00b0 26' E., on the right or south bank of the Bh\u012bma river, 31 miles from B\u0101rsi Road station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, with which it was connected in 1906 by an extension of the B\u0101rsi Light Railway. Population (1901), 32,405. Hindus number 30,658; Muhammadans, 1,217; Jains, 514. Pandharpur is one of the most-frequented places of pilgrimage in the Bombay Presidency.\n\nThe best view of the town is from the opposite bank of the Bh\u012bma. When the river is full, the broad, winding stream, gay with boats; the islet temples of Vishnupad and N\u0101rad; the rows of domed and spired tombs on the farther bank; the crowded flight of steps leading from the water; the shady banks, and among the tree-tops the spires and pinnacles of many large temples, combine to form a scene of much beauty and life. The d\u00e9bris of former buildings have somewhat raised the level of the centre of the town. In that part the houses are comparatively well built, many of them being two or more storeys high, with plinths of hewn stone. Pandharpur is highly revered by Br\u0101hmans as containing a celebrated temple dedicated to the god Vithoba, an incarnation of Vishnu. Vithoba's temple is near the centre of that part of the town which is considered holy, and is called Pandharikshetra, or 'the holy spot of Pandhari.' It has a length from east to west of 350 feet, and a breadth from north to south of 170 feet. In honour of this god three fairs are held annually. At the first of these, in April, the attendance varies from 20,000 to 30,000 persons; at the second, in July, from 100,000 to 150,000; and at the third, in November, from 40,000 to 50,000. Every month, also, four days before the full moon, from 5,000 to 10,000 devotees assemble here. Since 1865 a tax of 4 annas per head has been levied on pilgrims at each of the three great fairs. The town was constituted a municipality in 1855, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 67,400. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 88,200, of which the pilgrim tax contributed Rs. 50,000. The town is well supplied with water from a reservoir, about a mile south-west of the town, which was built by the municipality in 1874 at a cost of 2 lakhs. The Bh\u012bma has eleven gh\u0101ts or landings.\nBesides these, several stone pavements slope to the river. Pandharpur contains a Subordinate Judge's court, six schools, including a high school, an industrial school, and a school for girls, and one dispensary. It is a station of the Indian Village Mission. During the famine of 1876-8 numbers of children were left to die by their starving parents; while the famine lasted, the children were fed in the Gop\u0101lpur relief house. When the relief house was closed, an orphanage, the only institution of its kind in the Bombay Presidency, was established from subscriptions, and the foundation stone was laid on October 10, 1878. In connexion with the orphanage a foundling home was established from Rs. 10,000 subscribed in Bombay, to which a school of industry was added in November, 1881.\n\nIn 1659 the Bij\u0101pur general Afzal Kh\u0101n encamped at Pandharpur on his way from Bij\u0101pur to Wai in S\u0101t\u0101ra. In 1774 Pandharpur was the scene of an engagement between Raghun\u0101th Rao Peshw\u0101 and Trimbak Rao M\u0101ma, sent by the Poona ministers to oppose him. In 1817 an indecisive action was fought near Pandharpur between the Peshw\u0101's horse and the British troops under General Smith, who was accompanied by Mr. Elphinstone. In 1847 the noted dacoit R\u0101ghuji Bh\u0101ngrya was caught at Pandharpur by Lieutenant (afterwards General) Gell. During 1857 the office and the treasury of the m\u0101mlatd\u0101r were attacked by rebels, but successfully held by the police. In 1879 V\u0101sudeo Balwant Phadke, a notorious dacoit leader, was captured on his way to Pandharpur.\n\nPandharpur has a large annual export trade, valued at about Rs. 3,60,000, in buka (sweet-smelling powder), gram, pulse, incense sticks, safflower oil, kumku (red powder), maize, parched rice, and snuff.\n\n[For a full account of Pandharpur, its temples, gh\u0101ts, and objects of interest, ancient and modern, see the Gazetteer of Bombay, vol. xx, pp. 415-85 (1884).]\n\nP\u0101ndhurn\u0101.\u2014Town in the Sausar tahsil of Chhindw\u0101ra District, Central Provinces, situated in 21\u00b0 36' N. and 78\u00b0 32' E., on the J\u0101m river, 54 miles south-west of Chhindw\u0101ra town, on the road from Bet\u016bl to N\u0101gpur. Population (1901), 8,904. A curious local custom may be noted. On the night of the Pol\u0101 festival the k\u014dtsw\u0101r or village watchman plants a pal\u0101s-tree (Butea frondosa) in the bed of the J\u0101m river. Next day the people of P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 contend with those of the adjoining village of Sawargaon for the possession of the tree. Stones are thrown and wounds are frequently inflicted. But in the end the P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 people must always get the tree or some calamity will occur during the year. P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 was created a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 3,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 4,000, principally derived from a house tax. Two cotton-ginning factories have recently been opened, and\na pressing factory is under construction. Cotton cloths are woven by hand. P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 contains a vernacular middle school.\n\nP\u0101ndu.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nPandua Town (also called Paruah or Peruah).\u2014Deserted town in M\u0101l\u0101da District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 25\u00b0 8' N. and 88\u00b0 10' E., at a distance of 9 miles from Old M\u0101l\u0101da, and about 20 miles from Gaur, in a north-easterly direction from both. It is called Hazrat Pandua, to distinguish it from another place of the same name in Hooghly District. Although less noteworthy than Gaur, it contains some remarkable specimens of early Muhammadan architecture; but these, like the ruins of Gaur, lay for a long time buried in almost impenetrable jungle, in which tigers and other wild animals had their lairs, till the recent clearances of the jungle made by new settlements of Sant\u0101l colonies. According to Sir William Hunter, Pandua was probably originally an outpost forming one of the many defences of the more ancient city of Gaur, and guarding the road from the north from the incursions of Kochs and R\u0101jbansis. It is more likely, however, that Pandua was older than Gaur, and that it occupied the site of Paundravardhana\u00b9, the capital of the early Hindu kingdom of that name. Traces of extensive remains of ancient date may still be seen south of the Muhammadan city of Pandua, which probably mark the site of an older town; while the numerous stones with mediaeval Hindu carvings which were used in building the Adina Masjid were evidently stripped from Hindu temples formerly standing close by.\n\nThe fortified city of Pandua, the suburbs of which reached to M\u0101l\u0101da town, extended within the ramparts for 6 miles\u00b2 due north, some 4 miles to the east of the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 river, and running nearly parallel to it. M\u0101l\u0101da town was the fortified river port south of the city at the junction of the K\u0101lindri and the Mah\u0101nand\u0101, while the suburb of Rai Kh\u0101n D\u012bghi was a similar fortified port on the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 10 miles north of M\u0101l\u0101da town. The port of Rai Kh\u0101n D\u012bghi also guarded the bridge over the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 at Pirganj on the great military road. As Pandua increased in wealth and importance, its fortifications were extended, and it was further strengthened by an outpost at Ekd\u0101la, some 20 miles to the north within the limits of the modern District of Din\u0101jpur.\n\nThe recorded history of Pandua dates from about 1350, when\n\n\u00b9 In Wilson\u2019s Vishnu Pur\u0101na (vol. ii, p. 170, footnote), Pundra is said to be a man of mixed caste whose business it was to boil sugar; and it is suggested that this caste, which possibly survives in the Pund\u0101ris or Puros, a caste still existing in the neighbourhood, and now chiefly employed in reeling cocoons, gave its name to the kingdom of Pundra (see the similar derivation suggested by General Cunningham for Gaur).\n\n\u00b2 Cunningham estimates this length as less than 4 miles.\nShams-ud-d\u012bn Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101h, one of the first independent kings of Bengal, is said to have transferred his capital temporarily from Gaur to Pandua. It has been supposed that this king and his successors, who with difficulty repelled the Delhi emperor, were influenced in their desertion of Gaur by a strategic reason, as Pandua was not accessible by water, and was probably then as now protected by almost impenetrable jungles. However this may be, it does not appear that Gaur was entirely abandoned, as the two cities seem to have existed side by side, although Pandua continued to be the chief seat of government for about seventy years (1350\u20131420). Its court name was F\u012broz\u0101b\u0101d, which during this period regularly makes its appearance on the coins, whereas that of Lakhnaut\u012b (Gaur) disappears. About 1420, in the reign of Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn, the son of the Hindu R\u0101j\u0101 K\u0101ns, the royal residence was again transferred to Gaur; but it is probable that, though its name is not again mentioned in history, Pa\u00f1dua maintained its splendour for some time and was a favourite country resort of the Bengal kings.\n\nA road paved with brick from 12 to 15 feet wide seems to have passed through the entire length of the town. From the heaps of bricks on both sides it would appear to have been a regular street lined with brick houses, of which the foundations can still be traced in many places. Near the middle is a bridge of three arches, partly constructed of stone; it is rudely built and of no great size. At the northern end of the street are evident traces of a rampart, the passage through which is called Garhdu\u0101r or the 'gate of the fortress.' At the south end many foundations can be traced, which also probably belonged to a gate. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton was of opinion that the town extended only a little way either east or west from the main street, but that a scattered suburb reached in a southerly direction as far as M\u0101lda. Entering the town, the first buildings met with are those known as the Bais-haz\u0101r\u012b and Chheh-haz\u0101r\u012b, or the establishments of 22,000 and 6,000 bighas. The former belonged to the famous saint Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn Tabr\u012bz\u012b, who came to Bengal from Persia and died in 1244; and the latter contains the tomb of M\u012br Kutb Alam and that of his father Ata-ul-hakk. This saint played an important part during the rebellion of the Hindu zam\u012bnd\u0101r R\u0101j\u0101 K\u0101ns and died in 1415. Southeast of Chheh-haz\u0101r\u012b stands the Ekl\u0101khi monument, a mausoleum erected over the tombs of Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn Muhammad Sh\u0101h, the son of R\u0101j\u0101 K\u0101ns, who died about 1430, and of his wife and son. East of this is the Golden mosque, sometimes called the Kutbsh\u0101h\u012b mosque from the name of its builder, which was constructed between 1583 and 1585.\n\nBy far the most famous, however, of all the Muhammadan remains at Gaur and Pandua is the great Adina Masjid, which stands one mile\nnorth of the last group of ruins. It was built by Sikandar Sh\u0101h, and completed in either 1369 or 1374, and is said to be a copy of the J\u0101ma Masjid at Damascus. In its present state, it is a large mass of ruins, and it has been found possible to preserve only the B\u0101dsh\u0101h k\u0101 Takht, or zan\u0101na apartment, and the bays and arches around it. One mile east of the mosque are the remains of the old palace of Pandua, called the S\u0101taisgarh; they consist of a number of tanks with galleries and baths around them and a few ruined houses.\n\nGovernment has recently taken steps for the conservation of the Adina Masjid, the Ekl\u0101khi monument, and the Golden mosque.\n\n[Martin (Buchanan-Hamilton), Eastern India, vol. ii (1838); G.

Population (1901), 2,381. It was formerly noted for its manufacture of native paper, but the industry has disappeared. In ancient times Pandua, which is now only a small village, was the seat of a Hindu R\u0101j\u0101 and was fortified by a wall and trench 5 miles in circumference, traces of which can still be seen. There is also a tower (120 feet high), built to commemorate a victory gained by the Muhammadans over the Hindus in 1340.\n\n**P\u0101ndugarh.**\u2014Fort in S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay. See P\u0101ndavgarh.\n\n**P\u0101ndukeshwar.**\u2014Village in Garhw\u0101l District, United Provinces, situated in 30\u00b0 38' N. and 79\u00b0 34' E., on the route from Srinagar to the M\u0101n\u0101 pass, at an elevation of 6,300 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 298. It is said to take its name from the P\u0101ndava brothers, who retired here to end their days in pious observances, after giving up the kingdom of Hastin\u0101pur. There is a celebrated temple of Yog-badri, in which four or five copperplates are preserved, bearing inscriptions of the Katy\u016br\u012b R\u0101j\u0101s. A primary school has 23 pupils.\n\n**P\u0101ndya.**\u2014One of the three kingdoms, the other two being Ch\u0113ra and Ch\u014dla, which in ancient times divided the South of India among them. Megasthenes (302 B.C.) speaks of a country called Pandaia; one of Asoka\u2019s inscriptions (250 B.C.) mentions the kingdom; so does Pliny (A.D. 77); and Bishop Caldwell thought that the Indian king who sent an embassy to the emperor Augustus at Rome was a Pandya sovereign. The dynasty is thus of much antiquity. Regarding its early history there is, however, little but vague tradition. Its capital\nwas at Madura, and the extensive finds of Roman copper coins in the bed of the Vaigai have been held to indicate the former existence of a Roman settlement in that neighbourhood. Kolkai ('Kolkhoi Emporium'), at the mouth of the Tambraparni, now quite silted up, was one of the principal ports, if not at one time the capital, of the Pandyas. The Singhalese epic, the Mahawansa, which was written between A.D. 459 and 477, says that a king of Ceylon married a Pandya princess, and later on the two countries were several times at war with one another.\n\nIn the tenth century the Pandyas were overthrown by the Cholas, and a dynasty called in the inscriptions the Chola-Pandya line was probably established during the second half of the eleventh century. Subsequently the Pandyas appear to have reasserted themselves, for they were in power when the Musalmans under Malik Kafur swept down the Peninsula, and they shared in the downfall of the Hindu kingdoms of the South which resulted from that invasion.\n\nPangal.\u2014Hill fort in the Nagar Karnul taluk of Mahbubnagar District, Hyderab\u0101d State, situated in 16\u00b0 15' N. and 78\u00b0 8' E., south of Pangal village, 1,800 feet above sea-level. Population of fort and village (1901), 1,227. The fort is a mile and a half long by a mile broad, having seven walls, a citadel (b\u0101l\u0101 his\u0101r) in the centre, and seven towers. Two illegible inscriptions are engraved on a couple of slabs outside the fort. A battle was fought here in 1417, between the R\u0101j\u0101s of Warangal and Vijayanagar and F\u012broz Sh\u0101h Bahmani, when the latter was defeated. Sult\u0101n Muhammad Kuli Kutb Sh\u0101h gained a decisive victory at this place over the Vijayanagar R\u0101j\u0101 in 1513. According to a Telugu inscription on the b\u0101l\u0101 his\u0101r, the king's mother, with the kiladar, Khairat Khan, lived in the fort in 1604. Naw\u0101b Niz\u0101m Ali Khan of Hyderab\u0101d also resided in one of the fort buildings from 1786 to 1789.\n\nPang\u0101si.\u2014River of Bengal. See Kum\u0101r.\n\nPangmi (Burmese, Pinhmi).\u2014A very small State in the Myelat division of the Southern Shan States, Burma, situated in 20\u00b0 35' N. and 96\u00b0 42' E., almost within the boundaries of Hsam\u00f6nghkam, but touching Yawnghwe on the east, with an area of 29 square miles. The State is rather hillier than the rest of the Myelat, and is well watered, except to the east. The population in 1901 was 3,456 (distributed in 29 villages), of whom nearly 2,000 were Danus and about 1,400 Taungyos. The Ngwegunghmu resides at Legya (population, 371), not in the village of Pangmi. The revenue in 1904\u20135 amounted to Rs. 3,600, and the tribute to the British Government is Rs. 2,000.\n\nPangtara (Burmese, Pindaya).\u2014State in the Myelat division of the Southern Shan States, Burma, lying between 20\u00b0 55' and 21\u00b0 6' N. and 96\u00b0 37' and 96\u00b0 45' E., with an area of 200 square miles. It is\nbounded on the north by Lawksawk, on the south by Poila, on the east by Maws\u00f6n, and on the west by Yengan and Kyawkku. It consists of open rolling downs, with high hills to the west, and is exceptionally well watered by affluents of the Zawgyi. Near Pangtara (population, 1,632), the residence of the Ngwegunhmu, a considerable amount of 'wet' rice is grown. About 2,600 acres of land are under cultivation. The population in 1901 was 15,014 (distributed in 91 villages), of whom more than 11,000 were Shan-Burmans and Burmans, about 2,000 Taungthus, and the rest Danus, Palaungs, and Shans. The revenue in 1904-5 amounted to Rs. 17,500 (mainly from thatahmeda), and the tribute to the British Government is Rs. 9,500.\n\nPanh\u0101la.\u2014Fort on one of the summits of the Panh\u0101la spur of the Western Gh\u0101ts, in Kolh\u0101pur State, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 48' N. and 74\u00b0 8' E. The Panh\u0101la uplands are 2,772 feet above the sea and about 700 feet above the Kolh\u0101pur plain, and the hill-top crowned by the Panh\u0101la fort rises about 275 feet above the uplands. The fort, which is about 4\u00bd miles in circumference, is ascribed to the Silh\u0101ra Bhoja R\u0101j\u0101 in the eleventh century, and the small citadel on the summit bears his name. The gateways are the work of the Bahmani dynasty of the fifteenth century, and the Tin Darw\u0101za is a good specimen of its kind, with much tracery-work on the jambs and architrave. On the establishment of the Adil Sh\u0101hi dynasty of Bij\u0101pur in 1489, Panh\u0101la was fortified with great care. In 1659, immediately after the murder of Afzal Kh\u0101n, Sivaji took Panh\u0101la from Bij\u0101pur. Thirty years later, when Sambh\u0101ji was made prisoner by Aurangzeb's general at Sangameshwar in Ratn\u0101giri, Panh\u0101la came under the Mughals. In 1701 Panh\u0101la was taken from the Mughals by R\u0101mchandra Pant Am\u0101tya, the ancestor of the present chief of B\u0101vda. In 1705 T\u0101r\u0101 Bai, the widow of R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m, made Panh\u0101la her head-quarters, and the seat of the Kolh\u0101pur government was not moved from Panh\u0101la to Kolh\u0101pur till 1782. About 1827 Panh\u0101la and P\u0101vangarh were for a time made over to the British Government. In 1844, during the minority of Sivaji IV, Panh\u0101la and P\u0101vangarh were taken by rebels, who seized Colonel Ovans, the Resident of S\u0101t\u0101ra, when on tour, and imprisoned him in Panh\u0101la. A British force under General Delamotte was sent against the rebels, and on December 1, 1844, breached the fort wall, took it by storm, and dismantled the fortifications. A garrison of 1,845 militia and 100 pieces of ordnance were left to guard the fort. Panh\u0101la is the head-quarters of the Panh\u0101la subdivision, and is the best health resort in the Kolh\u0101pur State. Opposite Sambh\u0101ji's temple is another dedicated to Jij\u0101bai S\u0101hib, the wife of Sambh\u0101ji Mah\u0101r\u0101j (1712-60). The most important Musalm\u0101n building is the shrine of S\u0101dhoba, a Muhammadan saint. It is surrounded by a wall, and is 29 feet square and, including the dome, 50 feet high. This place\nis said to have been the seat of the sage Par\u0101sar, whose name the Karvir Mah\u0101tmya associates with several objects of interest on Panh\u0101la hill. Among these objects is a rock-cut cave of the sage to the south of the fort.\n\nP\u0101nih\u0101ti.\u2014Town in the Barrackpore subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 42'$ N. and $88^\\circ 22'$ E., on the left bank of the Hooghly river. Population (1901), 11,178. Agarp\u0101ra, within the municipality, has a church, female orphanage, and school under the management of the Church Missionary Society. P\u0101nih\u0101ti has a considerable trade in rice. Until 1900 it was included in the South Barrackpore municipality, but in that year it was constituted a separate municipality. The income for the four years since the separation has averaged Rs. 8,600, and the expenditure Rs. 8,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 10,000, half of which was obtained from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 9,500.\n\nP\u0101nipat Tahsil.\u2014Southern tahsil of Karn\u0101l District, Punjab, lying between $29^\\circ 11'$ and $29^\\circ 30'$ N. and $76^\\circ 38'$ and $77^\\circ 10'$ E., on the right bank of the Jumna, with an area of 462 square miles. The population in 1901 was 196,284, compared with 184,856 in 1891. It contains the town of P\u0101nipat (population, 26,914), the head-quarters; and 172 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 3.5 lakhs. On the east lie the Jumna lowlands, rich, picturesque, and unhealthy. West of the railway line the country lies at a higher level. The soil is in places saline, and considerable tracts are in consequence uncultivated, but the tahsil enjoys a high degree of prosperity. The uplands are irrigated by the Western Jumna Canal.\n\nP\u0101nipat Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Karn\u0101l District, Punjab, situated in $29^\\circ 24'$ N. and $76^\\circ 59'$ E., on the Delhi-Umballa-K\u0101lka Railway; 1,009 miles by rail from Calcutta, 1,035 from Bombay, and 916 from Kar\u0101chi. Population (1901), 26,914. The town is of high antiquity, being mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as one of the five places demanded by Yudhishthira from Duryodhana as the price of peace. In Muhammadan times it would appear to have been of considerably greater importance than it is now. It was from P\u0101nipat that prince Hum\u0101y\u016bn plundered Delhi in 1390, and he was defeated in the neighbourhood by Ab\u016b Bakr. P\u0101nipat was seven years later held for T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n and taken by Ikb\u0101l Kh\u0101n, and in the next year deserted on Tim\u016br's approach. During the reign of Bahlol Lodi his son Niz\u0101m Kh\u0101n, afterwards Sikandar Lodi, seized P\u0101nipat and made it his head-quarters. But its chief title to fame lies in that it was the scene of the three most decisive battles of Northern India: the defeat of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lodi by B\u0101bar in 1526, the defeat by Akbar of Himu, the Hindu general of Adil Sh\u0101h, in 1556, and Ahmad Sh\u0101h's\nvictory over the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1761. An indecisive battle was also fought at P\u0101nipat between the Sikhs and the Delhi emperor in 1767. The pargana of P\u0101nipat was made over to General Perron by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and passed to the British in 1803. The chief monument of antiquity is the tomb of the Muhammadan saint Kalandar (also said to be buried at Karn\u0101l), erected by the sons of Al\u0101-ud-din of Ghor. P\u0101nipat was the head-quarters of the District until 1854. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 26,400, and the expenditure Rs. 26,200. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 27,400, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 28,000. Local manufactures include brass vessels, cutlery, and silvered glass; and the town has a cotton-press and a combined ginning and pressing factory. The number of operatives employed in 1904 was 500. The Muhammadan community maintains an Arabic school, and the municipality an Anglo-veracular middle school. The town contains a dispensary.\n\nPanj\u0101b.\u2014See Punj\u0101b.\n\nP\u0101njalamkurichi.\u2014Village in the t\u0101luk of Ottappid\u0101ram, Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in 8\u00b0 56' N. and 78\u00b0 3' E., 2 miles from Ottappid\u0101ram town. It was formerly the stronghold of Kattabomma Naik, a rebel polig\u0101r who gave the British much trouble at the end of the eighteenth century. The place was first taken by Colonel Fullarton in 1783. In 1799, during the first Polig\u0101r War, it was again captured by the British and the polig\u0101r was hanged. In 1801 it was once more a centre of disaffection, and was stormed after a most stubborn resistance. This contributed largely to the complete subjugation of the polig\u0101rs of the South. The fort was not only pulled down and levelled to the ground, but the very site was ploughed over and cultivated. Nothing now remains to mark the spot but a few traces of the mound erected as a breaching battery, and the enclosure in the neighbourhood containing the tombs of the officers and men of the British force who fell in the fight. A few more such tombs are also to be found near Ottappid\u0101ram.\n\nPanjim.\u2014Capital of Portuguese India. See Goa City.\n\nPanjnad.\u2014River in the Punjab, formed by the united waters of the Sutlej, Be\u0101s, R\u0101vi, Chen\u0101b, and Jhelum. Its length is 44 miles to the junction with the Indus.\n\nPann\u0101 State.\u2014A sanad State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Political Agency, lying between 23\u00b0 49' and 24\u00b0 53' N. and 79\u00b0 45' and 81\u00b0 3' E., with an area of 2,492 square miles. The territory is distributed over three detached tracts, situated round the towns of Pann\u0101, Baksw\u0101ho (24\u00b0 17' N. and 79\u00b0 19' E.), and Birsinghpur (24\u00b0 46' N. and 81\u00b0 1' E.). It is bounded on the north by the British District of B\u0101nd\u0101 and the States of Ajaigarh and\nBhaisaunda; on the east by the States of Kothi, N\u0101god, Soh\u0101wal, and Ajaigarh; on the south by the Jubbulpore and Damoh Districts of the Central Provinces; and on the west by the States of Chhatarpur, Charkh\u0101r\u012b, Bij\u0101war, and the Alipura J\u0101g\u012br. The greater part of its area lies on the branch of the Vindhya, known as the Pann\u0101 range, which traverses Bundelkhand from south-west to north-east. The only river of any importance is the Ken, which separates it from Chhatarpur.\n\nThe geology of the State is unusually interesting, owing to the valuable mineral deposits which exist within its boundaries. The Pann\u0101 range consists principally of the upper Rewah sandstone of the Vindhyan series, and has long been famous for its diamond mines. The circumstances of the distribution of the diamonds are, however, very imperfectly understood. The mines are found scattered over an area of about 50 miles lying east and west of the town of Pann\u0101, which is situated at the centre of the productive tract. The diamonds occur as pebbles in a conglomerate, and also in a pebbly clay derived from it by disintegration. The lower Rewah series is composed of three strata, the upper being the Jh\u012br\u012b shales, the second lower Rewah sandstone, and the third a narrow shale band known as the Pann\u0101 shales. In the last of these the diamond-bearing conglomerate is intercalated at a variable horizon. The clay deposits are scattered in a capricious manner, often at great distances from any known outcrop of the conglomerate. The position of several of these beds, indeed, makes the theory that the gem-bearing gravel is a recent alluvium quite untenable. It is probable that the formation is an old one, and related to, if not identical with, the pebbly clays which have been met with at the base of the cretaceous Lameta rocks. Lameta outcrops occur near Pann\u0101, and are overlaid by some of the easternmost remnants of the Deccan trap known to exist on the Vindhyan table-land. In the western parts near Baksw\u0101ho an interesting and varied sequence of geological formations is met with, in which the Deccan trap, cretaceous Lametas, Rewahs, Kaimurs, Lower Vindhya, Bij\u0101wars, and Bundelkhand gneiss are all typically represented.\n\nA considerable area of the State is covered with forest, consisting largely of stunted teak and thick small tree and scrub jungle of species of Grewia, Zizyphus, Carissa, Woodfordia, Flueggea, Phyllanthus, Capparis, Acacia, Anogeissus, Terminalia, Boswellia, Butea, Bassia, Diospyros, and others.\n\nThe fauna are the same as those met with elsewhere in Central India, tiger, bear, s\u0101mbar (Cervus unicolor), and wild hog being common. Small game of all kinds is plentiful. In former days\n\n---\n\n1 E. Vredenburg, 'Geology of the State of Pann\u0101,' in Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxiii, pt. iv, p. 262.\nelephants were caught in these forests in large numbers, and Abul Fazl, in detailing the places where these animals were captured, adds that the elephants from Pann\u0101 are the best. The climate is hot but healthy, and the annual rainfall averages 42 inches.\n\nThe Pann\u0101 chiefs are Bundel\u0101 R\u0101jputs, descended from the Orchh\u0101 house. After the revolt and subsequent death of Jhujh\u0101r Singh of Orchh\u0101 in 1635, the whole of Bundelkhand was plunged into anarchy. Taking advantage of this state of affairs, Champat Rai, a grandson of Udot Singh, the brother of Madhukar of Orchh\u0101, commenced harassing the Mughals in every possible way, and finally established himself as the recognized leader of the Bundel\u0101 cause. For some time he was regarded with favour by Aurangzeb, to whom he had been of material assistance before the battle of S\u0101mogarh, in piloting his army across the fords of the Chambal river. Later he fell into disfavour and was attacked by the Mughal forces. To escape capture he was at his own request killed by his wife, who committed suicide immediately after.\n\nHis son Chhatars\u0101l, though only a youth, carried on his father\u2019s work, and acting more systematically rapidly acquired possession of the territory east of the Dhas\u0101n river, even extending his operations into the country round Gwalior and Eastern M\u0101lw\u0101. By 1671 he was virtually ruler of all Bundelkhand, his dominions extending from B\u0101nd\u0101 in the north to Jubbulpore in the south, and from Rewah in the east to the Betw\u0101 river in the west. Orchh\u0101 and Dati\u0101, however, were held by other chiefs of the same clan.\n\nChhatars\u0101l\u2019s first capital was K\u0101linjar, always the key to this region from the earliest days. After he had consolidated his power he moved, in 1675, to Pann\u0101, which at various periods shared with Chhatarpur (founded by him in 1707) and Jaitpur the honour of being his residence. The death of Aurangzeb gave him increased opportunities for strengthening his position, of which he took every advantage. In 1729 the emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h sent Muhammad Kh\u0101n Bangash into Bundelkhand to check his growing power, and Chhatars\u0101l was driven from Jaitpur. Reduced to extremities, he appealed for assistance to the Peshw\u0101, B\u0101j\u012b Rao I, who at once responded, and Muhammad Bangash, after a siege of six months, was expelled by the allies from Jaitpur (1730). In 1731 Chhatars\u0101l divided his vast possessions. The largest share, valued at 39 lakhs annually, which included Pann\u0101, fell to Hirde S\u0101h, his eldest son; the second, in Saugor District, valued at 32 lakhs, was granted to the Peshw\u0101 in return for his services; the third, including Jaitpur, and valued at 31 lakhs, went to his third son, Jagat R\u0101j, while numerous smaller grants were made to other vassals. Chhatars\u0101l died about 1732, at the age of eighty-nine, leaving twenty-two legitimate and thirty\nillegitimate sons, whose descendants now hold Pann\u0101, Charkh\u0101r\u012b, Ajaigarh, Bij\u0101war, Sar\u012bla, Jaso, Jign\u012b, and Lug\u0101si. The Mah\u0101-r\u0101j\u0101 of Pann\u0101 is looked on as the senior representative of the Bundel\u0101 chiefs east of the Dhas\u0101n, who were known as the Dang\u0101hi Bundel\u0101 chiefs, from their turbulent disposition (danga). Hirde S\u0101h (1732\u20139) on succeeding made Pann\u0101 his capital, and the State may be said to reckon its existence as a separate chiefship from this date. He was succeeded by Sabh\u0101 Singh (1739\u201352), in whose time the famous diamond mines were first worked. The next ruler, Am\u0101n Singh (1752\u20138), was murdered by his brother Hindupat (1758\u201377). Hindupat passed over his eldest son in favour of a younger, Anirudh (1777\u20139). Anirudh being a minor, the State was left in charge of Beni Haz\u016br\u012b and a Br\u0101hman, Khemr\u0101j Chaube. The jealousies of these two plunged the State into a civil war, which was intensified by the death of Anirudh and the rivalry of numerous claimants. During this period the area of Pann\u0101 was much reduced, as Beni Haz\u016br\u012b, Khemr\u0101j, and one Sone S\u0101h Ponw\u0101r carved out States for themselves, founding respectively Maihar, P\u0101ldeo, and Chhatarpur. Ultimately Dhokal Singh (1785\u201398), brother of Anirudh, was able to establish himself on the gadd\u012b. Owing to these internal dissensions, Bundelkhand in 1789 became an easy prey to the Gosain leader, Himmat Bah\u0101dur, and his confederate Ali Bah\u0101dur (afterwards known as the Naw\u0101b of B\u0101nd\u0101), who was the son of Shamsher Bah\u0101dur, an illegitimate son of the Peshw\u0101. Ali Bah\u0101dur assumed suzerainty over Bundelkhand and proceeded to grant sanads to all the local chiefs, including Dhokal Singh. When the British supremacy was established, Kishor Singh (1798\u20131840) was nominally ruling, though actually an exile. He was reinstated and confirmed in his possessions by sanads granted in 1807 and 1811. He was succeeded by Harbans Rai (1840\u20139) and Nripat Singh (1849\u201370). During the Mutiny the R\u0101j\u0101 assisted the British in holding the fort of K\u0101linjar and clearing Damoh District of rebels. For these good services he was rewarded with a khilat of Rs. 20,000 and the Simaria pargana; and in 1869 he received the grant of the personal title of Mahendra, which was made hereditary in 1875. In 1862 a sanad of adoption was conferred upon him, and in 1863 he ceded the land required for the East Indian Railway. He was succeeded by Rudra Prat\u0101p Singh (1870\u201393), who was made a K.C.S.I. in 1876, and received an addition of two guns to his salute as a personal honour in 1877. This chief was succeeded by his brother Lokp\u0101l Singh (1893\u20137), who was followed by M\u0101dho Singh. The latter was deposed in 1902, for complicity in the murder of his uncle, Rao R\u0101j\u0101 Khum\u0101n Singh. The present chief, Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 J\u0101dvendra Singh, son of Rao R\u0101j\u0101 Khum\u0101n Singh, was born in 1893 and is now being educated at the Mayo College at Ajmer. The ruler of the\nState bears the titles of His Highness and Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Mahendra, and receives a salute of 11 guns.\n\nThe population of the State has been: (1881) 227,306, (1891) 239,333, and (1901) 192,986, showing a density of 77 persons per square mile. During the last decade there has been a decrease of 19 per cent., mainly owing to famine. Hindus number 173,735, or 90 per cent.; Animists, 12,249, or 6 per cent.; and Musalm\u0101ns, 5,021.\n\nThe State contains one town, Pann\u0101 (population, 11,346), the capital; and 1,008 villages. The prevailing castes are Br\u0101hmans, 22,700, or 12 per cent.; Cham\u0101rs, 19,600, or 11 per cent.; Lodh\u012bs, 15,600, or 8 per cent.; and Ah\u012brs and Kurm\u012bs, 12,600, or 7 per cent. each. About 38 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture and 27 per cent. by general labour.\n\nOf the total area, 466 square miles, or 19 per cent., are under cultivation, of which 26 square miles are irrigable; 246 square miles of the uncultivated area, or 10 per cent. of the total, are cultivable, the remainder being forest and uncultivable waste. Of the cropped area, wheat occupies 66 square miles, or 13 per cent.; oilseeds, 59 square miles, or 12 per cent.; rice, 46 square miles, or 9 per cent.; and jow\u0101r, 6 square miles. Irrigation is very little practised, tanks being the ordinary source of supply where possible.\n\nThe area covered by forest is very large. Till the State was taken under administration no attempt had been made to obtain full value from the timber, only certain trees, such as teak, shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), harra (Terminalia Chebula), mah\u016ba (Bassia latifolia), and ach\u0101r (Buchanania latifolia), being preserved.\n\nThe Pann\u0101 diamond mines have been known since the seventeenth century. It is possible that they may have been worked in much earlier days, but had fallen into disuse. A systematic excavation for stones, however, was commenced in the time of R\u0101j\u0101 Sabh\u0101 Singh, due, it is said, to the advice of the preacher Pr\u0101n N\u0101th. The diamonds occur in the Rewah conglomerate and in alluvial beds. In the former case they are dug out of pits varying in depth from 3 to 30 feet. No large diamonds have ever been taken from the mine, though Hamilton (1813) mentions that a stone supposed to be worth Rs. 50,000 was in the possession of the R\u0101j\u0101. The stones are often of great purity. Pogson, who attempted to work a mine, arranges them in four classes, according as they are clear, orange-coloured, blackish, or greenish. In 1750 the State is said to have received 4 lakhs a year from this source, but the income has now diminished, the deposit having apparently been exhausted. The present income is about Rs. 7,000.\n\n---\n\n1 Records, Geological Survey of India, 1906, vol. xxxiii, pt. iv, p. 263.\nThe actual miners are mainly Gonds and Kols, but the work is financed by merchants from Gujar\u0101t.\n\nThe chief articles of commerce are grain and timber, which are exported through the railway at Satn\u0101, or by road to B\u0101nd\u0101, Nowgong, Mahob\u0101, and Cawnpore. The State is traversed by the Nowgong-Satn\u0101 metalled road, from which a branch road goes to Ajaigarh, 20 miles from Pann\u0101; and by the Chhatarpur-Saugor road, which crosses the Baksw\u0101ho pargana. A British post office is maintained at Pann\u0101 town.\n\nFor administrative purposes, Pann\u0101 is divided into eleven parganas, with head-quarters at Aktoh\u0101n, Baksw\u0101ho, Birsinghpur, Dharampura, Ghaura, Pann\u0101, Pawai, Raipura, Sh\u0101hnagar, Simaria, and Singhpur. The chief being a minor, the State is under superintendence. When exercising powers, the chief ordinarily has full control of the civil judicial and general administration, while in criminal cases he exercises the usual powers granted to holders of senior sanad States in Bundelkhand.\n\nThe total revenue amounts to 5 lakhs, of which 3 lakhs, or 60 per cent., is derived from land, the remaining sources being insignificant. The chief heads of expenditure are general administration and collection of revenue (1.5 lakhs), and chief's establishment (Rs. 33,000). The incidence of the land revenue demand is Rs. 1-7 per acre of cultivated land and 4 annas per acre of total area. A regular survey is now being carried out. Up to the present, assessments have been made on the standing crop. The currency is now the British rupee.\n\nThe army consists of 30 cavalry, 150 infantry, and 12 gunners with 19 serviceable guns. The regular police force numbers 126 men and the rural police 447 chaukid\u0101rs. A jail is maintained at Pann\u0101 town.\n\nEducation was first taken in hand by Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Nripat Singh in 1867. There are now 35 schools with 583 pupils. At the Census of 1901, 1.4 per cent. of the population were returned as able to read and write. A hospital was opened at Pann\u0101 town in 1881; and four dispensaries\u2014at Pawai, Malhra, Muhd\u0101ra, and Birsinghpur\u2014are under the supervision of the Agency Surgeon. In 1902-3 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 3,215, or 16 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nPann\u0101 Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in Central India, situated in 24\u00b0 43' N. and 80\u00b0 12' E., on the high road from Nowgong to Satn\u0101. Population (1901), 11,346. It was originally a Gond settlement, but fell in the thirteenth or fourteenth century to the Baghelas of Rewah. In 1494 it was attacked by Sikandar Lodi in his expedition against R\u0101j\u0101 Bhaira or Bh\u012bra. In 1563 it was held\nby R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m Chandra Deo. It was seized in the seventeenth century by Chhatars\u0101l, who raised it to a position of importance by making it his capital in 1675. The town lies in a valley about 800 feet above the level of the sea, and 300 feet below the surrounding hills. The buildings are for the most part constructed of local stone, which gives it an appearance of cleanliness and substantiality. The most imposing building is the new palace. Several temples stand in the town, but none is more than 200 years old. The most pretentious is one dedicated to Krishna\u2019s brother Balram, and known as Sri Baldeoji\u2019s, which was designed and built for Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Rudra Prat\u0101p Singh by his State engineer, Mr. Manley, the design being based on that of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. The most interesting shrine is that of Pr\u0101n N\u0101th, built in 1795. The exact date of Pr\u0101n N\u0101th\u2019s arrival in Pann\u0101 is uncertain; but from the best accounts he appears to have come in 1742, during the time of R\u0101j\u0101 Sabh\u0101 Singh, and not, as popular tradition has it, under Chhatars\u0101l. He was instrumental in discovering or reopening the diamond-bearing tract, and rose to high favour. Pr\u0101n N\u0101th was a Kshattriya deeply versed in Muhammadan learning, and endeavoured to show that there was no essential difference between the Hindu and Muhammadan faiths. To this end he collected a number of passages from the Kor\u0101n and the Vedas in a work called the Mahitariyal. His disciples prove their acceptance of his teaching by eating in a mixed assembly of Musalm\u0101ns and Hindus. However, with this exception, it does not appear that the two classes confound their civil or even religious distinctions, the unity, beyond that of eating, being no more than the admission that the God of both and of all religions is one and the same. The chief object of worship in the temple at Pann\u0101 is Pr\u0101n N\u0101th\u2019s book, which is kept on a gold-embroidered cloth. His followers are called Dh\u0101m\u0101s or Pr\u0101n N\u0101this, and are said to be numerous in Nep\u0101l, where converts have been made by missionaries of this sect. Nep\u0101li Dh\u0101mis come to Pann\u0101 to study the doctrines of the founder of their faith, and there are always a certain number in the town.\n\nPann\u0101 is connected by a metalled road with Chhatarpur (42 miles), Nowgong (57 miles), and Satn\u0101 (44 miles). Most of the traffic in piece-goods and European articles is carried on through Satn\u0101, which is served by the East Indian Railway.\n\nPanruti (Panroti).\u2014Town in the Cuddalore taluk of South Arcot District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 46\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 33\u2032 E., on the northern bank of the Gadilam river, and on the trunk road from Cuddalore to Salem, and also on the South Indian Railway. The population in 1901 was 15,206; but it has experienced great fluctuations owing to variations in the ground-nut trade, for which it is one of the chief centres. It is a Union under the Local Boards Act (V of 1884). It is one of the chief trading centres in the District, grain and ground-\nnuts from Tirukkoyil\u016br, Kallakurchi, and even the eastern part of Salem District being carted to it by road; and many native merchants, besides an English firm, have branches of their business here. Brick-making is carried on to a large extent, as the clay of the place is especially suitable. The town is famous for what are known as Panruti toys. These are made of clay, and represent vegetables and fruits of various kinds as well as figures of gods and men.\n\n**Pantanaw Township.**\u2014Township in Ma-ubin District, Lower Burma, lying between $16^\\circ 45'$ and $17^\\circ 14'$ N. and $95^\\circ 15'$ and $95^\\circ 38'$ E., with an area of 483 square miles. It is cut up by a network of small streams, connected with the Irrawaddy, which are leased as fisheries. The population was 48,204 in 1891, and 62,374 in 1901. Karens form between one-third and one-half of the total. It contains one town, Pantanaw (population, 5,010), the head-quarters: and 92 villages. In 1903\u20134 the area cultivated was 125 square miles, paying Rs. 1,70,000 land revenue.\n\n**Pantanaw Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the township of the same name in Ma-ubin District, Lower Burma, situated in $16^\\circ 59'$ N. and $95^\\circ 31'$ E., on the banks of the Pantanaw river, one of the deltaic branches of the Irrawaddy. Population (1901), 5,010. The town has long been a flourishing centre of the trade in fish and ngapi, but, owing to the silting up of the channel on which it stands, its prosperity now seems to be on the wane. The affairs of Pantanaw were at one time managed by a town committee, but in 1897 the town fund was abolished. There is a hospital with 10 beds.\n\n**Panth-Piploda.**\u2014Thakur\u0101t in the M\u0101lw\u0101 Agency, Central India.\n\n**Pantl\u0101vdi Akbar Kh\u0101n.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Pantl\u0101vdi Kesar Kh\u0101n.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Panvel T\u0101luka.**\u2014Northern t\u0101luka of Kol\u0101ba District, Bombay, lying between $18^\\circ 49'$ and $19^\\circ 7'$ N. and $72^\\circ 54'$ and $73^\\circ 17'$ E., with an area of 272 square miles. There are two towns, Panvel (population, 10,152), the head-quarters, and Uran (12,237); and 226 villages. The population in 1901 was 112,515, compared with 107,855 in 1891, the increase being due to immigration and a higher birth-rate. Panvel is one of the most thickly populated t\u0101lkas in the District, with a density of 414 persons per square mile. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2.81 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 22,000. Panvel includes the petty division (petha) of Uran; along its eastern boundary stand the lofty B\u0101wa Malang, M\u0101ther\u0101n, and Prabal ranges, while the M\u0101nikgarh range bounds the south-east. It is traversed from north to south by the Karn\u0101la range, which is almost denuded of forest, while on either side of the Uran creek lie extensive salt rice lands reclaimed from the sea. Numerous navigable streams and creeks, of which the K\u0101lundri river is the most noteworthy, intersect the low-lying seaboard\nand afford easy water traffic. The climate, though damp and unhealthy for Europeans, is temperate, except in the hot season, at which time the water-supply gets scanty. The annual rainfall averages 120 inches.\n\n**Panvel Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Kolaba District, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 59' N. and 73\u00b0 7' E., on the high road from Bombay to Poona. Population (1901), 10,152. The town was constituted a municipality in 1856, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 23,400. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 23,700. Panvel is the chief of four ports constituting the Panvel customs division. In 1903-4 the trade of Panvel port was: imports 7.23 lakhs, and exports 15.15 lakhs. The sea trade of Panvel is entirely coasting. The chief imports are grain, fish, liquor, gunny-bags, mahua flowers, coco-nuts, and timber. The chief exports are grain, gh\u012b, firewood, cart-wheel and axle oil, and oilseeds. The chief local industry is the construction of cart-wheels, of which it is said that every cart from the Deccan carries away a pair. Brick-making on a large scale has been attempted, but the enterprise has on two occasions failed. Panvel port is mentioned as carrying on trade with Europe in 1570; and it probably rose to importance along with Bombay, as it is on the direct Bombay-Deccan route. The town contains a dispensary, a middle school, and four other schools.\n\n**P\u0101pan\u0101sam** (*p\u0101pa*, 'sin,' and *n\u0101sam*, 'destruction').\u2014Place of pilgrimage in the Amb\u0101samudram taluk of Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in 8\u00b0 43' N. and 77\u00b0 22' E., 6 miles from Amb\u0101samudram town, at the foot of the Western Gh\u0101ts, near the point where the T\u0101mbraparni river descends to the plain in a magnificent fall. This waterfall is regarded as very sacred and is annually visited by thousands of pilgrims. P\u0101pan\u0101sam contains a large Saivite temple, and four or five chattrams and resthouses. The fish in the river near the temple are supplied with food from the temple funds. A mile below the village is situated the cotton-spinning factory of the Tinnevelly Mills Company, which is worked by water-power, generated by means of a channel from the river, and affords employment to 530 hands. The company has a capital of 4 lakhs, and turns out annually about 2,500,000 lb. of yarn, valued at 9 lakhs.\n\n**Papikonda.**\u2014Hill in God\u0101v\u0101ri District, Madras. See Bison Hill.\n\n**Papun Township.**\u2014Township of Salween District, Lower Burma, conterminous with the District itself. Its head-quarters are at Papun Village.\n\n**Papun Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of Salween District, Lower Burma, situated in 18\u00b0 3' N. and 97\u00b0 28' E., about the centre of the District, on the left or east bank of the Yunzalin river, 73 miles from the confluence of that river with the Salween. It is confined between two ranges of hills and has the reputation of being extremely unhealthy.\nIt is little more than a village, its population being 735 in 1877, and 1,422 in 1901. About 40 per cent. of the population are Shans, other nationalities, Karens, Burmans, and natives of India, making up the remainder in approximately equal proportions. Papun is the starting-point and terminus of caravan routes to and from eastern Karenni and the north-western portion of Siam, and contains a courthouse, a hospital, and two schools.\n\n**P\u0101rachin\u0101r.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Kurram Agency, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 33\u00b0 52' N. and 70\u00b0 4' E., 117 miles west of Koh\u0101t and 16 from the Peiwar Kotal, 3 miles from the southern slopes of the Safed Koh, in a plain naturally fertile but hitherto uncultivated owing to the absence of irrigation. Population (1901), 2,847. P\u0101rachin\u0101r possesses a temperate climate in which English flowers and fruit trees grow well. The station was first occupied in 1893, and is now the head-quarters of the Kurram militia and the residence of the Political Agent, Kurram. It contains a school, hospitals, and a jail, but has no trade.\n\n**Paramagudi Tahsil.**\u2014Zamind\u0101ri tahsil in the R\u0101mn\u0101d subdivision and estate, Madura District, Madras. The population in 1901 was 142,665, compared with 131,151 in 1891. It contains one town, Paramagudi (population, 16,134), a station on the Madura-P\u0101mban Railway and the head-quarters of the deputy-tahsild\u0101r; and 375 villages. The Vaigai river passes through the tahsil and serves as the main source of irrigation.\n\n**Paramagudi Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the R\u0101mn\u0101d estate, Madura District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 32' N. and 78\u00b0 36' E., on the south bank of the Vaigai river, on the road from R\u0101mn\u0101d to Madura, and one of the more important stations on the railway between these two places. The population in 1901 was 16,134, and is rapidly growing. It is the head-quarters of a deputy-tahsild\u0101r and of a District Munsif. The chief industry is the weaving of silk cloths. Hand-painted chintzes used to be made formerly, but the industry is now dead.\n\n**Paramukh.**\u2014Village in Malabar District, Madras. See Ferokh.\n\n**Par\u0101nt\u012bj T\u0101luka.**\u2014T\u0101luka of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District, Bombay, including the petha (petty subdivision) of Mod\u0101sa, situated in the extreme north-east of the District, and completely surrounded by Native States. It lies between 23\u00b0 3' and 23\u00b0 36' N. and 72\u00b0 44' and 73\u00b0 27' E., with an area of 447 square miles, and contains one town, Par\u0101nt\u012bj (population, 8,175), its head-quarters, and 120 villages in the t\u0101luka proper, and one town, Mod\u0101sa (7,276), and 46 villages in the petty subdivision. The population in 1901 was 86,753, compared with 116,140 in 1891, the decrease being due to famine. The density, 194 persons per square mile, is slightly below the District average.\nLand revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 1.4 lakhs. From the north-east, lines of rocky bare hills gradually sink west and south into a plain, at first thinly wooded and poorly tilled, then with deeper soil, finer trees, and better tillage, till in the extreme west along the banks of the S\u0101barmat\u012b the surface is broken by ravines and ridges. In the east the staple crop is maize, and in the west millet. Garden cultivation is neglected. Water is abundant. The t\u0101luka is the healthiest and coolest part of the District. The rainfall is more certain than elsewhere, but the residents are extremely poor.\n\nPar\u0101ntij Town (Par\u0101ntej).\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District, Bombay, with a station on the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d-Par\u0101ntij Railway, situated in 23\u00b0 26' N. and 72\u00b0 51' E., 33 miles north-east of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d city. Population (1901), 8,175. Par\u0101ntij is a prosperous town, and has been a municipality since 1855. The income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 7,000, and in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 7,700. The chief exports are gh\u012b, grain, and leather. Formerly there was a considerable local soap industry, but this has now greatly decreased. The town contains 6 schools, 5 for boys and one for girls, attended by 644 male and 109 female pupils. These include an English middle school with 19 pupils, and a mission orphanage with an industrial class attached to it. There is also a dispensary.\n\nParasgad.\u2014South-easternmost t\u0101luka of Belgaum District, Bombay, lying between 15\u00b0 36' and 16\u00b0 9' N. and 74\u00b0 49' and 75\u00b0 19' E., with an area (including the Murgod mah\u0101l or petty subdivision) of 6,40 square miles. It contains one town, Saundatti (population, 9,525), the head-quarters; and 124 villages, including Manoli (5,308) and Murgod (5,655). The population in 1901 was 108,311, compared with 110,584 in 1891. The density, 169 persons per square mile, is below the average for the District. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2.37 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 19,000. A low range of sandstone hills running north-west and south-east divides Parasgad into two nearly equal parts. South-west of the hills, whose southern face is steep and rugged, lies a plain of fine black soil with many rich villages and hamlets, which suffered severely in the famine of 1876-7. The north-east, which is broken by low hills, is a high waving plateau overgrown with bush and prickly pear, the soil being mostly poor and sandy. In the extreme north, the sandstone gives place to trap, and the soil is generally shallow and poor. The Malprabha, which flows north-east through the middle of the t\u0101luka, forms with its feeders the chief water-supply. Before the close of the hot season almost all the small streams dry up and stagnate, and the well and pond water becomes unwholesome. In the north and east the rainfall is scanty and uncertain: but in the south and west, and in the immediate\nneighbourhood of the Western Ghats, it is plentiful. The annual fall at the t\u0101luka head-quarters averages 23 inches.\n\nParasn\u0101th.\u2014Hill and place of Jain pilgrimage in the east of the Giridih subdivision of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District, Bengal, and adjoining M\u0101nbh\u016bm, situated in $23^\\circ 58' \\text{N.}$ and $86^\\circ 8' \\text{E.}$ The mountain consists of a central narrow ridge, with rocky peaks, rising abruptly to 4,480 feet above sea-level from the plains on the south-west, and throwing out long spurs which extend towards the Bar\u0101kar river on the north. A spur to the south-east forms the boundary between Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh and M\u0101nbh\u016bm, and eventually subsides into an extended belt of high land with peaked hills in the latter District. The hill is now easily approached by the East Indian Railway to Giridih station, and thence by a short journey of about 18 miles along a metalled road. In 1858 Parasn\u0101th was selected as a convalescent d\u00e9p\u00f4t for European troops; but on account of the confined area of the plateau at the summit and the solitude, it was found unsuitable for the purpose and was abandoned in 1868. The building formerly used as the officers\u2019 quarters is now utilized as a d\u0101k-bungalow. Pilgrims to the number of 10,000 flock annually from distant parts of India to this remote spot\u2014the scene of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a or \u2018beatific annihilation\u2019 of no less than ten of the twenty-four deified saints who are the objects of Jain adoration. From the last of these, P\u0101rsva or P\u0101rsvan\u0101tha, the hill, originally called Samet Sikhar, has taken its better known name. Pilgrimage to Parasn\u0101th is still as popular as ever among the Jains; and new shrines, a single one of which in white marble cost Rs. 80,000, are from time to time erected. The temples lie well apart from the plateau, and the improved means of communication hold out a possibility of the latter being again utilized as a small sanitarium.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvi, pp. 216, 217.]\n\nParatw\u0101da.\u2014Civil station of Ellichpur town, Amraoti District, Ber\u0101r, from which it is distant 2 miles. The population in 1901, when the town was garrisoned by a regiment of native infantry and a battery of the late Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent artillery, was 10,410; but the troops were removed in 1905. The town is situated on the S\u0101pan and Bichan rivers. The municipality was created in 1894. The receipts and expenditure from that year till 1901 averaged Rs. 12,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 16,437, chiefly derived from taxes and cesses; and the expenditure was Rs. 17,725, chiefly on conservancy and public works.\n\nParav\u016br.\u2014Town in Travancore State, Madras. See Par\u016br.\n\nP\u0101rbati.\u2014A tributary of the Chambal, draining part of Central India and R\u0101jput\u0101na. Rising in the Vindhya, in $22^\\circ 52' \\text{N.}$ and $76^\\circ 39' \\text{E.}$, at the village of Makgardha, it flows in a northerly direction\neither through or along the borders of the States of Bhop\u0101l, Gwalior, Narsinghgarh, and R\u0101jgarh in Central India, and Tonk and Kotah in R\u0101jp\u016bt\u0101na. After a course of 220 miles it joins the Chambal at P\u0101li gh\u0101\u1e6d in the north-east corner of Kotah (25\u00b0 51' N. and 76\u00b0 37' E.). Below Narsinghgarh the P\u0101rbati is a river of considerable size, the bed in parts of its course being nearly two miles broad. For about eight months the stream is continuous, the volume being very great during the rains; but for the rest of the year, except in deep reaches and pools, the bed is dry. The falls at Gugor are extremely picturesque when the river is in flood. The Sip, Sar\u0101ri, and Parang from the east, and the Andheri from the west, are the only tributaries of importance. Two railways, the Bhop\u0101l-Ujjain and the G\u016bna-Bina-B\u0101ran, cross the P\u0101rbati. At Atru, in Kotah State, near the confluence of the Andheri, a dam has been constructed, and the water thus stored ordinarily supplies about 7,000 acres in Kotah.\n\n**Parbhani District.**\u2014District in the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d Division of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, lying between 18\u00b0 58' and 20\u00b0 2' N. and 76\u00b0 4' and 77\u00b0 42' E., with an area of 5,091 square miles, including 995 square miles of j\u0101g\u012br and paig\u0101h lands. It is bounded on the north by the Buld\u0101na and B\u0101sim Districts of Ber\u0101r; on the east and south by N\u0101nder; on the south-west by Bh\u012br; and on the west by Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. A small area was transferred to the District from N\u0101nder in 1905.\n\nThe chief hill ranges are the Sahy\u0101driparvat and the Bal\u0101gh\u0101\u1e6d; the former runs through the north of the District, and the latter traverses a portion of the P\u0101lam t\u0101luk in the south. The Physical aspects. t\u0101luk of Jint\u016br, Hingoli, and Kalamn\u016bri are partly situated on the plateau south of the Sahy\u0101dri range, while the other t\u0101luk lies in the plains. The plateau slopes towards the south, and terminates in the valley of the Dudna.\n\nThe most important rivers are the God\u0101vari, the Pengang\u0101, the P\u016br\u1e47a, and the Dudna. The God\u0101vari enters from the west, and, after traversing the southern t\u0101luk for 112 miles, passes into N\u0101nder District. The Pengang\u0101 flows along the northern border of the District, separating it from the B\u0101sim District of Ber\u0101r. The Dudna flows across the District for about 50 miles from west to east, and joins the P\u016br\u1e47a. The latter river, which enters Parbhani from the south-west corner of Ber\u0101r, flows first in a south-easterly direction for about 35 miles, and then due south and falls into the God\u0101vari. Its length in this District is about 100 miles. A number of minor streams\u2014the Kikia (13 miles), Kharki (13), Kast\u016bra (38), Paingalgira (24), Indr\u0101yani (13), Dh\u0101mor (6), Ashna (12), Kiadho (48), and Kapra (12)\u2014also water the District.\n\nThe geological formation is the Deccan trap. In the valley of the God\u0101vari and some of its tributaries, the trap is overlaid by gravels\nand clay beds of upper pliocene or pleistocene age, containing fossil bones of extinct mammalia.\n\nThe trees found in the forest areas consist of babul (Acacia arabica), khair (Acacia Catechu), nim, mango, tamarind, eppa (Hardwickia binata), and mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia).\n\nIn the jungles of the Jint\u016br, Hingoli, and Kalamn\u016bri t\u0101luks, tigers, leopards, wolves, hyenas, bears, and wild hog are found, while in all the t\u0101luks s\u0101mbar and spotted deer are not uncommon. Partridge, quail, and peafowl are also to be found.\n\nThe climate is dry and healthy from February to the end of May, but feverish during the monsoon and part of the cold season. The plateau is much healthier than the plains, not being so damp during the rainy season. The temperature ranges from $60^\\circ$ in December to $105^\\circ$ in May in the plains, and to $98^\\circ$ on the plateau.\n\nThe rainfall during the twenty-one years ending 1901 averaged 34 inches. The amount received in 1899 (12 inches) was abnormally small, and resulted in the famine of 1900.\n\nThe District, which formed part of the Y\u0101dava kingdom of Deogiri (the modern Daulat\u0101b\u0101d), was conquered by Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Khilj\u012b in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and has since remained under Muhammadan rule. After the death of Muhammad bin Tughlak in 1351, it fell successively to the Bahmani and Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101hi kingdoms. On the conquest of the Deccan by Akbar and his successor it was again united to Delhi, but was finally separated in the beginning of the eighteenth century, on the foundation of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State.\n\nThe District contains four structures of note. The temple of N\u0101gn\u0101th at Aundah in the Kalamn\u016bri t\u0101luk is said to have been a seven-storeyed building which was demolished by Aurangzeb. At present it is 100 feet long, 80 feet broad, and 60 feet high, with a quadrangular court 7,200 square feet in area. It is adorned with hundreds of exquisitely carved figures of men, horses, elephants, bulls, and monkeys, and is locally believed to have been built by a P\u0101ndava R\u0101j\u0101 at a fabulous cost. The Jain temple of P\u0101rasn\u0101th near Jint\u016br has a very narrow, dark passage leading to a domed building, in the centre of which is a carved figure 12 feet high. A plainly built temple near B\u0101mu in the Jint\u016br t\u0101luk stands at the junction of the Sarasvat\u012b and P\u016brna rivers. The shrine of Ramaz\u0101n Sh\u0101h, situated on the summit of a hill near Khari in the Hingoli t\u0101luk, is enclosed by a strong wall 30 feet high and 1,200 feet square. The saint is said to have been converted to Isl\u0101m, and his shrine is visited by both Hindus and Musalm\u0101ns. Besides these, a large number of Hem\u0101dpanti temples are found throughout the District.\n\nThe number of towns and villages, including those in j\u0101girs, is 1,502.\nThe population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 685,099, (1891) 805,335, and (1901), 645,765. The famine of 1900 is responsible for the enormous decrease in the last decade.\n\n**Population.** The District is divided into seven *t\u0101luks*, Parbhani, P\u0101thri, Jint\u016br, Hingoli, Kalamn\u016bri, Basmat, and P\u0101lam (a 'crown' *t\u0101luk*), besides the two large *j\u0101g\u012br* *t\u0101luks* of Part\u016br and Gang\u0101kher. The towns are Hingoli, Parbhani, Basmat, M\u0101nwat, P\u0101thri, Sonepet, and Gang\u0101kher. About 90 per cent. of the population are Hindus, and 88 per cent. speak Mar\u0101thi. The following table shows the distribution of population in 1901:\n\n| T\u0101luk       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Numbers able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Parbhani    | 518                 | 1               | 165      | 93,325     | 180                       | 1                                                             | Not available                  |\n| Jint\u016br      | 798                 | 2               | 260      | 77,996     | 97                        | 29.0                                                          |                                 |\n| Hingoli     | 633                 | 1               | 192      | 78,138     | 123                       | 21.4                                                          |                                 |\n| Kalamn\u016bri   | 492                 | 1               | 175      | 52,437     | 106                       | 30.5                                                          |                                 |\n| Basmat      | 523                 | 1               | 194      | 66,272     | 126                       | 32.2                                                          |                                 |\n| P\u0101lam       | 427                 | 1               | 121      | 65,490     | 153                       | 12.2                                                          |                                 |\n| P\u0101thri      | 705                 | 2               | 151      | 109,837    | 155                       | 1.8                                                           |                                 |\n| Jagirs, &c. | 995                 | 2               | 239      | 102,360    | 103                       | 23.1                                                          |                                 |\n\nDistrict total 5,091 7 1,495 645,765 125 - 19.8 16,147\n\nIn 1905 the northern villages of the N\u00e4nder *t\u0101luk*, Nander District, were added to Kalamn\u016bri, and a few villages in P\u0101thri were transferred in exchange for some in the Ambarh *t\u0101luk* of Aurang\u0101bad District.\n\nThe most numerous caste is that of the cultivating Kunb\u012bs, who number 260,800, or more than 40 per cent. of the total population. Mah\u0101rs or village menials number 67,400, Dhangars or shepherds 47,900, Bani\u0101s or trading castes 33,700, M\u0101ngs or leather-workers 24,000, and Br\u0101hmans 20,500. The Mah\u0101rs and M\u0101ngs also work as agricultural labourers. Persons supported by agriculture number 342,000, or 53 per cent. of the total.\n\nThere is no Christian mission in the District, but the number of native Christians returned in 1901 was 70.\n\nThe soils of the *t\u0101luks* of Parbhani, P\u0101thri, Basmat, and P\u0101lam are mostly composed of the fertile *regar* or black cotton soil, with some *masab*; but in the remaining *t\u0101luks* *masab* and *kharab* soils predominate. *Rabi* crops, such as white *jow\u0101r*, wheat, gram, *tuar*, *l\u0101kh*, and peas, are extensively grown on the *regar* and *masab*; and yellow *jow\u0101r*, *b\u0101jra*, cotton, indigo, sesamum, *s\u0101v\u0101n*, and oilseeds and pulses are raised on the *kharab* and\nmasab soils during the rains. The kharab soils also bear garden crops, but they require heavy manuring. The soils at the foot of the hills and in the valleys of rivers are very fertile, and produce rabi and garden crops.\n\nThe tenure of lands throughout the District is ryotw\u0101ri. Out of 4,996 square miles of khalsa and sarf-i-kh\u0101s lands, 3,547 square miles were cultivated in 1901, 54 were cultivable waste and fallows, 255 were forest, and 240 were not available for cultivation. The staple food-crop is jow\u0101r, grown on 1,797 square miles, or 50 per cent. of the area cropped. Next in importance are wheat (229 square miles), b\u0101jra (206), and rice (57). Cotton is grown throughout the District, covering 809 square miles, or about 23 per cent. of the net area cropped. Sugar-cane occupies only 3 square miles.\n\nNo special breed of cattle is characteristic of the District, but those found are hardy and strong, and well suited for ploughing the prevailing heavy soils. Sheep and goats of the ordinary kind are reared by the Dhangars and some well-to-do ryots. Ordinary Mar\u0101th\u0101 ponies fetch about Rs. 50, but animals of a better sort command as much as Rs. 100 or Rs. 150 each. The State maintains nine Arab stallions in six of the t\u0101lukas, for the purpose of improving the local breed, at an annual cost of Rs. 2,400.\n\nThe total irrigated area, which was 74 square miles in 1904, is supplied by wells numbering 10,471. There are no irrigation tanks, but 15 other sources supply water.\n\nThe area under forest is 255 square miles, of which 55 are \u2018reserved\u2019 and the remainder open. Jint\u016br, Kalamn\u016bri, Hingoli, and P\u0101lam are the only t\u0101lukas containing forest.\n\nNo minerals of economic value are found in the District. Black basalt and granite are available everywhere, and are used for buildings and road-metalling.\n\nThere is no important hand industry. Ordinary coarse cotton cloth is woven for local use. The District contains 13 ginning factories and 5 cotton-presses, employing 255 hands. The total quantity of cotton ginned in 1901 was 417 tons.\n\nThe principal exports consist of jow\u0101r and other food-grains, cotton, oilseeds, indigo, chillies, cattle and sheep, jaggery, tobacco, hides, bones and horns, tarvar bark for tanning, and mahu\u0101 flowers. The chief imports are salt, salted fish, opium, spices, gold, silver, copper and brass sheets and vessels, sulphur, refined sugar, kerosene oil, iron, raw and manufactured silk, cotton and woollen cloth.\n\nThe chief centres of trade are M\u0101nwat, Hingoli, Parbhani, Sonepet, Gang\u0101kher, and Mantha, where a large business is done in local produce. Weekly bazars are also held at the t\u0101luk head-quarters and\nother villages. The trading and money-lending castes are the V\u0101nis, Komatis, M\u0101rw\u0101ris, Kachchis, and Bh\u0101tias.\n\nThe Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway traverses the District from east to west for a distance of 63 miles, and has 9 stations within its limits. The total length of roads is 341 miles, of which only 18 are metalled. About 26 miles were constructed during the famine of 1900. The principal roads are from Hingoli to K\u0101vergaon, metalled (18 miles), to Jaipur (28 miles), to Parbhani (44 miles), from Jint\u016br to Parbhani (24 miles), to Sail\u016b (22 miles), from Basmat to L\u0101sina (12 miles), and from Parbhani to Gang\u0101kher (20 miles). Besides these, about 163 miles of fair-weather roads lead to the head-quarters of the t\u0101luks and other important places.\n\nThe District suffered most severely during the famines of 1819 and 1854\u20135. It was again affected to a certain extent in 1876\u20138, but distress was most severe in 1899\u20131900. The rainfall in 1899 was less than 12 inches, and both the kharif and rabi crops failed. The kharif crop gave only 6 per cent., and the rabi, which mostly consists of jow\u0101r, the staple food of the people, was only about 4 per cent. of the normal. The number of units relieved exceeded 14 millions, and the highest attendance in one day was 90,222. While famine was raging in the District, cholera supervened, and carried off thousands, and the Census of 1901 revealed the enormous decrease of 159,570, or 20 per cent., compared with 1891. The people lost about 39 per cent. of their cattle, and the total cost of the famine to the State was more than 14 lakhs.\n\nThe District is divided into three subdivisions: one comprising the t\u0101luks of Hingoli, Kalamn\u016bri, and Basmat, under the Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r; the second comprising the t\u0101luks of Parbhani, P\u0101thri, and Jint\u016br, under the Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r; and the third consisting of P\u0101lam only, which is under the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r, who exercises a general supervision over the work of all his subordinates. Each t\u0101luk is under a tahsild\u0101r.\n\nThe N\u0101zim-i-Diw\u0101ni or Civil Judge presides over the District civil court, and there are two subordinate Munsifs\u2019 courts. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the chief magistrate of the District, and the District Civil Judge is a joint-magistrate, exercising powers in the absence of the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r from head-quarters. The Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs and the seven tahsild\u0101rs have magisterial powers of the second and third class. The two Munsifs exercise third-class magisterial powers in the absence of the tahsild\u0101rs from their head-quarters. Serious crime is rare in ordinary years; but in adverse seasons dacoities and cattle and grain thefts increase in proportion to the severity of the distress.\n\nAll that is known of the early revenue history of the District is that Malik Ambar\u2019s system was in force from the beginning of the\nseventeenth century. His settlement, which was a modification of Todar Mal's method, was based upon the actual area and the productivity of the soil. Taluks and villages were subsequently farmed out by the State to revenue contractors, who were allowed 10 per cent. for collections. After the introduction of District administration in 1866, this system was abolished, and cash payments with a ryotw\u0101ri settlement were introduced. In 1885 the taluks of P\u0101thri, Kalamn\u016bri, and Hingoli, and in the following two years the remaining four taluks, were settled for fifteen years, the rates fixed approximating to those in the adjoining Districts of B\u0101sim in Ber\u0101r, Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, and Bh\u012br. The enhancement of revenue resulting from this assessment was Rs. 99,210, or $5\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent. The average rate on 'dry' land is Rs. 1\u20135 (maximum Rs. 1\u201314, minimum Rs. 1\u20131), and on 'wet' land Rs. 3\u20134 (maximum Rs. 5\u20136, minimum Rs. 1\u20132).\n\nThe land revenue and the total revenue for a series of years are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|        | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|\n| Land revenue | 14.64 | 17.78 | 20.67 | 19.84 |\n| Total revenue | 19.35 | 25.47 | 33.16 | 34.45 |\n\nOwing to changes of area made in 1905, the land revenue demand is now about 22.1 lakhs.\n\nSince 1888 a cess of one anna in the rupee on land revenue has been levied for local purposes, and local boards formed for every taluk except Parbhani, under the chairmanship of the tahsild\u0101rs. A District board was constituted at the head-quarters, with the First Talukd\u0101r as president. Of the total cess, which yielded 1.3 lakhs in 1901, one-fourth is set apart for local and municipal works. At Parbhani town there is a municipality, and each of the taluk head-quarters has a small conservancy establishment, the District and taluk boards managing the municipalities as well. The local board expenditure in 1901 was Rs. 60,200.\n\nThe First Talukd\u0101r is the head of the police administration, with a Superintendent of police (Mohtamim) as his executive deputy. He has under him 8 inspectors, 92 subordinate officers, 548 constables, and 25 mounted police, distributed in 30 police stations. There is a District jail at Parbhani, where short-term prisoners are kept, while those whose sentences exceed six months are sent to the Central jail at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nThe District takes a medium position as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 2.5 per cent. (4.9 males and 0.1 females) could read and write in 1901. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903 was 267, 2,042, 3,341, and 3,437.\nrespectively. In 1903 there were 56 primary and 3 middle schools, with 41 girls under instruction. The total expenditure on education in 1901 was Rs. 20,300, of which the State contributed Rs. 11,300. About 44 per cent. of the total was devoted to primary schools. The fee receipts in 1901 amounted to Rs. 1,952.\n\nIn 1901 there were four dispensaries, with accommodation for 15 in-patients, besides a Y\u016bn\u0101ni dispensary maintained from Local funds. The total number of cases treated at these was 33,432, of whom 121 were in-patients. The number of operations performed was 663, and the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 12,900. The number of successful cases of vaccination in 1901 was 1,695, or 2\u00b762 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n**Parbhani T\u0101luk.**\u2014Central t\u0101luk of Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 560 square miles. Including j\u0101girs, the population in 1901 was 94,774, compared with 107,136 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The t\u0101luk has one town, Parbhani (population, 9,958), the head-quarters of the District and t\u0101luk; and 175 villages, of which 10 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 3\u00b74 lakhs. The God\u0101vari river flows in the south of the t\u0101luk. The soils are chiefly alluvial or regar.\n\n**Parbhani Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and t\u0101luk of the same name, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 19\u00b0 16' N. and 76\u00b0 47' E. Population (1901), 9,958.
