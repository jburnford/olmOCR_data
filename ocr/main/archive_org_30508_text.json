It is the largest taluk in the district, its area being 1,158 square miles. It is irregular in shape and its extreme length and breadth are 45 and 35 miles respectively. It is bounded on the north and east by Pulivendla and Rayachoti taluks respectively of the Cuddapah district, south by Madanapalle taluk of Chittoor district, and west by Pennakonda and Hindupur taluks. It is rocky and cut up by detached hills mostly destitute of vegetation. Its forests, though extensive, are neither so rich nor so picturesque as those of the adjoining Pennakonda taluk. There are no rivers save the Maddaluru and the Papaghni, the former being but the outlet of the Devaramcheruvu tank of Kadiri and the latter of the Kandukuru tank of Madanapalle taluk. Neither of them is of any great advantage for irrigation. The larger tanks are Kadiri, Mutyalacheruvu, Pantulacheruvu, Patnam and Vaikamaddi; the others are insignificant and precarious. The irrigation is mostly from private wells. Almost all the dasabandham wells were handed over to the inamdars at the recent resettlement.\n\n2. The soil is poor and infertile, a large proportion of it consisting of coarse red sand. The hills are unproductive. The chief products are paddy, cumbu, cholam, horse-gram, ground-nut and cotton. Paddy and cumbu are the staple food crops and ragi is also consumed to some extent. Sugar-cane is grown in the red loamy soils of the southern portion of the taluk and a good deal of jaggery is exported to Rayachoti and Pulivendla. There is also a considerable export of ground-nut and horse-gram to the coast districts. Except the making of jaggery, there is no industry worth mentioning.\n\n3. Kadiri, Dorigalla and Patnam are places of archaeological interest. Iswaramala, Inagaluru, Palkonda and Paipad-drug are the principal trigonometrical stations. The most important villages in the taluk are Kadiri, Kokkanti, Kurli, Inaguluru, Mutyalacheruvu, Patnam, Talupula, Thanakallu and Tummala.\n\n4. Kadiri is reputed to have been named after the \"Khadira\" tree (Acacia catechu) under which the local idol\nof Narasimha was found. The town is the head-quarters of the taluk, and contains, besides the Tahsildar's and Stationary Sub-Magistrate's Offices, a Police Station, a Local Fund Dispensary, a Sub-Registrar's office, Forest Range office and a Travellers' bungalow. It is a Union of 7,607 inhabitants of whom 2,772 are Musalmans. Its chief attraction is the famous temple of Narasimhaswami. The annual car festival in February and March attracts some thousands of devotees and spectators, not only from the district, but also from Bellary and Mysore. The notable feature of this festival is that two days after the car procession Panchamas are allowed to enter the temple after bathing in the Maddal\u00e9ru. This item of the festival is known as \"M\u00e1la parasa.\" The tradition is that the present town and its surroundings were formerly a jungle under the sway of a Hindu Chief of Patnam, and that the town is coeval with the temple. There is also another popular tradition which is supposed to account for the unique harmony that exists between the local Hindus and Musalmans. Chandrayadana, daughter of the Chief of Patnam, who was in the habit of making periodical visits to the shrine of Narasimhaswami, was one day observed by an Arab traveller, M\u00f3hiy\u00e1r, who, fascinated by the maiden's beauty and finding no means of winning her hand, became lovesick, starved and perished near the shrine. Attempts were made to remove the dead body but it was found impossible even to lift it. Chandrayadana made an attempt to lift the corpse but only to find her hands irretrievably clasped with the Arab's dead body. She concluded that it was the will of God that she should die with the Arab and accordingly ascended the coffin. It was then that it was possible to lift the corpse. Thus Chandrayadana was interred alive by the side of M\u00f3hiy\u00e1r. Their grave is honoured even at the present day both by the Hindus and Musalmans. This town was obtained by Parwarish Kh\u00e1n as a j\u00e1ghir but was resumed by the Mahrattas in 1756. It was restored in 1764 by M\u00edr S\u00e1hib who resumed it again in 1773. Alam Kh\u00e1n took possession of it in 1779.\n\nQamr-ud-din fixed his peshcush at 8,050 canteroy pagodas. On his refusing the peshcush he was attacked, and the j\u00e1ghir was again resumed. The family is now extinct.\n\nKokkanti is a village about 14 miles south-east of Kadiri and has a population of 2,825 persons of whom 248 are Musalmans. It was the seat of an old poligar family.\n\nPatnam.\u2014This is a village about 9 miles north-west of Kadiri with a population of 2,102 persons of whom 240 are Musalmans. It has a large tank which is fed by a channel from the Maddal\u00e9ru. Five miles north, on the hills, is a fine old fort. The village is said to have been the seat of an old family of poligars.\none of whom, Ranga Nayudu, is credited with having constructed the tank, Ranganayanicheravu. It contains a Police Station and a branch Post Office. The nearest railway station Kaliasamudram is about 2 miles distant.\n\nTalupula.\u2014This is a village about 11 miles north-east of Kadiri with a population of 2,993 persons of whom 767 are Musalmans. It was the seat of an old jaghirdar's family, and the half ruined fort-wall is visible even now. Some of the descendants of the old jaghirdar are drawing petty pensions. The village contains a Police Station and a branch Post Office.\n\nTanakallu.\u2014This is a village about 13 miles south of Kadiri; it has a population of 3,561 persons of whom 435 are Musalmans; it is the head-quarters of a Deputy Tahsildar and a Revenue Inspector.\n\nTummala.\u2014This is a village about 13\u00bd miles south-west of Kadiri; it contains a fort which, though now in ruins, was during the last century held as a military fief of Gurramkonda by a Musalman General.\n\"A book that is shut is but a block\"\n\nCENTRAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL LIBRARY\n\nGOVT.
