According to inscriptions found by him in certain temples at Jaisalmer, Mulr\u0101j I (No. 21) was succeeded by his brother, Ratan Singh, and they together \"righteously protected the earth as did Lakshman and R\u0101ma of old.\" Mulr\u0101j had a son called Deor\u0101j, the father of Kehar II (No. 24); one inscription mentions him as the chief of the State just after Gharsi (or Ghata Singh), but the popular idea is that he died of fever during the siege of Jaisalmer at the end of the thirteenth century.\n### TABLE No. VI.\n\n*Population, Jaisalmer State, 1881, 1891, and 1901.*\n\n|

Among the first three Th\u0101kurs in the above list, the earliest arrival takes precedence (on the right), and the same is the case with the next five (on the left). The last four Th\u0101kurs occupy the first seat (on the right or left, as the case may be) only when none senior to them in their group attends the assemblage.\n### TABLE No. XXIX.\n\n**Jodhpur Central Jail.**\n\n| PARTICULARS                  | 1891 | 1891 | 1901 | 1905 | 1903 | 1907 |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Average daily population:** |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| (a) Male                    | ...  | 796  | 890  | 1,004| 934  | 677  |\n| (b) Female                  | ...  | 44   | 32   | 79   | 68   | 49   |\n| Total                       | ...  | 157  | 840  | 922  | 1,083| 1,002| 726  |\n| **Maximum population on any one day:** |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n|                            | ...  | 956  | 1,268| 1,170| 1,120| 929  |\n| **Daily average number of sick:** | 14   | 21   | 10   | 7    | 15   | 12   |\n| **Number of deaths**        | ...  | 4    | 35   | 14   | 16   | 11   | 8    |\n| **Rate of mortality per 1,000.** | 25   | 42   | 15   | 15   | 11   | 11   |\n| Rs.                        |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| **Expenditure on jail maintenance:** | ...  | 41,668| 39,714| 44,241| 33,348|      |\n| **Cost per prisoner**       | ...  | 31   | 40   | 40   | 26   |      |\n| **Profits on jail manufactures:** | ...  | 3,729| 569  | 1,771| 1,789|      |\n\nIn 1891 the jail had accommodation for 600 prisoners (552 males and 48 females), and in 1901 and subsequent years for 862 prisoners (788 males and 74 females).

Included among the vernacular schools are five in Mall\u0101ni in 1891-92 and four in 1901-02, but nothing is known regarding the number on the rolls of, or the daily average attendance at, any of these institutions in either of the above years. Similarly, the special schools were the Sanskrit school and the Powlett noble's school in 1891-92, and the Sanskrit school and the Elgin Rajput school in 1901-02, but information as to attendance, etc., is available only for the Sanskrit school. The Elgin school was amalgamated with the Darb\u0101r high school in 1903-04, leaving only one special institution (the Sanskrit school) in 1904-05, but the nobles' school was re-established in the following year. The surveying class was held at the College, and hence has not been treated as a separate school; it was abolished in 1904.\n### TABLE No. XXXI.\n\n*List of schools in the Jodhpur State, 1906.*\n\n|

Prior to 1904, classes or sections of a school were treated as part and parcel of that school, but they have since been shown as separate institutions. For example, the high school, with its special classes for instruction in bookkeeping, banika business, the duties of a patw\u0101ri, etc., was formerly entered in the returns as one single school, but since 1904 each such class has been held to be a separate school. Similarly, many of the schools in the districts have long had both Hindi and banika classes, but the latter have for the last three years been shown as separate institutions. The schools mentioned in this table are all maintained by the Darb\u0101r; there have always been many private ones of the indigenous type, but they send in no returns.\n### TABLE No. LXVI.\n\n*List of schools in the Bikaner State, 1906.*\n\n| Locality     | Class                  | Number on rolls | Daily average attendance | Remarks                                                                 |\n|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bh\u0101dra       | Hindi primary          | 53              | 47                       | All these schools are maintained by the Darb\u0101r at an annual cost of about Rs. 31,000. There are in addition numerous institutions of the indigenous type, such as *p\u0101th-sh\u0101las*, kept up by private individuals or communities, but they are not under departmental control. A *banika* school, it should be explained, is one in which instruction is given in mental arithmetic and the general system of mercantile business and accounts as conducted in M\u0101rw\u0101ri characters. It will be seen that more than half of the boys were borne on the rolls of these *banika* schools. The girls' school at the capital is the only one of the kind in the State. |\n| \"            | Banika                 | 47              | 42                       |
