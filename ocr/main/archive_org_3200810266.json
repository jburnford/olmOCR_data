The evidence of Mrs. Charlotte Kent, which was first taken, was to the effect that she was in Buckingham-street at about half-past six on the 24th inst., when a man snatched her bag, containing amongst other articles, some certificates of the utmost value to her, and ran off. Another at the same time said, \"All right, lady, I'll run and catch him,\" and both disappeared. On Monday last the prisoner Fay called at her residence and told her that he was aware of her loss and of the identity of those who had occasioned it, and that he was in a position to get her back at any rate a part of it. He produced a pocket-book that had been in the bag in evidence of this, and it was arranged that he should bring the other articles the next evening. But meanwhile Mrs. Kent communicated with the police, and when he arrived Detectives Hailstone and Temblett were already hidden behind the tapestry curtains, from which they emerged at an opportune moment, and arrested Fay. In consequence of a statement made by him at the station, Inspector George Payne, of the L Division, went to a house in Blackfriars-road at half-past four on Wednesday morning, and there found Gray in bed. He told him he should arrest him, and he replied that he knew all about it. In the course of the afternoon both men made statements in one another's presence. Fay's was to the effect that he was in the kitchen of the house in Blackfriars-road, when Gray came in with three men, named Irwin, Cook, and Simpson, who were in possession of the stolen property. They spoke of putting the things on the fire, when Fay said that the papers might be of value. He looked at them, and finding the address of Mrs. Kent, suggested that the bag and its contents should not be burnt, but that he should take it back to the owner. This was agreed to, and he took it and locked it up. Gray's statement confirmed this, with the exception that he said he was already in the kitchen when Irwin, Cook, and Simpson came in. Inspector Payne added that two of the men named were then in custody, and had been charged at the Southwark Police-court on information already given to him by Fay as to the suspected theft of two ulsters, a coat, and a rug. Mr. Vaughan remanded the accused, taking bail for Fay.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810266.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 602, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2536, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
