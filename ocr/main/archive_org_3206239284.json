Returning home under the influence of drink, he ordered her to go upstairs, and, after locking the front and back doors, followed her with a heavy poker in one hand and a candlestick in the other. In the upper room he struck her across the eye, inflicting a fearful wound. The unfortunate woman called for assistance, but to no purpose. Her husband then struck her a succession of blows on the head with the knob end of the poker, and in a few minutes she was dead. When arrested the prisoner said:\u2014\"She commenced on me, and I punished her. I don't think she's dead. She oughtn't to be. I don't think they'll give more than 12 months, will they?\" He narrowly escaped lynching by the populace.\n\nTHE PRINCESS HENRI OF THE NETHERLANDS died at Luxemburg on Wednesday morning.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206239284.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2074, "total-output-tokens": 271, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1008, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
