Evidence was given to the effect that a kind of fair was held upon a piece of waste land in the rear of some houses in the Walworth-road. There were swings, steam roundabouts, stalls, and other adjuncts of a fair. Complaint had been made of the noise, particularly with regard to the steam organs attached to the roundabouts. A large number of persons congregated upon the ground, particularly at night. Long arguments were held on both sides, and police and other evidence taken, but there had been no particular disturbance or any charges brought before the Court arising out of such fair. Mr. Biron at length dismissed the summons against Hall, but decided to commit Cox for trial at the sessions, admitting him, however, to bail.\n\n\u2014There was a second case against some parties for a similar offence with regard to a plot of ground situate at Eagle-yard, Walworth-road, but this matter was adjourned to see if the defendants would abate the alleged nuisance, and then to allow of the vestry proceeding further or not.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206260986.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1384, "total-output-tokens": 324, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1379, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
