It has an area of 11,971 square miles. From its most westerly point, Cape Monze, or Ras Muari, its boundary, defined by the Habb river, beyond which is the Las Beyla State, runs north-east, then, gradually turning, points at last due north where it meets the Khirthar range of hills, which separate it from the Sehwan Taluka of the Larkana District. That district here penetrates the Karachi District, dividing it into two prongs and forming its northern boundary. The point of the eastern prong touches the Indus, which thence becomes the boundary of the Karachi District, running south-east and south and separating it from the Hyderabad District as far as Jerruck (Jhirak), where it passes beyond the river, being bounded first by the Guni and Badin Talukas of the Hyderabad District, then by the Rann of Cutch and the broad Khori creek. From this, its most southerly point, the limits of the district run north-west to Cape Monze again, with the sea for their boundary all the way.\n\nIn its physical aspects the district includes samples of all the features of nature to be found in Sind. Kohistan in the north, where the Khirthar range penetrates the district for thirty miles, flanked and followed up by minor ranges, has been described as \"a succession of broad valleys lying between ranges of hills running generally north and south. The valleys are more or less level and fairly covered with grass or brushwood; the hills are bare and mostly composed of limestone; looking at them they give little idea of containing any vegetation, but large flocks of sheep subsist on them and select these bare hills as grazing grounds in preference to the more grassy plains.\" Southwards towards Karachi the country degenerates into sandy wastes, uncultivated.\nand almost devoid of vegetation, but much broken up by short ranges of low, stony hills, and intersected by the nais, or torrent beds, which carry the drainage of the Kohistan to the Indus. The southern limit of this tract may be defined by a straight line drawn from Karachi to Tatta. South of this lies the Delta, a triangle with Tatta for its apex and the sea coast for its base. Tatta is, strictly speaking, well out of the Delta now, for the old branch of the Indus which ran past it into the Gharo creek silted up about 130 years ago and is only represented by the Kalri canal now. Another branch of the river, more recently extinct, has become the Baghar canal. The apex of the Delta now is at the bifurcation of the Ochito and the Haidari (Mutni), a few miles below Kotri Allahrakhio Shah in the Ghorabari Taluka. Between this point and the sea the country is cut up by a network of branches of the river, passing into creeks and connected by cross-channels, and the aspect which it presents varies with the distance from the sea. Along the coast a strip of 5 or 6 miles in breadth, which is so liable to submergence at high tides that it is always moist, supports a growth of small coarse grass and rushes, which in turn support innumerable buffaloes, so that this tract presents a more lively and populous scene than is met with further inland. To the west, as far as Karachi, large tracts of wind-blown sand-hills present a sample, on a small scale, of the desert of Thar and Parkar. Where the influence of fresh water begins to predominate over the salt, grass and mangrove swamps and sand give place to tamarisk and rice fields. In the south-eastern quarter of the Delta, however, there is a wide expanse of absolute salt waste, embracing a large part of the Shabbandar and Jati Talukas, which is almost uninhabitable for man or beast. In this, between the Sir and Khori creeks, lie the great Sirganda salt deposits, many square miles of solid salt. The upper portions of these talukas with Ghorabari, Mirpur Sakro, Sujawal and Mizpur Bathoro consist of fertile rice country, with tamarisk and khabar in all waste places, and diversified by groves of babul, wide dhands and perennial marshes.\n\nThe hills of Sind, with few and unimportant exceptions, lie to the west of the Indus Valley, and the Karachi District has a fair share of them. The Khirthar range, 150 miles in length\nand rising in one peak to a height of 6,878 feet above the sea, forms the boundary of Sind from the extreme north-west point of the Upper Sind Frontier to the junction of the Larkana with the Karachi District, after which point, turning a little eastward, it constitutes for more than 20 miles the boundary of the two and terminates near the Baran river at about 25\u00b0 43' north latitude. This is the \"Hala\" range of English maps and old writers.* About 30 miles of it belong to the Karachi District. Its general height further north is between 4,000 and 5,000 feet; but it falls very much towards its southern extremity and even isolated peaks seldom rise above 3,500 feet. The next most important range has been named by us the Laki because it first attracts attention near the town of that name in the Manjhand Mahal, a little to the north-west of which it commences. It is not the custom of the country to give names to ranges but to peaks and localities; so the local names of this range are numerous. The two hills between which the Baran cuts through the chain are Surjano and Sambok; north of the latter is Ehri, then Narero, then Hotiano. Running due south, the Laki range divides Kohistan from Kotri Taluka and then, turning a little to the west near Thano Bula Khan, from Tatta Taluka. The total length of this range is about 80 miles and it attains an elevation of 1,640 feet near its northern extremity. To the south and west of these two ranges there is a series of gradually decreasing limestone hills, all running more or less north and south. One such, the Kambu range, about 15 miles in length and attaining in the middle to 2,340 feet, seems to continue the Khirthar range beyond the Baran river, running due south. West of this is the Dumber range, about 15 miles in length. West of this again, where the Habb river joins the Sind Frontier, the much higher Bedur range, which forms the eastern watershed of that river, sends a spur into Sind. Another well marked line of hills runs east of the river from Mangho Pir to Cape Monze, and eastward of this the country round about Karachi is for the most part broken up into small ranges, or ridges, individually insignificant. A large part of the Kotri Taluka and the Manjhand Mahal is also hilly and a hilly tract runs southward from Kotri to Jerruck and\n\n* The name Khirthar appears to have been given to this range by the Geological Survey Department. It is applied locally to the southern extremity of it.\nTatta. The Makli hills, close by Tatta, are a rocky elevation, 18 miles in length by 4 in breadth, well known on account of the tombs which have been erected upon them.\n\nThe rivers of Sind, with the great exception of the Indus which is described in the \"A\" Volume, are ordinarily dry; but very little rain suffices to flood them from bank to bank, and the impediment which they may then offer to all traffic and military movements has given them importance. They are carefully noted in all the early reports of routes. They gain another claim to consideration from the fact that, though there may be no water in their beds, there is often a good deal under them, so that a broad tract of fields and gardens marks their course in many places. The Habb, which is said to take its origin in the Baluchistan hills, not far from Kalat, joins the Sind Frontier where it is crossed by the Kandahar road and defines it for the final 70 miles of its course, and falls into the sea on the north-western side of Cape Monze. This may indeed be called a permanent stream, for, though it does not flow above ground continuously, it is never without water in disconnected pools of such depth and amplitude that they harbour the mahseer and other smaller fish. After heavy rain a very large body of water comes down this stream. Between fifty and sixty years ago an attempt to use this river for irrigational purposes was made by Khan Bahadur Murad Khan to whom the British Government has granted 33,719 acres of land near its banks. At a cost of three lakhs of rupees he constructed a dam 800 feet in length and 15 in height, but the work was swept away by an unusually heavy flood. Further schemes on a more extensive scale were only arrested by his death.\n\nThe next most important river in the district is the Baran, which rises in the Khirthar range, rounds its southern extremity, then flows southwards again to near Thano Bula Khan, where it turns eastward, cuts its way through the Laki hills and finally falls into the Indus four miles south of Kotri, which more than once has came nigh being wiped out of existence by it. Deep drains and strong dams seemed to have removed this danger. The scenery where this torrent has cloven a passage through the hills is very striking. Its total length is about 90 miles. The Malir, a stream of less\nsize, drains the country north-east of Karachi for a distance of 60 miles and falls into Ghizri Bandar. The course of the Lyari is round the town of Karachi, and its waters go into the harbour. Its rise after rain is very sudden. Elsewhere, especially in the north, there are many similar channels which carry rain water from the hills to the Indus, or diffuse it on the low grounds and make cultivation possible. The most important of these is the Sann, which often pours a great volume of water into the Indus.\n\nNotwithstanding all that has been accomplished in restraining the annual overflow of the floods. Indus by protective bunds, it is not probable that the lowlands of the Delta will ever be safe from occasional destructive floods. Heavy rain also brings down torrents from the hill country in a surprisingly short time, which the water-courses are quite inadequate to carry off safely. In the past such floods have been frequent and sometimes disastrous, as in 1882, when the inundation surpassed all previous records and canals were breached and overtopped; and in 1892, when heavy rain, combined with floods from the hills, covered the face of the country with water, breaking the canals and almost totally destroying the kharif crops in the Jhirak and Shah Bandar Divisions and causing widespread distress. In 1895 the river rose unusually early, standing at 17 feet on the Kotri gauge on June 26th. On August 17th it reached its then record of 23.74 inches. The embankments of the Baghar and Kalri canals and most of the bunds on either side of the river were breached, and the consequent floods destroyed the entire kharif crop. Finally in 1914 the gauge reading on August 11th reached the highest point ever recorded, i.e., 23.8 inches. In this year the bunds of the Shalbandar Division stood, but that in Ghorabari Taluka burst, and an enormous area of that taluka was flooded, there being a great destruction of property as well as of the crops. The town of Kotri also was only with difficulty saved from submersion.\n\nThe climate of Karachi is the best in Sind and one of the best anywhere in the plains of India since the fierce heat of summer is tempered by a breeze from the sea, which, however, is not so moisture-laden and depressing as it is on the Bombay coast.\nGenerally the sea breeze begins to blow fitfully in March and settles down in April, after which a strong and steady wind from W.-S.-W. night and day is the rule till October. While this lasts the thermometer rarely rises above $93^\\circ$ or falls below $75^\\circ$, while the humidity of the air ranges from $75^\\circ$ to $85^\\circ$. But about May and again in October, or earlier, disturbances are liable to occur, the wind suddenly shifting; then the thermometer rises to over $100^\\circ$ while humidity falls by from $20^\\circ$ to $50^\\circ$. These hot, dry blasts rarely last as long as a week. In November the land breeze sets in and for four months the prevailing direction is E.-N.-E., the temperature gradually sinking until it may range for days together between $60^\\circ$ and $40^\\circ$, which is the lowest officially registered, though ice has been found in the public gardens at Karachi and precious plants have been severely frost-bitten. Humidity is very variable during the cold season, but the air is never dry with the dryness of Northern India. As far as can be judged from the materials available, the greatest difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb thermometers occurs in October, the least in April. Details of temperature for 17 years are given in Table III. The highest temperature recorded was $116^\\circ$ in May 1901, which was quite exceptional; the lowest $40^\\circ$ in January of several years. In the last seven years the thermometer never reached $100^\\circ$. The greatest range of temperature in one month was $43^\\circ$ in January 1902. These figures are for Karachi and may be taken as approximately applicable to all the coast talukas. Towards Tatta and Kotri the average maximum is higher, the thermometer rising commonly above $100^\\circ$ from April to October inclusive; and the average minimum lower, $32^\\circ$ being registered occasionally. With respect to the sensations of the inhabitants the principal climatic difference is perhaps this, that at Kotri the westerly winds of the hot season come from the Kohistan and not from the sea; consequently the heat is a dry heat. In winter, with the northerly winds blowing from the Indus Valley, there is not the same difference. Information about the climatic conditions of the Kohistan is not available, Thano Bula Khan being the only station at which even the rainfall is registered. The higher hills might afford pleasant sanitariums, but for the insuperable obstacle that there is no water on them.\nThe rainfall of the Karachi District varies extraordinarily from year to year, being dependent on what may be called accidental causes. The regular monsoon winds bring no rain to arid plains which receive them into an atmosphere hotter and drier than themselves, but when some cyclonic disturbance causes the wind to veer round to an unusual direction, rain frequently follows. During the last twenty years the annual fall at Karachi itself has fluctuated between a few cents and nearly 20 inches. In 1851 a fall of 22\u00b719 was reported between 5th July and 3rd August. From Table II-A it will be seen that August is the month in which most rain falls, then July, then September; but there may be none in these three months. It is very rare for the first three months of the year to be without rain, though the amounts may be small. Thus there are normally two periods of rain, with two dry intervals, for October and November are practically rainless, and April and May nearly so. The distribution of rain in the district appears also to be subject to no law. Table II-B shows that the normal mean ranges from 0\u00b784 at Manjhand to 9\u00b718 at Tatta or about 4 inches; but in 1909 when Manjhand had 1\u00b737, Tatta registered 6\u00b759. Upon the whole, the average is lowest in the region lying along the right bank of the Indus and highest on the coast, but the difference is small. The highest rainfall on record was 41\u00b722 at Shahbandar in 1913. In the hill country of Kohistan there is only one registering station and there the average is comparatively high\u20148\u00b754.\nPOPULATION.\n\nTables I, IV, V and VI.\n\nCHAPTER IV OF \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nThe figures given in Table I are those of the census of 1911. Of the total population of 521,721, Mussalmans made up 396,334 or about 76 per cent, and Hindus 111,521 or about 21 per cent; of the remainder, 9,013 were Christians and the rest Jews, Parsis, etc.\n\nA kind of census was carried out in 1854, but the results are of no value. There have since been four prior to that of 1911, from which, after making allowance for the Sehwan, Johi and Dadu Talukas, which were transferred from Karachi to Larkana District in 1901, we get the following figures for the district as now constituted:\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1872 | 324,921    |\n| 1881 | 401,046    |\n| 1891 | 411,004    |\n| 1901 | 446,513    |\n\nFrom these figures it appears that the rate of increase has been 16 per cent for the nine years ending 1881, 9 and 8 per cent for the next two decades and 9 per cent for the decade ending in 1911.\n\nThe numerical relations of the sexes is shown in the following table:\n\n| Proportion of females per 1,000 males in | Total population | Home-born population | Mussalmans | Hindus |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|-------|\n|                                        | 773              | 851                  | 810        | 681   |\n\nThe disproportion of females is greater than it was in 1901, and is to some extent explained by comparing the figures in the different columns. There are fewer females among the Hindus, many of whom keep their families in Hyderabad or elsewhere, than among Mussalmans, and far fewer proportionally in the total than in the home-born population, showing that immigrants without families are\nresponsible for much of the disparity. In the town of Karachi with its large foreign elements, this disparity is very striking. The number of females in the city and cantonment in 1911 was only 61,670 as against 90,233 males. But after all has been said, the paucity of females in Sind remains unexplained.\n\nThe density of the population works out to 44 per square mile for the whole district or 32 per square mile if the town of Karachi be excluded. The most populous rural tract is the Deita, especially the talukas of Mirpur Bathoro and Sujawal, which show 145 and 129 to the square mile respectively; and the least is, of course, the hill country: the Kohistan Mahal shows only 10.\n\nThe proportion of the population concentrated in towns was 34 per cent in 1911 as against 31 in 1901. The growth of the town of Karachi fully explains the increase. The rate at which it has grown during the last 39 years is shown in the margin. Excluding the cantonment, the population as ascertained in the census of 1911 was 140,511, which for an area of 66 square miles gives 2,068 per mile.\n\nThe proportion of residents whose home is not in the district is very large. In 1881 it was 18 per cent of the whole, in 1891 it sank to 16 per cent, but in 1901 it rose again to 23 per cent, and in 1911 it was 22 per cent. The countries or districts from which most of the immigrants had come in the last mentioned year are shown in the margin. The largest number came from Cutch, Kathiawar and Baluchistan, and the majority of these were labourers on the rice fields in the coast talukas and also at Karachi. Hyderabad furnished the next largest contingent, which would consist of men in Government service, or in business.\nThe population, classified according to their religions, consisted in 1911 of 396,334 Mussalmans, 111,521 Hindus, 9,013 Christians, 2,202 Zoroastrians, 650 Jains and 278 \"others.\" The number of Christians is larger than anywhere else in Sind owing to the British troops stationed at Karachi and the number of Goanese. These were attracted by the prospect of Government employment immediately after the British occupation and have remained.\n\nProminent Tribes and Families.\n\nThe chiefs of the following tribes reside in the district:\n\nNumria, Jokhia, Karmati, Jat.\n\nThe Numrias, Lumrias or Naumardis (see \"A\" Volume, page 178), classified among Samas in Table VI, constitute a large part of the population of Las Bela and held most of the Kohistan at the time of British conquest. Their present chief is Malik Sobdar Khan walad Malik Sardar Khan, a First Class Jagirdar (see \"A\" Volume, Chapter IX, Alienations). He resides at Kotri. Another First Class Jagirdar of the same tribe, Malik Dodo Khan walad Malik Salar Khan, resides at Thano Bula Khan.\n\nThe Jokhiyas, also included in Samas (see \"A\" Volume, page 174), infested the Delta two centuries ago, robbing merchants, and dominated the country about Karachi under the Mirs, enjoying lucrative privileges in return for the duty of furnishing a contingent of fighting men when required. The Jam of the Jokhiyas, Jam Murad Alikhan, a First Class Jagirdar and an Honorary Magistrate, resides at Malir.\n\nThe Karmatis are a Baluch tribe, deriving their name, it is said, from Karmat in Makran, where they were settled for some time before they came into Sind. They penetrated to Mirpur Sakro where their chief obtained a jagir on the condition that he should muster his tribe for the defence of Tatta when required. The present chief is Jam Punhu walad Khairo Khan. Other First Class Jagirdars of this tribe in the same taluka are Ali Muhammed walad Ibrahim Khan, Ghulam Muhammad walad Khudabakhsh, Jaffar Muhammad walad Alibaksh, Allah Bindo walad Jamal Khan and Jamal Khan walad Mr Ali. In the beginning of 1843 these three tribes gathered together under orders from the Mirs of Hyderabad to attack the British\ncamp at Karachi, but the news of the battle of Miani dispersed them.\n\nThe Jats (see \"A\" Volume, page 174) are found all over Sind, but those in the south acknowledge as their chief a Malik who held lands in the Jati Taluka (which perhaps took its name from them) under title deeds from the Emperors of Delhi. The present representative is Malik Muhammad Sidiq walad Malik Ghulam Hussein, First Class Jagirdar.\n\nBesides these chiefs there are the following First Class Jagirdars of other tribes in the district:\n\nMir Ali Muhammad Khan Ahmad Ali Khan and Mir Ghulam Haidar Khan Jan Muhammad Khan of the Khanani Talpur family are First Class Jagirdars in Ghorabari Taluka, though they reside at Digri in the Thar and Parkar District and Husri in the Hyderabad District respectively. Rashid Khan walad Gawhar Khan of the Mari (Baluch) tribe is a First Class Jagirdar in the Manjhand Malial, but resides at Berani in the Sinjhoro Taluka of the Nawabshah District.\n\nTwo places in the district, Tatta and Laki, are especially associated with those families of Saiyids who immigrated into Sind centuries ago and continued to exercise so potent an influence in the affairs of the country down to the time of British rule. They were feared and favoured and in many cases endowed by the rulers of each successive dynasty. In Tatta they founded many colleges for the study of Arabic learning, and it became what might be called one of the Universities of Sind, Bukkur being the other. Like the religious orders in Europe in the middle ages they did not confine themselves to religion and learning, but acquired great political power and used it, not always in the interests of peace. During the government of Sir Charles Napier their claim to the continuance of the allowances which they had been accustomed to receive from the Talpurs was refused, the Government of India considering that \"the allowances were not granted for the maintenance of any mosque or religious establishment of any kind, but were given as a daily allowance for the support of Saiyids and other persons reputed holy,\" and that they were not \"of that description which it could at any time have been held binding on the British Government to continue.\" Sir Bartle Frere revived the\nquestion, however, and proposed, with the view of turning\nthe Saiyids from a life of religious idleness to the pursuit of\nagriculture, that they should be granted so much land at\nhalf the usual assessment as would amount to a remission\nof Rs. 6,000 a year. The Government of India assented,\nbut the measure failed owing to the disinclination and\nunfitness of the Saiyids for agricultural pursuits. Finally the\nGovernment of India sanctioned an annual money payment\nof Rs. 6,000 to the whole body, leaving them to make their\nown arrangements for its distribution, and this arrangement\nstill continues in force. The Government of India desired\nthat an endeavour should be made to buy up the interests\nof the recipients by a ready-money payment, but they\nshowed no desire to accept such an offer. The principal\nfamilies of Tatta Saiyids are the following:\n\nShukr Illahi Shirazi. These are Husaini Saiyids and\nShias. They state that their progenitor, Saiyid Shukrullah,\ncame to Sind with Shah Beg Arghun (A.D. 1521) and was\nappointed kazi of Tatta. The historian Alisher of Tatta,\nauthor of the \"Tuhiat-ul-kiram,\" was of this family.\n\nMirki, also Husaini and Shia, descended from Saiyid\nMuhammad Mirak, who is said to have come in the train of\nShah Beg Arghun and settled at Tatta. He is reputed to\nhave amassed great wealth, but his descendants are very\npoor. Most of them live at Ghorabari and some at Tatta.\n\nAnjvi Shirazi (commonly called Nakvi), also Husaini and\nShia. These came to Sind, according to their tradition,\nduring the reign of Jam Salah-ud-din, one of the early Sama\nkings (in the 15th century) and settled in Tatta, where\nthey reside still, above 50 in number. They have many\nmurids (disciples).\n\nMazandran Lodhi, also Husaini and Shia, descended\nfrom Saiyid Badrudin, who is said to have come to Tatta in\n987 A.H. (=1559 A.D.). They are few in number and\nlive at Tatta.\n\nThe Lakiari Saiyids, so called because they first settled\nat Laki, where most of them are still to be found, suppose\nthat they came to Sind in the ninth century. They live\nalso at Amri, Manjhand and other places in Manjhand Mahal.\nThe mujawar of the shrine of Lal Shahbaz at Sehwan\nbelongs to this family and is considered the head of it.\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nTables VII and VIII.\n\nCHAPTER V OF \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nThe increase in extent of area (table VII) is mainly due to the results of survey operations. The \"Others\" shown under \"Not available for cultivation\" consist of (1) unculturable lands, comprising hilly tracts, sandy lands and saline tracts; (2) lands set apart for special purposes, viz., for Government and municipal buildings, parade grounds, etc.; (3) lands set apart for public purposes, viz., for burial grounds, roads, railways, musafirkhanas; and (4) land eroded by the river Indus.\n\nA large part of this district, including the whole of the Kohistan Mahal of the Kotri Division, is mountainous or hilly. The Tatta Division is also on the northern and western division diversified to some extent by elevated land, but Shahbandar, the southernmost division of the Karachi District, is altogether low and flat and appears an endless plain intersected by numerous creeks and channels. The cultivation is dependent on the Indus, which forms the eastern boundary of the district for so many miles, on several canals taking out of it, and on the hill torrents of the Baran, Malir and others. The cultivation of the district is increasing owing to constant improvements in the means of irrigation. The nature of the soil and cultivation in each taluka is briefly as follows:\n\nTatta Division consists of the talukas of Tatta, Mirpur Sakro, Ghorabari and Karachi.\n\nTatta.\u2014Its alluvial portion consists of a narrow irregular tract bordering on the Indus. The northern half is much interrupted by hills, whilst in the south a range known as the Makli hills skirts the western side of the taluka to the boundary of Ghorabari. It is watered by the Kalri, Baghar and other canals. About 80 per cent of the cultivation is by flow.\n\nMirpur Sakro.\u2014About half of the taluka is unfit for habitation and has not been divided into dehs. The inhabited portion lies to the east. The western half consists mostly of kalar land, while towards the sea tidal creeks\nbreak the coast line and, overflowing the land, form extensive mangrove swamps. The taluka is watered by the Baghar and other Government canals, but the water supply is only fair. About three-quarters of the cultivation is by flow and the rest by lift.\n\nGhorabari inclusive of Keti Mahal.\u2014Through this taluka the waters of the river Indus find their principal outlet to the sea by the Ochito and its mouth and irrigate the land. The soil is all alluvial. In the south, below Ket Bandar, there is a considerable area of bhal lands frequently swamped by the sea, but on which red rice is freely cultivated. The water-supply of the taluka away from the river is poor.\n\nKarachi.\u2014This is for the most part a hilly country which depends on rainfall for cultivation. It is, in fact, more pastoral than agricultural. The milch-cows of this taluka have achieved a world-wide reputation, and their export to foreign countries has been a matter of some concern for many years past. A Government cattle farm about eight miles out of Karachi is now to be established to conserve and improve the breed. The wealth of this taluka lies more in its stock than in its crops.\n\nKotri Division comprises the Kotri Taluka, Kohistan and Manjhand Mahals.\n\nKotri consists of two distinct portions, a hilly expanse known as the Band Virah Tapa, forming geographically part of Kohistan and a strip of alluvial soil lying between the hilly portion and the river Indus. The latter is irrigated by the Baghdad, Chhandan, Vachero and other canals. The area of cultivation under flow and lift is about equal.\n\nKohistan Mahal may be described as a succession of broad valleys lying between ranges of hills running generally north to south. The level both of plains and hills rises as one goes north. The little cultivation is entirely dependent on hill springs and on rain. Keeping sheep and goats is the chief occupation of the inhabitants.\n\nManjhand Mahal.\u2014Most of this consists of rocky hills and high land unfit for cultivation. It is divided into two parts by the North-Western Railway, which also approximately marks the boundary between lands depending for\ncultivation on rainfall and lands irrigated by canals or directly from the river. The irrigated portion is again divided into two by the Sann nai, north of which the water supply is derived directly from the river, while the southern portion contains the Government canals Karo, Shah Panjo and Butho. Nearly half the cultivation is dependent on rain and the amount of flow cultivation is only 3 per cent of the whole.\n\nShahbandar Division comprises the Shahbandar, Jati, Mirpur Bathoro and Sujawal Talukas.\n\nShahbandar.\u2014Its soil consists of the usual alluvial loam, but with an admixture of sand. In the extreme south, near the sea, however, where the out-flowing water of the Indus meets the in-coming tides of the sea, a deposit of soil takes place, which consists of a soft slimy mud, locally named bhul, on which rice is grown. The most characteristic feature of the soil generally is that, wherever the silt-laden water of the Indus has ceased to flow over it for a year or two, it turns into kalar, and kalar lands again become cultivable when overflowed for two seasons. The chief canals are the Sattah, Khanto, Ghar and Kodario. Almost the whole of the cultivation is by flow, only about 3 per cent being lift.\n\nJati.\u2014The portion of the taluka near the coast is a maze of tidal creeks, and further inland a saline plain, with no cultivation and little vegetation, scarcely inhabited by man or beast. The country towards the north-east is culturable waste land, for which at present there is no irrigation available. The principal canals are the Gungro, Saida, Mirza, Sattah and Gungri. Almost the whole of the cultivation is by flow, lift forming a very small proportion.\n\nSujawal.\u2014The most prominent feature of the country is the great extent of perennial marshes, which fill a chain of depressions running from Wali Shah on the north-westwards to Sujawal and southwards towards the Gungro canal, which now, by new drainage channels, conveys the flood water to the sea below Mughulbhin. For the rest the soil is the usual alluvial loam of Sind, the deposit of the river Indus. Formerly the taluka was subjected to destructive floods from the Indus, but latterly it has been protected by\npowerful river embankments. The cultivation is mostly by flow.\n\nMirpur Bathoro is an alluvial plain well watered by the Pinyari and Mulchand and some minor canals. The level is comparatively high and the taluka is consequently safe from the great floods to which the adjoining depressions of Sujawal are occasionally subjected. The cultivation is mostly by flow.\n\nThe various kinds of soil are so called by the people in consideration of the particular crops which can be grown upon them. Thus in practice a 'kalrati' soil is only suitable for rice crops, 'dasar' for juari, bajri and green gram, 'wariasi' for gourds and melons, 'rao' for juari, wheat and green gram. \"Shor kalar\" is unsuitable for any kind of crop.\n\nThe principal crops grown in the district are:\n\n**KHARIF CROPS**\n\n*Rice.*\u2014Rice is the staple food crop of the district and is cultivated in all parts except Karachi Taluka and Kohistan and Manjhand Mahuls. Both white and red rice are grown, but the latter variety is the more common. The usual white varieties are known as ratria and sathria, whilst the red are called motia, ganja and kambru.\n\n*Juari.*\u2014More than half the cultivation of this crop is done in the Kotri Taluka, some in Kstachi, Tatta and Kohistan. Two varieties, white and red, are grown.\n\n*Bajri.*\u2014Except in the hilly tracts of Kohistan and Manjhand, bajri is grown throughout the district.\n\n*Sesame.*\u2014The cultivation of sesame is small and generally distributed.\n\n*Green gram.*\u2014This is chiefly cultivated in Mirpur Sakro, Karachi, Ghorabari, Shahbandar and Sujawal.\n\n**RAHI CROPS**\n\n*Wheat.*\u2014Practically the entire wheat crop is grown along the river Indus in Kotri Taluka. White and red varieties are grown. The crop is principally raised either on kacha and other lands which have been submerged by the spill of the river or of a canal (sailabi) or on lands which\nhave been given a flooding by wheel irrigation towards the end of the inundation (bosi).\n\nBarley.\u2014Barley is chiefly grown in Tatta, Ghorabari, Mirpur Sakro and Sujawal.\n\nSaria and Jambho.\u2014The cultivation of saria (colza) is chiefly undertaken in Kotri and Mirpur Sakro. Jambho is grown everywhere.\n\nChickling vetch.\u2014This is principally grown in kacha lands which have been submerged by the spill of the Indus in Kotri, Tatta, Ghorabari and Shahbandar and also on host lands.\n\nVegetables.\u2014The indigenous vegetables in common use are cultivated in all talukas. European vegetables are grown in the gardens of Karachi and Malir, and in the Local Fund gardens at the taluka headquarters.\n\nFruit trees.\u2014Fruit gardens are found at Malir and Karachi. The best mangoes, guavas, figs and plantains in the district are grown at Malir. Grapes are chiefly grown in Karachi. The date-palm only flourishes at Kotri. Coconut trees are found at Karachi and at Keti Bandar.\nIRRIGATION.\n\nTables IX and X.\n\nCHAPTER VI IN \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nThe irrigation system cannot be treated by revenue districts, as these do not correspond with the districts into which Sind is divided by the Irrigation Department. Figures relating to all canals, of which any portion enters the Karachi District, will therefore be found in Table X, and for a full account of these the \"A\" Volume may be consulted. The extent and methods of cultivation by means of canal water are dealt with under the head \"Agriculture.\"\nECONOMIC.\n\nTables XI and XII.\n\nCHAPTER VII OF \"A\" VOLUME:\n\nRents, wages, prices, credit and indebtedness have been discussed for the whole province in Chapter VII of \"A\" Volume and the Karachi district scarcely presents any special feature. There is indeed a remarkable uniformity in the rates of wages in the different districts as shown in Table XII. In Karachi town a coolie can earn perhaps twice what he can anywhere else, but the average is not appreciably affected by that. The price of most grains is lower in Karachi District than elsewhere and all imported articles are naturally cheaper.\nCOMMUNICATIONS, TRADE AND INDUSTRIES.\n\nCHAPTER VIII OF \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nThe district was formerly a difficult country to travel in. North of a line drawn from Karachi to Tatta it consisted of rocky hills or waterless wastes; south of that line it was for half the year a waste of water, where the rice was reaped in boats and the wandering Jats voyaged on floats of grass. Natural conditions remain the same, but in the south the inundation has to some extent been brought under restraint and canals have been bridged, while in the north roads have been made and rest-houses multiplied. Above all a railway now traverses the district from Karachi to Laki with stations on an average at every eighth mile. The railway has been treated as a whole in Chapter VIII of the \"A\" Volume, and so have the postal and telegraph systems. Something remains to be said about the roads. There are three main lines of road starting from Karachi which follow the old trade routes\u2014one to Tatta and on to Lakhpur in Cutch and two to Sehwan for Shikarpur and the north. Of the latter, one passes through Kotri and is best known as the Hyderabad road. It takes the same course as the railway and is therefore very little used. The stages on the roads are exhibited in the following statements:\n\n| Stage          | Distance | Character of road | Remarks |\n|----------------|----------|-------------------|---------|\n| From Karachi   | 10       | Good and runs over an extensive plain.

The ruins of Bhambor lie 3 miles distant to the south-west. |\n| Gujo        | 12       | Clear road; heavy and sandy. | Public Works Department bungalow, musafirkhanas and camping ground. Good water. |\n| Tatta       | 10       | Clear road; good  | Staging and district bungalows on the Makli hills; camping ground; water not very good. |\n| Sujawal     | 18       | Crosses the Indus by the Sadpur ferry at Machhi's village.

Sweet water is brought from Lakhpur. |\n\nNote. The Kotri creek is crossed here and Lakhpur is reached.\n\nThe road from Kotri to Lakhi takes the following route:\n\nFrom Kotri to Petam: 14 Along the bank of the Musafirkhana; Indus water.\n\nBhian: 12 Shady\n\nManjhand: 15 Good, but not shady\n\nMusafirkhanas; Local Fund wells.\n\nThe head-quarters of the market. A small district bungalow and a musafirkhana; good water. The railway station is a mile to the west.\n\nSann: 11 Do.\n\nAmiri: 12 Do.\n\nMusafirkhanas and Indus water.\n\nStaging bungalow and musafirkhanas; Indus water.\n\nLaki: 10 Do.\n\nBungalow and musafirkhanas; Indus water. The Laki hot springs are at Dhara Tirth 2 miles to the north-west.\n\nFive miles further, at Morelak, is the boundary of the district.\nThe other main roads through the district are:\n\n(1) Dabheji station to Gharo (7 miles), to Mirpur Sakro (15 miles), to Buhara (6 miles), to Garho (18 miles) and to Keti Bandar (16 miles).\n\n(2) Jungshahi to Tatta (13 miles metalled), to Pir Patho (13 miles), to Kotri Allahrakhio Shah (12 miles), to Garho (18 miles) and to Keti Bandar (16 miles).\n\n(3) Kotri to Thano Bula Khan (32 miles).\n\n(4) Sujawal to Mirpur Bathoro (15 miles).\n\n(5) Karachi to Pir Mangho (10 miles) and to the Habb river (7 miles).\n\nWith the exception of the roads from Karachi to Pir Mangho and from Jungshahi station to Tatta none of the roads of the district is metalled. Except in municipal towns and cantonments the roads are in charge of the local boards, and up to the present have served their purpose. Hitherto transport has been mainly by camels, and carts have been few. Since the opening of the railway military traffic has practically stopped. With the development of motor transport the metalling of the main roads may become necessary.\n\nIn the Delta the traffic is almost entirely by water. Numerous creeks and channels are connected by cross channels, so that small boats can make their way at high water in any direction within a distance of fifteen to twenty miles from the shore.\n\nTraffic between Keti Bandar and Karachi is mainly by sea, except during the monsoon months.\n\nThere are numerous ferries plying across the river Indus. The canals are on the whole well bridged.\n\nThe great facilities for transport in every direction which exist now make it almost impossible to give any account of trade by districts. The trade of Karachi is nearly an equivalent term for the trade of Sind and it has therefore been treated in Chapter VIII of the \"A\" Volume. Further information is given below in the article on the Port of Karachi. Within the district the movement of trade consists chiefly in the\nflowing together to Karachi of the rice, wheat, wool, bones, hides and other produce of the country, and the distribution from Karachi, by way of the smaller towns, of piece-goods, sugar, kerosene oil and the miscellaneous manufactured articles from Bombay and Europe which people have learned to require. Among these, ironmongery and chemical dyes may be specially mentioned. The means of transport are road and rail in the northern half of the district and water in the southern. That which takes the former is nowhere registered in a form that can be made use of here, and it is less important. That which takes the latter has two principal gates\u2014Keti Bandar and Sirganda\u2014where it is all registered in the Custom Houses at those places (q.v. under \"places of interest\"). A good deal of produce, however, finds its way by the Gharo creek to Ghizri Bandar, which is a sub-port of Karachi, and is therefore absorbed in the trade of Karachi. Both Keti Bandar and Sirganda have a certain amount of direct trade with Cutch, Kathiawar and even Zanzibar; but the greater part of their exports first go to Karachi and are eventually included in the foreign or coasting trade of the chief port. The exports of the district, as of the province, always largely exceed the imports and consist almost entirely of raw produce, rice preponderating over all else. There are no arts or manufactures in the district of sufficient importance to deserve mention at all as an element in the trade, though from other points of view some, like the weaving of lungis at Tatta, are interesting. These are described in the general article in the \"A\" Volume and are mentioned also in connection with places at which they are a speciality. There is, however, one humble industry of the district which should not go altogether unnoticed, because it employs many hands and is also the cause of a local traffic by no means insignificant. This is the manufacture of mats (pankha) from the rank grasses, sar and kanh that grow on the river banks. These mats, which are used for temporary huts, boat swamps and many other purposes, form a very considerable proportion of the cargoes of the boats that ply among the mouths of the Indus and between them and Karachi.\nREVENUE.\n\nTables XIV, XV, XXII-A, XXII-B, XXIII, XXIV, XXV, XXVI-A and XXVI-B.\n\nCHAPTER IX OF \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nTable XV details the rates of assessment payable under the current settlement in each taluka of the district. The history of the various kinds of settlements that have been in force in the province from time to time have been given in Chapter IX of the \"A\" Volume. The irrigational settlement is in force in every taluka, except Karachi, and the Manjhand and Kohistan Mahals. The irrigated portions of Karachi Taluka near Malir and Landhi, comprising three tapas, were settled for the first time in 1911-12. The remainder of the taluka is divided into five tapas which have been roughly surveyed. The rates in force in these are 8 annas per acre for unploughed barani, 12 annas for ploughed barani, Re. 1 for flow aided by lift. In the hilly country of Manjhand and Kohistan it is impossible to bring cultivation under any very definite rules as it depends entirely upon rain, and crops are raised whenever there is sufficient moisture in the soil.\n\nThe figures of revenue given in Table XXII-A are expanded under different heads in the six succeeding tables. The head \"Other Sources,\" which is intended for miscellaneous sub-heads not deserving of separate notice, includes, in this instance, the imperial customs revenue collected at Karachi, Keti Bandar and Sirganda, and nearly four-fifths of the whole salt revenue of the province, and therefore amounts to more than the double of all the other heads put together. It also includes the revenue derived from fisheries, but not forest revenue, which is separately shown in Table XIV. Its sources are shown in the article on forests in Chapter II of the \"A\" Volume. The history and management of the customs and salt revenue are described along with excise, stamps, income tax, etc., in Chapter IX of that volume. The whole of the salt duty credited in this district is collected at the Maurypur Salt-works, a description of which is given below under \"Places of Interest.\" Allusion to these Salt-works has already been made in Chapter IX of the \"A\" Volume.\nThe right to fish in the Indus and in the canals and dhands within the District is annually sold by auction. In the case of canals and dhands filled by canals, the right is sold by auction and the proceeds are credited to the Public Works Department.\n\nIn the case of the river and of dhands filled by the inundation, the Revenue Department sells the right and receives the proceeds.\nJUSTICE.\n\nTables XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX and XXI.\n\nCHAPTER X IN \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nIn addition to the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of Sind at Karachi, which is also the Court of Sessions and District Court for the Karachi District, the following Criminal and Civil Courts exist in the district. The jurisdiction of each is specified:\n\n| Name of Court | Jurisdiction |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Court of the District Magistrate | The entire district. |\n| Port Officer | Kiamari and Manora. |\n| City Magistrate | Within Karachi City divided between them. |\n| Additional City Magistrate | Cantonments Karachi and Manora. |\n| City Deputy Collector | Tatta Division. |\n| Cantonment Magistrate and Cantonment Court of Small Causes, Karachi | Shalbandar Division. |\n| Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Tatta | Kotri Division. |\n| Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Shalbandar | Shalbandar Division. |\n| Resident Magistrate, Sujawal | Tatta Division. |\n| Nine Courts of Mukhtyarkars and Magistrates, one in each taluka. | Within taluka limits. |\n| Nine Courts of Head Munshis and Magistrates, one in each taluka. | Do. |\n| Court of Mahalkari and Magistrate, Manjhand Kohistan | Manjhand Mahal. |\n| Court of Small Causes, Karachi | Kohistan Mahal. |\n| Subordinate Civil Court, Tatta | Kotri Bandar. |\n| | The town and taluka of Karachi. |\n| | The whole of the Karachi District with the exception of Karachi Taluka. The Sub-Judge visits Kotri and Sujawal on circuit. |\n\nThe District Magistrate is by law a first class magistrate.\n\nThe Sub-divisional Magistrates, the Resident Magistrates and the Magistrates in Karachi are invariably of the first class, the Mukhtyarkars are either of the first or second class, the Mahalkaris usually of the second class, and the Head Munshis of the third class.\n\nFour benches of Magistrates invested with second class powers also sit in Karachi City.\nThere are three Special Magistrates in Karachi City and seven Special Magistrates in the district, who sit regularly for the disposal of cases. The powers conferred upon them vary.\n\nIn the district ten Registration Sub-districts have been created, with offices at Karachi, Mirpur Bathoro, Tatta, Mirpur Sakro, Kotri, Keti Bandar, Ladiun, Jati, Ghorabari and Thano Bula Khan. The Registration Sub-districts correspond therefore with two exceptions to the revenue divisions of talukas and mahals. Sujawal and Manjhand have not yet been formed into separate Registration Sub-districts. Deeds relating to property situated in Sujawal are presented to the Sub-Registrar of Mirpur Bathoro, while deeds relating to property in Manjhand Mahal are presented to the Sub-Registrar, Kotri, who for the purpose is required to visit Manjhand for one week every month. At Karachi, Kotri, Tatta and Mirpur Bathoro the work is done by full-time Sub-Registrars; elsewhere it is done by the taluka Head Munshis in addition to their own duties.\n\nThere are in the district a district prison at Karachi and eleven third class subsidiary jails, one in each taluka, or mahal, headquarters town, except Karachi. Besides these there are six police lock-ups at certain of the police stations.\n\nThe Karachi prison, to which figures in Table XXI relate, was situated in the jail quarter of the town, on the Bandar Road, having been constructed in 1858 at a cost of Rs. 1,12,412 and covering 10\u00bd acres. For many years it proved to be quite inadequate, and in 1906 a spacious new jail was opened on the plain north of the water-works reservoir. It is reached by the road running north-east from the Soldiers' Bazaar. The area within the outer wall, which is 13 feet high, is 10,889 square yards and provides accommodation for 325 males and 17 females. The several barracks, cells and workshops for male prisoners are surrounded by an inner wall 9 feet high. Between the two, in separate enclosures, are female cells, wards for Europeans, juvenile offenders, etc., and a hospital. The male prisoners' barracks are all fitted with cubicles of strong wire-netting. The quarters for the jail staff are all outside of the main wall. The total cost of the building was Rs. 3,57,000.\nLOCAL AND MUNICIPAL.\n\nTables XXVII-A and B and XXVIII.\n\nCHAPTER XI IN \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nLOCAL BOARDS.\n\nThe District Local Board is composed of 12 nominated and 11 elected members. The former include the Collector who is always appointed President, two Assistant Collectors, one District Deputy Collector, the Huzur Deputy Collector and the Executive Engineer, Karachi Canals. The elected members consist of one member from each of the Taluka Boards, one from the Karachi Municipality and one from the holders of entire alienated villages. The Vice-President is now for the first time a non-official.\n\nThere is a Taluka Local Board for each taluka, the number of members depending upon its size. The Assistant Collector or Deputy Collector in charge of the taluka is its President, and non-official Vice-Presidents are now being appointed, as opportunity for doing so presents itself.\n\nThe tables give details of the revenue and expenditure of the Boards. Besides the maintenance of roads, which involves keeping in repair some 800 important bridges, the District Board kept up the following important works during the year 1915-16:\n\n- 62 wells and tanks.\n- 10 travellers' bungalows.\n- 60 dharamshalas.\n- 103 schools.\n- 10 dispensaries.\n\nThe Board contributed to the following institutions in 1915-16:\n\n| Institution                          | Rs.   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|\n| Dayaram Jethmal Sind College         | 1,300 |\n| Sind Madressah                       | 1,800 |\n| Victoria Museum                      | 600   |\n| Zoological Garden                    | 1,000 |\n| Lady Dufferin Female Hospital, Karachi | 2,250 |\n| Karachi Civil Hospital               | 1,000 |\nTatta Municipality for maintaining schools and dispensaries  \nManjhand Municipality for maintaining schools and dispensaries  \nMunicipal Dispensary, Kotri  \nMunicipal Dispensary, Keti Bandar  \nMedical School, Hyderabad  \nNew High School, Karachi  \nLouise Lawrence Institute  \nJaffar Fudoo Dispensary\n\nThe Board keeps up some gardens and maintains the vaccinating establishment of the district.\n\nMUNICIPALITIES.\n\nThe progress and the present position of municipal government in Sind are sketched in Chapter XI of the \"A\" Volume. When Bombay Act VI of 1873 was extended to Sind on 1st October 1878, the Karachi District had Municipal Commissions in 14 towns, 8 of which, having less than 2,000 inhabitants, were excluded by that Act. Of the remaining 6 towns, Karachi having more than 10,000 inhabitants became a \"City Municipality,\" while the following five became \"Town Municipalities\"\u2014Kotri, Manjhand, Tatta, Mirpur Bathoro and Keti Bandar. The last had been eroded by the river in 1877, but arose again in a new place. In 1878 the Karachi Municipality set the example to Sind of levying a house-tax and was followed by Kotri and Keti Bandar. The elective system was introduced in Karachi and Kotri in 1884. When the enactments of 1873 and 1878 were repealed by Bombay Act III of 1901, which amended and consolidated the whole law relating to municipalities in cities and towns of the Presidency other than the city of Bombay, Karachi continued to be a City Municipality. The Municipality of Mirpur Bathoro was abolished in 1895, but the other four mentioned above remain to this day.\n\nThe Karachi Municipal Council in 1915-16 consisted of 42 members, of whom 24 were elected by wards, 2 by the Chamber of Commerce, 2 by the Indian Merchants' Association and 14 were...\nnominated by the Commissioner in Sind. The President is a non-official. The executive body is a Managing Committee of 9 members, of which the president is Chairman and the Vice-President a member.\n\nThe area originally assigned to the Municipality embraced 71\u00b742 square miles of ground and there has since been little change in these limits, except that in 1903 Manora, comprising an area of 2\u00b72 square miles, was declared to be a Cantonment and the municipal boundaries were adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe average income of the Municipality since the year 1904-05 has been Rs. 17,55,287 and the expenditure Rs. 16,84,134. Up to 1915 octroi was the main source of the income, accounting for more than one-half of it. In that year a terminal tax was introduced in lieu of it. The total revenue derived from the tax up to March 31st, 1914, was Rs. 2,34,546-13-0 and that for the year 1916-17 Rs. 6,42,787-10-7. The rest of the revenue is derived from water rate, conservancy cess, house-tax, rents, the sale of land, market and slaughter-house fees, tax on animals and vehicles, miscellaneous items and contributions. Government make an annual grant equal to one-half of the municipal expenditure on primary education, and smaller contributions for general and educational purposes are also received from the Local Board.\n\nThe principal claims on the revenue, after meeting the cost of general administration and collection of taxes, are conservancy, roads, schools and colleges, drainage, lighting libraries and museums, hospitals and dispensaries. The Municipality supports 18 primary schools and pays grants to 18 primary and 5 secondary schools. Karachi is the only town in Sind that maintains an agency of its own for the registration of births and deaths. The Registrar is also Superintendent of Vaccination. The municipal debt which stands at Rs. 17,71,350 is being paid off by means of a sinking fund. This debt was incurred on account of water works and drainage, on which the current expenditure is also heavy; but in the case of the water works it is reproductive expenditure, and even the drainage system has been made to yield a certain amount of revenue by its connection with a farm.\nThe constitution of the other Municipalities in the district is exhibited in the following table:\n\n| Municipality   | Commissioners |\n|----------------|---------------|\n|                | Officials     | Non-officials | Total | Population in 1911 |\n| Kotri          | 3             | 9             | 12    | 7,256              |\n| Manjhand       | 3             | 7             | 10    | 2,838              |\n| Tatta          | 4             | 8             | 12    | 11,161             |\n| Keti Bandar    | 4             | 8             | 12    | 1,734              |\n\nKotri is the only town in the district, except Karachi, which enjoys the privilege of electing a portion of its corporation. Six of the twelve are elected and the remainder nominated by the Commissioner in Sind. In the other three Municipalities the members are all nominated, either by name or in virtue of their offices. In Kotri the Deputy Collector is the President and the Mukhtyarkar has invariably been elected to the office of Vice-President. The same is the case in Manjhand, the Mahalkari of the mahal being the Vice-President. In Tatta and Keti Bandar the Assistant Collector in charge of the division is the President and the Mukhtyarkar always the Vice-President. All these Municipalities derive their revenue principally from octroi duties. In Kotri and Keti Bandar there is a house-tax, but it scarcely yields as much revenue in the former place as fees from markets and slaughter-houses, nor in the latter as much as the cattle-pound. A refund of octroi duty is always granted if applied for on goods which are exported within two years, but all the refunds do not amount to more than 5 or 6 per cent of the receipts. The incidence of taxation ranges from Rs. 1-4-2 per head per annum in Manjhand to Rs. 2-13-9 in Kotri. The heaviest charges on the revenues are always the maintenance of schools and the local dispensary and conservancy. The balance of the expenditure excluding working expenses and the collection of the revenue is on the repair and lighting of roads, buildings and the maintenance of gardens. Government pays to each Municipality\none-third of the amount expended by it on education and the Local Board always makes a contribution towards the dispensary. On the other hand the Municipalities pay something to the Local Funds for the services of their vaccinators. None of these four Municipalities has any debt. On the contrary their accounts show a credit balance, which, in the case of Keti Bandar, amounts to five times a year's revenue.\n\nCANTONMENTS.\n\nThe Karachi Cantonment has existed ever since the conquest and an area of 2.92 square miles was reserved for it by Sir Bartle Frere when fixing the municipal limits in 1858. Its present area is 10.37 acres 23 gunthas (3 square miles). The Sadar Bazaar, which was originally included in the Cantonment, was handed over to the Municipality and an arrangement was made in 1896 whereby the Municipality, in view of the fact that it recovers wheel-tax, etc., from residents in the Cantonment, pays to the Cantonment Committee an annual sum of Rs. 7,000 for repair of roads, lighting, etc. Other sources of Cantonment revenue are land, house and conservancy taxes, etc., the income from which for the last ten years has averaged Rs. 40,982. The average expenditure, chiefly on conservancy, has been Rs. 42,704. The Cantonment Committee is constituted under the Cantonment Code of 1899 and consists of the officer who would succeed to the command of the Cantonment during the temporary absence of the Officer Commanding the Brigade as President, the Cantonment Magistrate as Secretary, the City Magistrate representing the District Magistrate, the Sanitary Officer, Executive Engineer and District Superintendent of Police, such Commanding Officers as may be appointed in Station Orders and an additional member, or members, appointed by the General Officer of the Command. If the President dissents from any decision of the Committee he may refer the matter to the Officer Commanding the Brigade; and similarly if the District Magistrate dissents from any decision of the Committee on the ground that it is prejudicial to the public health, safety or convenience, he may refer it to the Local Government through the Commissioner.\nIn October 1903 the whole of Manora was declared a Cantonment. The area included is 302 acres and 32 gunthas, Baba and Bhit not being part of it. The Committee consists of five members, one of whom represents the Port Trust. The Cantonment Magistrate of Karachi is the Secretary. The sources of revenue are a property rate on houses and lands, a sanitary cess on non-military residents and a tax on vehicles and animals. Until these imposts were legalized in November 1905, the Committee was dependent on a Government grant-in-aid. Since then its average income has been Rs. 3,938 and the average expenditure Rs. 3,203. The military roads in the Cantonment are maintained by the Military Works Department and the other roads by the Cantonment Committee.\nEDUCATION.\n\nTables XXIX-A, B, C and D.\n\nCHAPTER XII IN \"A\" VOLUME,\n\nTable XXIX-B shows the number of educational institutions existing in Karachi during the 20 years ending 1915-16 and the number of boys and girls receiving instruction in them. Those recognized by the Educational Department and assisted by Government are classed as Public, others as private. The Primary Schools described as Public indigenous are those which, though they do not teach according to prescribed standards and therefore do not receive grants-in-aid, submit to inspection and get a small subsidy on certain conditions. Under the present rules a grant-in-aid is made by Government from provincial revenues as far as possible to all schools which conform to the prescribed conditions. The grant in each case is assessed by the Educational Inspector, or by one of his assistants, and is limited to one-half of the local assets, or one-third of the total expenditure of the institution, during the previous official year except in the case of Girls' Schools where the maximum grant is equal to half of the expenditure, and the Indigenous Schools where the grant ranges from Rs. 2 to 6 for a boy according to the standards. For each girl the grant is double of that for a boy in the corresponding standard. The details of the expenditure will be found in Table XXIX-D. The duty of providing primary education devolves in rural and non-municipal areas on the Local Boards and constitutes in municipal areas one of the statutory obligations of the Municipality. The development of these institutions during the last twenty years is shown in Table XXIX-B. The extent to which the measures adopted by these public bodies are seconded by private enterprise is also exhibited.\n\nAll the Local Board Primary Schools are boys' schools and teach according to the superior standards. Some of the schools in the mofussil, having a small number of pupils, have been permitted to teach up to the 4th standard superior. Mussalmans constitute 57 per cent of the total number of pupils and 28\u00b77 per cent of the pupils are the children of cess-payers. Education in these schools is\npartly free. The percentage of pupils paying no fees in the Local Board Schools is 84.1. In 62 per cent of the schools no fees are charged, whilst in the remainder a small fee ranging from 6 pies to 2 annas a month is charged. Even in those schools there is a free list comprising 25 to 75 per cent of the pupils.\n\nThe tuition in Municipal Primary Schools is identical with that given in Local Board Schools teaching up to the 7th Vernacular standard. Under this head there are 14 Girls' and 19 Boys' Schools. Although Arabic-Sindhi Schools form the majority, there are many Gujarati Schools to meet the needs of the Parsis, Gujaratis, Cutchis, Memons and others who form a considerable portion of the population of Karachi. There are 2 Marathi Boys', 1 Marathi Girls', 1 Urdu Boys' and 1 Urdu Girls' Schools in Karachi; 1 Gujarati Boys' School and 1 Gujarati Girls' School in Tatta and 1 mixed school at Keti Bandar. There are also two night schools maintained by the Municipalities, one in Karachi and the other in Tatta, but schools of this description exhibit little vitality and constitute an inappreciable element in the educational system of the district.\n\nExcept Keti Bandar all the Municipalities charge school fees for boys, which usually range from 6 pies to 8 annas a month according to the standard. The number of Mussalmans receiving instruction in Municipal Primary Schools is about 36 per cent of the total.\n\nOf the aided schools 22 are for boys and 12 for girls. More than half of them are Gujarati Schools, the rest being Arabic-Sindhi with the exception of a few Marathi and Devanagri Schools. Two of them are branches of the Church Mission High School and one of the Sind Madressah, to which they act as feeders. Seven of the 12 Girls' Schools have been started by the Church Mission Zemana Society in different localities in Karachi. Most of the Boys' Schools teach only up to the 4th Vernacular standard. After completing this course, a boy is transferred, if he wishes to acquire an English education, to an Anglo-Vernacular School, or to one of the High Schools, though it is open to him to prosecute his studies in the Vernacular up to the 7th standard in one of the schools teaching\nup to this standard. The fees charged from boys in these institutions range from 1 to 8 annas per month according to the standard. The number of Mussalmans receiving instruction in Aided Primary Schools amounts to only 30 per cent of the total. Though under private management, all these institutions are classed as Public Schools because they are inspected by and conform to the standards of the Educational Department. They receive a regular grant-in-aid from Government. There are two Government Primary Schools at Manora.\n\nThe Indigenous Schools consist principally of Koran classes which have descended to the present times from the days of native rule. These classes, which are commonly held in mosques or in sheds adjoining the mosques, are attended by Musselman boys and girls, whom the Mullah instructs in the reading of the Koran.\n\nThere are 14 Anglo-Vernacular Middle Schools in the district\u201410 at Karachi, 2 at Kotri (one European School and one Municipal School), 1 at Tatta and 1 at Manjhand. 3 out of the latter 4 are Municipal Schools and the former 10 are aided ones. The European School at Kotri was opened in 1870 and is aided by Government. The expenditure in 1915-16 amounted to Rs. 4,590, of which Rs. 1,250 was contributed by Government, Rs. 1,694 were met from fees and the rest from the municipal funds. The first five standards are taught in the school. The number of pupils on the rolls of the school in March 1916 was 83.\n\nThe school at Tatta which was opened about 1886 is also aided by Government and had 143 pupils on its rolls in March 1916. The expenditure in 1915-16 amounted to Rs. 6,440, of which Rs. 2,183 were contributed by Government, Rs. 2,556 were met from fees and the rest from municipal funds and other sources. The school teaches up to the first six standards. The school at Manjhand was started in 1915. It is only recognized, but it is not aided by the Educational Department. The school teaches up to the first three standards. There were 27 pupils in March 1916.\n\nOther private Anglo-Vernacular Schools in Karachi which are aided by Government are the Madressah Hussainy Boys' School and the Edward Jackson School at Kiamari. There are also two Girls' Anglo-Vernacular Schools, one\nbeing a Parsi and the other a Church of England Zenana Mission School.\n\nUnder the class \"English Middle Schools\" recognized by Government there are only two at Karachi. One is the Girls' Convent School and the other the Parish School. They are classed as Indigenous and are paid a small grant by Government.\n\nThe Girls' Convent School at Karachi has existed separately since 1900 and teaches up to the 6th English standard. There were 205 girls on the roll at the close of the year 1915-16, mostly native Christians. Though organically distinct, this school is under the same management as the Convent High School, of which it was till recently a portion, and it is carried on in the same building.\n\nThe Manora School was founded in 1866 for the education of the children of Europeans and Eurasians resident at Manora and Kiamari. It is controlled by a Committee, of which the Port Officer is ex officio President, and taught by a mistress who has free quarters on the premises. There were 27 children (boys and girls) on the roll in 1915-16. The Kotri School was probably started at a very early date, when the Indus Flotilla and the terminal station of the Karachi-Kotri Railway brought together a considerable European and Eurasian population and Kotri was an important place. As an Aided Middle School it dates from 1884-85. It is controlled by a Local Committee. In 1915 there were 17 pupils on the roll, all Christians.\n\nThere is another English School at Kotri under Roman Catholic management, which is called St. Mary's School. It teaches up to the 5th standard of the secondary course, but it is neither registered nor aided by Government. It receives, however, a grant from the railway.\n\nThe Karachi Narayan Jagarnath High School was the first Government school established in Sind. It was opened in October 1855 with 68 boys. The building, which was situated at the junction of the Bandar and Mission Roads, was designed by Lieutenant Chapman and the Municipality shared the cost of erection with Government. It was superseded in 1876 by the present buildings, which have cost (inclusive of additions in 1896 and 1900) Rs. 63,294 and provide accommodation for 17 classes. The number\nthe old Chapel for the Boys' School, which had grown into a High School. The present building was erected in 1895 on a free site granted by the Cantonment authorities and cost Rs. 51,882, towards which Government granted Rs. 13,036 and the Roman Catholic Mission contributed Rs. 37,746. The building contains one large hall and 8 class-rooms with accessories. In March 1918 the number on the rolls was 361, nearly all Europeans, Eurasians and native Christians. A few Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis and Jews attend.\n\nSt. Joseph's Convent School has grown gradually out of the mixed school opened by the Reverend J. Willy in 1861. The girls were separated in the following year and taken charge of by some nuns of the Congregation of the Daughters of the Cross, and a single-storied building was erected for their accommodation. In 1870 an upper story and central tower 50 feet high were added and the school became a handsome and imposing structure. But as the number of boarders and day scholars increased, further accommodation became necessary, and a third story was added, providing spacious and lofty dormitories. In 1897 a large play-shed was built on the site of the old St. Patrick's Church, and in 1900 a new aisle was added on to the south end. The total cost of the building has been about a lakh, of which Government granted Rs 25,000; the balance was raised by subscription. The accommodation now comprises 16 class-rooms, 2 refectories, 3 dormitories, 2 infirmaries and 19 other rooms, including the Sisters' quarters. In 1900 the school was divided into two distinct institutions\u2014an English-teaching Day School for native Christians and others, which has already been mentioned under Middle Schools, and a Boarding and Day School for European and Eurasian girls, which teaches up to the High School standards. The number of pupils in the latter is about 219, of whom 60 are boarders. The joint institutions are managed by 12 nuns of the order above mentioned and 5 lay Sisters under a Lady Superior. They also carry on a school for the poor in a separate building in the compound.\n\nThe origin of the Church Mission High School was a private school started by Major Preedy, Collector of Karachi, long before Government had moved in the matter of\neducation. In 1846 Major Preedy entrusted his school to a committee of residents, who in 1853 passed it on to the Church Mission Society on the same condition on which they had received it, viz., that all instruction, as far as the subject permitted, should be imparted by means of Christian publications and that these should include the whole Bible. This condition is still observed. The Mission afterwards acquired Major Preedy's kacheri as a Mission House and the little building which he erected in the compound for his school is said to survive as the hall of the present school house. It now contains 14 rooms with accommodation for 250 boys. The number on the roll in March 1910 was 417, of whom 256 were Hindus, 77 Brahmins, 32 Jains, 35 Mussalmans, 9 native Christians, 2 Parsis and 6 Jews. The annual cost of the school, so far as it can be dissociated from the general Mission work, is about Rs. 6,600.\n\nThe Dayaram Jethmal Sind College originated in a memorial sent to the Education Commission which was sitting in Bombay in 1882, urging the desirability of establishing a college in Sind. The contribution guaranteed at that time not being considered sufficient, a Committee was formed to collect funds and was able in 1886 to offer an endowment fund of Rs. 75,000. To the interest of this the Municipalities and Local Boards agreed to add a sum of Rs. 10,850 per annum. Government, still declining to found a college, promised a grant-in-aid of Rs. 10,000 if one were founded. The Committee accepted the offer and started the Sind Arts College in a hired bungalow. The control of it was handed over to the Sind College Board, which was afterwards amalgamated with the society of subscribers, which had been registered as the Sind College Association. This arrangement has continued.\n\nIn 1887 His Excellency the Viceroy, Lord Dufferin laid the foundation stone of the present College building, which was formally opened on 15th October 1893 by the Commissioner in Sind Mr. (afterwards Sir Evan) James. It cost Rs. 1,86,514, of which Government gave Rs. 97,193, the balance being raised by subscription, to which Municipalities, Local Boards and private individuals of all classes contributed with remarkable liberality. The College was named \"The Dayaram Jethmal Sind College\" to perpetuate the memory of the late Honourable Mr. Dayaram Jethmal.\ntwo of the members of whose family had contributed Rs. 25,000 for that purpose. The site for the College was granted by the Municipality free of charge.\n\nIn 1888 an Engineering class, which had existed in Hyderabad for some time, was made a branch of the College; Government promising an annual grant of Rs. 2,000 to assist it.\n\nIn 1894 His Excellency Lord Harris laid the foundation of a hostel on another site granted by the Municipality on the other side of the road fronting the College. It was opened in 1901 as the \"Metharam Hostel\" in honour of Rao Bahadur Diwan Metharam Gidumal, who contributed Rs. 15,000 towards its cost. The total cost was Rs. 1,18,935-6-8, of which Government granted one-half.\n\nIn 1916 the College took over the upper floor of the main building hitherto occupied by the Victoria Museum. In the same year a Biological Laboratory and a Swimming Bath were built.\n\nThe College is one of the most striking buildings in Karachi. Including its adjunct the Victoria Museum, it has a facade 431 feet in length, facing south-west on the Kacheri Road. The front consists of a plinth 5 feet high, supporting an open arcade of dressed stones running along the whole length of the building. In the centre is projected a portico of the Ionic order, surmounted by a pediment, in the tympanum of which a clock is placed. The pillars of the portico are 20 feet high. The central tower rises behind the portico to a height of 121 feet and has a dome 30 feet in diameter, built in stone. The portico leads to an open vestibule, which in turn leads to the main staircase, which is situated under the dome. The floors of these apartments are laid with Mosaic tiles from Belgium. The main staircase is 8 feet wide and is of ornamental cast-iron work. In the south wing is placed the lecture theatre of the College which is a spacious hall, 54 feet long by 34 wide and 35 feet high from floor to ceiling. The walls are pierced by arches at the level of the upper story, thus forming galleries for the use of the public when necessary. The College has, besides the hall, about thirty apartments, including lecture and classrooms, rooms for the Principal and Professors, the Lord Reay Memorial Library, a reading room, chemical and\nphysical laboratories, workshops, etc. The hostel has accommodation for 82 boarders and is always full.\n\nThe teaching staff of the College consists of a Principal, Vice-Principal and 9 Professors, assisted by seven teachers, Lecturers and Fellows. The course of instruction embraces the full curriculum in Arts of the Bombay University. In Engineering there is a three years' course, concluding with an examination conducted by members of the Public Works Department, success in which leads to appointment in that department.\n\nThere are 10 Government scholarships open to students in the College, besides 21 special scholarships and 10 prizes and medals provided by private generosity.\n\nThe fees are:\u2014\n\n| Branch         | Fee        |\n|----------------|------------|\n| Arts Branch    | Rs. 45 a term, Rs. 90 a year |\n| Engineering Branch | \"          |\n\nThe number of students in the Arts Branch in 1915-16 was 288, of whom 181 were Hindus, 9 Brahmans, 39 Mahomedans, 19 Parsis, 18 Europeans and Eurasians and 2 Jews; and 33 Hindus and Mahomedans were in the Engineering Branch.\n\nThe average annual expenditure on the maintenance of the College is about Rs. 65,500 apart from the Engineering Branch which costs separately about Rs. 7,000. The income consists of the Government grant of Rs. 27,200, grants from Municipalities and Local Boards aggregating about Rs. 18,000, the interest derived from the Endowment Fund about Rs. 6,000, and fees which have risen in 10 years from Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 32,500. The total income in 1915-16 was Rs. 1,01,057 besides Rs. 6,377 derived from the Engineering Branch.\n\nThe first newspaper published in Sind appears to have been the \"Sindian,\" which according to the old Gazetteer of 1876, had at that time been in existence for more than a quarter of a century. This became, or gave place to, the \"Beacon,\" and then to the \"Sind Times.\" In the meantime (in 1878-79) the proprietors of the \"Civil and Military Gazette\" at Lahore had started a Sind issue of their paper in Karachi, the name of which was afterwards changed to the \"Sind Gazette.\" This\nbecame the property of the late Colonel Cory, who edited it until 1902. From 1902 to 1912 it was edited by his daughter Mrs. Tate. In 1886 it was combined with the \"Commercial Press\" and the proprietorship transferred to a Joint Stock Company. At or about the same time, the \"Sind Times,\" which had ceased to be European property, stopped publication so that there was no opposition. This want was supplied by the starting of the \"Phoenix\" in 1888 under Indian management. It continues to the present day (1916). The \"SindGazette,\" now called the \"Daily Gazette,\" is the provincial organ of the European population and has a steadily increasing circulation. It is published daily. A bi-weekly paper called the \"Sind Observer\" is also published. Besides these, the \"Sind Sudhar\" may be mentioned as claiming to be the oldest vernacular paper in Sind. It was started originally by the Educational Department and handed over in 1884 to the since defunct Sind Sabha. It is now a private concern and appears to enjoy a large circulation.\n\nThe Karachi Municipal Library, or as it is commonly called, the Frere Hall Library, was originally the General Library, which was founded in 1852 under the presidentship of Mr. (afterwards Sir Bartle) Frere. There was at that time a Station Library, which was the property of the civil and military officers in the Cantonment and was not accessible to the rest of the community. Mr. Frere wished to found one which should be open to the public of all classes, with a graduated scale of subscriptions. So a Library was started and accommodated in a room of the Gymkhana, or the Ladies' Club as it was then called. It was declared to be public property, inalienable without the consent of Government, and the management was entrusted to a Committee consisting of some ex officio members and others elected by the subscribers. With it was combined a Museum, which was probably the one originated by Sir Charles Napier when he was Governor of Sind. The Library and Museum soon out-grew the limited accommodation available in the Ladies' Club and Mr. Frere appealed to Government for help to add two wings to the room. He obtained Rs. 6,000 from Government and Rs. 2,472 more were subscribed. At the same time he got a grant of Rs. 1,000 and a promise of Rs. 800 a year more on the condition that a free Reading Room was maintained.\nThe institution still grew and in 1862 a proposal was received from the Municipality that the existing building should be sold and the proceeds given to the Municipality as a grant towards the erection of the Frere Hall, in which rooms for the institution should be provided. The members were willing to agree to this proposal only on condition that they were guaranteed in undisturbed and uncontrolled possession of their Library and Museum. After some years an agreement was come to, which was sanctioned in Government Resolution No. 1881, dated 9th August 1870, and the Karachi General Library was handed over to the Municipality on the understanding that the Committee of Management should be appointed one-half by the Municipality and one-half by the general body of subscribers. Thus is still its constitution and the rules provide that one room shall be open to the public free of charge as a Reading Room and one room shall be set apart for the exclusive use of the subscribers. The Museum was separated from the Library in 1892 and the collections transferred to the new building described below, the management of them being entrusted to a new Committee by the Municipality at the request of the Library and Museum Committee, who were of opinion that they could not superintend the affairs of both institutions when separately located.\n\nThe Native General Library is supposed to have been founded before 1860 and has accumulated nearly 3,000 volumes, including some rare and curious works. Every year a sum of Rs. 250 or 300 is set apart for the purchase of new books and the Reading Room is supplied with newspapers and periodicals. The Library, as its name implies, is intended for and used principally by educated natives of all classes. It was located till 1905 in an old building of unknown date. This was pulled down and the Library was transferred in the following year to the Ghulam Husain Khalidina Hall. The control of the Library still vests in the subscribers.\nHEALTH.\n\nTables XXX-A and B, XXXI, XXXII and XXXIII.\n\nCHAPTER XIII OF \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nThere are three hospitals in the district\u2014the Civil and Lady Dufferin Hospitals in Karachi and the North-Western Railway Hospital at Kotri.\n\nThe Karachi Civil Hospital is one of the oldest British institutions in Sind and there appears to be no clear record of its origin. It is known that the central part of the old building, which is in the Runchore Lines quarter and stands on the Mission Road, was built by Government in 1854 at a cost of Rs. 6,878, and that it was added to in 1859 by the Sind Railway Company, recently established. Other additions were made and in 1903 it contained 8 wards and 79 beds. It was then completely re-built, and the hospital as it now stands forms one of the most imposing groups of buildings in the city. The following buildings are comprised in the group:\n\n1. A Dispensary, in which out-patients are attended to and new patients seen before admission. It is a single-storied building, paved throughout with marble, containing two large waiting rooms for men and women, with separate examination rooms, dispensary, drug and linen stores, etc.\n\n2. The Diamond Jubilee Block, next to the dispensary, consisting of nurses' quarters. The funds for this were raised by public subscription and the foundation stone was laid by Their Excellencies Lord and Lady Curzon in 1900. This building has since been added to, and there are now quarters for 27 nurses.\n\n3. The Surgical Block.\u2014This is the central building and comprises the hospital proper. It contains the Civil Surgeon's room, recruits' examination room, 4 wards for men and 1 for women, each 26 feet by 17, and a small spare ward, all on the ground floor. The upper story contains 6 wards for Europeans, each 26 by 17 feet, 4 bath-rooms, a duty room, matron's room, etc. The front verandah is 12 feet wide, the back verandah 10 feet. The wards are paved with white marble and have white tiled dadoes, while the bath-\nrooms have pavement and dadoes of Minton tiles. The verandahs, passages and, in fact, all floors not paved with marble are covered with small hexagonal Italian tiles. All corners are rounded off to prevent the accumulation of dust and the large steel girders are eased with cement concrete for the same reason. A large operation room is attached to this block on the ground floor.\n\n4. Medical Block.\u2014This stands to the right of the last and is connected with it by a covered way. It contains, on the ground floor, 2 wards, 26 feet by 17, for Mussalmans, 1 for women, 1 for high caste Hindus and 2 for low caste Hindus, 25 beds in all; and on the upper floor 6 wards for paying Indians, 25 beds in all. The bath-rooms, etc., are as in the Surgical Block.\n\n5. Police Block.\u2014This is similarly situated on the left of the Surgical Block and contains 2 large wards, 37\u00bd feet by 26 each, for ten men, on the ground floor, and the same on the upper floor.\n\n6. Septic Block.\u2014This stands to the rear of the hospital proper, and is provided with a special operation room. It contains wards with accommodation for 6 Mussalmans, 4 women, 4 high caste Hindus and 6 low caste Hindus.\n\n7. A mortuary, four strong wards for supposed insane under observation, quarters for the House Surgeon, ample kitchens and outhouses make up the remainder of the group of buildings, the total cost of which was Rs. 5,72,649.\n\nThe hospital is in charge of the Civil Surgeon, who has under him a House Surgeon, 3 Sub-Assistant Surgeons, 3 compounders, etc. The nursing staff consists of a Lady Superintendent, an Assistant Lady Superintendent, 3 Sisters, and 22 nurses. The cost of the maintenance of the hospital was for the year 1916 Rs. 58,341-12-11. Subscriptions of Rs. 6,313-8-0 and Rs. 12,414 were received in that year from public and semi-public bodies towards the expenses of the Nursing Association. The nursing staff is provided by this Association, and the arrangement is that Government contribute one-half of the expenses whatever they may be.\nThe latest development of the hospital is the erection of an eye hospital to be known as the Seth Goverdhandas Motilal Mohatta Eye Hospital, in honour of the Seth of that name who has contributed Rs. 70,000 for the purpose. The building is to be erected on the site of the House Surgeon's quarters facing Mission Road. Pending its construction, work is being carried on in a temporary structure. For his munificent generosity the title of Rao Bahadur has been conferred on Seth Goverdhandas.\n\nThe Lady Dufferin Hospital opposite the Civil Hospital was opened on 5th November 1898. It is maintained from grants by Government, the Karachi Municipality and the District Local Board, subscriptions, donations and the interest of the Reserve Fund, and is controlled by a Committee, of which the Collector of Karachi is the Chairman. The building which cost Rs. 1,05,000 was presented by Mr. Edulji Dinshaw, C.I.E., of Karachi. Besides the Lady Physician, the Matron and nursing staff at the hospital, the Committee maintain an Assistant Lady Doctor at the Jaffer Fudoo Dispensary for the benefit of women and children living in that part of the city. Within the last few years the work of the hospital has expanded considerably, and to meet the demands upon it an operation theatre, nurses' quarters and a maternity wing have been opened.\n\nIn connection with the hospital and situated within the same compound is an institute for the training of Indian midwives, named the Louise Lawrence Institute, founded in memory of Mrs. Lawrence, wife of a Collector of Karachi, who died in 1912. To commemorate her name and work a sum of over Rs. 75,000 was collected by popular subscription, and was expended in erecting and maintaining the very fine building in which the institute is housed. The work of the institute is comprised under four heads\u2014(1) attending maternity cases among the poor, (2) training of midwives, (3) partial training of dais and (4) lectures to married women. The work is under the control of the Lady Dufferin Hospital Committee, and the institute is in fact an integral part of the hospital.\n\nThe hospital at Kotri was built and is maintained by the North-Western Railway for the benefit of its own employes, but...\npassengers falling ill, or receiving injuries, are also treated at it. It was opened in 1903; the cost of the building was Rs. 25,701.\n\nThere are two Government dispensaries in Karachi.\n\nThe one at Manora is a very ancient institution, dating back to 1856. The remoteness of Manora, where there has always been a considerable establishment of Government servants, made it a necessity. There is an Assistant Surgeon in charge. The other is for the establishment of the Commissioner in Sind, and is almost, if not quite, as old, for the records mention an Apothecary attached to the Commissioner's Dispensary as long ago as 1859. It ranks as a Private Aided Dispensary and there is a Sub-Assistant Surgeon in charge. Of the remaining dispensaries, one in Karachi Cantonment is maintained by the North-Western Railway and the rest by Municipalities and Local Boards, though some of them owe their origin to private beneficence. There are also many dispensaries in Karachi kept by private practitioners.\n\nBesides these there is a Veterinary Dispensary in Karachi which is not included in the table. It was started in a hired building in 1892 and removed in 1895 to its present premises on the Bandar Road. They cover an area of about 10,000 square yards and include in addition to the dispensary separate wards for horses, cattle and dogs, besides an isolation ward and one built for its own purposes by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. There is a shoeing forge also. The cost of the buildings which amounted to Rs. 12,000 was borne equally by the District Local Board, the Karachi Municipality and the general public. The institution was named in honour of Colonel Crawford, for many years Collector of Karachi. A Veterinary Graduate is in charge of it. The cost of maintenance is borne by the District Local Board, contributions of Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 600 being received annually from the Karachi Municipality and Government respectively. In 1915-16 Rs. 4,702 were realized from fees and shoeing charges. In the same year 91 major and 273 minor operations were performed.\nThe Karachi District has 9 talukas and 3 mahals as shown below:\n\n| Taluka or mahal       | Headquarters | No. of taps | No. of dabs | Limits                                      | Area in square miles | Population | Average annual land revenue |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|----------------------------|\n| Shahbander Taluka     | Ladun        | 10          | 124         | 23\u00b0 41' and 24\u00b0 23' North Latitude, 67\u00b0 32' and 68\u00b0 26' East Longitude | 1,516                | 22,723     | Rs. 88,019                 |\n| Jati Taluka           | Mughalshin   | 10          | 135         | 23\u00b0 35' and 24\u00b0 38' North Latitude, 68\u00b0 1' and 68\u00b0 48' East Longitude | 2,145                | 33,847     | 1,07,748                   |\n| Sujawal Taluka        | Sujawal      | 12          | 74          | 24\u00b0 27' and 24\u00b0 33' North Latitude, 68\u00b0 1' and 68\u00b0 18' East Longitude | 269                  | 34,636     | 1,11,336                   |\n| Mirpur Bathoro Taluka | Mirpur Bathoro | 12        | 63          | 24\u00b0 36' and 25\u00b0 1' North Latitude, 68\u00b0 9' and 68\u00b0 49' East Longitude | 269                  | 38,942     | 1,34,845                   |\n| Tatta Taluka          | Tatta        | 8           | 39          | 24\u00b0 31' and 25\u00b0 27' North Latitude, 67\u00b0 34' and 68\u00b0 24' East Longitude | 1,225                | 47,221     | 58,085                     |\n| Mirpur Sakro Taluka   | Mirpur Sakro | 10          | 79          | 24\u00b0 14' and 24\u00b0 51' North Latitude, 67\u00b0 9' and 67\u00b0 55' East Longitude | 1,138                | 31,238     | 58,540                     |\n| Ghorakari Taluka      | Kotri Alharkho Shah | 10    | 89          | 23\u00b0 53' and 24\u00b0 34' North Latitude, 67\u00b0 22' and 68\u00b0 2' East Longitude | 364                  | 31,755     | 74,440                     |\n| Keti Bandar Mahal     | Keti Bandar  | 10          | 99          | 23\u00b0 53' and 24\u00b0 17' North Latitude, 67\u00b0 23' and 67\u00b0 46' East Longitude | 364                  | 1,784      | 74,440                     |\nThe first four constitute the Shahibandar Sub-division, of which an Assistant Collector has charge. He has an old bungalow in a large garden at Sujawal, which was formerly his headquarters, but he now resides at Karachi during the hot season.\n\nThe next four talukas and the Keti Mahal are the Tatta Sub-division, of which an Assistant Collector has charge. He is provided with a bungalow at Tatta, but makes his headquarters at Karachi during the hot season.\n\nThe Kotri Taluka and the Manjhand and Kohistan Mahals, comprising the Kotri Sub-division, are under a Deputy Collector who has his headquarters at Kotri.\n\nEach of the Assistant Collectors and Deputy Collectors is President of the Taluka Local Boards in his charge, while the Assistant Collector, Tatta, is President of the Tatta and Keti Bandar Municipalities, and the Deputy Collector, Kotri, President of the Kotri and Manjhand ones.\n\nThe revenue work of Karachi City is performed by a City Deputy Collector, whilst the City Magistrate is Sub-divisional Magistrate for Karachi. Both work directly under the Collector and District Magistrate. The Collector is in addition to his other duties ex officio Superintendent of Stamps for the province.\nPLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nCHAPTER XV OF \"A\" VOLUME.\n\nBhambor is the local name of a mound of ruins on a low rocky elevation situated on the north bank of the Gharo creek, three and a half miles westwards from the village of Gharo in the taluka of Mirpur Sakro, and about a quarter of a mile to the left of the road to Karachi. The remains of a fort, with walls and bastions, are distinctly traceable, and from among the heaps of broken bricks old coins have frequently been picked up after a fall of rain. No collection of them has, however, been systematically made. From the mound an old dam runs to hilly ground in the north, holding up rain water and forming a lake. As the Gharo creek is the most westerly channel of the Indus, it is probably the oldest and seems more likely than any other to have been the one down which Nearchus sailed. This also gives an air of probability to the hypothesis that Bhambor, and not Tatta, nor any of the other places that have been suggested, was the great Hindu town known as Debal, which was the first object of attack when Muhammad Kasimi invaded Sind. But there is not room on the site for a town of any size and no direction in which it could have extended. Bhambor is said to have been destroyed by an earthquake at the same time as Brahmanabad, i.e., about the middle of the 8th century according to the Tuhfat-ul-kiram. Sasui, the heroine of the romance of Sasui and Punhun (\"A\" Volume, page 484), was the adopted daughter of a washerman of Bhambor.\n\nDharaja. See Lahoribandar.\n\nGharo is a village in Mirpur Sakro Taluka, situated on a small creek between Dabheji railway station and Mirpur Sakro. It is seven miles distant from Dabheji and contains a Staging Bungalow, Vernacular School, Post Office and musafirkhana. A bridge of four arches, built in 1860, spans the creek a little to the east of the village. Formerly Gharo was an important post on the route from Karachi to Tatta and Hyderabad, boats reaching it by the creek from Ghizri Bandar in less than 24 hours. The creek\nwas navigable for vessels of 13 kharars as far as the town. It is still accessible to small boats at high tide.\n\nJam Tamachi-ji-mari, the palace of Jam Tamachi, is an interesting ruin situated on a hill at the north end of the Sonahri Dhand, near Hillaya in Tatta Taluka. The Jam Tamachi referred to was the second of that name and apparently the sixth in the succession of the Sama rulers (see \"A\" Volume, page 98). He reigned for thirteen years in the second half of the 14th century. He fell in love with a fisher maid, Nurahi the daughter of Gandrah, who fished in the Kinjhar lake below the hill on which the mari stands, and made her his queen (i.e., one of them). The story is told in one of the popular songs of Abdul Latif. They appear to have died at Tatta, for two humble tombs are pointed as theirs to this day at the north end of the Makli hills near the mausoleum of Sheikh Himad Jamali.\n\nJerruck (Jhirak) (25\u00b0 3' north latitude and 68\u00b0 18' east longitude), a town in the Kotri Taluka, is situated close to the Indus, at an elevation above it of 150 feet, on the range of limestone hills that runs along its right bank south of Kotri. From its situation, commanding the river as well as the roads from Karachi and Tatta, it was considered a position of some importance by Sir Charles Napier, who made it a Military Depot. Afterwards it was an outpost garrisoned by a company of sepoys. It was also the headquarters of the Deputy Collector. It now contains an Assistant Collector's bungalow, two musafirkhanas, a Vernacular School, Post Office and Dispensary. For many years it has been a Missionary Station. It had a Municipality, but that was abolished in 1878. On a hill to the north of the Kotri road and close to the town is the grave of an Assistant Surgeon Robert Huasey, who died here in 1850, and in another spot lie the remains of the Reverend C. Huntington, Chaplain of Hyderabad, who died here on his way to Karachi on May 27th, 1856.\n\nJerruck is connected, by road, with Tatta, Kotri and Meting, which latter is the nearest railway station, thirteen miles distant. On a flat hill situated in Deh Shekhani of the Tatta Taluka, about 300 yards to the east of the road\nfrom Jerruck to Tatta, and about 3 miles from Jerruck, there are the remains of a Buddhist town. The square basement of a stupa, about 30 feet each way and about 4 feet high, is still there. The fallen superstructure has been removed and piled up all round. It was here that Mr. W. Cole, once Collector of Customs in Karachi, found some Buddhist bricks which were afterwards deposited in the Karachi Museum and subsequently allowed to disappear. As they and any record that may have accompanied them are lost, the following account of their finding may be quoted from Sir R. Burton:\u2014\u201cMr. W. Cole, when Deputy Collector, found, during a chance visit, a large fine grained brick which induced him to trench across the mound. Presently he came upon the top of a wall, and having cleared it down to the level of the hill surface, he opened a building about 85\u00bd feet square. The material was of bricks, each 15\u00bd by 9\u00bc and 2\u00bd inches; the courses were laid without other cement than the fine mud of the Indus, mixed with some fibrous substance. The base showed a bold moulding and at intervals of six feet appeared square projections, as for pilasters. The potteries were in great variety: some moulded and others cut when the clay was soft; most of the human figures were defaced, but the iconoclast had not taken the trouble to break up the architectural ornaments in terracotta.\u201d The people have no legends about this place, but consider it the remains of a \u201cKafar Kot,\u201d i.e., heathen fort, and it is sometimes called by them \u201cKot Raja Maji Rae.\u201d The hill cannot be mistaken, as it is detached from the others, and from its flat summit a splendid view of forest, hill and river is obtained. Good felt (tat) is made in Jerruck.\n\nJhipir, a village near the railway station bearing the same name, contains a temple of Shiva where an annual fair attended by about 800 Hindus is held in February. At a distance of two and a half miles from it to the east is the shrine of Amir Pir, which, although of no architectural interest, dates back to the early Mahomedan times. The mausoleum of the saint is built on a bold cliff overlooking the Sonahri Dhand, which, when joined to those of the Kinjhar lake, forms one of the most beautiful sheets of water to be seen in Sind, bounded as it is by distant red hills and forests. The saint is not, however, buried in the mausoleum, but in a\ndeep cave under the rock, to which steps lead down, first into a court of cells occupied by pilgrims during the annual fairs, then into a smaller courtyard shaded by willow trees, which is kept scrupulously sacred, and then into the inner gloom of the cave. An annual fair is held and is attended by about 1,500 people. There is a house on the rock built for the accommodation of His Highness the Agha Khan, the spiritual head of the Khoja sect, and a number of other houses belonging to headmen of the community, who reside in Karachi, Mirpur Bathoro, Hyderabad and other places in Sind. The connection of the Khojas with this region dates from the time of the British conquest, shortly before which the grandfather of the present Agha Khan came to Sind from Persia. Sir Charles Napier appointed him to command the Camel Corps which he had organized and which was stationed at Jerruck. Some of his proceedings, however, gave offence to the Baluchis who attacked him and drove him out of the place. The colony of Khojas remained, but they have been for the most part ruined and their lands absorbed by the neighbouring zamindars.\n\nJhok is a small village on the banks of the Mulchand canal, between Mirpur Bathoro and Bulri. It is seven miles distant from Mirpur Bathoro. It contains a shrine of one Shah Inayatullah, which consists of a domed tomb faced with encaustic tiles and inscribed with Arabic scrolls of the holy names. A mosque adjoins it and the buildings stand in an extensive compound. Shah Inayatullah was a Sufi and is reverenced throughout Sind and named Sar Taj Sufan, \"Crowned Head of Sufis,\" and Sardar-al-ashkan, \"Leader of all Lovers.\" He was born at Miranpur, a village which is a mile distant from Jhok, in 1660 A.D., and is said to have been under the instruction of Khwaja Abdul Malik, great-grandson of Pir Dastgir of Baghdad at Burhanpur in Bengal for a term of five years, at the end of which period he was awarded a sword, a cap and red apparel, granted the title of Sufi and permitted to instruct disciples. He made so many disciples, both among Hindus and Mussalmans, that the Saivids of Bulri grew jealous of him and got the Governor of Tatta to send a report to the Emperor at Delhi which resulted in Nur Muhammad Kalhora being commissioned to destroy him. The latter accordingly besieged Jhok with\na large force, but Shah Inayat's fakirs were too strong for him; so he made peace and gained his end afterwards by assassination in 1717 A.D. (\"Tuhfat-ul-kiram\"). The saint's head was forwarded, according to the local tradition, to Delhi, reciting poems on the way. An annual fair is held at the shrine on the 17th day of Safar and lasts for three days and is attended by about 1,500 people.\n\nKarachi (formerly spelt Kurrachee), situated in 24\u00b0 51' north latitude and 67\u00b0 4' east longitude, is the headquarter town of the Karachi District and the capital of Sind, the seat of Government and of the chief court of judicature, and the headquarters of the Karachi Brigade and also of those heads of civil departments whose jurisdiction extends over the whole province. Besides being the official civil and military centre of the province, Karachi is the third port of India in order of commercial importance, having a volume of trade inferior only to that of Calcutta and Bombay. The firms represented on the Chamber of Commerce numbered 56 in 1916. In addition to local houses there are numerous agencies of merchants and traders doing business at Lahore, Delhi and other towns. Finally, Karachi is both the nearest port in India to Europe and the nearest maritime terminus of the whole system of railways that serve Sind, British Baluchistan, the Punjab and the north-west of India, and its harbour presents exceptional facilities for the shipment and landing of goods and for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and troops. These conditions have brought together a very heterogeneous population of 151,903, as enumerated at the census of 1911. The municipal limits which extend from Clifton and Ghizri on the one side to the Maurypur Salt Works on the other enclose an area of about seventy square miles.\n\nThe present position of Karachi will be better understood after a brief review of its history.\n\nIt has been confidently identified with Alexander's Haven and much ingenuity has been expended in efforts to trace Krokala, Eiros, Bibacta and other places mentioned by Nearchus; but anyone who has observed the evidences of every recent recession of the sea at Clifton and Ghizri and of the rapid erosion of the Oyster Rocks still in progress, will find reason\nto believe that 22 centuries have probably altered the whole aspect of the coast beyond all possibility of recognition. However that may be, it does not appear that there ever was a town on the site of Karachi, or anywhere near it, until two centuries ago; for, with the exception of a haven, which is the only one between Makran and Cutch, it lacks all the natural advantages that conduce to the rise of cities. The trade of Sind sought one of the commercial towns which succeeded each other on the ever-changing mouths of the Indus, while that of Baluchistan came down to a port formed by Cape Monze and the Habb river. But when the latter began to silt up so that large vessels could no longer enter it, the wealthy Hindu merchants of the place began to cast about for a new settlement and fixed on a back-water called Kalachi Kun, to which the sea found entrance over a bar known as Nawa Nar, near to the island of Baba in the present Karachi harbour. The present entrance to the harbour was at that time blocked by a rocky reef extending from Manora to the Oyster Rocks, which has since crumbled away. Such is the story told by Seth Naomal, a descendant of one of these Hindu merchants, in a manuscript family history which is still in the possession of his grandson Rao Bahadur Alumal Trikamdas. Other local accounts differ slightly, affirming the existence first of a large town called Karak on a lagoon some miles west of Karachi, from which it moved eastward on the silting up of the passage from the sea. In either case we know that the new settlers put themselves under the protection of the Jam of the Jokhias, who was the recognized blackmailer and guardian of the trade routes, and prospered and gradually sucked away the trade of the Indus ports. Subsequently they fortified their town with walls of mud and brushwood and mounted thereon some pieces of ordnance brought from Maskat, and it became Kalachi (or Karachi) Kot. It belonged to the Khan of Kalat, to whom it had been given by the Kalhoras as blood-money for one of his brothers slain by them in battle, but Ali Fateh Khan, the first of the Talpurs, cast a covetous eye on it. Twice he sent an expedition to take it; but the Hindu merchants collected their clients and dependents, landed marines from their ships and beat the assailants off. When a third attack\nwas made in 1795, the Khan of Kalat, being in difficulties himself and unable to help them, they negotiated and, being offered honourable terms, surrendered. The Mirs put a Governor in command, but treated the merchants most considerately and fostered the trade, which brought them an annual revenue of nearly a lakh of rupees (in 1838 it was estimated at a lakh and a half). In 1797 they built a fort on Manora as a defence against attack by sea. It was from this fort that fire was opened on the S.S. \"Wellesley,\" which was entering the harbour with the \"reserve force\" which the conduct of the Mirs had made it advisable to keep in Sind after Sir J. Keane's army passed on to Kabul.*\n\nThe guns of the \"Wellesley\" did not take long to knock down the shabby walls, and Rear-Admiral Maitland, with Brigadier Valiant, took possession of the fort and also of the town of Karachi on February 7th, 1839, but pledged themselves to hold the persons and property of the inhabitants sacred and not to interfere with the government of the town. British troops were landed and encamped about two miles from the walls, and so matters remained until the battle of Miami. A visitor in 1841 wrote afterwards:\n\n\"Kurachee was the residence of many ladies whose husbands' duty required them to penetrate further into the country, so that there was a larger society than is generally to be met with at an outstation. Monday and Friday evenings were the gay times. The band of H. M.'s 41st played on the parade ground and the beauty and fashion of Kurachee were seen assembling in groups.\" This was the birth of Karachi Cantonment and to this period belongs the interesting old burial ground on the Bunder Road. The native town, as it was in 1857, is thus described by Sir Richard Burton: \"The town is a mass of low mud hovels and high mud houses, with flat mud roofs, windowless mud walls and numerous mud ventilators, surrounded by a tumble-down parapet of mud built upon a low platform of mud-covered rock. This is the citadel: it fines off into straggling suburbs below, extending far northwards.\" \"The dark narrow alleys, through which nothing bulkier than a jackass can pass with ease, boast no common sewer.\" There were\n\n* According to a popular account of this incident which was current afterwards there was no garrison in the fort and the solitary gun fired therefrom was meant for a salute.\ntwo gates\u2014the Kara darwaza facing the sea, and the Mitha darwaza leading to the Lyari and sweet water wells. In front of the former a spit of dry land extended to the Customs House and white mosque, to which passengers were brought in canoes at high water from vessels anchored at Kiamari.\n\nWhen Sir Charles Napier transferred the seat of Government from Hyderabad to Karachi, the place began to develop. The histories of the trade, the Port, the Municipality and other institutions, which make up the story of the growth of Karachi during the seventy years since, are given in their appropriate places.\n\nThe first object that arrests the attention of the traveller approaching Karachi from the sea is the rocky headland of Manora, 100 feet high, with its Lighthouse, Observatory, little English Church and many other buildings. It is now a Cantonment, occupied by the Royal Garrison Artillery in charge of the harbour defences. The Indo-European Telegraph has also its Cable Factory and a considerable settlement here, and it is the residence of the Port Officer and other officials of the Port Trust, including the Pilot establishment. The tomb of a wonder-working Pir, who was buried here, attracts crowds to an annual fair, and Hinduism is also represented by a conspicuous, but not ancient, temple. Manora is self-contained, has its own Church (St. Paul's, consecrated in 1865), school, library, billiard room, tennis courts, etc.\n\nOpposite Manora and forming the other side of the entrance to the harbour is the Kiamari groyne, 8,300 feet long. Beyond it are the wharves, and the settlement known as Kiamari. The road leads direct from the boat basin to Karachi. On landing, the traveller first passes through the Sydenham Passenger Pavilion and enters Willington Place. To the right of this lies the Port Trust village, to the left the wharves and the railway (these are described in detail on page 86 below). Further on is the Bachubai Eduji Dinshaw Hospital, supported by the Municipality, North-Western Railway and Port Trust; then the McHinch Memorial Seamen's Rest, built by the Port Trust in 1904 at a cost of Rs. 30,833. The nucleus of this amount was a sum of Rs. 11,162 raised by subscription to commemorate the late Mr. Alexander\nMohinoh, C.I.E., a well known Karachi merchant and public man. To this the Port Trust added Rs. 8,386, the Municipality Rs. 3,000, the Chamber of Commerce and individual members of it Rs. 3,350, and Government Rs. 5,000. The Rest is supported by subscriptions with some help from Government, and is controlled by a Committee, on which the Port Trust and all the Churches of Karachi are represented. It provides reading and refreshments for seamen of all classes and creeds and also supplies the place of a Sailors' Home, as far as that is required at this Port.\n\nAt the Seamen's Rest the road leaves Kiamari Island, the limits of which have been much obscured by reclamation, and runs along the Napier Mole, on the left side of which, about a mile from the Rest, stands a monument to Sir Charles Napier. The original monument was an obelisk on a pedestal, about 13 feet high, built of ill-dressed stone and bearing on one side the following inscription:\n\n\"From this spot on the 1st December 1847 was fired the farewell salute to His Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Napier, G.C.B., on his retirement from the Governorship of Sind, being the extreme point to which at that date wheeled carriages had ever passed along this binder, a work planned and executed under the Government of His Excellency and was just completed at the date of his departure from this Province.\n\nERECTED 1853. REBUILT 1901.\"\n\nFor many years it was surrounded and concealed by plague sheds; these, however, were removed and the monument exposed to view. It was, however, generally recognized to be utterly unworthy of its subject, and in 1913 the Port Trust erected at its own expense a handsome Aberdeen granite obelisk with the words \"Sir Charles Napier, G.C.B., Governor of Sind\" on the face fronting the road, and below these words have been inserted the original inscription which has been quoted above. At the end of the Napier Mole, after passing over the screw-pile bridge 1,200 feet long, which was built in 1865 to span the cutting made\nthrough the Mole that the creek might scour the harbour, the main land is reached. The road then proceeds over a handsome stone bridge, 1,540 feet in length, beneath which the railway passes. This bridge was opened in April 1911 by His Excellency the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge, and is named after him. Its construction and the diversion of the railway necessitated the removal of the old Port Trust Office on the left of the road as one crossed the bridge over the creek from Kiamari, and the old Customs House, which spanned the road on five arches. To the left of the Hardinge Bridge now stands the new Port Trust Offices, the handsomest and most imposing building in Karachi, built at a cost of Rs. 8,60,000 and opened in January 1916. Beyond it and physically contiguous, the new Customs House is in course of construction.\n\nA short distance further on is the Merewether Clock Tower, a fine memorial raised by public subscription to a former Commissioner in Sind. It is a memorial also of Mr. J. Strachan, the Municipal Engineer who designed it and many other public buildings in Karachi. It is in the middle pointed style of Gothic architecture and has the form of an Eleanor cross. Standing on a basement 44 feet square, it rises to a height of 102 feet and carries, at an elevation of 70 feet, a clock with four faces, each 7 feet in diameter. The large bell, which strikes the hours, weighs 3 cwt., and the smaller bells, for the quarters, 1 cwt. each. The foundation stone was laid by Sir James Fergusson, Governor of Bombay, in 1884, and the completed structure was opened to the public and made over to the Municipality by Sir Evan James in 1892. The total cost of the structure and clock was Rs. 37,178.\n\nThe Merewether Tower cleaves the road. The branch to the right is the McLeod Road, named in honour of a public spirited Collector of Customs of Sir Bartle Frere's time. The Bunder Road continues its course on the left of the tower. Between it and the Lyari river, half a mile further to the left, lies the Old Town of Karachi, deprived of its wall and much changed by sanitation and other innovations, but still retaining many of the old alleys to which Sir Richard Burton alluded.\nBetween the Bunder and McLeod Roads, about half a mile behind the Clock Tower, was the old Kafila Serai, now absorbed in the Sind Madressah, where the camel caravans from Khorassan used to put up, outside the city walls. On and between the Bunder and McLeod Roads beats the commercial heart of Karachi. Here all the leading firms have their places of business. On the McLeod Road is the Ionic front of the Bank of Bombay, built, from a design by Mr. Strachan, in 1888; next to it is the Judicial Commissioner's Court, built by the old Bank of Bombay in 1866, and bought by Government when it failed; then the National Bank and opposite to it the new and handsome offices of McKinnon, MacKenzie and Company, the Shipping Agents, the City Station of the North-Western Railway with nearly half a mile of goods yards behind it, and the Central Post and Telegraph Offices; further on, iron-works which have been closely associated with the progress of Karachi for fifty years past, a little beyond which the McLeod Road falls into the Kacheri Road. Behind the Post Office, on the Kacheri Road, overlooking all, rises the great pile of the Dayaram Jethmal Sind College. On the Bunder Road to which we now return, stand the Boulton Market, the Max Denso Hall, the site of the old Jail, on which Government offices are to be erected, the High School, the Khalikdina Hall, the first English burial ground opened in Sind, the Small Cause Court, the Travellers' Bungalow of ancient days and later converted into a hotel, the Richmond Crawford Veterinary Dispensary and the Tramway Stables. As many of these places indicate, the Bunder Road must have been one of the first roads laid out in Karachi, leading as it did from the Bunder to the barracks and parade ground of the Native Infantry regiments, and it is still a main artery. Off it to the left, past the High School corner, runs the Mission Road to the little Mission Church and the school founded by Major Preedy, the first Collector of Karachi, in 1846, and handed over in 1853 to the Church Missionary Society's missionaries, who now live in the bungalow that was Major Preedy's Kacheri. On this road before reaching the Mission we pass the new Civil Hospital and the Lady Dufferin Hospital. Nearly opposite to the Mission Road another old artery takes off from the right of the Bunder Road. This is\nthe Kacheri Road, which, after passing Government House at a distance, reaches the Civil Lines a little less than 4\u00bd miles from Kiamari. Here are the Civil Lines.\n\nFrere Hall, the Statues of Queen Victoria and of King Edward, the Sind Club, the Y. M. C. A., the Masonic Hall, Holy Trinity Church, and the Gymkhana, an institution which has existed since the time of Sir Bartle Frere, if not from an earlier date, when, inasmuch as the word gymkhana had not been invented it was called \"The Ladies' Club\" and occupied an old bungalow on the road that now bounds it on the south-east. The backbone of Civil Lines is Victoria Road, a really fine thoroughfare, which, coming from the Sudder Bazaar, passes all these buildings, unites with the Kacheri Road at the railway, and, crossing it, continues nearly three miles out to Clifton.\n\nParallel to Victoria Road on the east is Elphinstone Street, and behind and parallel to it is Cantonment Frere Street, which runs in a straight line from the Bunder Road, where we left it, to the Cantonment Station, which was at first called Frere Station, and south of which is a triangle of bungalows originally known as Frere Town. This line is the nucleus from which the European side of Karachi grew. The officers' bungalows in Frere Street formed the front rank of the military quarters, receiving the first of the sea breeze before Civil Lines came into being. Those of the British regiments were at the southern, or station, end, those of the Native regiments, with the D\u00e9p\u00f4t and Commissariat, at the other. The Regimental or Sudder Bazaar was between. The barracks were on the wide rocky plain behind the officers' bungalows. Even here all is changed. The \"sheds of wattle and daub\" and \"parallelograms of unlovely regularity,\" so graphically portrayed, with their inmates, by Sir R. Burton, have to a great extent been superseded by substantial and handsome houses of two stories, the original Napier Barracks have been succeeded by magnificent edifices erected in 1866, and the Sudder Bazaar from being merely a regimental bazaar now supplies the wants of the whole civil station. In and about the Sudder Bazaar there are now many public buildings for example the Empress Market, the Scotch Church, the two Volunteer Halls, the Grammar School, the Goa-Portuguese Hall, etc.\nIn the northern half of the triangle formed by Frere Street with the Bunder and Kacheri Roads there is a wide sandy plain, used as a parade ground by the Royal Field Artillery, the lines and the stables of which are located between it and the Sudder Bazaar. The Artillery Mess House which is close to Holy Trinity Church is said to be the oldest building remaining in all this part. Adjoining the artillery lines, on the north, is the Arsenal, which was partly blown up by an explosion in 1858.\n\nThe tramway system of Karachi belongs to a Company (the East India Tramway Company) which pays the Municipality a royalty of Rs. 500 a year per mile of line. The system was opened in 1885, and the trams were driven by steam. Subsequently horse traction was substituted, and at a later date motor traction. The lines extend from Kiamari to the Cantonment Railway Station, with one branch via the Napier and Lawrence Roads to the Zoological Gardens and another to Soldiers' bazaar.\n\nThe aspect of the surroundings of Karachi is dreary. To the south-east is a flat waste, scarcely above high water mark, intersected by two roads into which the Victoria Road divides after crossing the railway. Of these, one, going almost due south, leads to Clifton, passing on the right a mound of hard conglomerate called Bath Island. Clifton is a plateau or rather, two plateaux, distinguished as old and new Clifton, in the very broken chain of hills of which Manora and the Oyster Rocks are detached links. Here very soon after the British occupation of Sind a few villas were built, to which residents of the cantonment used to go for change of air and sea bathing. The distance from the bazaar and the absence of drinking water has, however, prevented the place from ever becoming a large residential suburb of Karachi, and these deficiencies have not been made good to the present day. All this part of the coast is silting up and the Napier groyne, with the stopping of the Chinna creek, probably increased the deposit of fine sand to the west of Clifton, which, driven by the monsoon wind, forms moving hills that swallow up everything in their way. At one time the very existence of Clifton seemed to be threatened and\nthe road to it was buried, but the sand has been most successfully combated by an extensive system of low fences, within which a growth of \"Goats-foot Creeper\" (Ipomoea pes-caprae) is induced.\n\nAbout a mile east of Clifton, on another plateau, was Ghizri Sanitarium, established in 1854 for sick officers and soldiers. There were substantial stone bungalows for the officers and barracks for the soldiers and a detached residence for an Apothecary. The old Gazetteer of Sind pronounces the sanitarium to be admirably suited for its purpose and anticipates the erection of additional barracks to accommodate 400 invalids; but some years ago the sanitarium was abolished and everything removed except the foundation of the buildings.\n\nThe name Ghizri belongs properly to the creek east of the sanitarium, formed by the Malir river, which opens into the broad mouth of the Gharo creek and so has connection with the whole net-work of channels intersecting the Delta. This made it an important place at the beginning of the British rule and the remains may still be seen of a line of railway by which heavy material used to be sent from the workshops near Cantonment Station to Ghizri and so, by river-steamers, up the Indus to Kotri. This was when the Kotri-Karachi Line was under construction, but the route had long before that been in use for troops and stores. Ghizri is still a landing place, authorized under the Customs Act, for rice and other produce from the Delta. There is a Customs chowkey on the hill overlooking the creek and also a Municipal duty post.\n\nNearly north of Ghizri Sanitarium and not three miles from it there is a prominent conical hill with a house on the top known as Honeymoon Lodge. This is said to have been built by the ex-Raja of Satara; but, being assured by the sight of a cobra that the house was unlucky, he sold it to His Highness the Agha Khan to whom it now belongs. On another hill not far off is the Parsi Tower of Silence. A mile and a half further north is a group of higher hills, among which are the Hand's Hill quarries, out of which Karachi has been built.\n\nOn the west the old town was bounded by the abrupt banks and flat, sandy bottom of the Lyari river bed. It\nis a river for only a few days in the year, after rain, when it comes down in spate with such suddenness sometimes that persons crossing it are carried away. Eleven were drowned one morning in 1906. The Lyari drains the hills north of Karachi, and its left bank, for some miles above the town, is green with gardens and cultivation. Beyond that a barren plain extends to the hills of which Cape Monze, 20 miles away, is the southern extremity. Beyond them the great chain of the Pabb hills, or mountains, bounds the horizon.\n\nThe town originally depended for its water supply on wells alone. From the earliest days of the conquest projects were set on foot for supplying an adequate quantity of good water, but nothing practicable ensued till a scheme was prepared by Mr. Strachan, the Secretary and Engineer of the Municipality, in 1880. His first plans were rejected on account of their cost. He modified them and at last obtained sanction to a scheme estimated to supply 8 gallons of water a day per head of the population and not to cost more than Rs. 8,50,000. The foundation stone of the distributing reservoir (the Temple Reservoir) was laid by Sir Richard Temple, Governor of Bombay, on 18th February 1880, and the works were opened in April 1883. The source of supply was the underground flow of the river Malir, supplied from a reservoir of mountains one hundred miles away. Being porous, the mountains absorb the rain that falls upon them, and discharge it gradually through the subterranean stream-bed. On the right bank of the Malir, but at a distance of a thousand feet from the bank, two wells were sunk, 38 feet in depth and 40 feet in diameter. At about 2 feet from the bottom of each well a pipe, 2 feet in diameter, took off the supply. These met and from their junction a single pipe of the same diameter led to the junction tank, 6,551 feet from the first well. From the tank to the Temple Reservoir the water was carried by a masonry conduit having a section of 3' 3\" by 2' 3\" for the first 9 miles, with a fall of two feet to the mile, and after that a section of 2' 6\" by 2' 3\" with a full of 3' 91 feet to the mile. The conduit was covered, but provided with ventilators. The site of the wells was distant about 16\u00bd miles from Karachi.\nand 7 from Landhi Station on the railway and its height above mean sea level was 176 feet; so the water flowed easily to the reservoir, the floor of which was about 52 feet above sea level. As the town is very little above the level of the sea it was expected that there would be a sufficient head of water to supply the upper stories of all the houses. The reservoir was 200 feet in length by 150 in breadth and provided for a water depth of 10 feet. The total cost of the works was Rs. 8,54,973, but a further sum of Rs. 3,15,292 was soon after expended in extensions of the distributing pipes and other additions. In 1895-96 a second reservoir, a little larger than the first, known as the Currie Reservoir was constructed at a cost of Rs. 1,20,000. Before a year had run, however, it was found that the source of supply was not equal to the demand upon it and galleries had to be run out from both wells to catch more water. But the relief afforded was only temporary, and in 1887-88 it was found necessary to bring a conduit from Dumlotte (Damlot) five miles further up, between the Malir and Bazar rivers, as a feeder to the wells. The ten years from 1889 to 1898 were years of good rain, the average being 9\u00bd inches, but with 1898 a period of drought set in and the water supply failed again; and in April 1900 Mr. J. Forrest Brunton, the Chief Officer of the Municipality, proposed to sink another well on the 4th mile of the Dumlotte conduit, from which water might be pumped into the conduit. This was carried out at once at a cost of Rs. 5,523 and afforded immediate relief, but the supply of water had at the same time to be restricted to enforce economy. In 1901 a second well on the Dumlotte Conduit became necessary with a second pump. This cost Rs. 4,338. In the same year Mr. E. F. Dawson, Superintending Engineer, was deputed to investigate the whole question with Mr. Brunton, and in pursuance of his report the Municipality resolved to appropriate Rs. 39,332 for the purpose of sinking a larger well at Dumlotte, 35 feet in diameter and 37 feet deep, to be worked by a 12\" centrifugal pump driven by a 16 N. H. P. engine and capable of delivering 2,400 gallons per minute. This superseded the two smaller wells at Dumlotte. The demand on the supply continued to grow yearly, and in time it became necessary to augment not only the supply but also the storage reservoirs. The Temple Reservoir and the Currie Reservoir\nhave a combined capacity of six million gallons, and in 1913 a new reservoir, known as the Sydenham Reservoir, was constructed to contain another six million gallons. With this addition to the storage capacity it has become possible to meet the fluctuations of the demand, and at the present time the water problem of the town is not particularly acute.\n\nOf the public buildings and places referred to above some are described elsewhere, the schools and colleges for example in connection with Education and hospitals in the chapter on Health. Some remain to be noticed.\n\nThe main entrance to Government House is from Victoria Road immediately opposite to the entrance to Holy Trinity Church. There are five other entrances. The House, which stands in 40 acres of ground, was built by Sir Charles Napier, and was in his time a plain single-storied building. On Sir Charles Napier's retirement it was purchased by Government as a residence for the Commissioner in Sind, and has remained so ever since. General Jacob, when acting as Commissioner in 1856, added the upper story to the central block of the house, doubtless in imitation of the upper storey of his own house at Jacobabad. Since then no big structural alterations have been carried out, though constant improvements are made to modernize the house. In 1906 in anticipation of the visit of Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales a complete installation of electric light and fans was fitted. A marble tablet on the porch in front of the house records the fact that the House \"was built and occupied by Sir Charles Napier, Conqueror and Governor of Sind.\" The historical character of the house is further emphasized by the possession of portraits of Sir Charles Napier, all the Commissioners, and other distinguished men who have served in Sind, such as Sir James Outram, General Jacob, Sir Henry Green, etc. A small library of interesting and valuable books on the history of Sind was started by a former Commissioner, Sir Evan James.\n\nThe Frere Hall is by its situation and character the most notable building in Karachi and would be beautiful but for its incongruous excrescences, an octagonal tower crowned with an iron cage, and an\nacute roof spirelet, coated with Muntz's metal. The inception of this Hall was a meeting held to devise means of commemorating the long and brilliant administration of Sir Bartle Frere when he was called to the Viceroy's Council in 1859. A sum of Rs. 22,500 was raised by subscription and designs for a public hall were invited. Out of twelve sent in, one by Lieutenant-Colonel St. Clair Wilson was chosen, and the building was commenced in 1863. It was opened in 1865, though not then quite complete, by Mr. Mansfield, the Commissioner of the day. The total cost of it came to about Rs. 1,80,000, of which Government contributed Rs. 10,000 and the Municipality paid the balance. The Hall is in the Venetian Gothic style and is built of the familiar yellowish Karachi limestone, relieved very effectively by white oolite quarried near Bholari south of Kotri and red and grey sandstones from Jungshahi. The columns and arches of the wide verandahs are exceedingly graceful and the whole detail pleasing, but the tower and spirelet harmonize neither with the body of the building nor with each other. The apex of the spirelet is 144 feet above ground level. From the porch on the east side a double staircase leads up directly to a fine hall in the upper storey, 70 feet long by 35 in width and 38 m height. This is the \"Town Hall\" of Karachi for public meetings, lectures, balls, concerts and dramatic entertainments. It has wide verandahs on two sides and opens at the north end by an arch into a second fine room, 63 feet by 25, which can be used to supplement the main hall and accommodate a stage or platform. On the ground floor there is a main hall equal to the one above. The room at the end, corresponding to the second room above, accommodates the Frere Hall Library. The main hall upstairs is adorned with some good busts, among which are two of Their Majesties King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, presented by Mr. Edulji Dinshaw, C.I.E. There are also oil paintings of Sir Charles Pritchard, Sir Evan James, Mr. R. Giles and Mr. A. D. Young-husband, former Commissioners in Sind.\n\nOn the west side of the Hall stands the Queen's Statue in the midst of what is known as 'the Queen's Lawn,' and on the east side is the new Statue of King Edward VIII on the corresponding King's Lawn, the Hall and these two lawns occupying the entire space between Victoria and Bonus roads.\nThe Queen's Statue, which is by Sir Hamo Thornycroft, R.A., was unveiled by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in March 1906. The monument consists of a classically treated architectural pedestal with statues of bronze around the base, and crowned with a colossal white marble Statue of the Queen-Empress, wearing a widow's veil and the imperial crown and robes of state, and holding in her hand the sceptre and the orb. The principal group at the foot of the pedestal represents India approaching Justice and Peace. On one side is a lion, on the other a tiger, with heads erect, guarding the monument. At the rear the river Indus is symbolized by a woman carrying an urn and pouring water on the thirsty soil. The approach to the statue from the Victoria Road is by a broad flight of steps of Carrara marble.\n\nThe Statue of King Edward is also by Sir Hamo Thornycroft, R.A., and was unveiled by His Excellency Lord Willingdon, Governor of Bombay, in January 1916. The following description of it is taken from a pamphlet prepared by the Chairman of the Statue Committee at the time of its unveiling:\n\n\"The classically treated architectural pedestal is of white marble standing on a base of grey granite.\n\n\"The pedestal is crowned with a colossal white marble Statue of the late King-Emperor Edward VII wearing the coronation robes of the King of England, and holding in his hands the sceptre and the orb; upon the orb stands a winged figure of Victory in white marble.\n\n\"The group in bronze at the feet of the pedestal represents Britannia with the helmet, shield and trident, wreathed with leaves and protecting an Indian child.\n\n\"The group in bronze at the back of the statue represents 'Peace,' a winged female figure bending slightly over an Indian child.\n\n\"On the right hand stands a bronze figure of heroic size, representing a British soldier of the York and Lancaster Regiment standing at ease, his rifle with fixed bayonet in his hands.\n\n\"On the left hand side of the statue stands a similar figure of an Indian soldier of the 129th D.C.O. Baluchis.\"\nThis hall, which is situated on the Bunder Road, was erected in 1886 to honour the memory of a citizen who had been prominent in many ways and occupied the chair of the Chamber of Commerce in 1870-71. The sum of Rs. 9,000 having been subscribed by his friends, the Municipality gave a site and supplied the additional funds necessary to provide that part of the town with a public hall, reading room and library. The design was prepared by Mr. J. Strachan. The style is Venetian Gothic. The upper storey consists mainly of one hall, 60 feet by 30, intended to seat 500 people. The ground floor contains an entrance hall, library, reading room and some small rooms. On the east front there is an illuminated clock, the gift of Rao Sahib Ramdas Morarji.\n\nThe Ghulam Husseini Khalikdina Hall, also on the Bunder Road, was the result of a coalition between the executors of the late Mr. Ghulam Husseini Khalikdina, who had left by will Rs. 18,000 to be spent on some useful public object, the Committee of the Native General Library, who were badly in need of new premises, and the Municipality. The Municipality added Rs. 15,000 to the bequest and the hall was erected and opened in 1908. It consists of one spacious hall for public meetings and two rooms flanking the entrance, which are, according to agreement, placed at the disposal of the Committee of the Native General Library. The hall is 70 feet in length by 45 in width and 30 in height and is capable of seating from 600 to 700 persons. The front portico has an area of 52\u00bd feet by 32\u00bd and a ten-foot verandah runs round the sides of the hall. The building belongs to, and is maintained by, the Municipality.\n\nOther large halls available for public meetings are the Goa-Portuguese Hall in Frere Street just beyond the Grammar School, and those of the Sind Volunteer Rifles and the Karachi Artillery Volunteers, the former at the junction of Elphinstone Street with Bunder Road and the latter on Victoria Road opposite the Scotch Church. The first named hall belongs to the Goa-Portuguese Association and has taken the place of an earlier hall,\nthe proceeds of which helped towards the building of it. The balance of the money required was raised by the Association from its own resources. The total was Rs. 56,000, of which Rs. 8,000 were paid for the site. The building which was designed by Mr. M. Somake, a local architect, is arranged on almost the same plan as the Frere Hall, and the dimensions of its rooms are nearly the same.\n\nThe Sind Club occupies a conspicuous position in Victoria Road to the north side of the Frere Hall. It was originally housed in a small bungalow in Elphinstone Street, but in 1883 was removed to its present premises. The main building was built entirely of light limestone in the Italian style. A second building comprising a two-storied block of chambers was erected in 1888. In 1892 four chambers were built over the smoking room. In 1904 the third block was increased and finally on the acquisition of the site of the Masonic Lodge adjacent to it a new block containing 9 sets of chambers was erected in 1915. The club contains the usual accommodation and arrangements, and there is in the compound a racket court.\n\nThe gymkhana is in Scandal Point Road, and has occupied its present buildings (with subsequent enlargements) since 1886. It is the lineal descendant of the meeting place near the rifle range where the European population of Karachi used to meet in the early days of the conquest and which received the name of Scandal Point. The road leading to it is also known as Scandal Point Road.\n\nThere are numerous other clubs and similar institutions in Karachi, the principal being the Karachi Club in Kacheri Road, the Parsi Gymkhana, the Railway Institute and the Karachi Artillery Volunteer Club.\n\nThe original Masonic Hall stood on a site to the north of and adjacent to the Sind Club. A few years ago by an arrangement between the lodge and the club the site was resumed by Government and made over to the club on lease for an extension of its premises. The lodge was in exchange granted a site between\nGovernment House and the Artillery Lines, and a new temple was erected at a cost of Rs. 60,000 and consecrated in 1914. The original lodge in Karachi is Lodge Hope, founded in 1842. There are at the present time eight other lodges, all of which hold regular meetings.\n\nTo the west of the new lodge stand the buildings of the local branch of the Y.M.C.A. The branch was founded in 1905, and carried on its work in hired premises until 1914, when its permanent buildings were erected. Standing in an excellent site they have cost Rs. 67,500, met partly by subscriptions from Karachi and abroad, partly by a Government grant, and partly by a grant from the National Council. The buildings contain general rooms and a gymnasium on the ground floor and hostel accommodation for eighteen persons upstairs. There are five acres of land for games, etc., surrounding them.\n\nHoly Trinity Church, the first Protestant church built in Sind, stands in a compound of 15 acres between Victoria Road and Elphinstone Street and opposite the main entrance to Government House. It was one of the first works set on foot by Mr. (Sir Bartle) Frere after his arrival in Sind and he laid the foundation stone on 9th September 1852. It is recorded that the clergy, the Reverends W. K. Fletcher and W. Carr, met the Commissioner at the entrance to the church square. The Senior Chaplain, then in the name of the community, requested the Commissioner to lay the stone. On his assent being received prayers were recited and the Junior Chaplain then proceeded to read the inscription on the foundation stone.* The names of the coins to be deposited in the stone were then read out, after which the stone was duly laid by Mr. Frere in the name of the Holy Trinity. The doxology followed, then a royal salute and the national anthem, after which the Senior Chaplain pronounced the benediction.\n\nThe church was consecrated in March 1855 by the Bishop of Bombay. The cost of the building was Rs. 53,554 without the furnishings which amounted to about Rs. 10,700 and the two bells which cost Rs. 1,550. The organ was not provided until 1894; the cost of it (Rs. 7,000)\nwas met by private subscriptions. The present clock was also paid for by public subscription in 1906.\n\nThe church was designed by Captain John Hill of the Bombay Engineers. Sir Richard Burton compares it to a hammer with the handle turned heavenwards, and the author of \"Kurrachee, Past, Present and Future\" finds in it the form of a giraffe, an animal distinguished for its exceedingly long neck and the shortness of its back. The tower of the church is (or was) 150 feet high and the nave only 115 feet long. There is a popular story that the tower was intended to serve as a landmark for vessels approaching the shore, for which there does not appear to be any foundation excepting the difficulty of accounting for it in any other way. In 1904 the two uppermost of the six storeys of which it consisted were removed for reasons of safety, and this somewhat improved the whole structure architecturally. The church is not oriented, but lies north-west to south-east, probably to catch the prevailing breeze. There are 800 sittings, all free, but allotted at parade service. There was an interesting memorial window to Sir Charles Napier high up in the east wall (see page 145, \"A\" Volume) but it was blown to pieces by the cyclone of 1902. Another window, erected in 1881, by Mr. F. D. Melville, Commissioner in Sind, to the memory of his wife, survived the storm. There are numerous brasses, of which one, dedicated to the memory of three children of Captain Minter in 1842, must have been affixed originally in the old bungalow to which Sir Charles Napier referred as \"an ecclesiastical convenience\" long before the church was built. Seven in a group commemorate officers of the 129th Baluchis and linked battalions and are surmounted by old regimental colours. In front of the church stands a simple column erected in 1849 by Sir Charles Napier, then Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, and officers, non-commissioned officers and privates of H. M.'s 22nd Regiment, \"to their fellow-soldiers who died from the effects of climate during their first tour of service in Sind in 1842-43.\" This originally stood in the grounds of Government House, but was removed some years ago.\n\nTo the north-east of the church, a bungalow for the chaplain has recently been built by Government. South-\neast of the church stands the Howard Institute, founded by the Reverend A. B. Howard, but not finished until after his death. His portrait hangs in it and there is a brass tablet to his memory in the church. The institute contains a library and refreshment; billiard and reading rooms, besides a hall for meetings and entertainments, the cost of building which (Rs. 10,000 in all) was entirely raised by private effort. The institute is intended for the parishioners and members of the church and is much used by the soldiers in garrison.\n\nThis is a one-storeyed bungalow in Victoria Road for Widows' Home. the residence of widows and is in the charge of the chaplain. Four widows receive Rs. 15 per mensem, two others Rs. 5; and a Government grant of Rs. 17 is made towards the maintenance of a military widow. Apart from these grants the home is entirely supported by voluntary contributions.\n\nThe Scotch Church (St. Andrew's) is also between Victoria Road and Elphinstone Street, but more than half a mile north of Holy Trinity Church. It is close to the traffic of Sadar Bazaar, but effectually secluded by its well-wooded garden of 2 acres from which its graceful spire, rising to a height of 135 feet, commands attention from a great distance. This is a very pleasing building, designed by Mr. T. G. Newnham of the Sind Railway in the Gothic style of the 14th century. It consists of a nave, 100 feet long 56 feet wide and 56 feet high to the ridge of roof, which is separated from the aisles by arcades, above which are clerestory windows, ten on each side. There is a fine rose-window, 18 feet in diameter, at the south end, and a five-light window, with a head of geometrical tracery, on the opposite side. The church is entered by an octagonal porch at the south corner, near which is the tower and steeple. It is planned to accommodate 400 worshippers. The cost of the building was Rs. 56,300, of which Government contributed Rs. 25,000. The foundation stone of this church was laid on 6th February 1867 by Sir Robert Napier, K.C.B., Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army, and it was opened for divine service on the last day of 1868 though it was not dedicated until 1869.\nFurther on and upon the opposite side of Elphinstone Street is the American Methodist Episcopal Chapel, an unpretentious building, erected in 1875 and capable of seating 200 persons.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church is one of a group of substantial buildings which attest the importance of the Roman Catholic Community of Karachi. They are situated in the plain east of the Sadar Bazaar and north of the Napier barracks, embowered in a large and shady garden, which hides them from view to some extent; but the broad front of the church, with its two corner spires, stands out and commands attention. The place has some historical interest. Close to the south compound wall, and adjoining the old cemetery, described below, was built, in 1845, St. Patrick's Church, the first Christian Church in Sind, with the exception of the one mentioned in the article on Tatta, of which nothing is known. This little church has long disappeared and the site of it is now occupied by a play-ground for the girls of the Convent School; but three memorials of it are carefully preserved. The first is a brass tablet inscribed as follows:\n\n\"This Church, dedicated to St. Patrick and the first Christian temple in Pagan Scinde, was erected Anno Domini 1845, by subscriptions and donations from the Roman Catholic Officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers, departments, classes and individuals, aided by the donations of many of our Protestant brethren.\n\n\"The Reverend Francis Casabosch, Chaplain.\n\n\"Be it known unto all men. That all right to, and property in, and belonging to this Church, is vested in, and is hereby given unto the Reverend Francis Casabosch, Roman Catholic Chaplain (in trust for the use of all Christians) and his successors in communion with the Holy Roman Catholic Church, but under the control of the Bishop of Bombay, until such time as a Roman Catholic Bishop shall be appointed for this portion of the British Empire, and no\nlonger; but this Church is never to be given over in any manner whatsoever to Government.\n\nCommittee:\nThe Rev. F. Casabosch, Chaplain.\nMajor J. Creagh, H. M.'s 86th Regiment.\nAssistant Surgeon J. Coghlan, H. M.'s 8th Regiment.\n\nCollector and Treasurer:\nColor-Sergt. W. Smith, H. M.'s 86th Regiment.\nH.C. Johns, Engraver, etc., Chatham, England.\"\n\nAnother brass tablet contains an engraved balance sheet of the building expenses, in which His Excellency the Governor of Sind and staff appear as contributors of Rs. 180. The total expenditure was only Rs. 5,930-11-2.\n\nThe third memorial is a small marble tablet to the memory of the Reverend F. Andrew, \"discalced Carmelite,\" who died in 1860.\n\nIn 1881 the little church was superseded by the present one, but continued to be used as a school till it was wrecked by a storm in 1885. The new church, which was designed and constructed by three members of the Society of Jesus, Father Wagner, Brother Klaver and Brother Lau, was opened in April 1881. It is in the Gothic style and measures 170 feet by 75, and is calculated to accommodate 1,500 worshippers. Its exterior is not ornamental, though striking from a distance, but money and art have been lavished on the interior. The ceilings of both nave and aisles consist of ground vaults, and the vault of the nave is carried in one stretch from the portal, through the transept, to the peak of the apsis, an arrangement which enhances the impression of height and length. The chancel, itself spacious, acquires a special impressiveness by its additional height, while the noble contours of the aspiring altar are seen to the best advantage. The whole interior is painted in oil and the windows are all of stained glass, the gifts of members of the congregation. The central passage and the sanctuary are paved with marble. There is a number of life-size statues of some artistic merit, and a series of \"Stations of the Cross\" adorn the walls.\nThe other buildings in the compound are a parochial hall, the residence of the parish priests and their associates engaged in St. Patrick's School; and a group of five contiguous buildings which constitute the Convent School described under \"Education.\" The latter are substantial and built for comfort rather than effect, but would have been effective if their arrangement had not been somewhat cramped by want of space. They consist of a central towered block with two wings and two additional flanking wings. In the southern of these is the Convent Chapel, which is wholly paved with marble and decorated as richly as the church. St. Patrick's School, the last building of the group, is outside the compound and separated from the rest by the road that leads to the Parsi Gymkhana.\n\nThere are no private markets in Karachi, but eight municipal ones. The chief one is the Empress Market on the Preedy Road in the Sadar Bazaar, which was opened in March 1891. The foundation stone of it had been laid by Sir James Fergusson nearly seven years before, but the work lagged for want of funds. The building, which was designed by Mr. J. Strachan in the Domestic Gothic style, consists of four galleries, 46 feet wide, surrounding an open courtyard of 130 feet by 100. In the front rises a massive tower 140 feet high, in which is a chiming clock with four iron skeleton dials, each 6 feet in diameter. The market contains 280 stalls for the sale of meat, vegetables, fruit, flowers and all things else suitable for an Eastern market, save fish, which is accommodated outside. The cost of the market was Rs. 1,55,213.\n\nThe Boulton Market, which replaced an old one on the same site, stands on the left of the Bunder Road. It was named in honour of Colonel Boulton, Collector of Karachi and at that time President of the Municipality. It was designed by Mr. Strachan and was at first 100 feet in length by 80 feet in width and contained 62 stalls for fruit and vegetables. In 1886-87 it was largely extended to provide accommodation for butchers and fishmongers. Its total cost has been Rs. 42,658.\n\nThe other markets are the Lambert Market, a neat little dovecote at the meeting of five roads not far from the\nSind College, the Lyari Market on the left bank of the Lyari the Khudda Fish Market, about half a mile on the other side, where a great traffic in fresh-caught fish is carried on, and three others interesting to their own vicinities.\n\nThe Victoria Museum is undoubtedly the representative, in direct descent, of the Museum and Library started by Sir Charles Napier to promote the investigation of the history and antiquities of Sind. It subsequently was amalgamated with a public library inaugurated by Sir Bartle Frere in 1852, now the Frere Hall Library. The two were one institution and were at first accommodated in a room of the Ladies' Club and afterwards in the Frere Hall, in which they remained until 1892. It had before then been decided to separate the Museum and provide it with a worthy building. Mr. J. Strachan designed a building, the foundation stone of which was laid in the Burns Garden by His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught in 1886-87, but as it soon became apparent that the funds available for this and for the Sind College, at that time being designed, would not suffice for two structures of adequate dignity, an economy without sacrifice of effect was achieved by amalgamating them and making the Museum a wing of the College. It consists of a main hall, 53\u00bd by 34\u00bd feet, with a gallery supported on ornamental iron pillars, and ten smaller rooms, affording 3,723 square feet of floor space. The front verandah, hall and one side room have floors of mosaic tiles. The Victoria Museum was formally opened by Sir Evan James, together with the College building, on 21st May 1892.\n\nWhen the Museum was transferred to its present building, its control passed to the Municipality, and the results have been to some extent unfortunate, as the collection was for some time neglected with the results that many valuable exhibits have been lost or cannot now be properly identified. There is nevertheless much that is of value in the Museum.\n\nThe most important of the public gardens is the Municipal garden commonly known as the Zoological Garden between the old Commissariat Stores and the\nLyari. It was originally one of the Government gardens which were initiated almost immediately after the British occupation for the purpose primarily of supplying the troops with fresh vegetables. A sum of Rs. 100 a month was at first allowed for its support, but in 1847 Major W. Blenkins, Assistant Commissary-General and Superintendent of Gardens, was able to report that he had discontinued drawing that for two years and during that period had made a profit for Government of Rs. 17,032. This was by the issue of vegetables to the troops and fodder to Government cattle, the sale of vegetables and forage to private persons and the supply of pigeons, rabbits and leeches to the hospital. He appended three medical certificates to the effect that the leeches bred by Major Blenkins were infinitely superior to those formerly obtained by contract. The garden at that time measured 43 acres and contained 15 wells. Sometime after the formation of the Karachi Municipality the garden was handed over to its care. Afterwards it was laid out on a new plan by the late Mr. H. M. Birdwood. He was associated in this work with Mr. Finch, Director of the Indo-European Telegraph, and Mr. Strachan, and they proceeded, with the help of district officers and native gentlemen in all parts of the province, to form the nucleus of a collection of wild animals. The sandy soil and the climate appear to be favourable to the health of these, which have thriven and in many cases bred and multiplied so that the Karachi Zoological Garden has a reputation quite out of proportion to its size and character. Vegetables and fruits of many kinds are grown in this garden and it contains a large vineyard which produces excellent grapes. The original slips were obtained from California by Sir E. James, a former Commissioner.\n\nSouth of the Zoological Garden is a shady bagh, full of old trees, commonly known as the Merewether Garden or the Commissioner's Garden. It belongs to a bungalow which was purchased by Government in 1869 for the ex-Rani of Satara and afterwards used as a residence for Chima Saheb, brother of a former Raja of Kolhapur. After Chima Saheb's death it was reserved as a guest-house for the accommodation of the Mirs of Sind. Some years ago, at a lecture\nby Mr. H. M. Birdwood, read before the Society of Arts, Sir W. Lee-Warner made an amusing reference to this garden and took to himself some credit for saving it when he was a member of the Finance Committee appointed by Government to cut down redundant expenditure. One of the members was drawing his pen through a curious item in the expenditure of Sind, which no one could explain, on account of \"Mrs. Gordon's Establishment.\" Sir W. Lee-Warner having been in Sind looked into the matter and found that the name was only a Bengali printer's version of Mrs' Garden Establishment. The garden is maintained still, though the bungalow collapsed a few years ago, and up to the present has not been rebuilt.\n\nThe Burns Garden, on the Kacheri Road and separated from the Sind College by the Burns Road, is the memorial of a gentleman of whom history has kept no other record. He is commonly spoken of as Dr. Burns. The garden covers an area of 26-20 acres and is intersected by walks shaded by well-grown trees, with flower beds and vegetable pots between. There is also a vinery.\n\nThere are several minor municipal gardens.\n\nThe old burial grounds contain some of the most authentic records of the history of Karachi. The oldest is the one already alluded to, on the left hand of the Bunder Road, between it and the Preedy Tank. This is the oldest European cemetery in Sind and belongs to the time when the reserve force was encamped near the old town of Karachi before the conquest. Here is the grave of Captain Hand of the 2nd Grenadier Regiment, B. N. I., who was \"barbarously murdered by a gang of Sindhians, 1839.\" The family annals of Seth Naomal tell the story of this unfortunate young officer's end. He went out from the camp one day for a ride in the direction of Mugger Peer, but did not return. Search was made and his body found in a hollow of the hills. Colonel Spiller, the officer in command of the small force, at once applied to Seth Naomal, who sent out puggies and traced the murder to Khalifa Chakur, a notorious religious leader of Shah Bilawal, and some of his followers, whose cupidity had been excited by the gold\nbraid on the Captain's coat. Through the Political Agent at Hyderabad Mir Nur Muhammad was induced to arrest Khalifa Chakur and send him to Karachi. He was tried by a military court and hanged at the scene of the murder, which possibly gave its name to Hand's Hill, about 2 miles north-east of the Napier barracks.\n\nImmediately after the conquest a new cemetery was opened close to the south boundary of the Convent School's compound. Here is the grave of Captain John Moore Napier, nephew and Military Secretary of the conqueror, who died of cholera on 7th July 1846, and of his infant daughter Sarah who preceded him by three days. Other memorials of that awful time are not wanting. One conspicuous monument is to the memory of 10 corporals, 1 drummer, 263 privates, 35 women and 66 children, 86th Royal Regiment. Of this number 261 died of cholera in June and July 1846. Twenty-three sergeants of the same corps, of whom 19 fell victims in the same fatal months, have a separate monument. The latest tomb in the cemetery is dated 1854, though the Barrat family vault appears to have been re-opened for a burial in 1859.\n\nThe next burying ground apparently was the small one, about half a mile to the north of the one at present in use, containing only 16 graves. The few inscriptions which are still legible belong to the years 1852-53. This was succeeded by the cemetery now in use on the Tatta Road, which water and care have converted into an oasis of greenness and shade in the midst of a stony plain.\n\nThe Port of Karachi is distant from Bombay 483 miles, from Aden 1,437 and from London via the Suez Canal 6,077, being nearer to Europe than Bombay by 200 miles. From Basrah in the Persian Gulf its distance is 1,107 miles or less than that of Bombay by 470 miles. It is regularly served by two lines of coasting steamers\u2014those of the British India Steam Navigation Co., which ply between Bombay and the Gulf Ports, calling at Karachi two or three times a week each way, and carry His Majesty's Mails, and those of the Bombay Steam Navigation Co. (Shepherd & Co.), whilst the passenger steamers of the City, Hall, Ellerman and Wilson lines use\nthe port regularly. The position of Karachi and the facilities which the port affords for the embarkation of troops have rendered it a place of considerable military importance during the war.\n\nThe harbour, as it was before the British occupation of Sind, consisted of a great lagoon, or backwater, which at high water spring tides covered an area of 18 square miles of creek and mangrove swamp and mud flat. It had two inlets, separated by the long, low island of Kiamari. The eastern inlet was the Chima creek, now closed; the western being protected from the southwest monsoon by the rocky headland of \"Ras Mumhora\" and from hostile fleets by the stone fort and round tower built therein by the Mirs in 1797. Being partly closed by a long bar, or sand-bank, it afforded a safe and spacious anchorage for vessels not drawing more than 15 or 16 feet. These lay at anchor in deep water off Kiamari, and discharged their cargoes and passengers into doondees, by which they were conveyed at high water up a narrow channel which penetrated the mud flat in front of the town, and so landed on a small patch of rising ground \"besides a white mosque built close to the Custom House,\" as reported by Commander T. G. Carless of the Indian Navy.\n\nWhen the British came into possession of Karachi, its supreme importance as \"the key of Sind and of the Indus,\" was apprehended at once, and the attention which was then directed to the great question of improving the port has scarcely suffered interruption in the seventy years that have followed. It is only possible here to enumerate the principal measures which have been carried out.\n\nIn 1859 the Napier Mole, projected by Sir Charles Napier, was completed and Kiamari connected with the mainland.\n\nIn 1858, Mr. Walker, C.E., to whom the whole subject had been referred by the East India Company in consequence of the earnest representations of Mr. (afterwards Sir) Bartle Frere, proposed a marvellously far-seeming and comprehensive scheme, embracing six urgent works, estimated to cost \u00a3260,000, and three others of less certain necessity. Five of these were sanctioned in 1860, and\nthough afterwards interrupted for some years were all eventually carried out, namely:\n\n(1) Kiamari Groyne, running southwards from Kiamari for a distance of 7,400 feet (extended afterwards to 8,300 feet).\n\n(2) Stoppage of Chinn Creek.\n\n(3) Napier Mole Bridge (over a passage 1,200 feet long to be cut through the mole).\n\n(4) New Channel (which now conducts the flow of the Chinn Creek under the bridge and past the Native Jetty, so that, on the ebb, it joins up the waters of the western backwater, the whole tidal volume being thus concentrated and passing out through the harbour entrance).\n\n(5) Native Jetty.\u2014The object of the first four works were in Mr. Walker's own words,\n\n\"to prevent the ebbing tide from spreading and wasting its force until it has carried the sand of the bar into deeper water;\n\nsecondly, to give the water that passes through the entrance to the harbour at each ebbing and flowing tides its right direction;\n\nthirdly, to increase the quantity of water that passes through the entrance;\n\nfourthly, to shut off the heavy southerly and south-westerly seas from the mouth of the harbour.\"\n\nThese objects were attained in a remarkable degree and the bar began to move outwards, while the depth of water over it increased. The sixth of Mr. Walker's proposed works, the Manora Breakwater, projecting from the headland for 1,500 feet and terminating in five fathoms, was begun in 1869 and completed in 1873. In 1877 to supplement the effect of these works Government sanctioned a grant of one lakh of rupees annually for ten years, to be spent on dredging.\n\nIn 1880 the Harbour Board was constituted, and the Merewether Ship Pier was completed in 1882. In 1886 the affairs of the Port were taken over by a Port Trust, and this body found itself in possession of the following\nfacilities for accommodating steamers up to 3,000 tons burden:\n\n(1) Anchorage for 3 ocean-going steamers.\n\n(2) Moorings, fixed and swinging, for 8 ocean-going steamers.\n\n(3) The Merewether Pier accommodating one large ocean-going steamer.\n\n(4) A wharf, the Napier Mole Boat Wharf, 680 feet long, for the accommodation of the country craft trade.\n\nThe construction of a wharfage line, about 2,000 feet long for the accommodation of 5 ocean-going steamers, had just been commenced.\n\nDuring the thirty years that have elapsed since the formation of the Trust, the harbour has been so improved that any vessel that can pass through the Suez Canal can enter into it. The following works now exist on the eastern side of the Ship Channel commencing from the south end where the eastern groyne constructed in 1863 and 1865 springs from the main land:\n\n(1) Bulk Oil Pier at which liquid fuel, oil and petroleum is discharged by pipes direct into the installations of the Standard Oil Co., New York Burmah Oil Co., Asiatic Petroleum Co., Tank Storage Co., Ltd., and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co., Ltd., and by drums and tins into railway waggons. This pier was built in 1909.\n\n(2) Boat Basin, 11 acres in extent, for landing and embarking passengers and goods, etc., from and on vessels in the stream, with railway service and hydraulic cranes, built in 1911.\n\n(3) Return Wharf, 325 feet long, for coasting steamers served by railway and hydraulic cranes, built in 1912.\n\n(4) Continuous line of wharfage, 8,000 feet in length, completely served by railway, with 87 hydraulic cranes of 35 cwt., one of 30 tons, one of 14 tons.\nThis wharfage line is divided as follows:\n\n(a) \"Merewether\" Wharf, 4 ship berths (this was built in 1909 and the old Merewether Pier was removed when this straight line of wharf was constructed).\n\n(b) \"Erskine\" Wharf, 3 ship berths. Part of the old Erskine Wharf, built in 1888, was removed when the line of wharf was straightened in 1908.\n\n(c) \"James\" Wharf, 3 ship berths, built in 1895.\n\n(d) \"Younghusband\" Wharf, 4 ship berths, built in 1907-10.\n\n(e) \"Giles\" Wharf, 3 ship berths, built in 1906-07.\n\nThese wharves are named after former Commissioners in Sind.\n\n(f) Heavy Lift Pier, one 14-ton crane (for use in connection with a 30-ton floating crane), built in 1914.\n\n(g) Napier Mole Boat Wharf, 1,824 feet in length, for country craft trade. The original length was 680 feet as before mentioned; 1,000 feet were added in 1907-09 and 192 feet in 1915, a length of 48 feet was cut off in 1910 owing to the building of the new railway bridge across the Chimm Creek.\n\nThere are thus 17 ship berths in line at which vessels can lie, discharge and load with the greatest ease and rapidity, and two other ship berths well suited for the purposes they serve.\n\nThere are also 20 moorings in the stream for ocean-going steamers and ample anchorage for innumerable country craft.\n\nIn the year 1909 the Trust installed in the Manora Light House a new flash light of great power at a cost of Rs. 1,15,948 in place of the old low power fixed light which they inherited from the Harbour Board. In the year 1914 Government installed a flash light in a new light house at Cape Monze, distant 20 miles, west of Karachi, and a lightship has since been provided by Government for the mouths of the Indus, south-east of Karachi, which, however, owing\nto the war has not yet been used and lies at anchor in the harbour. The safe approach to the Port in normal times has thus been amply provided for.\n\nAt the north of the Ship Channel is the Native Jetty with warehouses used by vessels discharging and loading in the stream, etc. This was built before the Port Trust was constituted, but has been largely improved and additional warehouses built in the present century.\n\nThe Trust in 1909 purchased an area of 177 acres, mostly tidal swamp, from the Karachi Municipality, which they reclaimed and constituted a Produce Yard, known as the \"Thole\" yard. They have also since 1909 reclaimed an area of 61 acres and constituted thereon the \"Manfield\" Import Yard named after a former Commissioner in Sind, complete with ample ranges of warehouses for import cargo on the Karachi side of the Chitta Creek.\n\nThey have also since the beginning of the century reclaimed about 115 acres of land between Kiamari and the Chitta Creek, thus enormously enlarging their Kiamari Railway and Produce Yards which have been reconstructed with a view to the convenience of merchants and rapidity of working.\n\nThis reclamation has also completely consolidated the area between the Chitta Creek Bridge and Kiamari to the north of the Napier Mole Road.\n\nThe following figures relating to financial years (1st April to 31st March and for every fifth year) show how the revenue and expenditure have progressed:\n\n| Year    | Revenue   | Expenditure |\n|---------|-----------|-------------|\n| Rs.     | Rs.       |\n| 1887-88 | 4,63,696  | 5,11,137    |\n| 1892-93 | 6,46,573  | 8,34,020    |\n| 1897-98 | 9,03,922  | 8,97,841    |\n| 1902-03 | 15,54,918 | 12,97,790   |\n| 1907-08 | 32,04,986 | 20,45,278   |\n| 1912-13 | 46,67,661 | 38,51,615   |\n| 1916-17 | 46,66,847 | 39,93,710   |\nThe highest revenue reached was in 1913-14, the year before the war broke out, when it was nearly Rs. 50,00,000. It will thus be seen that in thirty years the revenue has increased to ten times as much as when the Port Trust was constituted and that the heavy increases began after 1902-03.\n\nThe value of the trade of the Port for corresponding years is as follows:\n\n| Year   | Import       | Export       | Total        |\n|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|        | Rs.          | Rs.          | Rs.          |\n| 1887-88| 6,18,61,331  | 4,08,16,877  | 10,26,78,208 |\n| 1892-93| 7,00,13,198  | 5,56,48,339  | 12,56,61,537 |\n| 1897-98| 8,71,07,380  | 7,27,20,313  | 15,98,27,093 |\n| 1902-03| 11,59,81,484 | 10,42,05,235 | 22,01,86,719 |\n| 1907-18| 21,66,01,881 | 11,14,26,339 | 32,80,28,220 |\n| 1912-13| 24,90,48,379 | 37,02,12,715 | 61,92,61,094 |\n| 1916-17| 20,85,97,022 | 28,70,92,354 | 49,56,89,376 |\n\nThe falling off in the year 1916-17 is due to the great reduction of trade owing to war conditions.\n\nIn the earlier years of the Port debt was incurred by loans from Government. These were inherited by the Port Trust Board from the Harbour Board and at present only amount to Rs. 4,63,537.\n\nThe complete figures are as on 1st April of each year:\n\n| Year   | Outstanding debt |\n|--------|------------------|\n|        | Rs.              |\n| 1887-88| 11,08,887        |\n| 1892-93| 24,67,641        |\n| 1897-98| 43,99,766        |\n| 1902-03| 53,77,504        |\n| 1907-08| 81,44,447        |\n| 1912-13| 1,95,68,332      |\n| 1916-17| 2,61,21,949      |\n\nThe Board since the year 1887 have raised loans in the open market under the Local Authorities Loans Act and later under their own Act as since amended. The repayment at maturity of all loans is fully provided for by Sinking Funds which are maintained under Government audit.\nThe position of the Trust financially is very strong as with a comparatively small debt they own an immensely valuable property in land and material and have established a Reserve Fund in case of need which stood at the following figures for the years given on 1st April:\n\n| Year     | Reserve Fund |\n|----------|--------------|\n|          | Rs.          |\n| 1887-88  | Nil          |\n| 1892-93  | Nil          |\n| 1897-98  | 2,00,000     |\n| 1902-03  | 1,69,000     |\n| 1907-08  | 15,00,000    |\n| 1912-13  | 22,25,474    |\n| 1916-17  | 40,47,695    |\n\nBut for the interruption of the war, a very important extension of the harbour works, estimated to cost Rs. 272 lakhs, would now have been in progress. This is known as the \"West Wharfage Scheme\" and provides for the present construction of six and later on, as required, of ten more ship berths on the western side of the Ship Channel. So far work has progressed only to the extent of obtaining a very powerful suction dredger costing with pipe line about \u00a396,200 and the reclamation by means thereof of a portion of the site required.\n\nThis scheme which has been approved by Government includes the widening and deepening of the Ship Channel from its present width of 600 feet to 1,200 feet and to a depth taking vessels drawing up to 32 feet at any state of the tide while the ship berths will allow vessels alongside with that draught. The provision of a graving dock capable of accommodating the largest vessels visiting Eastern waters is also contemplated and separate proposals for the further improvement of the harbour entrance involving the purchase of a rock breaker, etc., have been put forward and approved.\n\nThe Port Trust at the present time is composed of a Chairman appointed by Government and ten Trustees nominated by the Commissioner in Sind as the local Government, and various local bodies.\nKeti Bandar (24\u00b0 8' north latitude, 67\u00b0 30' east longitude) is the headquarter town of the Keti Bandar Mahal and is the chief town in the taluka of Ghorabari. It is a municipal town with a population of 1,734. It is administered by a Mahalkari and contains the Mahalkari's Office, Customs House, Police Station, Vernacular School, Post Office and Dispensary. Keti is a place of very recent origin. When Commander Carless, I. N., surveyed the Delta of the Indus in 1837, he found Vikkur Bandar next in importance to Karachi, but it was not a town, only a landing place for Baroe Gorah (Ghorabari), which had acquired commercial importance when the old ports of Dharaja and Shahbandar were forsaken by the ever-changing river and the Hajamro became almost the only route by which vessels of any size could pass up. Even at that time vessels drawing more than 7 feet could not get up as high as Vikkur. About ten years later Vikkur became inaccessible and trade removed to Ksti, apparently the name of a small village, which then existed. The name has remained, but the site of the Bandar has changed, the first site having been submerged about 1854. Even the present site is very insecure and much of the town has been eroded during the last twelve years. The Ochito is now the main stream, the river having forced its way down it, but at any time it may follow the channel of the Haidari. Keti is of importance now less as an entrance for merchandise seeking the upper parts than as an outlet for the produce of the surrounding country. The total value of the trade for the last five years is shown below:\n\n| Imports | 1911-12 | 1912-13 | 1913-14 | 1914-15 | 1915-16 |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Merchandl | Rs. 1,74,856 | Rs. 1,61,000 | Rs. 1,28,347 | Rs. 1,22,600 | Rs. 1,30,000 |\n| Treasure | Rs. 8,117 | Rs. 3,450 | Rs. 22,761 | Rs. 31,121 | Rs. 29,550 |\n| Total | Rs. 1,82,73 | Rs. 1,64,800 | Rs. 1,50,888 | Rs. 1,43,721 | Rs. 1,59,550 |\nThe imports consist almost entirely of miscellaneous goods from Karachi.\n\n**Exports.**\n\n|        | 1911-12 | 1912-13 | 1913-14 | 1914-15 | 1915-16 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Merchandise | Rs. 6,81,123 | Rs. 7,17,893 | Rs. 5,53,932 | Rs. 4,44,308 | Rs. 6,41,209 |\n| Treasure | N.A. |         |         |         |         |\n\nThe great article of export is rice, much of which is sent to Cutch and Kathiawar. The duty realized on this is shown below:\n\n|        | 1911-12 | 1912-13 | 1913-14 | 1914-15 | 1915-16 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.    | 20,331  | 16,660  | 19,162  | 14,767  | 12,779  |\n\nThere is a substantial Customs House with quarters for the staff, which consists of an officer in charge and three clerks. Keti is also the headquarters of two Sea Coast Inspectors of the Customs Department who patrol the creeks in boats.\n\nKotri, a large town (25\u00b0 22' north latitude, 68\u00b0 22' east longitude) is the headquarter station of the Kotri Taluka. It has a Municipality, and a population of 7,256. There are in the town the Mukhtyarkar's Office, Assistant Collector's bungalow, Police Station, Railway Hospital, Library, musafirkhana, combined Post and Telegraph Office, Anglo-vernacular School, 2 European Schools, and a Distillery, the only one of its kind in Sind, used for the distillation of the country liquor commonly sold in the bazaars.* There is also a small church (Christ Church) with seats for 100, which contains a font given by Mrs. (Lady) Frere in 1854 and the Ten Commandments executed in Hala pottery and several memorial tablets. This church was consecrated in 1855 and thoroughly renovated in 1887. Kotri is situated on the right bank of the Indus and since 1900 has been connected with Gidu Bandar on the other side of the river.\n\n* See \"A\" Volume, page 421.\nby an iron bridge replacing the steam ferry which used to ply between these two places. The town has excellent road communications; to Karachi there are two road routes\u2014one by Thano Bula Khan, and the other via Jerruck, Tattu, Gharo and Landhi, 117 miles. A road also goes to Band Virah, distant 24 miles. Much of the traffic by river has ceased since the construction of the railway. Kotri is quite a modern place. It owed its first importance to the rise of Hyderabad on the other side of the river and to the roads from Sehwan, Karachi and the Delta meeting here. It greatly increased when it became the terminus of the Karachi Kotri Railway and the starting point of the river steamers for Sukkur and Multan. The old Gazetteer describes the animated appearance of the river bank \"with the Flotilla steamers, their barges and numerous native boats moored close to the shore, all either discharging or taking in cargo.\" There were miles of sidings on the banks of the river to facilitate the transfer of cargo. The remains of the old flotilla and other vestiges of that prosperous time may still be seen, though the only steamer of that period which now survives and is in use is the Commissioner in Sind's \"Jhelum\" and its attendant flat the \"Multan.\"\n\nAfter Kotri was directly connected with Sukkur by a line on the right bank of the Indus it sank into comparative insignificance. The population in 1872 was 7,949, of whom 304 were Christians; in 1901 the population was only 7,617 with 259 Christians, while in 1911 it was 7,256 with 45 Christians. Kotri was at times exposed to serious peril from floods in the Baran river, which falls into the Indus four miles south of it. Deep drains were cut north of the town and embankments raised to the west of it with good results. In August 1914 owing to the phenomenal height of the river the town was all but submerged. Drainage and sanitation appears also to have improved the health of the town.\n\nKotri Allahrakhio Shah (24\u00b0 24' north latitude, 67\u00b0 52' east longitude) is the head-quarter station of Ghorabari Taluka and is close to the river. It is a village of no importance, but conveniently situated for administrative purposes. It contains the Mukhtyarkar's Office, a\nPolice Station, Post Office and musafirkhana. The nearest railway station is Jungshahi on the North-Western Railway, 37 miles distant. At a distance of about four miles is situated the village of Uderolal, which contains a shrine built by one Seth Manghamal in honour of Uderolal's passing some time there while achieving a victory over an oppressive ruler of Tatta. An annual fair takes place on the Chetichand and is attended by about 400 persons.\n\nLadiun (24\u00b0 19' north latitude, 68\u00b0 7' east longitude) has been the headquarter station of Shahbandar Taluka since December 1892 and has a population of 616. It contains a Mulhetyarkar's Office, District Bungalow, Police Station, Dispensary, musafirkhana, Vernacular School and Post Office. The nearest railway station is Jungshahi on the North-Western Railway, 42 miles distant. A fair is held at the tomb of a saint at Shah Yakik, two miles distant from Ladiun. It begins on the first Sunday in the month of Chet, which corresponds to March and April, and lasts for 3 or 4 days. The total attendance is about fifteen thousand persons. Gold and silver articles, wearing apparel, silk, ivory, metal vessels, fancy articles, sweetmeats and fruits are sold there and the sales amount to about 20,000 rupees. The mausoleum at Shah Yakik contains two tombs plastered with lime without inscriptions. On the road leading from Ladiun to Ghungani, 5 miles south-east of the mouth of the Sattah Wah, is a conical hill crowned by the shrine of Aban Shah, of whom little or nothing is known. This hill and a few smaller adjacent elevations constitute the only pieces of rising ground in the Shahbandar Division. They are evidently an outcrop of the hills on the Tatta side of the river. They are composed of a rather soft yellow stone.\n\nLahoribandar or Larrybandar,* as it is always called by old writers, was one of the principal ports on the Indus as long as the Baghar was an efficient branch of that river, discharging into the sea by the Pitti (Rahu) and Kudi mouths. Captain Hamilton says (1699): \"Sindy is the westernmost Province of the Mogul's dominions on the sea coast, and has Larribunder to its Sea Mart, which stands about 5 or\n\n* La. i Bandar (the Port of the Lar) was very probably the original pronunciation.\n6 leagues from the sea, on a branch of the river Indus, capable to receive ships of 200 tons. It is but a village of about 100 houses, built of crooked sticks and mud; but it has a large stone fort with four or five great guns mounted on it to protect the merchandise brought thither from the robberies of the Ballowchies and Mackrans that lie near them to the westward and the Jams to the eastward, who, being borderers, are much given to thieving and they rob all whom they are able to master.\" Merchandise was sent from Larribandar to Tatta, which, according to Captain Hamilton, was about 40 miles distant, on camels, oxen, and horses. When Mr. Crowe represented the East India Company in Sind, at the end of the 18th century, one of his factories was at Lahoribandar. In 1831, when Alexander Burnes passed up the Indus, the Baghar channel had been deserted for three years and the trade had gone to Shahbandar and Vikar (Ghorabari). A little further up the river (Thornton says 2 miles) was the town of Dharaja of Dharaji, a much more important place than Lahoribandar, which was, in all probability, merely a landing place for Dharaja at certain times. The Rana of Dharaja was assassinated at the instigation of Ghulam Shah Kalhora who then seized his dominions (see \"A\" Volume, page 111). The ruins now pointed out as those of Lahoribandar are situated in level country, on a small creek which joins the Wango and the Rahu, and appears to be regularly submerged at spring tides. Little is left now, but mounds of bricks, with traces of stone buildings here and there and the ruins of a brick mosque.\n\nOn the west, about a quarter of a mile distant, is a fort built entirely of red bricks, which is no doubt the very one seen by Captain Hamilton. The walls, five feet thick, still stand in some parts to a height of 14 feet. The fort is 350 feet square and appears to have had 14 bastions. A mile west of it is a shrine of one Balushah, much visited by Jats and Muhanas.\n\nLaki, a village of the Manjhand Mahal of the Kotri Taluka and at the extreme north point of the district, is seated close to the west bank of the Indus and immediately below the Laki hills, which here rise to a considerable elevation.\nIt has a railway station of its own name and contains a musafirkhana, Vernacular School and Post Office. The town is situated on the main road leading from Kotri to Sehwan. A branch road leads to the hot springs of Dhara Tirth, distant about 2 miles, the water of which, like that of Mangho Pir, is considered highly efficacious for the cure of cutaneous and other diseases. Unlike that of Mangho Pir, it has a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, a saline and bitter taste and alkaline reaction. On analysis it has been found to contain about 7,050 parts of solid matter (dried at 100\u00b0 C.) per million, the bases present being chiefly magnesium and sodium, as sulphides, chlorides, sulphates and carbonates. As a mineral water its most characteristic properties may be considered to be due to the presence of sulphides of magnesium and sodium. The surroundings of the springs have in the last few years been much improved for the convenience of those using them.\n\nManjhand (25\u00b0 55' north latitude, 68\u00b0 17' east longitude) is the headquarter station of Manjhand. It is a municipal town having a population of 2,838 and contains a Deputy Collector's Bungalow, Mahalkari's Office, Police Station, Post Office, Vernacular School and musafirkhana. It stands on the high road from Kotri to Sehwan and has a station on the North-Western Railway a mile distant. There is a tomb of Shah Awes near Manjhand which is visited by a considerable number of people.\n\nAllusion to the Mauryapur Salt Works has already been made in Chapter 9 of the \"A\" Volume. They are situated in the Moach plain, about seven miles west of Karachi, where strong brine, amounting almost to a saturated solution of nearly pure chloride of sodium, may be found in many places, about 12 feet below the surface. Mr. Maury, the officer of the Bombay Salt Department, who was deputed to Sind in 1879 to organize the works, and after whom they are named, closed the scattered pans, which he found on the plain, and laid them out on a compact, symmetrical and admirably designed plan, with a high surrounding embankment as a protection from floods. The original works were completely washed away in the cyclone of 1907. Other works above\ntide level were constructed in the same year, enclosing a larger area of land than before.\n\nThe works were started with 39 pans. This number has been increased from time to time and there are now 140 pans within the permanent embankment, but about 100 temporary pans have recently been opened outside the embankment, with a view to increase the output, which amounted in the calendar year 1917 to five and a half lakhs of maunds compared with one lakh of maunds in 1879. It is intended to include the temporary pans in the permanent works and to extend the embankment for the purpose. Brine is lifted from shallow wells in buckets suspended from the longer end of a lever of bamboo construction, the shorter end of which is weighted with a basket of stones. The brine is run into shallow beds, 25 feet square and 6 inches deep. The surface of the beds is plastered with a peculiar kind of clay found in the neighbourhood, which is beaten down and allowed to harden, forming an impervious medium through which water cannot percolate. The heat of the sun evaporates the brine in the pans, and causes the salt in the water first to form on the surface and then as the residue increases in gravity to sink to the bottom of the pan in fine crystals. The salt is scraped together with toothless rakes and then washed by the basketful in brine, the amount of washing depending on the degree of whiteness required. The finished product is heaped by the manufacturers on drying platforms alongside the pan where it is allowed to dry for a week.\n\nInside the embankment, running right round and through the centre of the works is a wide trench which serves two purposes. It prevents the surreptitious removal of salt, and it assists in feeding the brine wells, into which the water from the trench percolates. The saline strength of the water in the wells varies considerably and some of the pans consequently turn out far larger quantities of salt than others. Another cause of variations in production is the cold winds in winter which reduce the outturn and cause the crystals sometimes to assume a peculiar needle-like formation with a considerable impregnation of magnesia.\nIt is popularly asserted that the wind causes the formations. To a certain extent it may be so, as the magnesia \"suts,\" or needles as they are called, generally occur in the cold weather. But their formation can be practically stopped by a careful manufacturer.\n\nA series of 20 or 24 of the \"beds\" referred to above constitute a \"pan\" which is the unit of the subdivision for administrative purposes. Each pan has its own wells and dryage platform and is held by a manufacturer (or Lunari) on a yearly license subject to good behaviour and satisfactory work.\n\nPans are allotted by the Superintendent free of charge, and when the holder dies; his holding usually is continued to his family; but bad conduct may entail expulsion.\n\nOne Lunari may hold several pans, working them with the help of his family or servants. Pans are held principally by Makranis, Baluchis, Pardesis, Vanis and Zikris, the last predominating. The Lunaris with their families are accommodated in a village not far from the works. The population of the village is estimated at about 1,200.\n\nUpto the time of the crop of each bed being taken in by the Superintendent of the works on behalf of Government the salt is the property of the \"Lunaris.\" On the Superintendent passing it, as clean, dry, and suitable for human consumption it is carried and stored after weighment on platforms, in conical heaps (thatched with mats to preserve the commodity from climatic deterioration) of 25 to 50 thousand maunds. The platforms are so located as to be generally convenient for storage to the contractors, who are paid at the rate of Rs. 2-1-4 per 100 maunds for the work of storage. The Lunaris are paid from one anna and six pies to one anna and nine pies per maund. A special rate of two annas per maund is paid for salt of superior whiteness.\n\nThe business of removing salt from Maurypur to the central market at Karachi had gradually fallen into the hands of a ring of merchants who divided amongst themselves the work of transport and were able to keep the cost of camel and boat transport down to a low figure. So long as the public secured the advantage of low rates the arrangement was unobjectionable. But in recent years the merchants\nmonopolized the means of transport and a ring forced up prices. In order to break down the operations of the ring, and to make salt readily available to the public at a low cost, a Government Depot was established in Karachi in 1916 for the sale of salt, and this depot has served its purpose.\n\nThe Maurypur Salt Works supply the greater part of Sind, part of the supply being issued from a depot at Sukkur, and part from the new Karachi Depot. The territory of His Highness the Mir of Khairpur also draws its supply from these works. Salt of the Karachi and Sukkur Depots is transported in bond through the medium of a contractor whose services are also utilized for the carriage of salt to Khairpur. The transport contractor is free to remove salt to Karachi by the land route or by sea. He is paid 20 pies per maund for transport of salt to the Karachi Depot and 18 pies per maund for transport to the Karachi Bandar Station for despatch to the other two destinations. In special cases salt is also issued direct from the work. The charges amount to Re. 1-8-1 per maund, and include cost price, duty, storage and establishment charges.\n\nOne of the chief problems confronting the Salt Department in Sind is to increase the outturn of salt at Maurypur to the largest possible extent. It is proposed to extend the works, and at the same time to improve the conditions under which the Lamaris work and provide an adequate supply of fresh water for the village.\n\nThe Superintendent, Inspector, clerical staff and guard peons all live at the works in buildings provided for them by Government.\n\nMirpur Bathore (24\u00b0 44' north latitude, 68\u00b0 18' east longitude) is the headquarter station of the taluka of that name and has a population of 2,497. It possesses a Mukhtiyar's Office, Public Works Department Inspection Bungalow, Dispensary, Post Office, Vernacular School, Police Station and muafirkhana. It had a Municipality but that was abolished in 1895. The nearest railway station is Jungshahi, 47 miles distant. It had a name for the printing of cotton cloth, but the industry is dying out. Lacquer work is also done in the town. There is a large tank in the centre of the town, the water of which is used for drinking.\npurposes. This town with the surrounding country belonged before the British conquest to Mir Sher Muhammad of Mirpur, and Burnes states that it yielded a revenue of 5 lakhs of rupees.\n\nMirpur Sakro (24\u00b0 33' north latitude, 67\u00b0 40' east longitude) is the headquarter station of the taluka and has a population of 1,720. The nearest railway station is Dabheji, at a distance of 22 miles. It contains a Mukhtyarkar's Office, Public Works Department Inspection Bungalow, Police Station, Vernacular School, Dispensary, Post Office and musafir-khana. At a distance of 10 miles to the north-east of Mirpur Sakro, and about 2 miles from Gujo, is situated the tomb of Sheikh Haji Turabi. It is plainly visible from Gujo, which is only 8 miles from Jungshahi. It is a humble old building, measuring 13 feet each way and undecorated, but derives interest from the confident statement of the author of the \"Tufat-ul-kiram\" that it is the resting place of a famous Arab general by name Sheikh Abu Turab, who captured the fort of Bukkur and other places in western Sind during the reign of the Abbaside Khalifa Mansur; for confirmation of which he appeals to the date 171 on the dome. If there is no fraud here and 171 is not a mistake for 771, this must be the oldest historical record of any kind in Sind. According to the local tradition the Sheikh was a saint who lived in the day of an oppressive Hindu Raja by name Tharna, whom he transmuted with his army into a hill. The hill remains to this day. The tomb has been repaired occasionally by devotees of the saint, who are said almost to have obliterated the old Arabic inscription. A small monthly fair is held at the shrine.\n\nPir Mangho, or as it is vulgarly called Mugger Peer, 10 miles north of Karachi with which it is now connected with a metalled road, is the tomb of Haji Mangho (the Arabic form of the name), a holy hermit, who is said to have been settled there about the middle of the thirteenth century. He was visited by a quaternion of saints known as the four friends, of whom Lal Shahbaz Kalander of Sahwan was the most famous, and they made the barren valley a mere eligible residence.\nfor him by causing a hot spring to issue from the rock and a grove of date palms to spring up from the ground. When the Pir died and was buried, his grave became a place of pilgrimage for pious Muslims from all parts of the country. But it is also a resort of Hindu devotees, who call it Lala Jasraj. This double character is common among the shrines of Sind: the Mussalman Lal Shahbaz is the Hindu Raja Bhartari and the Mussalman Khwaja Khizar is the Hindu Jinda Pir.\n\nMugger Peer is traditionally \"a place to see,\" the only one in the neighbourhood of Karachi. Lieutenant Carless of the Indian Navy, who was surveying the Sind coast in 1838, heard of it and made an enterprising excursion to it. A few extracts from his account will give a fair idea of the place as it was:\n\n\"An hour's ride brought us to the foot of the hills, which are about 800 feet high and of coarse sandstone formation; we crossed them through an irregular rocky ravine, having every appearance of being the bed of a large torrent during the rains, and then pursued our way along several small valleys bounded by long narrow ridges or detached hills. The valley of Pir Mangho is surrounded by hills 700 or 800 feet high, between which glimpses are occasionally obtained of the level plains beyond. An extensive grove of dates and other trees occupies the centre of the plain and on the western side there is another.\" \"The spring gushes out in a small stream from among the roots of a picturesque clump of date trees covering the extremity of a rocky knoll of limestone about 30 feet high and falls into a small natural basin, from whence it escapes in numerous rills to the adjacent gardens.\" \"It is colourless and perfectly pure to the taste, having no perceptible flavour of any kind, but, from the stones in some of the rivulets being encrusted with a soft substance of a dark, reddish brown colour, probably contains a small portion of iron. The water is so warm that at first you can scarcely bear your hand in it, and its temperature was afterwards found to be 133\u00b0.* The natives say it cures every disease, and they not only bathe in it whenever\n\n*This temperature is nearly right; that of the water at the spring is about blood heat. There is no trace of sulphur in this water, nor of iron. Like most Sind water it contains salts (of sodium, magnesium and calcium) which were found to amount to 14 parts in 1000.\nthey have an opportunity, but drink it in large quantities.\"\n\n\"After everything worthy of notice about the Kisti spring had been examined, we mounted our horses and proceeded to the temple on the western side of the valley. It is surrounded by a thick grove, and after emerging from the narrow path that leads to it we came suddenly upon one of the most singular scenes I ever witnessed. Before us lay a small swamp enclosed in a belt of lofty trees, which had evidently been formed by the superfluous waters of a spring close by flowing into a low hollow in the ground. It was not a single sheet of water, but was full of small islets, so much so that it appeared as if an immense number of narrow channels had been cut so as to cross each other in every direction. These channels were literally swarming with large alligators, and the islets and banks were thickly covered with them also. The swamp is not more than 150 yards long by about 80 yards broad, and in this confined space I counted above 200 large ones, from 8 to 15 feet long, while those of a smaller size were innumerable. The appearance of the place altogether, with its green, slimy, stagnant waters, and so many of these huge, uncouth monsters moving sluggishly about, is disgusting in the extreme and will long be remembered by me as the most loathsome spot I ever beheld. After gazing upon the scene some time we proceeded round the swamp to the temple, where the priests had spread carpets for the party under the shade of some trees. They told me it was a curious sight to see the alligators fed and that people of rank always gave them a goat for that purpose. Taking the hint I immediately ordered one to be killed for their entertainment. The animal was slaughtered on the edge of the swamp, and immediately the blood began to flow, the water became perfectly alive with the brutes, all hastening from different parts towards the spot. When the meat was thrown among them it proved the signal for a general battle; several seized hold of a piece at the same time and bit and struggled and rolled over each other until almost exhausted with the desperate efforts they made to carry it off.\"\n\n\"The mosque is a neat, white building of a square form, surrounded by a small terrace, with a cupola and slender minarets at the corners, erected on the summit of a rocky\ncrag of limestone and said to be 2,000 years old. The interior of the mosque contains a tomb surmounted by a canopy of carved woodwork supported on slender pillars; the whole prettily and neatly ornamented and kept in excellent order as are the building and terrace, which are built of stone. On the site of the rock looking towards the alligators pool the perpendicular face of the cliff is covered with a coating of smooth chunam, and from the lower part the principal spring gushes forth through a small fissure. The water is received into two small reservoirs and then escapes through several outlets to the swamp below. In one of them was a large alligator, with about a dozen young ones, which the inhabitants have named the Peacock (or Mor) and they consider him to be the progenitor of the whole race. The water of this spring is perfectly fresh and slightly warm, but at another, a few yards from it, it is quite cold.\"\n\nSince that time the place has been, as Sir R. Burton complained in 1876, \"sadly civilized and vulgarized by Cockney modern improvements.\" The number of crocodiles is greatly reduced and the size too, if old reports are true. They have been confined, moreover, by a wall, in a small and dirty tank, where they present a squalid and uninteresting spectacle. Tombs, adorned with the poorest description of glazed tiles and not kept in repair, give a shabby look to the environment of the shrine. The most interesting object is a kandi tree, hung with small calico bags containing the hair of infants.\n\nOne object of peculiar interest at this place has not received much attention and none at all from Sir R. Burton. Looking from the verandah of the bungalow two tombs are seen by themselves on a low eminence at a distance of less than half a mile, which are altogether different from those in other parts of the valley. They are constructed of slabs of very hard limestone, delicately and beautifully sculptured in a great variety of designs, and then put together over the grave without cement. The larger of the two has a domed roof, on stone pillars, and appears to have contained four graves; but the dome is in a ruinous condition and the graves have fallen in. The other is an open platform with two tombs on it, the figures carved on which seem to\nindicate that they cover the remains of women. The local story is that the principal tomb contains the body of one Sardar Khan, chief of the Burfat tribe, who was killed in a battle against the Jokhias at Allah Buna, about 10 miles from Pir Mangho. There is an inscription on this tomb, containing passages from the \"Koran,\" but no information except the plain date 913. This gives the year A.D. 1506, at which period the Samas were ruling in Sind. Similar tombs are said to be found further on among the hills and there is a low ridge visible from the municipal water-works bungalow at Malir, covered with them. Some are ruinous, some in good condition, with the delicate carving sharp and clear, showing the hardness of the stone of which they were made. They have all the same character as those at Pir Mangho, but bear no inscription except, in some cases, a single name, often that of a woman. The Jam of the Jokhias lives in the neighbourhood, and his people seem to have preserved the same tradition as to their origin. The Burfatis, or Bulfatis, are a sub-tribe of the Numrias, the most powerful tribe in Las Bela and the Kohistan, and it is more than likely that they had many struggles with the Jokhias before the latter established themselves in Malir and the Delta; but unless their women were Amazons, the popular story does not account for the female graves.\n\nA charitable refuge for lepers, known as the Hiranand Leper Asylum is maintained by private benevolence on the outskirts of the village at Pir Mangho.\n\nMughulbhin* (24\u00b0 21' north latitude, 68\u00b0 19' east longitude), a small town on the bank of the Gumgro, with a population of 1,720, is the headquarter station of the Jati Taluka. It contains a Public Works Department Inspection Bungalow, Police Station, musafirkhana, Post Office, Vernacular School and Dispensary. A road runs from Mughulbhin to Lakhpat which is much frequented by Hindu pilgrims en route to Narmain and Dwarka. The nearest railway station is Junshahi, 52 miles distant. Mughulbhin possessed a Municipality, which was abolished in 1878. This town is said\n\n* This appears to have been quite recently corrupted from Mughulbhin or Mughulbin.\nto owe its name to Bhim alias Shekh Salamat, a chief of the Kureshi tribe, and Mughal (or Mughar) his son, who were killed resisting the Hindu king of Halar, who attacked them owing to their refusal to hand over to him a Saiyid charged with the murder of the king's son. Over their bodies tombs were erected by an unknown disciple and adjoining these there is a beautiful and well painted mosque. There are besides two other tombs, which contain the bodies of a grandson of Bhim and his grandfather Nibho. The buildings are of the conventional type, made of common brick and plaster, with no features of architectural distinction. Both the saints Mughar and Bhim are credited with having performed many miracles. A large black stone weighing 120 lbs. lies before the chief tomb, with a groove made on it by the thumb of the saint's brother Umar. The story is that, at the sight of this stone in the hands of Umar, a thief restored stolen property. The stone is revered greatly. Women go and sing beside it almost every night and sick men touch it in the hope of being cured. The followers of these saints are mostly Jats. An annual fair is held on the 23rd of the Hindu month Phagun and lasts for about 6 days. On the first day takes place the achhi ceremony, which consists of white-washing the tombs; the people of the neighbourhood bring all the milk in their homes and mix it with the lime for white-washing. On the fifth day from the commencement comes the par ceremony which consists of removing all the pars (the coverings of the tombs), washing them in the Gungro, drying them and putting them on again. The average number of persons attending the fair is about 10,000 and goods of all sorts are sold to the estimated value of Rs. 20,000. No sale of animals takes place, as is customary at other large fairs.\n\nAt a distance of 5 miles north-east from Mughulbhain are the remains of what is supposed to have been a fort, called Nanikot, \"the fort of Nand.\" Nand Raja is believed to have flourished before the Kalhoras and to have been very rich. Buried treasure is supposed by the inhabitants to exist here.\n\nPir Patho is a Ziarat-gah which, according to Captain Wood (1841), was second only in sanctity to the shrine of Lal Shahbaz.\nin Sehwan. The situation is a cliff separated from the southern extremity of the Makli hills by the channel of the Baghar and lying about 12\u00bd miles south of Tatta. The ruins of a great mosque idgah and minar afford evidence of the former existence of a large town at the base of the hill; but the object of veneration is the conspicuous white tomb, crowning a height and visible from afar, of a holy man whom Mussalmans call Pir Patho and Hindus call Raja Gopichand. He is said to have been born in A.H. 560 and to have been a contemporary of the Persian poet Saadi, which may be true of the Pir. The Hindu, whose shrine he usurped, probably lived many centuries before. In the time of the Talpurs stores of grain and ghi were kept at the shrine and pilgrims were fed at the expense of the local governor. Since those days the celebrity of the place has much declined, but hundreds of Kachhis still flock to the annual fair held there from the 11th to the 14th of the Mahomedan month Rabi-al-awal. There is a Public Works Inspection Bungalow and also a musafirkhana.\n\nRani-ka-kot is the name of the fort about 7 or 8 miles from the town of Sann. It is thus described by Captain Del-Hoste, of the Bombay Army, who in 1839 was Assistant Quarter-Master-General of the northern division of the army: \"Rani-ka-kot was built by Mir Karam Ali Talpur and his brother Mir Murad Ali, about A.D. 1812, cost 12,00,000 rupees and has never been inhabited, in consequence of there being a scarcity of water in and near it. That so large a fort should have been constructed without its having been ascertained beforehand that an article so indispensably requisite, not only for the use of man, but even for the construction of the walls, was wanting, seems most extraordinary, but I am told that this was the reason for its having been abandoned. A rapid stream runs past it and joins the Indus, and, by a deviation from its course, parts of the walls of this fort have been destroyed. The object of its construction seems to have been to afford a place of refuge to the Mirs in case of their country being invaded.\" At present the Sann river, or as it is there called the Rani Nai, runs through the fort, and it is stated that there is now no scarcity of water whatever.\nRarhi (Beri), an ancient town in the Jati Taluka, some 16 miles north-east of Mughulbhin, was a flourishing centre of trade 100 years ago. The tradition of this fact is kept up in a phrase still current. \"Are you a Shahukar of Rarhi?\" is a question asked ironically of a man who is throwing his money about.\n\nAll that is left of Rarhi is a few domed tombs (the largest being that of a Khoja saint, Nur Shah) and the marks of the foundations of a considerable village in the midst of a bare desert. Dr. Burnes, in his \"Visit to the Court of Seinde,\" about 1828, mentions the population of the village as having declined to 500 or less. The decline was evidently due to the main channels of irrigation in that direction having dried up.\n\nShahbandar is a village in the Shahbandar Taluka. It is in the Indus Delta and was formerly on the east bank of the channel, which discharged its waters into the sea by the Mal mouth. At present it is 10 miles distant from the nearest point of the Indus. It is said to have been founded in 1759 A.D. by Ghulam Shah Kalhora, who ordered all the residents of Aursnga to move to it. The English factory at Auranga Bandar was included in this transfer, and it is recorded that, previous to the dissolution of the factory in 1775, it supplied a considerable establishment for the navigation of the river, consisting of 14 small vessels, each of about 40 tons burthen.\n\nThe rulers of Sind had a fleet of 15 ships stationed at Shahbandar. It would seem that the earthquake of 1819 caused great alterations in the lower part of the Indus and brought about the decay of the town by withdrawing the current from the branch on which it stood. So it dwindled away into obscurity and has no trade nor manufacture of any kind whatever. It is a colony of Cutchi Bhatias, a few of whom still trade with Muscat and other parts, doing their business at Karachi or Ket Bandar, but keeping their homes and families at Shahbandar. It was formerly the headquarter town of the taluka, but these were removed to Ladium in 1892.\n\nSirganda, or Sundo Bandar, so called from the petty village of Sundo, four miles from Mughulbhin, gets any importance it\nhas from being the furthest point to which boats have been able to ascend the Sir creek since the Pinyari river silted up or the Mirs dammed it, if that account of the matter be true. It is in fact the grain port of Mughulbhin and the Jati Taluka. It is not mentioned by any of the officers who surveyed the Delta before the British occupation of Sind, but its trade is included in the earliest extant reports of the Collector of Customs at Karachi, and it continues to the present day to carry on a considerable traffic with Karachi and the coast ports. The value of the imports and exports during the last five years is shown below:\n\n**Imports**\n\n|        | 1911-12 | 1912-13 | 1913-14 | 1914-15 | 1915-16 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Merchandise | Rs. 1,78,721 | Rs. 1,86,743 | Rs. 1,32,984 | Rs. 1,38,876 | Rs. 1,55,288 |\n| Treasure   | Rs. 1,30,504 | Rs. 2,45,382 | Rs. 1,62,064 | Rs. 1,37,420 | Rs. 1,70,783 |\n| **Total**  | Rs. 3,09,225 | Rs. 4,31,126 | Rs. 2,95,048 | Rs. 2,76,296 | Rs. 3,25,171 |\n\n**Exports**\n\n|        | 1911-12 | 1912-13 | 1913-14 | 1914-15 | 1915-16 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Merchandise | Rs. 6,70,688 | Rs. 6,90,121 | Rs. 5,12,420 | Rs. 4,98,657 | Rs. 8,40,440 |\n| Treasure   |         |         |         |         |         |\n| **Total**  | Rs. 6,70,688 | Rs. 6,90,121 | Rs. 5,12,420 | Rs. 4,98,657 | Rs. 8,40,440 |\n\nThe imports consist of manufactured and miscellaneous commodities, the exports mainly of rice, much of which goes to Cutch.\n\nThe duty collected on this during the last five years is shown below:\n\n|        | 1911-12 | 1912-13 | 1913-14 | 1914-15 | 1915-16 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.    | 32,713  | 30,475  | 22,064  | 21,302  | 40,431  |\n\nThere is considerable passenger traffic also when labourers from Cutch come in to reap the rice harvest and return to their home after it. There is a substantial Custom House, surrounded by the warehouses of the merchants. There have been many complaints lately about the creek having\nsilted up to such an extent that only the smallest craft could go up to the Custom House. This was partly due to the indolence of the boatmen themselves, who preferred to heave sand ballast into the stream rather than take the trouble to put it ashore; but more perhaps to the cutting down of jungle which had acted as a screen against sand drifts. An attempt was made with some success some years ago to scour the channel by opening the sluices of the Gungro canal at the ebb of the tide.\n\nSujawal (24\u00b0 36' north latitude, 68\u00b0 7' east longitude) is the headquarters of Sujawal Taluka. It contains a population of 1,553. Here the Assistant Collector has a residence, and here are situated a Mukhtiyarkar's Office, Resident Magistrate's Court House, Veterinary Dispensary, Post Office and Vernacular School. It is 4 miles east of Saidpur steam ferry, which connects it with the other side of the river, and is 32 miles distant from the nearest railway station, Jungshahi.\n\nTatta, or Nangar Tatta (24\u00b0 46' north latitude, 67\u00b0 59' east longitude), the headquarters of the Tatta Taluka, is 50 miles east of Karachi and 13 miles distant from the Jungshahi Station of the North-Western Railway with which it is connected by a metalled road. Two miles from Tatta, where the road crosses the Makli hills, there are a Travellers' Bungalow and a District Bungalow.\n\nThe date of the foundation of Tatta is unknown, but it is certain that a town has existed on the site for many centuries. As long as the Makli hills stood at the apex of the Delta\u2014and that condition only ceased 140 years ago by the silting up of the channel which is now the Kalri canal\u2014the situation was so obviously suited to a commercial town that it never could have been long unoccupied; but both the site and the name of the town have probably changed many times, and such changes can seldom be traced with exactness because the new name does not at once replace the old. For instance, Goa is spoken of as the capital of Portuguese India, but the town which is referred to is some miles from the original Goa and its proper name is Panjim, or Nova\nGoa. Early writers supposed Tatta to have been Alexander's Patala, but that seems to be out of the question. It has also been identified with Debal, the great Hindu town which was first attacked by the Arabs under Muhammad Kasam, a theory discredited by Major-General Haig, but supported in a measure by Mr. H. Cousens, on account of the evidence of the ancient existence of a great Hindu temple on the Makli hill, the materials of which have been employed in the older Mussalman tombs. The Sama kings, who came into power in the middle of the 14th century, called their capital Samui, but it was only three miles north of the present site of Tatta, to which the population may have transferred itself gradually until the Jam Nizam-ud-din, by some official recognition of the new settlement, gained the credit of having founded the city of Tatta about the end of the 15th century (see History, Volume A, page 100). The city has moved a good deal in much more recent times, creeping after the retreating river by a process of growth on the east and decay on the west. It has also been sacked or burned three times\u2014first by Shah Beg Arghun in 1521, then by a Portuguese force in 1556, and lastly by its own ruler, Mirza Jani Beg, when he was resisting Akbar's forces in 1591. Nevertheless it continued to be the capital of south Sind until the building of Hyderabad in 1768 and rose to great splendour. Captain Alexander Hamilton, who saw it in 1699, thus writes of it: \"Tatta is the emporium of the Province, a very large and rich city. It is three miles long and one and a half broad, and is about 40 miles from Larrybunder (Lahori) and has a large citadel at its west end capable to lodge 50,000 men and horse, and has barracks and stables convenient for them and with a palace built in it for the Naboh.\" \"Tatta stands about two miles from the river Indus, in a spacious plain, and they have canals cut from the river to bring water to the city, and some for the use of their gardens. The King's gardens were in pretty condition in Anno Domini 1699 and were well stored with excellent fruits and flowers, particularly the most delicious pomegranates that ever I tasted.\" Again he says: \"The city of Tatta is famous for learning in theology, philosophy and politics, and they have 400 colleges for training up youths in those parts of learning.\" Tatta had at one time a lucrative trade with the Portuguese, and\nfrom the following passage it seems that their missionaries must have got a footing there and lost it:\u2014\"The Portuguese had formerly a Church at the east end of the city. The house is still entire and in the vestry are some old pictures of saints and some holy vestments, which they desired to sell; but I was no merchant for such bargains.\" There had been a drought for the previous three years, which \"caused a severe plague to affect the town and circumjacent country to such a degree that, in the city only, 80,000 died of it, that manufactured cotton and silk, and above one-half of the city was deserted and left empty.\" This was the time when Surat and all Gujarat suffered so severely from the plague.\n\nAfter the rise of the Kalhoras the decay of Tatta was very rapid. Henry Pottinger, who passed through it in 1809, writes: \"We rode a long way after we got among ruins, before we came to the habitable part of the city.\" In 1831 Alexander Burnes described it thus: \"It does not contain a population of 15,000 souls, and of the houses scattered about its ruins one-half are destitute of inhabitants. Of the weavers of 'loongees' for which this place was so famous, 126 families only remain. There are not forty merchants in the city.\" Even the heaps of ruins which these writers mention have largely disappeared since by the action of wind and water, or the overgrowth of vegetation. The Tatta of to-day is a town of 11,161 inhabitants, with narrow streets, but not very dirty as towns go in Sind. The houses are two and three storeys high, but all of wattle and mud plaster. Stone has never been used in domestic architecture in this town. The public buildings are the Steele Hall, Mukhtyarkar's Office, Police Station, Dispensary, Post and Telegraph Office, Reading Room and Library, Anglo-Vernacular School and musafirkhana. The factory of the East India Company, which had a trading station here from 1758 till 1775, was used at the time of the conquest and long after as a travellers' bungalow, or officers' quarters, but it fell into ruins and was overbuilt nearly forty years ago. A large yard on the opposite side of the street, which is said to have been part of the Company's premises, has an old and massive wooden gate and an entrance of rough stone pavement. A curious memorial of early English enterprise in this quarter\nof the world is the grave of Edward Cooke, which lies 150 yards from the District Bungalow. It bears the following inscription in deep relief on a slab of yellow stone:\n\nHere lyes the manes of Edward Cooke,\nwho was taken out of the world in the Flower\nof his Age, a person of great merit and much\nlamented by his friends, learned in many\nlanguages, of great humanity, a sound judgment\nand generous disposition, who departed\nthis life on the 8th of May 1743. Aetatis\nsuae 21.\n\nAs blooming lillies grace the field,\nSo for a day they shine,\nLike him to God, so they yield\nTheir selves, but not their name resign.\n\nTo whose memory his servants erected this\ntomb.\n\nNothing is known of Edward Cooke, who preceded the East India Company by fifteen years. There are graves near his and also some in the town, which are said to be those of Europeans, but they mostly bear no inscription and nothing is known about them. Tatta is distinguished among the towns of Sind for its unhealthiness. The lowlands all round are submerged during the inundation, after which malaria rages in the town. Early travellers were struck with the sickly appearance of the inhabitants and the British troops encamped on the Makli hills in 1839 learned a lesson which was long remembered. The 22nd Regiment alone had 1,576 cases in hospital between August and January. There are still a good many Banias in Tatta, engaged in trade, and its ancient industry, the manufacture of silk jangas, is carried on still upon a small scale. The most influential section of the community by far is the Saiyids, who have settled here for centuries. The historian of Sind, Ali Sher Kani, the author of the \"Tuhfat-ul-kiram,\" was a citizen of Tatta and lived in the middle of the 18th century. The only monuments which survive of the former glory of Tatta are the tombs on the Makli hills and the Jama Masjid and Dabgar Masjid in the town. The latter will be conveniently described with the former, as they belong to the same time and style.\nThe Makli hills are geologically a very interesting outcrop in a flat, alluvial plain, of the great bed of tertiary rocks which have been distinguished as the Ranikot Group (see Geology, Volume A, Chapter I), consisting of nummulitic limestone. The range, which starts from Pir Patho, runs north for about 11 miles, ending due west of Tatta and scarcely a mile distant from it. Seen from the west it scarcely seems to deserve the name of a hill, but from Tatta its aspect is more abrupt. The actual height is from 80 to 150 feet above sea level. The top is a plateau studded with the formal and forbidding \"cactus\" so-called (Euphorbia nereifolia) and strewn thick with pebbles and nodular lumps of hard, yellow limestone, which are sometimes quite speckled with little nummulites. These get detached and lie on the ground in such quantities that it has become a trade to collect, drill and string them for sale to pilgrims on the way to Hinglaj in Baluchistan. They are called thumra. But more interesting far than its geological features is the great necropolis which occupies the northern half of the Makli hill. The population of this city of the dead has been estimated at one million. It is impossible to say when the Makli hill first began to be a cemetery. It was evidently invested from a very early time with a vague sacredness, which accumulated as one Saiyid after another found a resting place in it. The Sama Jams had their capital, Samui, just below the north end of the hill and, according to one popular tradition, Jam Tamachi and the fisherman's daughter whom he made his queen are laid in two old tombs at that end of it. With Jam Nindo, or Nizam-ad-din, we come to history. There is no doubt about the identity of this tomb, built in 1508 A.D. It is entirely of sculptured stone and the designs are distinctly Hindu in their character. The Superintendent of the Archaeological Survey is of opinion that a large part of the material of this tomb has been taken from some old and magnificent Hindu temple, and there is a tradition that such a temple existed. The Arghuns, who expelled Jam Nindo's son, lived at Sukkur and were interred at Mecca, but under the Tarkhans, who followed them, Tatta again became the capital of lower Sind, and then an era of architectural magnificence set in. The mausoleum of Mirza Isa, the first Tarkan ruler, is built entirely of stone, but in that of his son, Muhammad\nBaki, and all the subsequent tombs of any distinction, the principal materials are glazed bricks or encaustic tiles. Of this work Mr. H. Cousens, Superintendent, Archaeological Survey, Bombay, says: \"The buildings of the latter class are almost entirely built of brick masonry, the brick-work being very superior, being made of the best pottery earth, perfectly formed, dense and having clean, sharp-cut edges. Some are unglazed, a plain dark red, while others have their outer surfaces enamelled in dark and light blue and white. The joints between them are exceedingly fine, but an imitation joint is formed on one side of each brick by a \u00bd inch strip along its edge being sunk and enamelled white. Most of the brick buildings have been built of these bricks with the various coloured faces so disposed as to form patterns, every brick being burnt for its own position. When used in the inner lining of domes they have been worked in zigzag patterns, in radiating divisions and flutings from apex to springing line, and look remarkably well though quaint. But the finest features in these buildings is the beautiful glazed tile-work in the shape of panels and dados. The lovely soft blending of the colours has run slightly in the firing, thus blurring the edges of the pattern, and the result of this accident is to give the work a softness and waxy, translucent look which is its chief charm. To my thinking the effect is superior to that of European tiles with their harder and sharper outlines. A single pattern will often run over several square yards of surface, each tile consequently being different from its neighbour, instead of a single small pattern from tile to tile. The pigments chiefly used are three, viz., a rich dark blue, a turquoise or light greenish blue, and white. The first two are very transparent colours and thus acquire great depth and richness. Now and again at Tatta is found a yellow, but very rarely in the old work. Its place is taken by a buff, unglazed tile or stone, being the same colour right through, and which, being a softer and subdued tint, harmonizes better with its surroundings.\"\n\nIn recent years steps have been taken to keep the tombs in repair, and all those detailed below, and also the Jama Masjid, Dabgar Masjid and Kalan Kot have been declared protected monuments under the Ancient Monuments Act. The principal tombs are:\u2014\n1. Tomb of Mirza Jani Beg and Mirza Ghazi Beg.\u2014Jani Beg was the last independent Tarkhan ruler of Tatta. He resisted manfully, but unsuccessfully, the general whom the Emperor Akbar sent to take possession of Sind. Making his submission afterwards, he was reinstated as governor of Tatta. He died in 1599. His son Ghazi Beg succeeded him in his office and was also appointed governor of the province of Kandahar. He was murdered in 1611-12 A.D. and the remains of both father and son were interred in this tomb in 1613. It stands in a courtyard, on a high plinth, and is itself octagonal, with a domed roof. The plinth is of stone, but the superstructure is of glazed blue bricks in lines alternating with unglazed brown ones. This striped pattern is quaint and occurs nowhere else. The stone-work exhibits some beautiful carving and inscriptions. There are three tombs inside\u2014two of marble and one of stone. This is the first of the imposing edifices which crown the slope near to the district bungalow.\n\n2. Tomb of Nawab Mirza Isa Tarkhan.\u2014This nobleman, who must not be confounded with his namesake the first Tarkhan ruler of Tatta, was appointed governor of south Sind by the Emperor Jehangir in 1627 A.D. and began to build his tomb, it is said, in the same year. It was finished in 1644. He had been deputed in the meantime on military service to Karnal, whence he is said to have sent the stone for the tomb; but according to another account it came from Junagad. The mausoleum as a whole is the most imposing one on the hill. It stands in the middle of an ample courtyard and is itself 70 feet square. In the centre is the great apartment, containing eleven graves, which rises through the full height of the building to the dome. This is surrounded on all four sides by pillared verandahs in two storeys. The whole is built of buff-coloured stone elaborately and exquisitely carved. The tombs within are literally covered with carving, which consists largely of texts from the Koran in Arabic or Persian characters. Their ends are plain save for the names and dates inscribed on them. Outside, with an enclosure of their own, are the graves of the ladies of the family, distinguishable, as usual, by their flat tops, but as elaborately sculptured as those of the men. The dome is quite plain\non the outside and white. This tomb stands north of the one last described.\n\nTo the east of this tomb and in front of it is an enclosure in the same style, with a magnificently carved mihrab, which is said to contain the remains of the zenana of Nawab Isa Khan; but one of the graves in it bears the date 964 (i.e., 1557 A.D.), which would be about 90 years before the death of the Nawab. The history of this enclosure is uncertain.\n\n3. Tomb of Mirza Tughral Beg.\u2014This is between the last two. Not much is known of Tughral Beg, except that Kalan Kot at one time had the name of Tughralabad, from which we may conjecture that he was a commander of some reputation. His tomb is in rather a ruined condition, but is now preserved from further damage. It is almost entirely of stone. The dome, or canopy, is supported by twelve sculptured stone pillars.\n\n4. Tomb of Diwan Shrofa Khan.\u2014This offers a contrast to the last two white-domed tombs, for its dome is faced on the outside with the finest red bricks, varied with lines of blue-green enamel. Probably the whole was originally enamelled. The whole of the structure is of the same work, except the foundation and plinth. It stands on a platform in a large courtyard. The Diwan, who was an Arghun, held the post of minister to one of the governors of Tatta appointed from Delhi. His tomb is said to have been built in 1638 A.D., during his lifetime.\n\n5. Tomb of Nawab Amir Khalil Khan.\u2014This is said to have been built at some time between 1572 and 1585 A.D. The Amir, of whom little else is known, had such a tender conscience that he left directions that his body should not be buried inside the mausoleum, which was reserved for seven holy men. Their sanctity has unfortunately not preserved it from utter ruin, for it bears a striking and unique inscription in white Arabic letters upon a broad band of large, deep blue tiles. Time has dealt more gently with the humble tomb of sculptured stone in the courtyard in which the body of the Amir is laid.\n\n6. Tomb of Mirza Isa Tarkhan.\u2014This Mirza was the first Tarkhan ruler of lower Sind and his tomb is said to have\nbeen built in 1573 A.D. It stands, with several smaller tombs, in a large square courtyard, within which there are two minor courtyards. All are of stone, sculptured, inscribed and in some places perforated.\n\n7. Tomb of Jam Nizam-ud-din.\u2014This is the oldest of the tombs on the hill which have any clear historical interest, having been built in 1508 A.D. Jam Nizam-ud-din was the last but one of the Sama Jams and an autochthonous ruler, unlike the Mughals and Sayyids who afterwards covered the hill with their memorials. His tomb is a square building, without roof, built entirely of stone, the carving on which, as has already been said, affords strong grounds for inferring that the materials of some ruined Hindu temple have been freely used, omitting, or obliterating, idolatrous emblems. Two contiguous stones in the wall are sometimes of different breadths and contain dissimilar patterns. A staircase through the side wall leads to a narrow balcony and portico decidedly Hindu in their character. Numerous smaller buildings round about, in a more or less ruined condition, exhibit still more distinct traces of Hindu origin. An adjacent tomb, evidently of more recent date, is decorated internally with glazed tiles.\n\n8. To the north of the last and on the other side of a valley is the large and conspicuous tomb of Saiyid Ali Shirazi, built of brick, with a large and two small fluted domes, all plastered and white-washed. There are inscriptions on some of the tombs within the enclosure, but none on the Saiyid's. This venerated man was chosen to carry the offerings of the people of Tatta to the Emperor Humayun at Umarkot (see page 104). He died in A.D. 1572 and his tomb is said to have been built by disciples of the Jokhia tribe.\n\nJama Masjid.\u2014This truly magnificent mosque, which is still in use, is in the town of Tatta. It was, according to the local histories, a gift from the Emperor Shah Jehan in recognition of the hospitality of the town, in which he sought refuge for some time when in rebellion against his father. It was begun in 1644 and finished in 1647, but the floor was not laid till eleven years after. It is said to have cost 9 lakhs of rupees. It is built in the form of a caravanserai, a great court enclosed by a corridor of ninety domed compartments,\nexclusive of the masjid proper in the middle of one side and its counterpart opposite. It measures 315 by 190 feet and covers 6,316 square yards of ground. The exterior is quite plain and white-washed, but the whole interior, from the ground level to the centre of the highest dome, is covered with the most amazing variety of beautiful patterns worked out in coloured tiles. Many of the small domes along the sides are not so covered now, but probably were originally; for the whole edifice was in terrible disrepair when, under Sir Bartle Frere in 1855, it was saved by subscription, Government contributing Rs. 5,000. In 1894 again a sum of Rs. 20,500 was raised by the same means and spent in repairing the denuded faces of the walls with tiles made in Hala and Multan. These do not harmonize well with the old, but happily it was the dado chiefly that needed repair, where the patterns are comparatively simple. Higher up the designs are not printed on square or hexagonal tiles, as they are in the tombs on the Makli hill, but worked out in mosaic with minute tiles of different colours and shapes.\n\nDalqir Masjid.\u2014This was probably in the heart of the town once, but lies quite outside of it now. It is a hopeless ruin, the dome having fallen in and much of the facing of enamelled tiles wholly disappeared, but what remains is so beautiful that measures have been taken to preserve it as far as possible from further destruction. The mihrab is so exquisitely sculptured that it is difficult for the visitor to realize that he is not looking at carved sandalwood but at stone. Yet the building is more than 300 years old, having been built by Amir Khushro Khan, who got into trouble by his handling of public moneys when he was governor of Tatta under Mirza Isa Tarkhan. (See History, Volume A, page 106.)\n\nSamui, the capital of the Sama Jams before they moved to Tatta, lies three miles north-west of the latter, on high ground. Of it the report of the Archaeological Survey says that \"it is now represented by a small hamlet of a few houses clustered upon a mound, with the indispensable Pir's tomb. There is very little of antiquity to be seen above ground save the indications of the foundation of a\nplain brick mosque upon a low knoll upon one side of the village.\"\n\n*Kalan Kot*, which is undoubtedly a perversion of *Kalim Kot*, i.e., the Fort of Welfare, lies about three miles south of the Travellers' Bungalow on the Makli hills. It was used by the Mussalmans, for to it the last of the Tatta Jams retreated when pressed by Akbar's army, and no doubt it was repaired or renewed by them and they re-christened it Tughralabad; but its origin appears to go much further back. As Burton has pointed out, both the words *Kalian Kot* are Sanskrit and the towers are all within bow-shot of each other, indicating that it was planned before firearms were in use. The local tradition which associates it with Alexander suggests points of resemblance to Kafir Killa, or Alexander's Fort, near Sehwan. The massive brick-work of both in a country where stone was so handy is curious, and in *Kalian Kot* large bricks of the kind which characterize Buddhist remains are reported to have been dug up. The ruins now indicate a large and very strong fortress on a rock, which is, or at least was, surrounded on three sides by water and cut through on the fourth side by a very deep moat with perpendicular sides. The whole was guarded by massive towers of great height, which are now only huge mounds, and a curtain connecting them. The ruins of a large building, apparently a mosque, are still standing and show, by some ornamentation of enamelled tiles, that it was comparatively recent. Near it is a great reservoir for water. In the building was found, seventy years ago, a quantity of charred grain, which seemed to indicate that the place had been destroyed by fire.\n\n*Thano Bula Khan* (25\u00b0 22' north latitude; 67\u00b0 52' east longitude) is the headquarter station of Kohistan Mahal and has a population of 1,192. It contains a Mahalkari's Office, Dispensary, Police Station, Vernacular School, Post Office and musafirkhana. The nearest station is Meting, at a distance of 24 miles. Good embroidery work is done and fine woollen pads for camels are made. This place is said to have been a camp of Bula Khan Naumardi when he withstood an invading force of Jokhias in the days of Nur Muhammad Kalhora.\n### TABLE I.\n\n#### AREA AND POPULATION.\n\n| No. |
