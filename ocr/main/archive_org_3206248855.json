There were other counts of the indictment charging the prisoner with feloniously wounding, with intent to do grievous bodily harm.\u2014The learned counsel, in opening the case to the jury, said that the prisoner and the prosecutrix had been married only two months, during which they had lived together in a state of great unhappiness. The money which the prosecutrix had was settled upon her, so that the prisoner could not touch it. The consequence was that she was treated very badly, and at the time when the offence was committed a deed of separation had been drawn up, and was about to be executed. On Dec. 14th the prosecutrix went out shopping with a friend, and upon returning to the house of the latter she found her husband there. Prisoner had some conversation with his wife and endeavoured to induce her to live with him again. This she declined to do, and angry words ensued. The prisoner sprang upon the prosecutrix, threw her down, and stabbed her three times with a penknife, which she had a short time before presented to him. Subsequently she was taken to Guy's hospital, where her wounds were attended to.\u2014The statement of counsel having been corroborated by the evidence, Mr. Grain submitted on behalf of the prisoner that what was done was done in the heat of passion, and that the prisoner had no intention whatever of murdering his wife. He had always borne a good character, and was humane in his disposition. He submitted that there was no evidence upon the major charge, and he urged the jury to deal with the prisoner in regard to the minor offence.\u2014The jury found prisoner \"Guilty of feloniously wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.\"\u2014Mr. Justice Bowen sentenced him to five years' penal servitude.\n\nA TROUBLESOME PRISONER.\u2014Joseph Denny, 30, sailor, pleaded \"Guilty\" to an indictment charging him with stealing, in the dwelling-house of Richard Bolton Jones, the sum of \u00a37, two coats, and other articles.\u2014The prisoner completed a term of seven years' penal servitude on the 10th of last month, and committed the offence in question on the 13th of the same month. While undergoing penal servitude he was 11 times flogged for assaulting warders, and other offences, and was 782 times punished by being placed upon bread-and-water diet.\u2014Sentence postponed.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206248855.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 573, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2429, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
