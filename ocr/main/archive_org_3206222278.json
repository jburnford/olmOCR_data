This temporary stage was formed of the old moveable stage, and was supported on five rows of strong wooden piles with cross beams, which were fastened together by seven-eighth inch bolts. The stage was about sixty feet in length and eleven or twelve feet in height, extending to an old steamer moored in the stream. Shortly before four o'clock a boat arrived from Liverpool with about 200 passengers, who immediately proceeded to land. The collector was stationed in a small box midway between the old steamer and the shore, and here the passengers were densely crowded in order to pay their fares. In an instant, without any previous suspicion of danger on the part of those who had charge of the ferry, the bolts which secured that part of the stage where the collector was stationed gave way, the temporary landing place fell, and the 200 passengers were precipitated upon the sands. For a short time the greatest consternation prevailed lest some of the unfortunate passengers had sustained fatal injuries. Fortunately, however, this was not the case, although several of them were severely shaken and bruised. The most serious accident occurred to police-constable Howe, who had his leg fractured. Mrs. Holden, of Montpelier-terrace, was also injured about the leg, and had to be taken home in a cab. Under considerable excitement a number of spectators hastened to the assistance of the passengers, who were in rather a pitiable plight, lying as they were upon the sands, and being covered with mud. The large open boats in use at the ferry having been brought up, a number of passengers remaining on the steamer were landed, but others, owing to the inconvenience, declined to go on shore, and shortly afterwards returned to Liverpool. After a short time the ordinary traffic was resumed, although some excitement occasioned by the occurrence continued during the evening.\u2014Liverpool Mercury.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206222278.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1154, "total-output-tokens": 489, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2272, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
