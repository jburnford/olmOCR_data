Since the arrest of the prisoner on the afternoon of the 8th inst., the girl has been very ill in the hospital, and unable to give evidence. She was in service at Sutton, Surrey, where her parents resided, and the prisoner, who left the army just before Christmas, was sheltered there by his brother, the father of the girl. An intercepted letter and communication from the mistress of the girl, opened by the eyes of her parents to the intimacy which existed between her and the prisoner. He was ordered out of the house and went to Pimlico, where the girl joined him in a day or two, giving out, when she left home, that she was going to visit her sister. Letters from her found on the prisoner showed that she addressed him in the most endearing terms.\n\nOn the prisoner being placed in the dock, the girl Florence fainted. She was led out of the court soon afterwards in a violently hysterical condition. After a considerable interval, although weak and ill, she was enabled, with her face averted from the dock, to give some evidence. She said that the prisoner wrote her a number of letters. He left Sutton in March. On Friday, the 7th inst., in consequence of a letter from the prisoner, she left her home at Sutton unknown to her parents, and came to Victoria Station. She proceeded to the prisoner's lodgings at Commercial-road, Pimlico, as she had been directed. Prisoner met her, and said that he had found a room for her at a sort of mission-house. He took her to a place\u2014some chambers she did not know. A man in the doorway remarked, \"You have soon come back.\" Prisoner answered, \"Yes, and I have brought my wife with me.\" He did not leave the room she had to occupy during the night. The witness, much agitated, gave some further evidence in support of the more serious aspect of the charge, and, in answer to the magistrate, she said that on the following morning prisoner walked back with her to Commercial-road. They had breakfast together there. She never saw him afterwards till he was in custody.\n\nInspector Campbell suggested that the girl should be asked about a statement which the prisoner made to her. Witness said that on the Friday night she met the prisoner. He told her to tell people that she was his wife and first cousin\u2014an orphan. After some hesitation the prisoner decided to give evidence, which he is entitled to do under the Criminal Law Amendment Act. The result was a material corroboration of the girl's testimony. He said that, as arranged on Good Friday, he sent her his address, but he could not see that this enticed her from Sutton. He asked her to return there, and she refused. In answer to Mr. De Rutzen, he said he took a-room as she had stated. The Magistrate: You don't wish to say any more? No, sir. Or in any way to deny the statements made by your niece as to what took place? My niece told me to say that she was my wife. Mr. De Rutzen committed the prisoner for trial to the Central Criminal Court.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200811564.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 970, "total-output-tokens": 764, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3292, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
