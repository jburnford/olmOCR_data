The evidence showed that when Chandler went on Saturday night to show the prisoner to bed and they were passing through a narrow passage the prisoner struck the porter a heavy blow with a short piece of iron on the back of the head. He then rifled the porter\u2019s pockets, stole his watch, and decamped. Information was at once given to the police, and the prisoner was found in the Fairfield-road. He said that he knocked the porter over near \u201cthe cookhouse.\u201d Medical evidence showed that the injured man would not be able to appear for some time. In reply to questions, the prisoner admitted the offence. It transpired that he had served two terms of penal servitude for seven years, one of two years, and three of 12 months, besides smaller terms, making 22 years. He was further remanded.\n\nHAMPSHIRE.\u2014SERIOUS FATALITY.\u2014A dreadful accident occurred on Wednesday morning at the Portsmouth Town quay, which resulted in the loss of three lives. The old Enchantress, for many years the yacht devoted to the service of the Lords of the Admiralty, having been sold to a firm of shipbuilders, was lying alongside a quay in the Camber, under the tripod shears belonging to the Corporation, to have her boilers removed. Just before noon a boiler, weighing about 15 tons, was being lowered on to the quay when, owing to the extra strain upon the shears, one of the legs snapped near the base, and fell into the water. About 20 men were working close by at the time, and most of them managed to escape before the other legs also collapsed, falling with great force into the quay. Three men, named Tubbs, Williams, and Hubbard, shipwrights, were struck by the falling ironwork, one being killed on the spot, and the other two sustaining injuries to which they succumbed shortly afterwards.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206269588.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 878, "total-output-tokens": 488, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2018, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
