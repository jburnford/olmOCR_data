The Variation of the Compass; containing (a) 1719 Observations to, in, and from, the East Indies, Guinea, West Indies, and Mediterranean, with the Latitudes and Longitudes at the Time of Observation. The Longitude for the most Part reckoned from the Meridian of London; if otherwise, it is taken Notice of in the Margin. By Mr. Robert Douglass. Recommended to the Public by the late Dr. Halley. Communicated by the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal, F. R. S. with a Letter prefixed from William Mountaine, Esq. F. R. S. to Mr. Maskelyne.\n\nTO THE REV. NEVIL MASKELYNE, A. R. F. R. S.\n\nDEAR SIR,\n\nR. June 1, 1775.\n\nMr. Robert Douglass's observations of the variation, taken by himself, and signed by Dr. Halley, I now beg leave to return, with answers to the questions you proposed thereupon; viz. Whether I had ever seen them; or had made any use of them in my former publications? And if so, whether any further notice of them was necessary? In answer to the first; among my papers on the variation I have an exact copy of them, recommended under the same signature, of the same date, and in the same words, and the\n\n(a) Douglass calls these 1719 observations; but these tables, I rather think, should be called the Result of 1719 Observations. W. MOUNTAINE.\nwhole seems written by the same hand; so that both of them (containing 1719 observations each) may be stiled originals: I have sent mine herewith for your inspection. To your second question, I answer, that I could not make any use of them in the construction of either of my charts, as the first was formed from actual observations made about the year 1744, and Douglass's conclude in the year 1735; but as many of them as suited the periodic times were taken in, and compared with many thousands of others, according to the order of their respective dates, in forming the six periodic reviews, as published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. L. part I. for 1757. To the third question; viz. whether they are worth a public record? I rather think they are; and have sometimes thought to present them to the Royal Society for their approbation: for, notwithstanding they have been thus made use of, yet they are mixed and moulded up with others, and those only to every five degrees of latitude and longitude; so that the variations respecting the several latitudes and longitudes do not singly appear. And as the true theory of this arcanum in nature is yet so little known, every thing that serves to illustrate it, deserves attention. And as these tables, for a single set, are extensive, and may be esteemed authentic, they may very well serve for comparatives in future times; for if the change of the variation be regulated by any constant law, which I still continue to doubt, the discovery of that law must greatly depend upon such comparisons made from multitudes of good observations taken\ntaken at different periods, and those over the whole face of the terraqueous globe; but until that law is certainly known, charts can be constructed only from time to time from the latest observations. I am, &c.\n\nW. MOUNTAINE.\n\nP. S. From the differences, times considered, between these identical observations of DOUGLASS, and Dr. HALLLEY's chart in 1700, Mr. CHARLES LEADBETTER attempted, with great labour, to delineate a set of curves for the year 1740, but without success. He seems, by his unfinished work, to have plunged himself into an inextricable labyrinth. I have the manuscript chart and his table of differences now in my custody. His attempt was frustrated by the opinion he possessed of an uniform and regular mutation; and this failure further convinced me of the necessity of proceeding upon other principles.\nOn the outside leaf of each copy is the following testimonial:\n\nMr. ROBERT DOUGLASS having shewn me this curious collection of Observations of the Magneticall Variation, made by himself in most parts of the world, I thought them worth preserving, and as such recommend them to the public, believing they may be of use both to the present and future navigation.\n\nGreenwich,\nAug. 28, 1738.\n\nEDM. HALLEY.\nTo the right honourable the Lords Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland, &c.\n\nMY LORDS,\n\nI HAVE already given in to this honourable board those observations I had to the East Indies, Guinea, and West Indies, but not those I had in a second voyage to the West Indies, nor from England to the Mediterranean. Dr. Halley has perused them, and recommended them to the public. And as nothing of this nature has ever yet appeared, to my knowledge, I hope they may be of use for ships bound to Guinea, West Indies, Mediterranean, and East Indies: and as I think that all things of this nature belong to this honourable board, especially by me who have served as school-master many years in the royal navy; therefore I most humbly dedicate them to your lordships, and am, with all due respect,\n\nYOUR LORDSHIPS\n\nmost humble and most obedient servant,\n\nJan. 30, 1738.\n\nRt. DOUGLASS.\nTHE variation of the compass in a voyage to, in, and from, the East Indies, in the years 1721, 22, 23, and part of 24, from the Island Madeira, on board the Lyon, THOMAS MATHEWS, Esq. Commodore. Likewise the variation to Guinea, from the Isle of Mayo to Cape de Verd, along the Coast to Widah, Island St. Thomas, Cape Lopez; back again to the Coast of Guinea; then to the Island St. Thomas; from thence to Barbados, St. Christophers, Jamaica, Porto Bello, along the Coast to Cartagena; then to Jamaica through the Gulph of Florrida, as far as $35^\\circ 15'$ North, and West longitude from London $61^\\circ 56'$; back again to Antegoa; from thence to England, in the years 1725, 26, and part of 27, on board the Kinsale, RICHARD GIRLINGTON, Esq. Commander. Some more to the West Indies, on board the Lark, JOHN GRAY, Esq. Commander, in the years 1727 and 1728. More from England to the Mediterranean, as far as Leghorn, on board the Dreadnought, ALEXANDER GEDDES, Esq. Commander, in the years 1730 and 31. More in the Mediterranean, as far as Tripoly in Barbary, on board the Hector, the hon. Sir ROGER BUTLER, Commander in the years 1733, 34, and 35.\n\nNote, the first column is the year and day of the month; the second and sixth, the variation; the third and seventh, the number of observations; the fourth, fifth, eighth, and ninth, the latitude and longitude at the time of observation. The longitude for the most part reckoned\nreckoned from the meridian of London; if otherwise, it is taken notice of in the margin. When there are more observations than one, that set down is the mean. When in sight of land, I have set down its bearings and distance in the margin. E. stands for East, and W. for West variation.\n\nWe observed with 3 compasses outward-bound to the East Indies. The master of the ship managed one; the pilot his own; and I had the other, which I kept the whole voyage. We had but 2 homeward-bound; they seldom differed $\\frac{1}{2}$ a degree, and not often that: they were taken with all the exactness possible. I have set down the latitude and longitude of most of the places I went from, and the latitude and longitude I made the place ly in (that I was bound to) by my reckoning.\nThe Variation of the Compass to, in, and from, the East Indies, on board the Lyon, Thomas Mathews, esquire, Commodore.\n\n| Date | Var\u00b0 P.M. | No. of Obs. | Lat. | Long\u00b0 W. | Var\u00b0 A.M. | No. of Obs. | Lat. | Long\u00b0 W. |\n|------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|\n| Mar. 21 | 6 28W | 2 | 29 20N | 18 53W from London | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | Lat. of the W\u00b0 end of Madeira 32 25 N.
