Should any of the Selected Candidates become disqualified, the Secretary of State for India will determine whether the vacancy thus created shall be filled up or not. In the former case, the Candidate next in order of merit, and in other respects duly qualified, shall be deemed to be a Selected Candidate. A Selected Candidate declining to accept the appointment which may be offered to him will be disqualified for any subsequent competition.\n\n9. Selected Candidates, before proceeding to India, will be on probation for two years, during which time they will be examined periodically, with a view of testing their progress in the following subjects:\u2014(h)\n\n| Subjects                                      | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| 1.

The Examination will be conducted on paper and viva voce, as may be deemed necessary. The last of these Examinations will be held at the close of the second year of probation, and will be called the \"Final Examination,\" at which it will be decided whether a Selected Candidate is qualified for the Civil Service of India. At this Examination Candidates will be permitted to take up any one of the following branches of Natural Science, viz.\u2014Botany, Geology, or Zoology, for which 350 marks will be allowed.\n\n10.

The Forms must be returned so as to be received at the Office of the Civil Service Commissioners on or before the 1st of April, 1881. They should be accompanied by evidence on the first four of the points mentioned in Regulation 2, and by a list of the subjects in which the Candidate desires to be examined. (i)\n\nThe Civil Service Commissioners are authorised by the Secretary of State for India in Council to make the following announcements:\u2014\n\n(1.)

(k)\n\n(2.) The Probationers, having passed the necessary Examinations, will be required to report their arrival in India, within such period after their Certificate of Qualification as the Secretary of State may in each case direct.\n\n(3.) The seniority in the Civil Service of India of the Selected Candidates shall be determined according to the Order in which they stand on the list resulting from the Final Examination.\n\n(4.)

All Selected Candidates will be required, after having passed the first periodical Examination, and before receiving the first instalment of their allowance, to attend at the India Office for the purpose of entering into an agreement binding themselves, amongst other things, to refund in certain cases the amount of their allowance in the event of their failing to proceed to India. A surety will be required.\n\n(6.) After passing the Final Examination, each Candidate will be required to attend again at the India Office, with the view of entering into covenants.

Supplement A\n\nJudges of the High Court and (provided that they are Barristers and not Covenanted Civil Servants)\n\nJudges of the Chief Court of the Punjab, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department, the Recorder of Rangoon and First Judges of Small Cause Courts of Presidency Towns ...\n\nNative Civil Servants ...\n\nLaw Officers described in Section 1 of Supplement C, provided that they are not Covenanted Civil Servants ...\n\nBishops ...\n\nChaplains ...\n\nUncovenanted Officers excepting those specified in Section 4 (c)\n\nThe Police at Port Blair ...\n\nThe Bengal Pilot Service ...\n\nMilitary Officers subject to Military Rules ...\n\nOfficers serving under Special Contracts ...\n\nThe Rules which apply to these Officers are contained in\u2014\n\nAppendix CI\n\nTheir contracts.\n\n1. An Officer under contract is not entitled to leave, except in accordance with the terms of his contract. But, if an Officer of the class defined in Clause (c) of Section 4, is, by the terms of his contract of service, entitled to leave under the \"Uncovenanted Service Leave Rules,\" the Rules referred to shall be held to be the Rules in this Code which apply to Uncovenanted Officers.\n\nSection 4. The Rules in this Code apply to the following Officers:\u2014\n\n(a) Covenanted Civil Servants.\n\n(b) Military Officers subject to Civil Rules.\n\n(c) Any Uncovenanted Officer belonging to one of the classes enumerated in Schedule A, and appointed thereto by Her Majesty's Secretary of State or with his particular sanction, or whose name is entered in Schedule B.\n\n(1) The Officers whose names are entered in Schedule B were admitted to the benefits of these Rules from the 3rd January, 1872, being the day on which the despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 451, dated 6th December, 1871, was received. The death, resignation, removal, or retirement of any of these Officers should be promptly reported by the Government Department or Head of Office under whom he is serving, directly to the Government of India in the Financial Department.\n\n(2) The conditions precedent to the entry of the name of an Officer in Schedule B were that\u2014\n\n(1) He was not of purely Asiatic descent.\n\n(2) He held substantively, on the 3rd January, 1872, one of the offices described in Schedule A; and\n\n(3) His salary, on the 16th February, 1876, was not less than six thousand rupees a year.\n\n(3) An Uncovenanted Officer to whom the Rules in this Code are declared applicable, does not forfeit his privilege upon transfer to some office not included in Schedule A, unless such transfer is ordered as a penalty, or because of the Officer's inefficiency.\n\n(4) The Rules in this Code which apply to an Uncovenanted Officer apply to an Officer of the Royal Navy attached to the Marine Survey Department.\nSection 5. Subsidiary Leave of Absence under Chapter VI., Privilege Leave of Absence under Chapter VII., and Examination Leave of Absence under Chapter VIII. of this Code, may be granted to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules, provided that he is not employed in the Military Secretariat of the Governments of India, Madras, or Bombay: no other Leave of Absence may be granted, under the Rules of this Code, to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules. No Leave of Absence can be granted under this Code to a Warrant Officer, excepting under his Section.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGENERAL RULES.\n\nSection 6. The Government of India reserves to itself the full right of modifying the Rules in this Code and its Supplements as may from time to time seem to it expedient, and of interpreting these Rules in case of dispute. In all contracts for service in India to which the Secretary of State is a party, provision is made for the exercise by the Government of these rights.\n\nSection 7. Leave of Absence can never be claimed absolutely, as of right. Nothing in this Code or its Supplements must be understood to limit the free discretion of the Government to refuse or revoke Leave of Absence of any description, at any time, according to the exigencies of the Public Service.\n\n1. If a Local Government, under this Section, refuse Furlough to a Bengal Covenanted Civil Servant, it should report the refusal for the confirmation of the Government of India in the Home Department.\n\nSection 7A. (a) An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave of any kind is entitled to take the balance of his leave, together with any leave of the same kind subsequently earned, as soon as he can be spared from duty.\n\n[Note.\u2014Time occupied in the voyage to India on recall from recognised leave out of India is not included in the balance of leave.]\n\n(b) An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognised leave out of India\u2014\n\n(1) is entitled to free passage to India, and actual personal travelling expenses from the port of embarkation in India to the Station to which he is posted;\n\n(2) and counts as Active Service time spent on his voyage to India and (if he takes the balance of his leave within a year from the date when he can be spared) on his return voyage to Europe.\n\n[Note.\u2014During both voyages Leave Allowances only are granted.]\n\n(c) An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave in India, other than Privilege Leave, is treated as on duty from the date on which he starts for the Station to which he is ordered, and is entitled to his actual personal travelling expenses on his journey to the Station to which he is posted.\n\n(d) An Officer recalled to duty from Privilege Leave is entitled to no concession except that mentioned in Clause (a).\n\nSection 8. If an Officer while absent on Leave during which the amount of his Leave Allowances depends upon the substantive or officiating rank or appointment which he would hold if present on duty, obtains promotion, substantive or officiating, or an increase of Pay or Acting Allowance which involves no change in, or addition to, his duties or responsibilities, the promotion or increase has effect at once. Otherwise the promotion of an absent Officer has effect only from the date of his return to duty.\n\nSection 9. An Officer who is discharged from, or resigns, the Public Service, and is re-employed after an interval, cannot, without the sanction of the Government of India, count his service before discharge towards leave after re-employment.\n\nException.\u2014An Officer discharged from the Indian Navy on its abolition, and subsequently re-employed, may count his Naval Service towards leave after re-employment, notwithstanding the occurrence of a moderate interval between his discharge from the Indian Navy and his first re-employment. Any leave taken by such Officer while in the Indian Navy, will be treated, in calculating the leave due to him under this Rule, as if such leave had been taken under the Rules to which he became subject on re-employment.\n\nSection 10. Service as Private Secretary to the Governor-General or a Governor qualifies, provided that the officer belongs to the Covenanted Civil Service or to the Staff Corps, or belonged (before his appointment as Private Secretary) to the Uncovenanted Service.\n\nSection 13.* If an officer makes over charge of his Office before noon, his leave begins on and includes the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise, it begins on and includes the following day.\n\n1* If the absence of the Officer does not involve the deputation of any Officer from another Station, or any formal transfer of charge in the way of taking over money, or the like, then the local Government may, by special order, permit the Absentee to leave his Station at the close of the last day on which the office is open for business before his leave begins. In such case the several transfers of charge dependent upon the departure of the Absentee shall take effect from the close of the last working day as aforesaid. But the leave of the Absentee and the re-arrangement of allowances, if any, depending upon his departure, shall begin from, and include, the first day thereafter on which the Office is open for business. The actual date of the Officer's departure from his Station must, however, always be reported.\n\nSection 14. No Leave but Privilege Leave may be granted to a Covenanted Civil Servant who has completed thirty-five years' service, or to a Military Officer in Civil Employ whether subject to Civil Rules or to Military Rules, who is more than fifty-five years old. Any Leave other than Privilege Leave granted to a Covenanted Civil Servant before such date ceases to have effect on such date, and any Leave other than Privilege Leave granted in the Civil Department to a Military Officer in Civil Employ before he is fifty-five years old ceases to have effect on his fifty-fifth birthday, on which date he reverts to Military Employ. The Absentee allowances of a Military Officer in Civil Employ on Leave become a Military Charge, and he becomes subject to Military Rules on his fifty-fifth birthday, whether his Leave was granted in the Military or the Civil Department.\n\nSection 15. An Uncovenanted Officer is eligible, after he attains the age of fifty-five years, for Privilege Leave, and also for any Special Leave (Chapter V. of this Code, and Section 6 of Supplement F), to which he may be otherwise entitled, and for no other kind of Leave. Any Leave, other than Privilege Leave or Special Leave, granted to an Uncovenanted Officer before the date on which he attains the age of fifty-five years, ceases to have effect on this date.\n\nSection 16.\u2020 A Local Allowance is given in full to the Officer actually present on duty, and is not taken into account in calculating Leave Allowances or Pension. A Local Allowance may be drawn by an officer absent from his office on duty for a period not exceeding one month, provided that it is not drawn by a locum tenens.\n\n* Applies to all Officers.\n\n\u2020 An Officer who is absent from Duty for more than a month, is not entitled to draw his Local Allowance for any part of such absence.\nSection 17. A Covenanted Civil Servant is not entitled to any special privileges by reason of his being a Barrister, and an Uncovenanted Officer is not entitled to any special privileges by reason of his being a Barrister, unless, on his first admission to the Service, he is appointed to some office in which the Local Government, with the sanction of the Government of India has declared it to be necessary on public grounds to employ a Barrister.\n\nSection 17a. Subject always to the provisions of any Statute applicable to the case, the Local Government may at its discretion grant Leave of Absence from duty otherwise than under the rules of this Code and its Supplements.\n\nProvided that\u2014\n\n(1) Such Leave may not be granted in combination with any leave;\n\n(2) An Officer absent from duty on Leave so granted shall receive no absentee allowance; and\n\n(3) If he is a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, he shall retain no lien upon any office.\n\n[Note.\u2014This Section does not refer to casual leave for short periods. Such Leave is not recognized and is not subject to any Rule. Technically, therefore, an Officer on casual leave is not treated as absent from duty; and his salary is not intermitted.]\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nFURLough.\n\n[Note\u2014The Local Government in the Civil Department may grant Furlough in India under Military Rules to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules who is entitled to furlough under Chapter I. of the Rules published by G.G.O. in Military Department, No. 171, dated 25th February, 1874. Such Furlough should be granted only upon a certificate by the Government in the Military Department of the Presidency to which the Officer belongs, that he is entitled thereto; and a copy of the Order granting the Furlough should be sent to that Government.\n\nA Local Government may not, in the Civil Department, grant Furlough out of India under Military Rules to any Military Officer subject to Military Rules.]\n\nSection 18. The amount of Furlough admissible to a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules and the aggregate amount of Furlough and of Special Leave With Allowances, admissible to an Uncovenanted Officer, is limited to six years. All the Rules in this Code are subject to this limitation.\n\nExplanation.\u2014The following Leave under other Rules is counted as Furlough under this Section.\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014Furlough, and Leave With Allowances on Medical Certificate under former Rules.\n\n(1) Leave of the kind described in Section 2 (h 5) and Junior Furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855, are not counted against an Officer under this Section.\n\nIn the case of a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\u2014Furlough under Rules 1 and 6 of the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014Furlough and Leave With Allowances on Medical Certificate, and Leave on Private Affairs under former Rules, or under the Rules in Supplement F to this Code.\n\nSection 19. The amount of Furlough \"earned\" by an Officer is one-fourth of his Active Service.\n\n1. Leave of the kind described in Section 2 (h 5) counts as Active Service under this Section.\n\nProviso.\u2014Provided that, in making this calculation for an Uncovenanted Officer, only half of the Active Service rendered by him in offices other than those included in Schedule A, shall be taken into account.\n\nI. The whole of the Active Service rendered by the Officer while officiating in any of the offices included in Schedule A is to be taken into account.\n\nSection 20. The amount of Furlough \"due\" to an Officer is the amount which he has earned, diminished by\u2014\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014\n\n(1) The Furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules, except Junior Furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855;\n\n(2) The excess over one year in the amount of Leave with Allowances, on Medical Certificate, which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\nIn the case of a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\u2014\n\n(3) The Furlough which he has enjoyed under the Rules of this Code, or Rules 1 and 6 of the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014\n\n(4) The Furlough, or Special Leave, with Allowances, which he has enjoyed under these or any other Rules;\n\n(5) The Leave on Private Affairs or on Medical Certificates with Allowances, which he has enjoyed under the Rules formerly applicable to him.\n\nProviso.\u2014Provided that if more than two years' Furlough be due to an Uncovenanted Officer when he is first admitted to the benefit of these Rules, the excess shall be cancelled.\n\nSection 21. To an Officer who has rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than two years may be granted, as follows:\n\nOn Medical Certificate,\u2014unconditionally;\n\nWithout Medical Certificate,\u2014subject to these provisos:\u2014(1) That the Furlough be due to him; (2) that he have rendered eight years' Active Service; (3) that the whole number of Officers absent on Furlough and Special Leave do not exceed the limit (if any) appointed by the Government of India.\n\n1. Except on Medical Certificate, or on very Urgent Private Affairs, Furlough or Special Leave may not be granted to a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, in Oudh, the Central Provinces, British Burma, Assam, Ajmir, Mysore and Coorg, and Berar, if one-fifth of all the Officers serving in the same Commission are already absent on Furlough or Special Leave. Elsewhere, it may not be granted, if one-fifth of the whole number of Covenanted Civil Servants or Military Officers subject to Civil Rules serving under the orders of the same Local Government are already absent on Furlough or Special Leave.\n\nSection 22. Furlough granted under Section 21 may, on Medical Certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\nSection 23. To an Officer who has not rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than one year may be granted on Medical Certificate.\n\nSection 24. Furlough granted under Section 23 for less than one year may, on Medical Certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\nSection 25 (a). Subject to his good conduct and efficiency, an Officer on Ordinary Furlough, has a Lien on his substantive appointment, or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay.\n\nExplanation.\u2014Ordinary Furlough includes\u2014\n\n(1) The first two years of each separate period of Furlough under Section 21, including any extension under Section 22;\n\n1. Ordinary Furlough can, under no circumstances extend beyond two years at one time.\n(2) So much of Furlough under Section 23, including any extension under Section 24, as may be due: Provided that the Officer have rendered six months' Continuous Active Service.\n\n(b) On Other Furlough a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, has no Lien; but an Uncovenanted Officer has a Lien.\n\n(3) An Officer on Furlough has no claim to substantive promotion, but there is no objection to such promotion.\n\n(5) An Officer cannot obtain Ordinary Furlough or retain allowances under Section 27, unless he has a substantive appointment. A Military Officer who has no substantive Civil appointment continues subject to Military Rules, and can only get Military Furlough Allowances.\n\nSection 25A. Saving as provided in Section 27, Furlough and Special Leave out of India begin on and include the day of the departure of the vessel in which the Officer sails, and end on and include the day before the arrival of the vessel in which the Officer returns.\n\n1. *An Officer may leave India, or return to India, by any port; but his Furlough or Special Leave begins on the vessel's departure from the port where he first meets it, and ends the day before its arrival at the port where he last quits it.\n\nExample.\u2014The Furlough or Special Leave of an Officer sailing from Calcutta in a vessel which touches at Madras, begins on the departure of the vessel from Calcutta, and not from Madras.\n\n2. *The date of the departure of a vessel in charge of a pilot is the date on which the pilot leaves it at sea; and the date of the arrival of a vessel in charge of a pilot is the date on which the pilot is taken on board.\n\n3. *An Officer serving in Persia or Arabia may leave the country in which he is serving, or return to it, by any port or frontier town except Aden. The date of his departure or return must be certified by the British Consul, or, if there be no British Consul, by the Officer himself.\n\n4. *An Officer taking Furlough or Special Leave out of India must report his embarkation to the Local Government which granted his leave, and his arrival in England, to the Secretary of State.\n\nSection 26. An Officer is not entitled, at the end of Furlough or Special Leave, or Subsidiary Leave affixed thereto, to resume, as a matter of course, without further orders, the particular appointment which he vacated before his Furlough or Special Leave. He should report his return to duty in the manner prescribed in Section 50, Rule 7, and await orders.\n\nSection 27. An Officer on Ordinary Furlough is entitled, subject to the limitations prescribed in Sections 28 and 29 to a Leave Allowance equal to half the Average Salary which he has earned during so much of his Continuous Active Service as is within the three years preceding the day on which he gives up office.\n\nProvided that neither Subsidiary Leave, nor any period during which an Officer has been out of employ in India, otherwise than as a penalty for misconduct, shall be included in Active Service under this Section. Provided also that the Leave Allowances of an Uncovenanted Officer shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes Furlough.\n\nSection 28. The Maximum Leave Allowance of a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, on Ordinary Furlough is, if paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3250 a quarter; if paid in India Rs. 833\u00bd a month. The minimum is, if paid at the Home Treasury, \u00a3125 a quarter; his last salary, whichever is less; if paid in India, Rs. 416\u00bd a month, or his last salary, whichever is less.\n\nSection 29. The Maximum Leave Allowance of an Uncovenanted Officer on Ordinary Furlough is, if paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a quarter, or if paid in India, Rs. 666\u00bd a month. There is no minimum.\n\n1. An Officer on Furlough does not forfeit his past Leave Allowances by resigning the Service without returning to India.\n\nSection 30. An Officer on Furlough other than Ordinary, is entitled, if a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, to Subsistence Allowance; if an Uncovenanted Officer, to \u00a3120 a quarter paid at the Home Treasury, or Rs. 400 a month paid in India, or to one quarter of the Average Salary defined in Section 27, whichever is less.\n\n1. The following are the rates of Monthly Subsistence Allowance for a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\n\nTo an Officer of not more than eight years' actual residence in India.

Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months:\n\nProvided that an Officer who has had Special Leave must render six years' active service before he can again have such Leave.\n\n(1) The corresponding Leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July 1868, is \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this proviso.\n\n(2) An Uncovenanted Officer is not debarred from obtaining Special Leave with allowances under this Chapter by reason of his having had Leave on Private Affairs under the Rules in Supplement F, which is Furlough in another form.\n\nSection 32. An Officer on Special Leave has a lien on his substantive appointment, or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay, as if he were on Ordinary Furlough.\n\nSection 33. For the first six months for which an Officer is on Special Leave, whether the six months be included in the same Leave or not, he is entitled to the Leave Allowance admissible under Sections 27, 28, and 29. Thereafter he is entitled to no Leave Allowance.\n\n* Applies to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules.\n\n\u2020 Applies to all Officers who are subject to the Rules in the Supplements to this Code except Supplement F.\nABSTRACT OF THE CIVIL LEAVE CODE\u2014continued.\n\n(1) The corresponding Leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this Section.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\nSection 34.*\u2014(a) Subsidiary Leave is the time allowed\u2014\n\n(1) To an Officer leaving India, on retiring from the Service, or on Furlough or Special Leave, to break up his domestic establishment and travel to the port of embarkation, and\n\n(2) To an Officer returning to India from Furlough or Special Leave, to travel from the port of debarkation and re-organize his domestic establishment.\n\n(b) The grant to an Officer leaving India\u2014\n\n(1) Of permission to retire from the Service, or\n\n(2) Of Furlough or Special Leave out of India, carries with it the grant of Subsidiary Leave, including, in Case (2), Subsidiary Leave on his return to duty.\n\nSection 35.* The minimum Subsidiary Leave is ten days; otherwise Subsidiary Leave is calculated as Joining Time is calculated (Rule 3, Chapter IX.).\n\nNote.\u2014All the provisions to Rule 3 in Chapter IX. apply equally in the case of Subsidiary Leave.\n\nSection 36.* If an Officer eventually fails to obtain the medical certificate required by Section 51, Rule 8 or 11, he is entitled to Joining Time from the date on which the decision of the Medical Board or Officer is communicated to him, to enable him to return to his appointment. During this Joining Time, his allowances are regulated as if he was on Subsidiary Leave.\n\nSection 37.* An Officer may take Furlough or Special Leave, partly in, and partly out, of India. But Subsidiary Leave is not admissible unless the Furlough or Special Leave begins, or, as the case may be, ends, as Furlough or Special Leave out of India.\n\nProviso.\u2014If an Officer going on Furlough or Special Leave out of India, is prevented by sickness or other urgent and adequate reason not within his own control, such, for example, as the postponement of the departure of the vessel in which his passage is engaged, from embarking within his Subsidiary Leave, the Local Government may order that his Furlough or Special Leave shall begin in India at the end of his Subsidiary Leave, without forfeiture of his Subsidiary Leave.\n\n1. In the absence of such special order, if an Officer remains in India after the end of Subsidiary Leave, his Furlough or Special Leave dates from the beginning of his Subsidiary Leave.\n\n2. An Officer returning to India, without the permission of the authority which granted him Leave, more than fourteen days before the end of his Furlough or Special Leave, is not entitled to Subsidiary Leave, save under the special orders of the Local Government.\n\nSection 38. An Officer on Subsidiary Leave under Section 34 (a), (1), has, or has not, a lien on an appointment according as he has, or has not, such lien on the first day of the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\nNote.\u2014A Military Officer subject to Military Rules does not lose his lien during Subsidiary Leave preparatory to Furlough.\n\nSection 39. An Officer on Subsidiary Leave under Section 34 (a), (2), has, or has not, a lien on an appointment according as he has, or has not, such lien on the day last preceding the Subsidiary Leave.\n\n* Applies to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules.\n\nSection 40. An Officer on Subsidiary Leave is entitled to allowances as follows:\n\n(a) If the Leave be Subsidiary to Special Leave, and the Officer have had leave subsidiary to a former Special Leave: no allowance.\n\n(1) The corresponding Leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is Special Leave within the meaning of this Clause.\n\n(b) If the Leave be subsidiary to Ordinary Furlough or Special Leave:\u2014the allowance admissible under Section 27, but calculated, in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, without the limitations of Maximum or Minimum prescribed by Section 28. The limitations prescribed by Section 29, apply to the allowances of an Uncovenanted Officer on Subsidiary Leave.\n\n(c) If the Leave be Subsidiary to Furlough other than Ordinary, the allowance admissible under Section 30.\n\n(d) If the Officer, under Section 50, have ceased to have a lien on a substantive appointment\u2014as, for example, if a Covenanted Officer has been absent on Extraordinary Leave in extension of Furlough\u2014in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\u2014Subsistence Allowance; and, in the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014no allowance.\n\n1. An Officer may draw allowances as if he were on Privilege Leave for any part of his Subsidiary Leave under Section 34 (a), (1), for which, if he were not retiring from the Service, or going on Furlough or Special Leave, Privilege Leave would be admissible to him. It is to be observed that an Officer who has no lien on an appointment cannot benefit by this Rule see Rule 3 under Section 46).\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n[The Rules in this Chapter apply to Military Officers subject to Military Rules.]\n\nSection 41. The amount of Privilege Leave admissible at one time is limited to three calendar months.\n\nSection 42. The amount of Privilege Leave earned by an Officer is one-eleventh part of the time during which he has been on duty without interruption: Provided that no Privilege Leave can be earned by an Officer by duty done, while three months' such leave is due to him, and that, whenever duty is interrupted, all claim to Privilege Leave earned theretofore is forfeited. Absence on Privilege Leave, or while the Office or Court of an Officer is closed, and he is at liberty to leave his Station, during a regular periodical departmental vacation, though not counting as duty, is not an interruption of duty within the meaning of this Section.\n\n1. The calculation must be made as follows:\u2014One calendar month for every eleven complete calendar months of duty, and one day for every eleven days of the balance.\n\n4. \"Examination Leave\" may, if the Examination for which it is granted be successfully passed, or unless the Officer has already had twelve months' Examination Leave, count as duty qualifying for Privilege Leave. \"Examination Leave\" does not interrupt duty within the meaning of this Section, unless in the case of leave granted under Clauses (c) and (d) of Rule 1 in Chapter VIII., the Officer fails to pass the Examination for which the Leave is granted.\n\nSection 43. The Privilege Leave due to an Officer is the Privilege Leave which he has earned, less the period during which he has been absent on Privilege Leave.\n\n* Applies to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules.\nSection 44. To an Officer who has been on duty, without interruption, for eleven calendar months, and who has not, for six calendar months, been absent on Privilege Leave, or while the Office or Court of an Officer is closed, and he is at liberty to leave his Station during a regular periodical vacation, the whole or any part of the Privilege Leave due to him may be granted.\n\n1. An Officer applying for Privilege Leave must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking Furlough, Special Leave, Subsidiary Leave, Leave on Private Affairs or Leave on Medical Certificate; and, unless his application be for Leave combined with Vacation under Section 44A, that he will not be entitled to any regular periodical departmental vacation for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying for permission to retire or to take such leave within the three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\nSection 44A. Once in three years, Privilege Leave due may be granted in combination with an authorised periodical departmental vacation, provided that vacation and Privilege Leave thus enjoyed together shall in no case exceed three calendar months, and that half allowances only shall be drawn for the period by which the three months, or other term of absence less than three months, exceeds the authorised vacation.\n\nSection 45. An Officer on Privilege Leave has a lien on his substantive appointment; he has also a lien on his officiating appointment, so long as it is not resumed by an Officer having a superior lien on it.\n\nSection 46. An Officer on Privilege Leave is entitled to a Leave Allowance equal to the salary which he would receive if he were on duty in the appointment on which he has a lien.\n\n1. If Privilege Leave is granted to an Officer who holds an appointment sanctioned only for a limited time and for a special purpose, he is not entitled, during Privilege Leave, to any Special Allowance attached to the appointment.\n\n2. An officer on Privilege Leave is entitled to a Leave Allowance equal to his salary, even though another Officer be appointed to act for him.\n\n3. An officer who has no lien on an appointment is entitled, during privilege leave\u2014\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules\u2014to Subsistence Allowance.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer, to no allowance.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nEXAMINATION LEAVE OF ABSENCE.\n\n[The Rules in this Chapter do not apply to Officers employed in the Public Works Department, in the Survey Department under the Surveyor General of India, or in the Forest Department: the Rules in this Chapter apply to Military Officers subject to Military Rules, serving in any other Civil Department.]\n\n(I) (a) A Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, who is a candidate for a reward for proficiency in one of the vernacular languages or Sanskrit, or, by the Higher Standard in Persian, is entitled to Joining Time to and from the place of examination, besides leave for the day or days of examination.\n\n(b) A candidate for a reward for proficiency in Arabic, or for High Proficiency in Persian, may be allowed leave for one month, and, if he passes the examination, for two months.\n\n(c) The maximum Leave for two months authorised by Clause (b) may be prefixed to the examination if the candidate undertakes to spend it in study under professional tuition at a Presidency Town.\n\n(d) An Officer, who, after passing an examination for High Proficiency in Arabic or Persian, is a candidate for the Degree of Honour in either of these Languages may be allowed, instead of the leave for two months provided in Clause (c), leave for three months to Persia for Persian; and to Arabia, Mesopotamia, Egypt or Syria, for Arabic.\n\n(2) An Officer on Leave under Rule 1 has a lien on his appointment, substantive or officiating, and is entitled to Leave Allowances, as if he were on Privilege Leave for an aggregate maximum period of twelve months.\n\n(3) An officer while absent from his Office or from his Station to attend an obligatory Departmental Examination, or (in the Punjab) an examination in Pushfu or Biluchi, is considered to be on duty.\n\n(4) Leave may not be given under Rule 4 to an Officer to prepare for examination, or for recreation after examination. A reasonable time, including the day or days of examination should be allowed for the journey to and from the place of examination, and nothing more.\n\n(5) Leave may not be granted under this Chapter to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules to enable him to pass an examination under the orders of the Government of India in the Military Department, No. 1009, dated 3rd December, 1866.\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJOINING TIME.\n\nThe Rules in this Chapter apply to all Officers.\n\n1.\u2014Joining Time is the time allowed to an Officer to proceed from one Station to another when his appointment is changed, or when, being unemployed, he is appointed to any office. An Officer is held to be on duty during Joining Time, if he is entitled to allowances.\n\n2.\u2014Only one day is allowed for joining an appointment which does not necessarily involve a change of residence.\n\n[Note.\u2014See Proviso VI. to Rule 3.]\n\n3.\u2014Otherwise, Joining Time is calculated as follows, excluding Sundays not actually spent in travelling:\u2014Six days for preparation; and, in addition, thereto\u2014for the portion of the journey which a day for the Officer travels, or might travel,\u2014{ each by Railway ... ... ... 200 miles. by Ocean Steamer ... ... ... 150 \" by River Steamer ... ... ... 80 \" by Mail Cart or other public stage conveyance drawn by horses... ... ... 80 \" In any other way ... ... ... 15 \"\n\n* Or any longer time actually occupied in the journey.\n\n[Note.\u2014An extra day is allowed for any fraction of distance over that prescribed.]\n\nProvisos\u2014\n\ni.\u2014The maximum Joining Time is Thirty Days: the following provisos are all subject to this maximum.\n\n[Note.\u2014If the Local Government is satisfied that an Officer has, through no fault of his own, been unable to avail himself of the usual mode of traveling, it may extend even the maximum Joining Time of Thirty Days. But in that case it should report its proceedings to the Government of India in the Department of Finance, with a full statement of the circumstances of the case.]\n\nii.\u2014When part of the journey is by steamer, the days intervening between the Officer being set free from his office, or, if he has no office, receiving his orders, and the departure of the\nABSTRACT OF THE CIVIL LEAVE CODE\u2014continued.\n\nsteamer, or his start duly regulated to catch the steamer, shall be added to the time calculated under Rule 3.\n\niii.\u2014By whatever route the Officer travels, his Joining Time shall, unless the Local Government specially permit otherwise, be calculated by the route which travellers habitually use.\n\niv.\u2014If the Officer satisfies his new Departmental Superior that, notwithstanding due diligence on his part, the journey has occupied altogether more time than is allowed by the Rules, the time actually occupied may be allowed.\n\nv.\u2014On being satisfied that the Rules have, in any particular case, operated hardly, as for example if an Officer has, through no default on his part, missed a steamer, or fallen sick on the journey, the Local Government may allow concessions in excess of what is admissible by the Rules, on such conditions as to allowances or otherwise as it may think fit. Such concessions must not be made as a mere indulgence or otherwise than because the Rules do not appear to provide reasonably and equitably for the case.\n\nvi.\u2014The Local Government may extend the Joining Time admissible by Rule if it considers such extension necessary for the public convenience, or for the saving of public expense, as, for example, to prevent unnecessary and merely formal transfers.\n\n[Note.\u2014This Proviso applies also to Rule 2.]\n\nvii.\u2014The Accountant General shall bring to the notice of the Local Government any concession made under Proviso iv., which seems to him improper or unreasonable, and shall move the Local Government to report to the Government of India any concession made under Proviso v., or extension made under Proviso vi., which appears to him contrary to the spirit of those Provisos. The Local Government may not, in either case, finally override the Accountant General without a reference to the Governor General in Council.\n\n[Note.\u2014Upon the application of the Local Government, the Government of India will sanction any necessary relaxation or modification of these Rules in exceptional localities, where their general application would operate harshly.]\n\n4. The Joining Time of an Officer whose appointment is changed while he is in transit from one appointment to another, begins on the day following that on which he receives his orders.\n\n12. Except in the case mentioned in Rule 13, an Officer draws during Joining time the pay or salary which he drew in his old appointment or that which he draws in the new, whichever is less; provided that an officer transferred from one officiating appointment to another shall not draw any acting allowance during joining time if he had not a superior lien on either of the officiating appointments to that of the officer relieved by or relieving him.\n\n13. An Unconvenanted Officer who has no substantive appointment is not entitled to any allowance during Joining Time; but, if such an Officer, officiating in an office, is transferred to another office under the same Local Government, the Local Government may allow him to draw during his transit, the allowance to which he would be entitled under Rule 12.\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nEXTENSION AND COMMUTATION OF LEAVE.\n\nSection 47. Except as provided in Section 34, no kind of Leave can be granted in continuation of any other kind; but any Leave granted under the Rules in this Code may be, retrospectively, changed for any other kind or period of Leave which might, at first, have been granted:\n\nProvided that the grant, or extension of Furlough, under this Rule (otherwise than on Medical Certificate), is subject to Proviso (3) under Section 21.\n\n(1) When granting Furlough or Special Leave out of India, a Local Government should always state if there is any objection to its being prolonged or commuted under the Rules, and the Accountant-General should note any reservation of this kind upon the Absentee's Last Pay Certificate. In the absence of such reservation, the Secretary of State will exercise jurisdiction under this Section in the case of an Officer on leave in Europe, without reference to the authorities in India: Provided always that an Officer on Furlough or Special Leave in Europe who wishes to have his Leave extended, must apply to the Secretary of State at least three months before the date on which his leave will expire in India; otherwise, he may be required to pay the cost of a telegram to and from India.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nPAYMENT OF LEAVE ALLOWANCES.\n\n[This Chapter applies to all Officers.]\n\nSection 48. (a) Leave Allowances are payable in India after the end of each Calendar month; but an Officer on Furlough or Special Leave out of India may, at his option, take payment at the Home Treasury of the Government of India.\n\n1. Privilege leave allowances are not payable out of India; but in case an Officer leaving India should afterwards want his leave to be commuted, he should take with him a certificate as follows:\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE CERTIFICATE.\n\n(Name of, and designation of office held by, the Officer.)\n\n1 Government under which employed.\n2 Date of beginning of Leave.\n3 Date on which Leave will end.\n4 Whether Furlough or Special Leave is admissible on Privilege Leave being commuted, and if so, to what extent and on what terms.\n\n(Note.\u2014If Furlough or Special Leave is granted, the Leave Allowances admissible will not be paid out of India until the Officer produces a last Pay Certificate.)\n\n(Signature)\n(Accountant General)\n\nN.B.\u2014Privilege Leave Allowances are not payable out of India.\n\n2. An officer embarking on Furlough or Special Leave must take with him a Last Pay Certificate, whether he intends to draw his allowances in England or not.\n\n(b) If payment be taken at the Home Treasury it is made quarterly, and rupees are converted into sterling at the rate of exchange fixed, for the time being, for financial transactions between the Imperial and the Indian Treasuries.\n\nException. The Absentee Allowance of a Military Officer on Furlough out of India and drawn in England, who elected the Military Furlough Rules of 1868 before the 1st July, 1871, is paid at the rate of two shillings the Government rupee.\n\n1. Payment is made from the Home Treasury as follows:\n\nOn fixed Quarter-Days (namely, March 25th, June 24th, September 29th, and December 24th), a form is supplied on application to the India Office, containing\u2014\n(1) A life-certificate to be filled up in the manner directed on its face.\n\n(2) A Cheque for the amount due (which is specified) for the Officer to fill up, and which may be cashed through any Banker.\n\n2. If in any covenant or contract, dated before the 23rd day of November, 1871, with any Officer for service in India, it is provided that, in payments to be made under, or in pursuance of, the contract, a pound sterling shall be considered an equivalent or equal to, and calculated after the rate of, ten rupees, any leave allowance which the Officer is, under his covenant or contract, entitled to receive in England, shall be converted into sterling at that rate. But if, in such contract, no provision is made for the payment of any allowances during leave, the aforesaid rate of exchange will not apply to any leave allowances.\n\n3. If an Officer receives an advance of pay in England to enable him to return to duty in India, the advance if not earlier liquidated, will be recovered by monthly instalments of one-third of salary, at the rate or rates of exchange fixed for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments for the year in which the advance was made. This Rule will also apply when an advance is made in England to a person appointed there, proceeding to India to join his appointment.\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nRETURN TO DUTY.\n\n[This Chapter applies to all Officers, including Military Officers subject to Military Rules, in respect to Leave of Absence granted in the Civil Department.]\n\nSection 50. An Officer who remains absent after the end of his Leave is entitled to no allowance for the period of such absence, and ceases to have a lien on any appointment,\n\nif his Leave was Furlough,\u2014immediately; and\n\nif it was Special or Privilege Leave,\u2014after a week.\n\n1. An Officer on Furlough or Special Leave in Europe may not return to India, without obtaining the permission of the Secretary of State. He must apply for this permission at least three months before the end of his Leave. An Officer whose furlough was granted or has been extended on medical certificate is required to produce a certificate of fitness before he can be permitted to return to duty. Ordinarily, he must obtain this certificate from the Medical Board of the India Office, but, in special cases, particularly if the officer be residing at a distance of more than sixty miles from London, the Secretary of State will, at his discretion, accept a certificate from two medical practitioners in lieu thereof.\n\n8. An Officer may not, without the permission of the Authority which granted him Leave, return to duty more than fourteen days before the end of Furlough or Special Leave. This permission may be given with such conditions as the Authority granting it may prescribe.\n\n[Note.\u2014This Rule applies to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules; but, he must obtain permission to return to duty from the Local Government.]\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE.\n\nSection 51. Every Application for Leave is to be submitted to the Local Government.\n\n(1)* When a Gazetted Officer applies for Leave, he should quote the Section or Rule of this Code or its Supplements under which he considers himself entitled to the leave.\n\n(13) If the Officer is going on Leave out of India, he should take with him one copy of the Medical Report upon his case.\n\n(14)* A duplicate of the Medical Report upon the case of an Officer going to Europe on Medical Certificate should be forwarded through the Government under which the Officer is employed for the information of the Medical Board, attached to the India Office, so as to arrive as soon as the Officer arrives in England.\n\n(15) If an Applicant for an Extension or Commutation of Leave on Medical Certificate be residing out of India, and within sixty miles from London, he must produce a Certificate from the Medical Board attached to the India Office, showing the necessity for the Extension or Commutation. If he be residing more than sixty miles from London, Certificates must be produced from two Medical Practitioners, and he may be called upon to produce other evidence.\n\nSection 52.

Leave on Private Affairs and Furlough cannot be taken in continuation of any Leave except Subsidiary Leave; but any Leave granted under these Rules may be retrospectively changed for any other kind or amount of Leave which might at first have been granted;* and, if an Officer absent on Privilege Leave, or on Leave on Private Affairs, or on Furlough, take extension of Leave on Medical Certificate, the whole of the absence will be treated as Leave on Medical Certificate.\n\n(1) Extraordinary Leave without allowances cannot be converted retrospectively into Leave on Medical Certificate, but Leave on Medical Certificate may be given in continuation of Extraordinary Leave without allowances.\n\nSection 17. No Officer's appointment becomes vacant, simply by reason of his taking Leave under these Rules. But Absence without Leave, or after the end of Leave (excepting Privilege Leave, in which case a week's grace is allowed) involves loss of appointment; and after five years' continuous absence whether with or without Leave, an Officer is considered to be out of Government employ.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE.\n\nSection 18. (a) Leave may be granted to an Officer by the Authority whose duty it would be to fill up his appointment if vacant. The Local Government may empower Heads of Departments to grant Privilege Leave to Officers under their orders, who are appointed by Government; but if the Officer, to whom Leave is granted, be a gazetted Officer, the grant of Leave must be reported to the Local Government.\n\n* See Rule 6 under Section 52, Civil Pension Code.\nI. Privilege Leave may be granted to the men as under:\n\n2 months after 30 months' consecutive service.\n\nSuch Leave cannot be claimed as a right, and will only be granted when it can be given without inconvenience to the Public Service.\n\nDuring Privilege Leave full pay is admissible.\n\nII. Sick Leave on full pay is granted for fifteen days, after which the men will receive subsistence as under:\n\nConstables Rs. 6 per mensem.\nSergeants 10\nChief Constables 15\nInspectors Two-thirds of salary.\n\nIII. Furlough to unmarried men, or men whose families remain at their homes in India, may be given in turn after five years' Continuous Service in the Settlement.\n\nFurlough may also be given, in special cases, at the discretion of the Superintendent, to married men having their families at the Settlement, after a continuous service of not less than five years.\n\nIV. Such Furlough carries with it half-pay, and may be for periods of from four to six months, according to the distance of the applicant's home from Calcutta.\n\nV. Leave-men proceeding to India should be employed, ordinarily, on the voyage in guarding transferred convicts, and when not required for the purpose they will be granted deck passages at the expense of Government.\n\nVI. From the port of debarkation they will proceed to their homes at their own expense, and on the expiration of their Furlough they will report themselves to the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, with a view to their employment as convict guards on the return voyage. If not required for this purpose, they may be granted a deck passage at the public expense.\n\nVII. The total number of men on Leave at one time from all causes other than Privilege Leave shall not exceed ten per cent. of the Force.\n\nVIII. Absence without Leave is punishable by dismissal or forfeiture of pay.\n\n---\n\nSection 1. For the purposes of these Rules, the pay of the several Grades of the Service shall be taken to be as follows:\n\n| Grade          | Pay per Month |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| Branch Pilot   | Rs. 1,000     |\n| Master Pilot   | Rs. 700       |\n| Mate Pilot     | Rs. 450       |\n\nSection 2. Furlough may be taken to the extent of four years during the entire period of service in the following instalments, viz., after ten years' service two years, and after every subsequent eight years, one year on an allowance of half the average pay for the last three years.\n\nSection 3. Leave on Medical Certificate may be taken to the extent of three years during the whole period of service, but not for more than two years at a time, and not more than twice out of India. Such Leave cannot be taken for more than one year except after three years' Continuous Service immediately preceding. Leave on Medical Certificate cannot be counted as service for Furlough, and no Leave on Medical Certificate can be taken while any Furlough is due. An Officer on Leave under this Section is entitled to half his average salary for the first fifteen months of each period of absence, but not for more than thirty months in all. For the rest of his Leave under this Section he is entitled to a quarter of his average salary. The minimum allowance during Leave on Medical Certificate to the Officer to whom any allowance is due shall be Rs. 100 a month.\n\nSection 4. (a) Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months, provided that an Officer who has had Special Leave must render six years' Active Service before he can again have such Leave.\n\n(b) For the first six months for which an Officer is on Special Leave, whether the six months be included in the same Leave or not, he is entitled to Leave Allowance of half average pay for the last three years.\n\n(c) Thereafter he is entitled to no Leave Allowance.\n\nSection 5. Privilege Leave may be taken either\u2014\n\n(a) As provided for Officers in Chapter VII. of the Civil Leave Code; or\n\n(b) For a period of two months in every twelve, on half pay (which can be accumulated) on a Medical Certificate showing that the applicant requires, through sickness, more leave than he could take under the ordinary Privilege Leave Rules in the Code. When such Leave is taken in extension of ordinary Privilege Leave, the period of ordinary Privilege Leave first taken under Clause (a) must be commuted to double the period on half pay under Clause (b). Leave taken under this Clause shall be reckoned as Active Service. Provided that if Leave taken under this Clause be extended under Medical Certificate, the whole of the Leave shall be treated as Leave on Medical Certificate under Section 3.\n\nSection 6. Four Branch Pilots who were in the service of the Government on the 10th January, 1879, are subject to the Rules which regulated the Leave and Allowances of Pilots before that date.\n\nNote.\u2014A Pilot subject to the Rules in force before the 10th January, 1879, is, if promoted to a higher rank while on Leave in England, entitled to the furlough pay of such higher rank from the date of promotion.\nEXTRACTS FROM THE CIVIL PENSION CODE, SHOWING THE CHIEF RULES APPLICABLE TO UNCOVENANTED SERVANTS IN THE SUPERIOR DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT IN INDIA, TOGETHER WITH AN ABSTRACT OF ITS VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS.\n\nSection 3. The Rules in this Code and its Supplements apply to all Public Officers, excepting Officers and men in the Army or the Navy (including Covenanted Medical Officers), and Officers of the Subordinate Medical Department. The Rules in Chapter VII, however, apply to the officers thus excepted.\n\nSection 4. The Rules in the body of this Code do not apply to the undermentioned Officers, whose pensions are regulated by the special Rules contained in the Supplements.\n\nCovenanted Civil Servants (Supplement A).\nJudges of the High Courts of Judicature (Supplement B).\nChaplains (Supplement C).\nMembers of the Bengal Pilot Service (Supplement D).\n\nSection 6.\u2014The Government reserves to itself the right of changing the Rules in this Code from time to time at its discretion and of interpreting their meaning. An Officer's claim to pension is governed by the Rules in force at the time when he resigns or is discharged from the service of Government; he is not entitled to concessions withdrawn before, or made after, his resignation or discharge. The general purport of this Rule is inserted by the Secretary of State in all covenants for service in India to which he is a party, which contain a promise of pension under the Uncovenanted Service Pension Rules.\n\nSection 7.\u2014Pension may not be granted to an Officer whom it is desired to remove for misconduct or inefficiency.\n\nSection 8.\u2014An Officer may be admitted to pension while absent on leave whether in or out of India.\n\nSection 9.\u2014A pension (except a pension granted under Section 74) is fixed in rupees and not in sterling money, even though it is to be paid in England.\n\nSection 12. An officer cannot earn two pensions in the same office at the same time, or by the same continuous service.\n\nSection 13.\u2014Two Officers may not simultaneously count service in one office.\n\nSection 17. Service under a covenant which contains no stipulation regarding pension does not qualify, unless the Government of India specially authorises an Officer to count such service.\n\nSection 19. Service as an Apprentice (excepting at the Central Forest School, in continuation of qualifying service, or as an Engineer Apprentice in the Public Works Department) or, in the Bengal Presidency, as a Supernumerary Assistant Surgeon does not qualify.\n\nSection 20. Except for Compensation Gratuity, superior service by an Officer whose age is less than twenty-two years does not qualify. But Officers described in Schedule A, excepting Class III, (2) (b), and all Officers appointed in England by the Secretary of State for service in India, are exempt from this disability.\n\nSection 21. (a) If an Officer of Class I in Schedule A lands in India on or before the 1st of December of the year in which he passes out of College, his service counts from the preceding 1st of October unless another date should be specified in his letter of appointment.\n\n(b) If an Officer of Class I, is, after completing his three years residence at College, required to go through a course of practical engineering in England under a civil or mechanical engineer, his service, unless another date should be specified in his letter of appointment, will reckon from the commencement of the practical course, or from such later date as will be consistent with the regulation that he may count as service towards pension the time spent on such practical course to the extent of one year only.\n\n(c) The service of an Officer of Class I, whose case is not provided for in (b), and who does not land in India by the said 1st of December, and that of an Officer of Class II. or III. (1) counts from the date on which he landed in India.\n\nSection 27. Service does not qualify unless the Officer holds a substantive office on a permanent establishment.\n\n2. An Officer officiating in an office which is vacant, or the permanent incumbent of which does not draw any part of the pay or count service, may, if he is confirmed without interruption in his service, count his officiating service.\n\n3. The service of a Probationer who holds a substantive office and draws substantive pay, qualifies. So does that of an Officer who is on probation for a substantive office, if he is employed in a vacancy reserved for him, pending probation, and in which no other Officer simultaneously counts service.\n\nSection 52. An Officer belonging to any of the Classes described in Schedule A, except Class III. (2) counts Furlough as service as follows:\n\n| If the service of the Officer | He counts as service |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| be not less than            | furlough for        |\n| 20 years                    | 2 years             |\n| 25 \"                         | 3 \"                 |\n| 30 \"                         | 4 \"                 |\n| 35 \"                         | 5 \"                 |\n\nSection 52a. Otherwise time passed on Leave other than Privilege or Subsidiary Leave does not count as Superior Service. Time passed on Leave subsidiary to Leave on Medical Certificate by an Officer who has twice before had Leave on Medical Certificate out of India does not count.\n\nSection 55. An interruption in the service of an Officer entails forfeiture of his past service, except in the following cases:\n\n(a) Authorised Leave of Absence.\n\n(b) Unauthorised absence in continuation of authorised leave of absence, so long as the office of the Absentee is not substantively filled; if his office is substantively filled, the past service of the Absentee is forfeited.\n\nProvided that, if the Absentee is subsequently reinstated, the Authority whose duty it is to make the appointment, within three months, or, the Local Government, within one year, from the end of the authorised leave of absence, may declare, in an order to be communicated to the Accountant-General, that his previous service, or any part of it, shall not be forfeited.\n\n(c) Suspension immediately followed by re-instatement, which need not be to the same office.\n\n(d) Abolition of Office.\n\n(e) Transfer to non-qualifying service in an establishment under Government control. The transfer must be made by Competent Authority; an Officer who voluntarily resigns Qualifying Service, cannot claim the benefit of this exception. Transfer to a Grant-in-aid school entails forfeiture.\n\n(f) Transfer to service on the Household Establishment of the Viceroy.\n\n(g) Loss of appointment owing to the Mutiny, provided that the Officer affected cleared his character and was re-appointed as soon as a suitable vacancy was found for him.\n\n(h) Transit from one appointment to another, provided that the Officer is transferred under the orders of Competent Authority, or, if he is a Ministerial Officer, with the consent of the Head of his old office.\nSection 56. Resignation of the Public Service, or removal from it for misconduct, inefficiency, or failure to pass a prescribed examination, entails forfeiture of past service.\n\n1. Resignation of an appointment to take up another appointment service in which counts, is not held to be a resignation of the Public Service.\n\n2. Any authority who, on revision or appeal, reverses an order dismissing an Officer, may declare that the past service of the reinstated Officer counts.\n\n3. An Officer who resigned the Public Service, before the 8th June, 1863, if he was a Superior Servant, or before 1st September 1871 if he was an Inferior Servant, and was re-appointed to the Public Service within twelve months from his resignation, counts his service rendered before resignation. This Rule can be applied to only one resignation.\n\nSection 57. Upon such conditions as it may think fit, in each case, to impose:\n\n(a) The Government of India may condone all interruptions in service not exceeding twelve months in all; and the Local Government may condone all interruptions not exceeding three months in all.\n\n(b) If the proposed pension does not exceed fifty rupees a month, the Government of India may condone interruptions in service, whatever their duration; and the Local Government may exercise the same power if the pension is a provincial charge; otherwise it may condone interruptions not exceeding twelve months in all.\n\nSection 58. Pensions are of four classes:\n\nCompensation Pensions.\n\nInvalid Pensions.\n\nSuperannuation Pensions.\n\nRetiring Pensions.\n\n(1) A Gratuity is paid in a single sum, and not by instalments.\n\n(2) A Gratuity is intended to be less valuable than a pension, and should not be awarded if it is likely to impose upon the State a higher charge than would arise from a pension.\n\nSection 59. A Compensation Pension is awarded to an Officer discharged from the Public Service, because on a reduction of Establishment his appointment is abolished.\n\nSection 61. An Invalid Pension is awarded on his retirement from the Public Service to an Officer who, by bodily or mental infirmity, is permanently incapacitated\u2014\n\n(a) For the Public Service, or\n\n(b) For the particular branch of it to which he belongs.\n\nSection 62. If the Officer applying for pension is sixty years old or upwards, no Certificate by a Medical Officer is necessary; it suffices for the Head of the office to certify to the incapacity of the applicant. Otherwise incapacity for service must be established by a Medical Certificate.\n\nSection 64. If the incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits, no pension can be granted. Otherwise, it is for the Local Government to decide whether the Officer's incapacity is such as to render it necessary to admit him to Invalid Pension.\n\n1. An Officer who has submitted a Medical Certificate of incapacity for further service, must not (except for special reasons to be reported to the Local Government) be retained in active service pending a decision on his application for pension, nor can he obtain leave of absence. Without the further special sanction of the Local Government, service after the date of a Medical Certificate does not count for pension. The object of this Rule is to discourage tentative applications; but an Inferior Servant, or a Police Officer whose pay does not exceed twenty rupees, and who, in the opinion of the Head of his Office, is fit for light work, may be retained in employment till his pension is sanctioned, provided that his place is not filled up till he retires, and that his service counts only to the date of his Medical Certificate.\n\nSection 65. A Superannuation Pension is granted to an Officer entitled or compelled, by Rule, to retire at a particular age.\n\n1. An Officer in a Superior Grade who has attained to the age of fifty-five years may be required to retire, unless the Local Government considers him efficient, and permits him to remain in the Service. But, as the premature retirement of an efficient Officer imposes a needless charge on the State, this Rule should be worked with discretion.\n\nSection 66. A Retiring Pension is granted to an Officer who voluntarily retires after completing the requisite period of service.\n\nSection 67. The amount of Pension that may be granted is determined by length of service, as set forth in Sections 68, 69, 70, and 71.\n\n(1) An Officer entitled to Pension may not take a Gratuity instead of Pension.\n\nSection 68. Compensation and Invalid Pension may be granted for Superior Qualifying Service as follows:\n\n(a) After a service of less than fifteen years:\u2014\n\nA Gratuity not exceeding (except in special cases and under the orders of the Government of India) One Month's Emoluments for each completed year of service or twelve months' Emoluments in all. If the Emoluments of the Officer have been reduced during the last five years of his service, otherwise than as a penalty, Average Emoluments may, at the discretion of the Local Government, be substituted for Emoluments.\n\n(b) After a service of not less than fifteen years, but less than twenty-five years:\u2014\n\nA Pension not exceeding one-third of Average Emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 3,000 a year, or, if the Average Emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 2,000 a year.\n\n(c) After a service of not less than twenty-five years:\u2014\n\nA Pension not exceeding one-half of Average Emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year, or, if the Average Emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 4,000 a year.\n\n[Note.\u2014The Proviso under Section 70 applies to an Officer invalided on account of incapacity for further service, which incapacity is due to old age or natural decay from advancing years. In the case of an Officer whose Qualifying Service began after he attained the age of twenty-five years, the attention of the Examining Medical Officer should always be called to that Proviso, in order that he may adapt his Certificate accordingly.]\n\nSection 69. An Invalid Pension on the following Scale, but not being less than Rs. 1,000 or more than Rs. 2,000 a year, may be granted to an Officer belonging to any of Classes described in Schedule A, except Class III. The Government of India may, on special grounds, recommend for sanction by the Secretary of State the grant of an Invalid Pension on the same scale to an Officer belonging to Class III., provided that if he was not appointed by the Secretary of State, he be not of purely Asiatic descent.\n\nIf the qualifying service of the officer be not less than\u2014\n\n| Years | Officer's average emoluments |\n|-------|-----------------------------|\n| 10    | 10                          |\n| 11    | 11                          |\n| 12    | 12                          |\n| 13    | 13                          |\n| 14    | 14                          |\n\nSection 70. The amount of Superannuation Pension which may be granted for Superior Qualifying Service is that which would be admissible as an Invalid Pension.\n\nProviso.\u2014If an Officer's Qualifying Service began after the 20th January, 1871, and after he attained the age of 25 years, the pension admissible under this Section is to be multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 30 or, for Officers entitled to the benefit of Section 73 (c), 27, and the numerator the number of years' service completed, not exceeding 30. The limit of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000, or Rs. 5,000 is to be applied before, and not after, this multiplication.\nSection 71. Retiring Pension may be granted for Superior Qualifying Service as follows:\n\nAfter a service of not less than thirty years:\nThe same in amount as an Invalid Pension admissible after twenty-five years' service.\n\nSection 72. In the following cases the several prescribed maximum limits of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000, and Rs. 5,000 a year may be relaxed.\n\n(a) For an Officer whose Average Emoluments exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, or whose salary before the 6th August, 1862, exceeded Rs. 10,000 a year, the maximum pension is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year. But if the service of such an Officer has been of extraordinary merit, a pension exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year may be recommended for the sanction of the Secretary of State.\n\n(b) To an Officer who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, but whose Average Emoluments do not exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Government of India, sometimes grants a Special Pension in excess of the prescribed maximum, for unusually meritorious services.\n\n(c) For a Native Judge who was in the service on the 29th October, 1866, the limit is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year.\n\n(d) These limits do not apply to a Covenanted Civil Engineer or Civil Officer of the Telegraph Department who executed his Covenant before the 8th June, 1863, and who has elected the Rules which were in force before that date. There is no maximum money limit to the pension of such an Officer, whose covenant is dated before the 19th May 1855; if his covenant is dated after the 19th May, 1855, the pension is limited to \u00a3400 a year, if his pay is not less than Rs. 700 and not more than Rs. 1,000; and to \u00a3500 a year, if his pay exceeds Rs. 1,000.\n\n[Note.\u2014The limits which may be relaxed under the foregoing Rules are the maximum money limits, and not the limits of one-third or one-half Average Emoluments.]\n\nSection 73. In the following cases, certain privileges exist in respect of the length of service required for pension\u2014\n\n(a) To an Officer, not being a native of Asia, whose qualifying service began after twenty-five years of age, and whose whole service for which pension is claimed has been passed in one or other of the following offices, pension is admissible after three years' less service than is required from other Officers:\u2014\n\nDirectors of Public Instruction.\nInspectors of Schools.\nPrincipals and Professors of Colleges.\nHead-masters of Colleges and High Schools.\nBarristers serving in Offices other than those mentioned in Section 74 to which the Local Government has, with the consent of the Government of India, declared it to be necessary to appoint Barristers.\n\n[Note.\u2014The only office concerning which this declaration has been made is that of Deputy Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, Bengal.]\n\nSection 74. To the following officers, being Barristers and not being Covenanted Civil Servants, viz.:\n\nJudges of the Chief Court of the Punjab;\nFirst Judges of Small Cause Courts of Presidency town;\nRecorder of Rangoon;\nSecretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department.\n\nSpecial Pensions are admissible as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) After not less than six years and nine months' Active Service in one or other of the Offices specified in this Section,\u2014an Invalid Pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\n(b) After not less than eight years and eight months' such service,\u2014an Invalid Pension of \u00a3500 a year.\n\n(c) After not less than eleven years and six months' such service,\u2014a Retiring Pension of \u00a3750 a year.\n\n1. Active Service here includes, besides time spent on duty, whether in substantive or acting service, Privilege Leave, Subsidiary Leave, and periods of vacation during which the Officer is not on Furlough or Extraordinary Leave.\n\n2. Except as provided by this Section, these Officers come under the ordinary Rules.\n\nSection 79. (a) Unless there be something repugnant in the subject or context, the words \"Pay\" and \"Emoluments\" mean the pay and emoluments which the Officer was receiving immediately before his retirement.\n\n(b) \"Average Emoluments\" means the average calculated upon the last five years of service.\n\nSection 80. (a) In the term \"Emoluments\" are included the following:\u2014\n\n(1) Pay; (2) Personal Allowance; (3) Fees or Commission, if they are the authorised emoluments of an appointment, and are in addition to Pay, and Commission in the case of a Thuggee; (4) Charge Allowances to Signallers in the Telegraph Department; (5) Bullock Train and Punjab Military Horse Van, Dak Allowances in the Post Office Department; (6) Allowances attached to a Minor Professorship in a Medical College under the Medical Warrant of 1867; (7) Allowances attached to a Professorship or Lectureship in a Government Institution.\n\n(b) Other Allowances are excluded.\n\n(c) Acting Allowances and allowances drawn by an Officer appointed substantively pro tempore may not be included unless the pro tempore or acting service counts under Section 13 or Section 27, Rule 2, as the case may be.\n\nSection 95. A pension is payable in India monthly on the first day of the following month.\n\n(5) At the Home Treasury pensions are paid quarterly.\n\nSection 99. A pension is payable as follows:\u2014\n\nI. If it is stated in Rupees\u2014\n\n(a) At any Treasury of the Government of India in India; or,\n\n(b) If the Pensioner is resident elsewhere than in Asia, at his option at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments.\n\nII.

The Rule for the payment at the Home Treasury of a pension at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments, applies to an Officer under covenant, who is entitled by his covenant to pension in accordance with the Rules applicable to Un-covenanted Officers; the covenanted rate of exchange for his pay and allowances does not, unless it is expressly so stated, apply to his pension.\n\nSection 100. Transfer of a Pension from the Home to an Indian Treasury is permitted whenever desired; but transfer of a Pension from an Indian to the Home Treasury is permitted only once.\nSCHEDULE A.\n\nOfficers who are entitled to certain special privileges.\n\n[See Sections 20, 21, 52, and 69.]\n\nI.

The promotion of Officers while on probation will go on in their respective regiments. Officers of the British Army, when permanently transferred to the Staff Corps, will be removed from the strength of the regiment to which they belonged. It is discretional with the Governments in India to employ the Officers of the Staff Corps, in such manner as they may think best, in the situations for which their respective qualifications may render them most fitted. The appointments and promotions in the several departments rest with the Governments in India, and will be made irrespectively of the rank which the Officers may hold in the Staff Corps.\n\nOfficers of British regiments which may be ordered home and embark before the completion of their period of probation may, with the sanction of the Government of the Presidency, be allowed to remain in India to complete that period.\n\nOfficers of Her Majesty's British Regiments are eligible for appointment to the Staff Corps of any Presidency, without reference to the Presidency in which their regiments may be serving, and they will be permitted to serve out their probation without reference to their regiments being in the meantime moved to another Presidency.\n\nApplication for admission to the Staff Corps, on probation, should be made to the Government, through, and with the sanction of, the Commander-in-Chief of the Presidency, and that of the Commander-in-Chief in India.\n\nA candidate for appointment to the Staff Corps, on probation, must produce the following certificates of his Commanding Officer and the Surgeon:\n\n**Certificate of Commanding Officer.**\n\nCertified that\n\nof the regiment\n\na candidate for the Staff Corps, has on this date completed years' service from the date of his first commission, of which years (or the whole period of which, as the case may be), was spent in India.\n\nhas passed the examination in the Native languages by the higher (or lower) standard, and has attained such a knowledge of his drill and duty as an officer of infantry (or cavalry) in all its branches as to qualify him for the command of a company (or troop) in all situations. He also possesses a fair knowledge of the Articles of War and of the Queen's Regulations, as well as of the Military Regulations of the Bengal (Madras or Bombay) Presidency, besides having gained some general acquaintance with the organization and nature of the duties of all branches of the army serving in Bengal (Madras or Bombay).\n\nI further certify that during the period he has been attentive to his duty, and that his conduct has been in all respects unexceptionable.\n\nStation and date.\n\nCommanding Regiment.\n\n**Surgeon's Certificate.**\n\nI certify that, to the best of my belief, is in good bodily health, and apparently well capable of undergoing the vicissitudes of service in India.\n\nStation and date.\n\nSurgeon Regiment.\n\nThe date of transfer of an Officer to the Staff Corps will be that of his appointment on probation, except in the case of an Officer who has gained promotion in his regiment during his period of probation; in that case, he is allowed to enter the Staff Corps from the day following his promotion, with the rank then gained.\n\nExcept under very special circumstances, the period of probation will be limited to one year,\u2020 at the end of which the candidate, if not qualified for admission to the Staff Corps, must be remanded to his regiment; and should his regiment be in England, he will be put on British pay from the date of failing to pass the final examination. If possible, he will be provided with a passage in a troop ship, but if none be available, then the actual expense of the passage, and no more, will be paid to the agent of the vessel conveying the Officer to England. In no case will the period of probation exceed a second twelve months.\n\n* See page lvii.\n\u2020 All leave, except privilege leave and leave to pass in the Native languages for admission to the Staff Corps will be excluded from the year's probation.\nA British Officer, on probation for the Staff Corps, proceeding on leave to Europe, is to be held to have resigned his probationary position and appointment. Should an Officer so circumstanced be placed on the half-pay list, he will cease to be considered as a probationer.\n\nA probationer for the Staff Corps may at any time be allowed to withdraw his application, provided that he has not been actually admitted to that Corps by the Government in India.\n\nAs a general rule, a young Officer, on becoming a probationer, is appointed to do duty with a Native regiment.\n\nOn the completion of the year's probation, the candidate must produce certificates from his Commanding Officer (or the Officer under whom he has served) and from the Surgeon, similar to those obtained at the commencement of his probation; and he must pass an examination in the following tests, according to the nature of the duty or department in which he is to be employed.\n\nOn special grounds, but only when required for the convenience of the public service, examinations may be held at any time within two months of the expiration of the probationary year.\n\nShould he be found qualified, he will be admitted to the Staff Corps, and to the appointment or department for which he has proved his fitness. The circumstance of an Officer being in the Staff Corps will not exempt him from passing departmental tests, should he be transferred from one appointment or department to another.\n\nOfficers of Line Regiments, in which the purchase system was in force up to the 31st October, 1871, who entered the service prior to the 26th August, 1871, and whose permanent appointment to the Indian Staff Corps shall appear in the General Orders of one of the Local Governments of India, on a date subsequent to the 18th March, 1868, and who, on the date of such permanent appointment (being the date of appointment as probationers for the Staff Corps), shall not have exceeded four years' service on full pay, from the date of first Commission, shall receive, on their names appearing in the \"London Gazette\" as finally transferred to the Staff Corps, the exact sum such Officers would have received, under War Office Regulations, had they retired from the service by the sale of their Commissions at the time of Joining the Staff Corps as probationers.\n\nOfficers who have been appointed probationers subsequent to the 31st October, 1871, will be required to make and sign the declaration laid down in para. \"C,\" clause 139, sec. 4 of the Queen's Regulations.\n\nThe young Officers who, on final transfer to the Staff Corps, may receive the value of their commissions, will, if appointed probationers on or after the 1st of July, 1870, be debited with the cost of their successors' passage to India, in the same manner as other Officers who are allowed to retire from British Regiments in India with the value of their commissions.\n\nOfficers who are entitled to the value of their first commissions should apply for it to the agents of the regiment to which they formerly belonged.\n\nOfficers who desire to enter the Staff Corps under the provisions of the General Order from the Horse Guards, dated the 1st of May, 1868, must make their applications in such time as will admit of the requisite forms being complied with before the completion of their four years' service, as the Government cannot be responsible for any accidental delay, and applications for special consideration will not be received hereafter.\n\nOfficers joining the Staff Corps from the British Army must furnish a statement of their services duly vouched by their late Commanding Officers, showing in detail their actual service in India, and the periods of leave during such service, completed to the date of their transfer to the Staff Corps.\n\nNo Officers while away from their regiments as probationers for the Indian Staff Corps shall be permitted to retire from the service by the sale of their commissions, but such officers will still be eligible for such promotion in their regiments as may occur whilst they are probationers by or without purchase.\n\nThe claims to pension of widows and families of officers of the Staff Corps who may join from the British Army will be treated under the provisions of the Royal Warrant of the 27th December, 1870, or of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British officers as may be in force at the time being.\n\n---\n\n**TABLE OF SALARIES ALLOWED FOR STAFF OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS OF THE SEVERAL PRESIDENCIES IN INDIA.**\n\n| Military Secretariats | Rupees

A supernumerary General Officer promoted for distinguished service in the field, and absorbed under Art. 12, shall take his seniority from the date of his promotion as published in the London Gazette.\n\n14. Field Marshals shall be appointed at the will of the Sovereign, and the rank shall be conferred without reference to seniority.

They must possess a diploma in surgery or a license to practise it, as well as a degree in medicine, or a license to practise it in Great Britain or Ireland.\n\n2. They must subscribe and send in to the Military Secretary, India Office, Westminster, so as to reach that address at least a fortnight before the date fixed for the Examination, a declaration according to the annexed form.\n\n3. This declaration must be accompanied by the following documents:\n\n(a) Proof of age either by extract from the register of the parish in which the candidate was born, or where such extract is unattainable by his own declaration (pursuant to the Act 5 and 6 Will. 4, c. 62), form of which can be obtained at the India Office. (A certificate of baptism which does not afford proof of age will be useless.)\n\n(b) A certificate of moral character from a magistrate, or a minister of the religious denomination to which the candidate belongs, who has personally known him for at least two preceding years.\n(c) A certificate of registration in accordance with the Medical Act of 1858, of the degrees, diplomas, and licenses possessed by the candidate.\n\n4. The physical fitness of candidates will be determined previous to examination by a Board of Medical Officers, who are required to certify that the candidate's vision is sufficiently good to enable him to perform any surgical operation without the aid of glasses. A moderate degree of myopia would not be considered a disqualification, provided it did not necessitate the use of glasses during the performance of operations, and that no organic disease of the eyes existed. Every candidate must also be free from organic disease of other organs, and from constitutional weakness, or other disability likely to unfit him for military service in India.\n\n3. On producing the foregoing qualifications, the candidate will be examined by the Examining Board in the following compulsory subjects, and the highest number of marks attainable will be distributed as follows:\n\n- **Marks**\n  - Anatomy and Physiology: 1,000\n  - Surgery: 1,000\n  - Medicine, including Therapeutics, the Diseases of women and children: 1,000\n  - Chemistry and Pharmacy, and a practical knowledge of Drugs: 100\n\n(The examination in medicine and surgery will be in part practical, and will include operations on the head body, the application of surgical apparatus, and the examination of medical and surgical patients at the bedside.)\n\n6.

Candidates, who desire it, will be examined in French, German, and Hindustani, Comparative Anatomy, Zoology, Natural Philosophy, Physical Geography, and Botany, with special reference to Materia Medica.\n\n8. The number of marks gained in these subjects will be added to the total number of marks obtained in the obligatory part of the examination by candidates who shall have been found qualified for admission, and whose position on the list of successful competitors will thus be improved in proportion to their knowledge of modern languages and natural sciences.\n\n9. The maximum number of marks allotted to the voluntary subjects will be as follows:\n\n| Subjects                          | Marks |\n|----------------------------------|-------|\n| French, German, and Hindustani   | 450   |\n| Natural Science                  | 300   |\n\n10. The subjects for this part of the examination will be taken from the following books:\n\n- \"Animal Kingdom,\" by W. S.

Brooks, \"Physical Geography,\" by Mrs. Somerville.\n\n11. The Examiners in London will prepare a list in order of merit, with the marks affixed in the different subjects, to be transmitted to the Director-General and communicated to the Professors of the Army Medical School. If any Candidate is found to be deficient in any particular subject, this shall be stated, in order that he may receive special instruction on the point at Netley.\n\n12. After passing his preliminary examination, candidates will be required to attend one entire course of practical instruction at the Army Medical School, before being admitted to examination for a commission, on\u2014\n\n(1) Hygiene.\n(2) Clinical and Military Medicine.\n(3) Clinical and Military Surgery.\n(4) Pathology of Diseases and Injuries incident to Military Service.\n\nThese courses are to be of not less than four months' duration; but candidates who have already gone through a course at Netley as candidates for the Army or Navy Medical Service may, if thought desirable, be exempted from attending the school a second time.\n\n13. During the period of his residence at the Army Medical School, each candidate will receive an allowance of 8s. per diem, with quarters, or when quarters are not provided, with the usual lodging and fuel and light allowances of subalterns, to cover all costs of maintenance; and he will be required to provide himself with uniform (viz., the regulation undress uniform of a Surgeon of the British service, but without the sword).\n\n14. All candidates will be required to conform to such rules of discipline as the Senate may, from time to time, enact.\n\n15. At the conclusion of the course, candidates will be required to pass an examination on the subjects taught in the school. The examination will be conducted by the professors of the school.\n\nThe Director-General, or any medical officer deputed by him, may be present and take part in the examination. If the candidate gives satisfactory evidence of being qualified for the practical duties of an Army Medical Officer, he will be eligible for a commission as Surgeon.\n\n16. The position of the candidates on the list of Surgeons will be determined by the combined results of the preliminary and of the final examinations, and, so far as the requirements of the service will permit, they will have the choice of Presidency in India, according to their position in that list.\n\nIndia Office, June, 1880.\n\nN.B.

Officers of the Indian Medical Service will be allowed to retire on the following scale of pension, on completion of the required periods of service:\n\n| After 30 years' service in India | \u00a3 |\n|---------------------------------|--|\n| \" 27                            | 550 |\n| \" 24                            | 456 |\n| \" 21                            | 365 |\n| \" 17                            | 292 |\n|                                  | 220 |\n\n25. Time of service for pension will reckon from date of arrival in India. The period of residence at the Army Medical School will reckon as service for the above pension, except in the cases of Officers who have gone through the course at Netley as candidates for the British Army or Navy Medical Service.\n\n26. A Surgeon-General, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, will be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3350 per annum, in addition to that which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n27. A Deputy Surgeon-General will, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3250 per annum, in addition to the pension to which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n28. In each of the above cases stated in pars. 26 and 27, six months' absence on medical certificate will be allowed to count towards actual service in those grades.\n\n29. A Surgeon-General or Deputy Surgeon-General who has completed his term of service and has reverted to British pay, may reside in Europe, at the same time qualifying for higher pension.\n\n30. With a view to maintain the efficiency of the service, all Medical Officers of the rank of Brigade Surgeon and Surgeon-Major shall be placed on the Retired List when they shall have attained the age of fifty-five years, and all Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General when they shall have attained the age of sixty years. In any special case, where it would appear to be for the good of the service that the Officer should continue in employment, he may be so continued, subject in each case to the sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n31. A Medical Officer, retiring after a service of twenty-five years and upwards, may, if recommended for the same by the Government of his Presidency, receive a step of honorary rank, but without any consequent increase of pay.\n\n32. Officers of over 6 years' service compelled to leave the service on account of ill-health, and not entitled to full-pay pension under present regulations, will be allowed the half-pay of their relative rank, as laid down in the Royal Warrant.\n\n| Rank                  | Relative Rank | Rates of Half-pay |\n|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|\n|                       |               | Per Day | Per Annum |\n|                       |               | s. d.   | \u00a3 s. d.  |\n| Brigade Surgeon       | Lieut.-Colonel| 11 0    | 200 15 0 |\n| Surgeon-Major of 20 years' service | Major | 9 6    | 173 7 6 |\n| Surgeon-Major         | Captain       | 7 0     | 127 15 0 |\n\nOfficers cannot retire in India on half-pay (No. 54, 28th February 1865).\n\n33. Officers of less than 6 years' service may, under the conditions prescribed in the Regulations of the Indian Service, be granted pensions of 4s. a day if over 3 years' service, and 2s. 6d. a day if under.\n\nWound Pensions.\n\n34. Medical Officers are entitled to the same allowances granted to Her Majesty's Indian Military Forces on account of wounds and injuries received in action as combatant Officers holding the same relative rank.\nDespatch to the Government of India, No. 132, of the 30th June, 1866.\n\nFamily Pension Fund Regulations.\n\nFamily Pensions.\n\n35. The claims to pension of widows and families of Medical Officers shall be treated under the provisions of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British Officers as may be in force at the time being. (The Royal Warrant of 1st May, 1878, is the one now in force.)\n\n36. The widows and families of Medical Officers are also entitled to pensions from the Indian Service Family Pension Fund, to which all Surgeons must, as a condition of their appointment subscribe from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS OF 1796.\n\nOfficers (of whatever rank) must be ten years in India before they can be entitled (except in cases of certified sickness, and as hereafter specified) to their rotation to be absent on furlough, and the same rule is applicable to assistant surgeons and veterinary surgeons. The furlough to be granted by the commander-in-chief at each presidency, with the approbation of the respective governments.\n\nOfficers who have not served ten years in India, but whose presence in England is required by urgent private affairs, may be allowed a furlough for one year without pay.\n\nOfficers coming to England on furlough are required immediately to report their arrival by letter, with their address, forwarding at the same time the certificates they received in India.\n\nThe period of furlough is three years, reckoning from its date to the day of the return of the officer to his presidency.\n\nOfficers are required to join the establishment to which they belong at the expiration of the three years' furlough, unless they shall have obtained an extension of leave, six months before the expiration of that period. No furlough will be extended, except in cases of sickness, certified in the manner hereafter mentioned; or in cases in which it shall be proved that a further residence in Europe is indispensably necessary.\n\nAll officers finding it necessary to solicit a further leave of absence on account of sickness, must, if resident in London or its vicinity, appear before the Medical Board appointed for that purpose, who will report their opinion on the state of such officer's health. And if resident in the country in any part of the United Kingdom, they must transmit with their letter of application for such leave, a certificate according to the following form, signed by at least two gentlemen, eminent in the medical profession, viz.:\n\nI hereby certify, that I have carefully examined (state the nature of the case, as well as the name of the party), and I declare, upon my honour, that, according to the best of my judgment and belief, is at present unfit for military duty, and that it is absolutely necessary, for the recovery of his health, that he should remain at least longer in this country.\n\nAlso, previously to such extension of furlough being granted, such further proof shall be adduced by personal examination or by such other evidence as shall be deemed satisfactory.\n\nOfficers abroad in any part of Europe, applying to remain a further time from their duty on account of sickness, are to furnish a certificate of two eminent physicians, in the above form, with the attestation of a magistrate, that the persons who signed the certificate are physicians.\n\nOfficers having obtained an extension of furlough to a given period, must at its expiration apply for permission either to return to their duty or to reside a further time in England.\n\nIn every case in which an officer has had his furlough extended beyond the prescribed period on the ground of his health not being sufficiently restored, and shall apply for permission to return to his duty, he shall produce a certificate from the examining physician that his health is completely re-established, and that there is every probability of his being able to perform the active duties of his profession in India.\n\nNo officer who has failed to obtain an extension of furlough will be considered eligible to return to the service after five years' absence, under the Act of Geo. III. cap. 52, sec. 70.\n\nEvery officer upon leaving India will receive a printed copy of the General Order on this subject, published agreeably to the instruction of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the plea of ignorance of the regulations will not be admitted as any justification of the breach of them; officers, therefore, who shall come home on furlough, and who shall not in due time apply, so as to effect their return to the Presidency to which they belong within the period of three years from the commencement of their furlough, will subject themselves to the loss of the service, unless they shall be permitted to remain a further time in Europe.\n\nNo officer on furlough can receive pay for more than two years and a half from the period of his quitting India until he returns, excepting colonels of regiments and general officers; the latter are then allowed to draw the pay of their brevet rank beyond the above period.\n\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS.\u2014Nov. 17, 1854.\n\nWith the view of adapting the regulations to the present increased facilities of communication, and to correct, as far as possible, any tendency in them to deter officers from resorting to the places which may be most conducive to the restoration of their health, when a change of climate is required for that purpose, the following rules are established, and are to have effect from the 1st February, 1854:\n\n1. All regimental officers in the service on the 1st February, 1854, who prefer retaining what may be considered the advantages of the old regulations, may do so, provided they signify their wish to that effect when they next apply for furlough or leave of absence, without any limitation whether such leave be in India or elsewhere; and officers who once make their election will not be entitled to any other choice, but will be afterwards subject to the new or old regulations, according to their decisions.\n\n2. Staff officers, as such, have not the above option allowed them, but they may retain the advantages of the old regulations by giving up their appointments, which, in such cases, will be considered vacated from the date of embarkation.\n\n3. To those officers who adopt them, the new regulations will apply retrospectively in respect of furlough and leave of absence beyond sea, and in computing their time of service for retirement, so that their furloughs or leaves of absence, whether under the old or the new rules, and whether on private affairs or sick certificate, within or beyond India, will count for ser-\nvice to the authorized extent only, in computing the time for retirement on full pay.\n\n4. Officers who have availed themselves of the option of the old rules are allowed to reconsider the question under the modifications now sanctioned.\n\n5. Officers who have not taken leave subsequent to the publication of the new rules on the 1st February, 1854, and who, consequently, may not have been called upon to declare whether they would abide by the old or the new regulations, will, on retirement from the service, be entitled to take full advantage of the privileges given by the new regulations.\n\nFURLoughs ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n6. Every officer will be allowed a furlough to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of two years at the expiration of ten years' service, and for a second period of two years after twenty years' service in India.\n\n7. The second furlough of two years will only be granted after ten years' service in India, from the date of the return to duty after the first furlough of two years. These furloughs are not to be cumulative, under any circumstances, but are limited to two years. Officers who have taken leave of absence on sick certificate to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, will be ineligible to a furlough on private affairs until they have served six years from their last return to duty. This rule does not apply to short leaves to sea.\n\nOfficers who take their first furlough after twenty years' service in India, may take their second furlough after an additional service of five years from the date of their first return to duty. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n8. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and to the regulations framed for and preservation of the efficiency of each regiment by limiting the number of absentees.\n\n9. Officers holding staff or other detached appointments, may be allowed furlough for a period of six months without losing their appointments; but, during that period, they will not be entitled to any portion of their staff salary, which will be drawn in full by the officers officiating for them.\n\nAbsence for six months under this rule does not preclude an officer from taking his furlough to Europe after ten years' service. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n10. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on furlough on private affairs, will be entitled to \"Furlough Pay\" only.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE ON SICK CERTIFICATE.\n\n11. Leave of absence on sick certificate will be granted for a term not exceeding eighteen months, whether it be to any place in Europe, or elsewhere out of India.\n\n12. Extension of such leave may be granted, as at present, on production of medical certificates, for further periods not exceeding eighteen months in the whole.\n\n13. An officer holding a staff or other detached appointment, will be allowed to be absent on sick certificate in England, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of twenty months, without losing his appointment; and, during the first six months only of such absence, he will be entitled to draw half the staff salary of his appointment, the officer officiating for him drawing the remaining half salary during the first six months, and the whole salary during the remainder of the time.\n\n14. An officer's claim to half staff salary for six months, as sanctioned in the preceding rule, will not be affected by his subsequently retiring from the service in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n15. No portion of command allowance, medical staff salary, or other similar allowance, which under the old rules was inadmissible to officers absent from their corps or stations, at the Cape or elsewhere, will be allowed to absent officers under these regulations.\n\n16. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on leave of absence on sick certificate, will be entitled for a period of six months to the same rate of Indian pay and allowances as was allowed under the old regulations to officers proceeding to the Cape on medical certificate, and for the remaining period of their leave they will receive furlough pay only.\n\n17. If the leave on sick certificate be extended, furlough pay will be continued; but under no circumstances for a longer period than three years altogether, from the commencement of the absence.\n\nSTAFF OFFICERS.\n\n18. The term, \"staff officers,\" applies to all officers holding staff or detached appointments, military (general or regimental), political, or civil; also to general officers commanding divisions, members of the Medical Board, superintending surgeons, and others who, under the old rules, were entitled to draw half staff allowance when absent at the Cape.\n\n19. Staff officers absent on leave beyond the periods stated in Rules 9 and 13 respectively, cannot retain their appointments and allowances except on special grounds to be sanctioned by the Government of the presidency. Any such special grant of leave is to be reported at once, with the reasons for it, and to be subject to approbation.\n\n20. The privilege of retaining staff appointments during leave of absence on sick certificate, or on furlough on private affairs will not be available a second time, if the fresh leave is on sick certificate, until an officer has been three years, or, if on private affairs, until he has been six years, in the discharge of the duties of his appointment, from the date of last return to it.\n\n21. This rule, however, does not apply to leaves of absence, whether on sick certificate or on private affairs in India, or for brief periods to Ceylon, the Mauritius or other places out of India.\n\n22. Officers commanding troops of Horse Artillery and Light Field Batteries, and officers generally in employment, will be allowed leave out of India under the same rules with respect to allowance and tenure of command or office, as regulated the grant of leave to the Cape to such officers under the old regulations, except as to the duration of those advantages, the time for their continuance being subject to the provisions of the new regulations.\n\nDATE OF FURLough AND ADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n23. The period of furlough on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, is to be calculated from the date of the departure from India of the ship in which the officer proceeds.\n\n24. Advances of pay and allowances, staff and regimental, to officers proceeding on leave of absence on sick certificate, who may be entitled to them, will be made in India for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England at the rates of exchange fixed annually for repayment of advances made on account of Her Majesty's Government. Furlough pay will continue to be issued in advance for six months when required by officers obtaining furlough on private affairs.\n\n25. The existing regulations regarding passage-money to officers are not affected by these rules.\n\n26. The certificates issued to officers who are granted furloughs on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, are to specify the time each officer has been absent on leave within Indian limits, as well as the time of his previous absence in Europe; but will not include the periods allowed for proceeding to the presidency or port of embarkation, and to enable officers to rejoin their regiments or stations after their return to India, nor the leave of one month's absence in six months, as authorized by the regulations. The last pay certificate of all officers proceeding to England on sick certificate is to specify the rate of regimental pay and allowances and staff salary to which they would have been entitled under the old regulations if proceeding to sea on medical certificate. This information is necessary in order that no difficulty may arise in the Pay Department of the India Office in adjusting the several payments which may be due.\n\nOFFICERS OF H.M.'S SERVICE.\n\n27. Officers of Her Majesty's service in India, whether employed regimentally or in staff or detached situations, are entitled to the advantages above laid down in respect to allowances and tenure of office when on furlough or leave of absence.\n\n28. In the case of officers of Her Majesty's service on furlough or sick certificate, in England or elsewhere, who may retire or exchange into regiments not on the Indian establishment, the grant to these officers of Indian allowances will cease from the date of their retirement or exchange, if it take place before the expiration of six months from the date of quitting India.\nPERIODS OF ABSENCE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AS SERVICE FOR RETIRING PENSIONS.\n\n29. In order that all officers quitting India on furlough or sick certificate may be placed on an exact equality as regards loss of time, the period allowed by regulation for proceeding to the presidency, or to the nearest port of embarkation, as well as the time to enable officers to rejoin their corps or station after their return to India, will be considered as time counting for service for the retiring pension.\n\n30. No furlough or leave of absence, as announced in General Orders, exceeding two years in twenty years' aggregate service, three years in twenty-five years' service, and four years in thirty years' service, shall be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension; and no difference will be made in this respect between leave of absence taken in Europe or elsewhere, in or out of India, or whether the leave be on sick certificate or on private affairs.\n\n31. In the term \"Leave of Absence as announced in General Orders,\" is to be included all leave of absence, except the period allowed in Rule 29, and the ordinary indulgence of one month's leave in six months, as authorized by the existing regulations, and which are, in all cases, whether of regimental or staff officers, to be allowed to count as service for the pension. All leave to a greater extent, granted by political and other authorities, which may not hitherto have been published in General Orders, must be so announced hereafter.\n\n32. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of their regimental rank (under the regulations of 1796), must have served twenty-two years in India, out of which leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension.\n\n33. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of captains and majors (under the regulations of 1835-37) must have served twenty and twenty-four years respectively; out of which time leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more will be allowed to count as service.\n\n34. Officers to be entitled to retire as lieutenant-colonels must have served twenty-eight years; out of which leaves of absence for three years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n35. Officers to be entitled to retire as colonels must have served thirty-two years; out of which leaves of absence for four years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n36. The scale for medical officers and veterinary surgeons of privileged furlough and leave of absence as counting for the retiring pension, will be as follows:\n\n| Years. Months | Service |\n|--------------|---------|\n| 1            | 8       |\n| 2            | 0       |\n| 3            | 0       |\n| 4            | 0       |\n| 5            | 0       |\n| 6            | 0       |\n\n37. It is to be distinctly understood, that under no circumstances whatever will an officer be permitted to retire on full pay until he has completed the full time of service above specified, whether he be in England at the close of his service or elsewhere.\n\n38. The privileged time of absence may, with the permission of the local government, be taken at any time, subject to these regulations. If, therefore, at the end of twenty years' service, of which eighteen had been passed on actual duty in India, an officer should be on furlough or sick certificate in Europe or elsewhere, he will be entitled to retire on the full pay of a captain without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pensions. In like manner, a medical officer on furlough or sick certificate, in Europe or elsewhere, at the end of seventeen years' service, fifteen years and four months of which have been passed on actual duty in India, will be entitled to retire on the lowest rate pension, without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pension.\n\n39. These rules do not in any way affect the existing regulations regarding the grant of leave in India, or for short periods to sea, whether on private affairs or on sick certificate, except as to the periods of such absence being taken into calculation in the time allowed to count as service for retirement on full pay.\n\nINDIAN MILITARY FURLOUGH RULES OF 1868.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\nThe following General Order by the Government of India, dated 25th February, 1874, No. 171, is republished:\n\n\"No. 171 of 1874.\u2014The Furlough Rules of 1868, as revised by various subsequent decisions, are republished for general information; and in future this General Order shall ordinarily be referred to in any matter depending on those rules. The rules previously in force will be designated, as heretofore, the Furlough Rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nThe following G. G. O. are cancelled prospectively from the 1st January, 1875:\n\nG. G. O. No. 630 of 1869 (1st clause).\nG. G. O. No. 627 of 1870.\nG. G. O. No. 613 of 1871.\n\n2. These rules are applicable to all officers who, on the 1st July, 1868, belonged to the several Indian Staff Corps, or to the Indian Army, and who have elected, or may elect, to adopt them; officers of the British Army who entered the Staff Corps after that date are of course subject to them.\n\nRules apply to Officers of Staff Corps and Indian Army.\n\nIn regard to the periods of leave of absence during which appointments may be held, and in regard to the increased allowances, they are also applicable to officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, late of the Indian Army, holding permanent staff appointments not of a regimental nature, and to such officers of the Engineers of the Imperial Establishment as may be permanently employed on the staff in India.\n\nBut should an officer of the British Service, holding such permanent staff appointment, be allowed to proceed on leave under circumstances which, by these rules, would involve loss of appointment, he cannot take leave under them, but simply as a British Officer holding no appointment.\n\n3. These rules are not applicable to officers on the Invalid or Invalid Pension Establishment, even if previous to their transfer they should have elected them, being intended solely for officers on the effective list.\n\nOfficers generally of the British Service, whether formerly belonging to the Indian Army, and now in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and new Line Regiments, or on the old Line Establishment; nor are they applicable to officers of the British Army holding staff appointments the tenure of which is limited to five years, except in the sense in which the rules of 1854 were made applicable, viz., as regulating the amount of absentee allowance to be granted to such officers holding staff appointments, when they are absent on furlough on medical certificate.\nDo not apply to Officers of the British Medical Staff.\n\n5. They are applicable to Officers of the Royal Engineers on the Imperial list, holding permanent non-regimental staff appointments.\n\nApply to R. E. Officers on the Imperial list, holding permanent non-regimental staff appointments.\n\nThese officers, therefore, and other Royal Engineer Officers of the Imperial list on permanent staff employ under the Government, will be entitled to a furlough of two years after eight years' service in India, or at the expiration of one year from the date of their return (for a second tour of service in India) on the completion of the prescribed home service after the first period of seven years' service in India.\n\nThe English rate of pay of his rank only will be passed to such an officer during this leave; but on his return to India for a second tour of service, the difference between that pay and \"Furlough Pay\" will be admitted to him; and if he should not return to India, his passage money to England will be paid to him.\n\nPay allowed them during furlough.\n\nRoyal Engineer Officers on the Imperial Establishment, who are merely doing duty with, or attached to, the Sappers and Miners, but not on the fixed establishment and drawing staff salary, will, in regard to these rules, be on the footing of Regimental Officers of the British Service\u2014see preceding paragraph. If, however, they afterwards accept staff employ, they also will count their service for furlough from date of arrival in India.\n\n6. Officers of British Regiments who may join the Staff Corps, can count as service towards furlough all their military service in India, provided that half of it (in no case less than four years) shall have been passed in the Staff Corps. But any leave to England they may have taken during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough already taken. Officers of the British Service who formerly belonged to the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n\nPrevious service of Officers of the British Service who join Staff Corps, how reckoned towards furlough.\n\nBritish Service who formerly belonged to the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n\n7. These rules apply also to all Warrant Officers holding Veteran or Honorary Commissions, who may elect them; the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of a Commission. They will receive during furlough half their total receipts, calculated as laid down in Rule V., but without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate. Warrant Officers not holding Commissions can obtain furlough under these rules only on medical certificate.\n\nSuch furlough may be for two years with retention of appointment and half of the aggregate allowances; but any extension of such leave (which will not be granted for more than one year in excess of the two years) or any leave taken within less than three years from the date of last return to duty, will be on \"English furlough pay.\" [See Note to para. 9.]\n\n8. Every Warrant Officer who attained warrant rank before the 19th February, 1869, and who has not made his election, will be required, on the first occasion of his applying for leave out of India, to state whether he desires to take leave under these rules, or under those previously in force applicable to Warrant Officers, viz., G. G. O. Nos. 518 and 531 of 1854, G. G. O. No. 1559 of 1857, and subsequent orders. That election will be considered final.\n\nThose who became Warrant Officers after 19th February, 1869, are subject to these rules, and cannot elect any of the previous rules.\n\nLeave on medical certificate on Indian pay and allowances to places eastward of the Cape, as allowed to Commissioned Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1796 is not in any case admissible to a Warrant Officer.\n\nRules apply to Medical as to other Warrant Officers.\n\n9. The term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and twofold significance, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits specified in paragraph 5 of these rules, converted at the rate of exchange fixed by the Secretary of State for the official year, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English pay under the rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nNote.\u2014Where in these Rules English furlough pay is mentioned as that to which an officer is to be restricted, the rates laid down in paragraph 11 of G. G. O. No. 69, dated 22nd January, 1868, and (for Medical Warrant Officers) paragraph 22 of G. G. O. No. 550 of 1868, are to be understood as intended in the cases of Warrant Officers.\n\nRULES.\n\nI.\u2014The distinction with respect to allowances which has been hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave, is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtaining of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\nII.* Officers can retain their appointments during all leave of absence granted by competent authority. But their pay during such absence will be the same as they would obtain under these rules had this exemption from forfeiture of appointment not been granted.\n\n* As altered by G. G. O. No. 1174 of 1875.\nIII.\u2014The Rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII. of George III., Chapter 5, Section 70;* but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the rules now prescribed. Nor do they affect the regulations by which General Officers Commanding Divisions and Brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their Commands.\n\nIV.\u2014Leave of absence will in future be of three kinds, viz.:\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Furlough in or out of India.\nII.\u2014General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, or short leave to sea.\nIII.\u2014Privilege leave.\n\nChapter I.\n\nFurlough.\n\nV.\u2014An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on furlough, will be allowed pay at the rate of 50 per cent. of the salary of his substantive office.\n\nBut an officer in civil employ and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary during the three years prior to his proceeding on furlough, or during his actual service in India should that be less than three years; and the time spent and the allowances drawn during any leave \u201cother than privilege leave,\u201d will be omitted in the calculation of average salary.\n\nNo absentee shall in either case draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nThe term \u201csalary\u201d will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay, or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances. But in the case of a military officer in civil employ, his acting allowances shall be taken into account as a part of his salary in calculating his furlough pay.\n\n\u00a7 2. An officer absent on furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his furlough, to furlough pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, whatever the salary of the office to which he may be transferred may be. This furlough pay will be continued to an officer in military employ after his return to India and until he joins his appointment, provided it is not less than the military pay, or pay and allowances, of his rank.\n\nBut an officer whose term of office shall lapse, who shall vacate his appointment, or whose appointment shall be abolished during his furlough, will revert at once to the furlough pay which he would draw in virtue of his rank, as laid down below, in \u00a7 4. Any case of sudden abolition of appointment may, however, be specially considered in the department of the Government under which the officer may have been employed. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher Staff Corps or regimental rank, whilst on furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers holding regimental medical charges will be allowed to retain such charges during the authorized periods of furlough, as if they were medical staff appointments. And the difference between the unemployed* grade pay of the officer holding the substantive charge and the consolidated salary of the charge will be considered the staff salary divisible between the absentee and the officer officiating for him.\n\n\u00a7 4. Officers not in staff employ will receive half the Indian pay of their rank, provided that an officer entitled to furlough shall in no case receive less than the above minimum of \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nNote.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the Military Fund during absence in Europe, will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\nVI.\u2014All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service,\u2014of which exigency the Government is to be exclusively the judge,\u2014and to any regulations that may be found necessary for limiting the number of absentees.\n\nNote.\u2014It is therefore within the competency of local Governments and of the Commander-in-Chief to decline to forward the application of any officer whose absence would, in their opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the public service, until such time as arrangements can be made for removing the difficulty; and it is the duty of every head of a department to\n\nApplications of officers who cannot be spared need not be forwarded.\n\n* The section referred to is quoted below:\u2014\n\nSection 70.\u2014\u201cAnd be it further enacted that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a Member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and who, having departed from India by leave of the Governor-General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or Native Corps of Troops or in the civil line of the Company\u2019s Service, unless in the case of any Civil Servant of the Company, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or, unless such person be permitted to return with his rank to India, by a vote or resolution passed by way of ballot by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days\u2019 previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any Military Officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\u201d\ndecline to forward any application for furlough, whenever the services of the officer cannot be spared without risking the efficiency of the department, any doubtful case being referred for the orders of Government.\n\nVII.\u2014The maximum amount of furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time, carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years: any extension of such furlough will be without pay unless it is on medical certificate, see Rule XIII. (But see Notes (3) and (4) Rule IX.) And no extension on private affairs beyond two years will be granted, though without pay, except upon satisfactory evidence of very urgent necessity.\n\nVIII.\u2014A period of at least three years' service after return from last furlough, except furlough for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months) must be completed before furlough can again be taken, unless obtained under medical certificate (see Rules XIII. and XIV. and Note 3 of Rule IX.).\n\nThree years' service to intervene between two furloughs.\n\nBut an officer who may be ordered to return to duty before the completion of his furlough for the purpose of proceeding on field service may be allowed to take the balance of such furlough at any time.\n\nException in cases of officers ordered out on field service.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer in civil employ cannot reckon in this interval of three years any period of absence from actual duty, excepting those spent on privilege leave.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer will be eligible for two years' furlough on the completion of eight years' actual service in India (see para. 6 of this order); for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years, and so on, up to the maximum prescribed in Rule XVI. The grant of furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules VI. and VII. But see notes to this Rule.\n\n\u00a7 2.* Leave granted under these Rules, without furlough pay, will not reckon as furlough already taken in calculating the balance at an officer's credit, or as part of the total of eight years allowed as shown in Rule XVI, but all furlough with furlough pay, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, taken under these Rules, will so reckon.\n\n\u00a7 3.* Furlough and leave previously taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, will count, as respects officers who have elected these Rules, as follows:\u2014\n\nFurlough on private affairs, with pay, taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, counts in all respects as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, under the Rules of 1796, does not count in any respect as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, with pay, under the Rules of 1854, counts as part of the maximum of eight years allowed under these Rules, but until the maximum thus made up be reached, this leave will not count as furlough already taken in determining the amount of furlough to which an officer is entitled.\n\nLeave without pay under the Rules either of 1796 or 1854, does not count in any respects as furlough.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer appointed to any duty in England draws his Indian allowances, with or without any portion of his staff salary, he can count the period of such employment as service towards furlough; but if he is appointed to an office in England to which a fixed consolidated salary is attached, he cannot reckon the time of such employment as service towards furlough.\n\nNote (1).\u2014But an officer of less than eight years' service in India may obtain furlough not exceeding two years, on medical certificate, with furlough pay and retention of appointment, provided he has been three years in the Staff Corps, or\u2014in the case of a Royal Engineer officer holding a permanent staff appointment, or an officer not in the Staff Corps\u2014has served for three years in India.\n\nNote (2).\u2014If the officer has not been three years in the Staff Corps, or served three years in India, as the case may be, he will receive \"English furlough pay\" only, and must vacate his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nThis rule and the provisions in Note 1, however, are not applicable to officers of the Indian Army who entered the new Line Regiments, or Royal Artillery, and subsequently the Staff Corps.\n\nNote (3).\u2014Unemployed General Officers of the Staff Corps or local service can be granted furlough without serving the intervals of three and six years, respectively, prescribed in Rules VIII. and IX., and they can remain in Europe after they have exhausted the full period of furlough allowed during an officer's service by Rule XVI. (eight years on the whole) on the English furlough pay of their rank.\n\nNote (4).\u2014And a Major-General of the Staff Corps\u2014if he has so much furlough at his credit, and proceeds to England within a year of his being promoted to that rank, or of his ceasing to be employed\u2014can continue, after the expiration of the two years' furlough to receive half his Indian pay until he completes the period of three years during which he would be entitled to draw his Staff Corps pay if he were in India.\n\nX.\u2014An officer eligible for furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of furlough for which he may be eligible.\n\nIllustrations.\n\n1.

G. O. No. 197 of 1st March, 1877\n2. An officer who has served 20 years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer is said to have furlough at his credit,\u2014even though he may not be able to obtain it owing to the number of absentees, or other causes,\u2014when the calculation of his service, as in illustration 1 above, shows a \"balance for which he is eligible.\"\n\n* XI.\u2014Furlough on urgent private affairs for six months on pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, may be granted when the officer has less than six months' furlough at his credit, or when from other causes, e.g., the number of absentees, or his not having served three years since his last return to duty, he is not able to take it. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule IX., and also\u2014except in the case of an officer in civil employ, see Rule VIII. note\u2014of the three years which are required to intervene between two periods of furlough by Rule VIII.\n\nThis leave cannot be given in extension of furlough of any description. It cannot be extended beyond six months unless on medical certificate and on the same pay; in which case the officer will be deemed to have vacated his appointment, unless entitled to re-aim it under Rule II.; the whole period will be reckoned in the maximum amount of furlough (8 years) allowed by Rule XVI., and no portion of it can form any part of the periods referred to in Rules VIII. and IX.\n\nNote.\u2014Ill-health is not considered as warranting furlough under this rule to any officer who under the provisions of these rules can obtain furlough on medical certificate without forfeiting his appointment.\n\nXII.\u2014Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during furlough. But, if he desires to spend in England the rest of a \"furlough in India,\" or vice versa, he must obtain permission to do so from the Government of his Presidency, or from the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be; and on landing in either country, he must report his arrival accordingly to the Military Department of his own Presidency, or to the India Office, forwarding a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination. He must also communicate his address. An officer who, on his return to India, reports his embarkation, without forwarding at once a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination, or submitting an application for such permission, will be considered to have returned to his duty.\n\nXIII.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate is obtainable as indicated in Notes (1) and (2) of Rule IX. and in Rule XIV. Absence on such furlough for a longer period than two years at one time will involve forfeiture of appointment. [But see exceptions in Rule II.] Furlough may, however, be extended on medical certificate up to a third year on \"English furlough pay;\" and an officer on furlough on private affairs, who may be obliged to obtain an extension on medical certificate, will be thenceforward entitled to the same advantages, and subjected to the same disadvantages as to retention of appointment, pay, &c., as if he had originally obtained furlough on medical certificate.\n\nIf he exceeds three years' absence on medical certificate, the officer may have to retire or go on half-pay.\n\nExtension on medical certificate over three years to be without pay.\n\nOfficers on medical certificate must be pronounced fit for duty before returning to India.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer whose health may necessitate his taking furlough within three years from the date of last return from any furlough except that taken for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XII. (and extending also, in the case of an officer on civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months), may obtain under the usual medical certificate, such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health; but he will receive only \"English furlough pay;\" and must vacate any appointment he may be holding, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\n\u00a7 2. If, however, he shall have served three years since the date of his last return to duty, although there may be no balance of furlough at his credit, he will be entitled, on obtaining furlough on medical certificate, to retain his appointment and to receive \"furlough pay,\" as laid down in Rule V., for the entire period not exceeding two years. Should the latter period be exceeded, he will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer entitled to furlough, or having a balance of furlough at his credit, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, must take the leave as furlough under Rule IX., but without forfeiting any passage-money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules,\u2014or, if a Subaltern, by Regulation, when proceeding on medical certificate.\n\n\u00a7 2. Should the officer be declared fit for duty before the expiration of two years, he may be granted extension on private affairs up to that limit, provided that he has so much at his credit, and that if he remains he will not be in excess of the established proportion of absentees. Any extension on private affairs of such furlough beyond the said period of two years, must be without pay.\n\n* As modified in G. G. O. No. 922, of 31 Aug., 1876.\n\u00a7 3. Any extension on medical certificate of furlough under \u00a7 1 of this rule beyond two years or any lesser period which may be at his credit under Rules IX. and X. will be regarded, in all respects, as furlough on medical certificate (Rule XIII.); and if the period of two years should not exhaust the balance of furlough at his credit under Rule X., the period or such balance till the latter is exhausted. On the aggregate of two years' leave being exceeded, the officer will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nTotal furlough with pay, &c., in an officer's service limited to eight years.\n\nFurlough not reckoned in this period.\n\n\u00a7 1.\u2014Leave without pay.\n\u00a7 2.\u2014Sick leave to Europe, or to the Colonies eastward of Cape under the Rules of 1796.\n\u00a7 3.\u2014Leave taken under Rule XI. of these Rules, provided it be not extended over the six months. If it be so extended, the whole period will reckon as part of the eight years.\n\u00a7 4.\u2014Leave necessitated by wounds or sickness contracted on active service, and any other leave which may be allowed by proper authority to reckon as service for pension.\n\u00a7 5.\u2014In the case of an unemployed officer, periods of residence in England on English pay after promotion to the rank of Major General, or to the rank of Regimental Colonel in the Royal (late Indian) Artillery and Engineers, or after completion of tour of service as Inspector General or Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, when the officer is no longer required to reside in India.\n\nAll other leave to Europe, or out of India for periods exceeding three months (see Rule XXVII.), including furlough on medical certificate under the Furlough Rules of 1854, will form part of the period of eight years.\n\nXVII.\u2014If taken in India, furlough will be reckoned from the date of the absentee's quitting his station to the date of his return thereto; if taken out of India, from the date of the sailing of the vessel in which he may have embarked, to the date of his bond fide disembarkation in India for the purpose of rejoining his appointment or Regiment: the date of embarkation (or furlough).\n\nNote (1).\u2014As an illustration of this rule, it may be observed that a Madras officer's landing and reporting himself at Madras, en route to Calcutta to join his appointment in Bengal or the North-Western Provinces, &c., is not disembarkation in the sense intended by this rule.\n\nNote (2).\u2014To enable an officer who overstays his leave to obtain an extension, he should show that he took all needful precautions to insure his arrival in proper time, and how obtained.\n\nExtension to cover excess over furlough if delayed by the departure of the vessel being deferred, he should obtain the certificate of the owner or agent that she had been bond fide advertised to sail from \u2014\u2014\u2014 on the \u2014\u2014\u2014 but that her departure had been delayed till the \u2014\u2014\u2014.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Preparatory leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere on furlough will be granted for any period deemed necessary, not ordinarily exceeding 30 days. Leave up to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date succeeding that of his disembarkation in India.\n\nThis applies equally to furloughs taken under Rule XI. The authority which has power to grant preparatory leave can, on due cause being shown, grant any necessary extension of it, but this can be done only on very sufficient reasons.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer obtaining a furlough on private affairs or medical certificate must embark within three months of the date of the General Order which notifies it, or take up the first portion of his furlough in India until he embarks; if not, the General Order will cease to have effect. The only exception to this rule that can be allowed is when the officer is prevented from embarking within the three months owing to his detention in India by proper authority on bond fide public grounds.\n\nIf, however, the officer does not, within a reasonable time, avail himself of the furlough given him, his subsequently being placed on duty rendering his detention necessary will not exempt him from the rule; and in every case of such detention the officer must at once report it, and he is not to embark after the expiration of three months until he has applied for and obtained from the Government of his Presidency an extension of the period.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Officers who may be serving in other Presidencies than their own, if they desire to embark bond fide for Europe from the latter, may obtain preparatory leave accordingly, and their furlough will reckon from the date of their embarkation at their own Presidencies.\n\nNote (3).\u2014For full information as to the submission of applications for furlough, see G. G. O. No. 34, of 11th January 1869; G. G. O.

No advance is made in England to officers on their returning to duty.\n\nXXI.\u2014The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule V.\n\nXXII.*\u2014An Officer acting in India for an absentee on furlough will be restricted, for the entire period that he may so act, to the half staff salary of the appointment in which he may be acting, in addition to the full pay of his rank, and the half staff salary of his own appointment, if he possess one. The aggregate staff salary granted to an acting officer in such cases will not be less than Rs. 100 per mensem, unless the full staff salary of the post in which he is officiating is less than that sum.\n\nA Warrant Officer acting for one of a higher grade on furlough receives half of the aggregate allowances of the absentee added to half of the aggregate of his own allowances.\n\n\u2020 Note.\u2014The indulgence granted by section 1 of this rule is only allowed to one directly officiating in the place of the officer absent on furlough, not to one acting in the room of an officer who is himself acting for an absentee on furlough.\n\nPeriods of furlough, &c., counting as service towards pension.\u2021\n\n| Years | Years |\n|-------|-------|\n| 2     | 20    |\n| 3     | 25    |\n| 4     | 30    |\n| 5     | 35    |\n| 6     | 38    |\n\nPeriods of furlough reckoned by Warrant Officers towards pension.\n\n15 months in 12 years' Departmental Service.\n\nThose who were promoted to warrant rank before that date, are allowed to continue if they prefer it, on the old rule, and reckon all leave in India as service, all out of India being deducted from their service, for pension.\n\nIllustration of the mode of computing service for pension in any case.\n\nTotal service from date of arrival in India, say.................................................. 30 years.\n\nLeave\u2014\n\nIn Europe, say........................................................................................................... 6 years.\n\nIn India...................................................................................................................... 3 years.\n\nOf which he can reckon............................................................................................ 4 years.\n\nRemaining to be deducted.......................................................................................... 6 years.\n\nService counting for Pension....................................................................................... 24 years.\n\nXXIII.\u2014On computing the furlough on private affairs to which an officer who has already enjoyed some portion of such furlough will be entitled, under these rules, it will be necessary to deduct the total amount of the furlough on private affairs of which he may have availed himself during his service from the total periods to which under Rule IX. he can lay claim. The balance within the limit of eight years' total furlough on private affairs and medical certificate laid down in Rule XVI., will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty.\n\nIllustration.\n\n(1).\u2014An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns to India on the date on which this order is promulgated.

During the entire period of his absence on this account the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively the officer will lose his staff appointment unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a Medical Board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in his entire period of service, but will not be regarded as furlough, nor will it affect the intervals entitling to furlough laid down in Rule IX. During this leave the absentee will draw a moiety of his staff salary in addition to the pay of his rank. But if the 12 months be exceeded, the whole leave must be reckoned as furlough, and allowances be adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Short leave, not exceeding three months, on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be taken to sea, on the above condition, but absence from India for any longer period will be treated as furlough.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014All general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXXIX.\u2014Privilege leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General leave, in extension of privilege leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\nXXX.\u2014In the case of the stations noted in the margin, privilege leave may, as at present, be granted for ninety days to officers of local Corps, or of Corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\n| Assam. | Khairwara. |\n|---------|------------|\n| Shillong. | Khotra. |\n| Erinpooa. | Bunnoo. |\n| Deolec. | Dera Ismael Khan. |\n\nNo restriction as to place.\n\nXXXI.\u2014An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on privilege leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\nXXXII.\u2014Privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on privilege leave, the privilege leave will be converted into general leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMilitary Officers in Civil Employ.\n\nXXXIII.\u2014Those Military Officers (including Warrant Officers who hold Honorary, Veteran, or Unattached Commissions) in Civil or Political employ who may elect these rules when they take leave in India, come, as respect periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted, under the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules.\n\nFor preparatory or subsidiary leave, see Note (4) of Rule XVII.\n\nSubsidiary Rule.\n\nXXXIV.\u2014Officers of the Indian Military and Medical services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made.\n\n\u00a7 2. Officers going home under these Rules will pay English rates of subscription only to the Military Fund.\n\n\u00a7 3. Officers who may determine to abide by existing Rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII., VIII., and XIII., to the extent to which they may be entitled under the Furlough Regulations of 1854 or of 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV. must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n\u00a7 4. If an officer under the Furlough Rules of 1796 elects the present Rules, his service for pension will\nPrevious service of officers under 1796 Rules how reckoned.\n\nleave out of Indian limits taken previous to 1st July, 1868; and the fact of the officer having been on furlough on 1st July, 1868, and not then having elected the Rules of 1868, will not affect the case. All periods of his service counting for pension, as shown in Rule XXIII.\n\nRetirement under 1796 Rules not affected.\n\nHis election of these Furlough Rules in no way affects his right to retire under the Pension Rules of 1796.\n\nFURLOUGH AND LEAVE RULES.\n\n30th December, 1875.\n\nNo. 1,316 of 1875.\u2014Under instructions from Her Majesty's Government, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to publish the following revised Furlough and Leave Rules applicable to the Staff Corps and Indian Local and Medical Services.\n\n1. Officers included in Schedule A may receive, after five years' service in India or under the Government of India, one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these rules, be taken later.\n\n2. An Officer may receive at any time any portion of the furlough to which he is entitled; but, except under Rule 8, he may not be absent from duty on any ground for more than three years consecutively; nor, on return from furlough, may he receive, except under Rule 6, any further portion of the furlough to which he is entitled until after the interval of two years.\n\n3. It must be distinctly understood that furlough is subject to the exigencies of the public service. Officers commanding regiments, and Heads of Departments, will forward no application for furlough unless able to satisfy the superior authorities that the Officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\n4. Furlough does not involve forfeiture of appointment, may be spent anywhere, and counts as service for pension.\n\n5.* A commissioned Officer on furlough receives (up to, but not beyond, the sum of \u00a31,000 a year) half the emoluments of his office, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State; but in any case he does not receive less than \u00a3250 a year. The emoluments of his office include all pay, staff corps pay, staff salary, and Indian allowances he would receive in respect to it if he were on duty, and for the purpose of each payment his office is the office he fills on the day when that payment becomes due. A Warrant Officer receives half the emoluments of his office, calculated in the same manner as those of Commissioned Officers, no Warrant Officer, however, receiving as furlough pay less than the English furlough pay of his rank.\n\n6. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years; but such furlough will be deducted from his next accruing furlough until it is paid off. An Officer will not be allowed to anticipate furlough under this rule to an aggregate amount of more than two years.\n\n\u2020 An Officer of less than two years' service from date of coming under the new rules, falling sick, will be sent to England on medical certificate, on English furlough pay, subject to the decision of her Majesty's Government as to his ultimate disposal; a special report on each case being submitted to her Majesty's Government by the Government of India, or in the case of Officers of the Madras or Bombay army by the Government of those presidencies.\n\n\u2021 Warrant Officers promoted to that grade after the 31st December 1875, will be allowed to count their previous service for furlough under Rule 6. Furlough, however, is not to be granted under that rule until a Warrant Officer has completed two years' service since his last return to duty from furlough as a non-commissioned officer, otherwise he can only be granted leave under clause \u2020.\n\n\u2020 Furlough on medical certificate under this rule does not count as service for pension until it has been paid off as provided for in the rule.\n\n7. An Officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be placed temporarily or permanently on half-pay, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\n8. Under very urgent circumstances special furlough may be granted for private affairs, which need not be paid back; but it will be in all cases without any kind of pay, and will not count for pension.\n\n\u2020 The amount of leave which may be granted under this rule will be restricted to such period as the Government granting it is satisfied is actually necessary with reference to the urgency of the case.\n\n9. Advances for passage money, on need shown, will be granted to Officers on furlough, to be recovered in manner specified at the time of the grant; in India, at the discretion of the Local Government; and in England, at the discretion of the Secretary of State.\n\n10. Leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, and may not, except for very urgent reasons, be specially reported to the Government of India, be renewed till after six months have elapsed from its expiration. It must be spent at some place east of the 40th degree of east longitude. Subject to these conditions, it may be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the local authorities, who in granting it shall fix its duration, and may fix the limits within which it shall be spent, and whether during its continuance half-pay and allowances are to be deducted for the payment of a substitute; and they may grant it as preparatory to furlough, or for the purpose of a medical examination. Leave counts as service for pension and furlough. The local authorities shall be deemed for the purpose of this rule by the Government of India.\n\n11. Leave and furlough are reckoned from and to the close of the days named in the order granting them.\n\n12. The position of Officers not included in Schedule A will be unchanged as respects leave or furlough.\n\n13. Officers now in the service placing themselves, from a given date, under these rules, shall count service for pension up to that date under the rules to which they were then subject.\n\n\u2020 An officer takes with him so much service for pension as he had become entitled to under former rules. Under the rules of 1854 and 1868, two years' leave in twenty years' service counts for pension, but in periods of less than twenty years no leave counts. Therefore, if an officer now under the rules of 1854 or 1868, of twenty years' service, with two years' leave, elects the present rules, his service for pension will be twenty years; if an officer of nineteen years' service, with the same amount of leave, elects these rules, his service for pension will be seventeen years only.\n\n* As modified by G.G.O. No. 440 of 11 May, 1877.\n\u2020 Rulings contained in G.G.O. No. 1,110 of 27 Oct., 1876.\n\u2021 Ruling contained in G.G.O. No. 23 of 10 Jan., 1879.\n\u2020 Ruling contained in G.G.O. No. 480 of 25 May, 1877.\nOfficers entering the Staff Corps or Indian Medical Service, and Warrant Officers attaining that rank, after the 31st December, 1875; and\n\nAny other officers, Commissioned or Warrant, belonging to the Indian Army or Medical Service or Officers of the Staff Corps, who, after the 31st of December, 1875, shall, before asking for leave or furlough, apply in writing to their Local Governments to be placed definitely upon this Schedule; but their service for furlough under Rule I shall commence from the date of such entry or such application respectively.\n\n\u2020 The date of entry into the Staff Corps is that of entry for choice of furlough rules, viz., the date on which the Officer was originally appointed on probation. An Officer, therefore, whose date of admission to the Staff Corps is not after the 31st December, 1875, will have the choice of rules, but an Officer whose date of admission is after that date will have no option.\n\n\u2020 An Officer coming on this schedule, having furlough to his credit under previous rules, forfeits such furlough absolutely, he being required to serve five years from date of applying to be placed on the schedule before he can take one year's furlough, unless it be sick furlough under Rule 6. An Officer similarly circumstanced, but having furlough to his debit, is equally with the others entitled to take one year's furlough five years after joining the new rules.\n\nAny Officers in civil employment declared by the Government of India to be under civil leave rules shall not be under these rules.\n\nThe last pay certificate issued to an Officer to whom furlough or leave has been granted shall state the pay to which, under Rule 5, he is at that date entitled in respect to the office he is holding, noticing the date, if any fixed, at which he will vacate it.\n\nWith adverence to the foregoing rules, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify\u2014\n\nI. That no \"extra or special allowances\" drawn by an officer, which are now excluded from the account in calculating furlough pay under the Rules of 1868, can be reckoned in calculating furlough pay under these Rules (Rule 5).\n\nII. That the Governments of the three Presidencies, or their Excellencies the Commanders-in-Chief, in regard to Officers serving directly under them, shall be held to be the \"local authorities\" named in Rule 10.\n\nIII. That, pending further orders, a Staff Officer granted leave under Rule 10 shall receive, as heretofore, the pay or staff corps pay of his rank, and half the staff salary of his appointment during such leave; but full staff salary may be allowed him for the first two months (as now during privilege leave) when he makes approved arrangements for the performance of his duties during that period. In such cases the Government Officer granting the leave must state that the first two months are to be on full staff pay.\n\nN.B.\u2014It is distinctly to be understood that the rule regarding the pay to be drawn on leave under para. 10 is liable to be modified at any time in any way that the Government of India may deem expedient.\n\nIV. Pending further orders these rules are not applicable to any Officer in civil employ.\n\nNo. 1102 of 1877.\u2014His Excellency the Governor General in Council is pleased to notify the following supplementary regulations, which have received the approval of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India, providing for the case of Military Officers in Civil employ, referred to in paragraph IV. of the subsidiary rules appended to G.G.O. No. 1316 of the 30th December, 1875:\n\nI. Any Officer now in Civil employ, who is subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1854 or 1868, shall remain so subject.\n\nII. Any Military Officer who may hereafter enter Civil employ, who is not already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall remain subject to the rules applicable to him when he enters Civil employ.\n\nNote.\u2014An Officer referred to in Rules I. and II. cannot elect the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, so long as he continues in Civil employ.\n\nIII. Any Officer who may enter Civil employ, who is already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall be subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code applicable to covenanted civil servants, both as regards furlough and leave taken out of India and in India.\n\nADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n22nd February, 1878.\n\nNo. 175 of 1878.\n\nUnder Instructions from Her Majesty's Government, the Right Hon. the Governor General in Council is pleased to publish the following rules regarding advances of pay to Officers under the furlough rules of 1868 and 1875:\n\nOfficers proceeding on furlough to Europe may if they desire it, receive an advance equivalent to three months' furlough pay.\n\nOfficers returning from furlough will similarly be granted advances of pay at the following rates, on obtaining permission to return:\n\nFor a Subaltern ... \u00a365\nFor a Captain ... \u00a3100\nFor a Field Officer ... \u00a3150\n\nNo advance, however, will be issued to an officer who obtains from the Fund to which he is a subscriber a loan equal to or greater than the advance authorized for his rank; and an officer who obtains from his Fund a loan less in amount than such advance, will be granted only the difference between the two.\n\nRecovery of the advances made in England to be effected in India by five equal monthly instalments at the rate of exchange fixed for the year.\n\nThe following advances will be issued to Warrant Officers, on the same conditions:\n\nTo First Class Combatant Warrant Officers ... \u00a350\nTo Senior Apothecaries ... \u00a350\nTo other Warrant Officers with honorary commissions ... \u00a325\nTo Second Class Combatant Warrant Officers ... \u00a325\nTo Apothecaries ... \u00a315\nTo Assistant Apothecaries ... \u00a315\n\n\u2020 Rulings contained in G.G.O.
