The boys were found in the building at ten o'clock on the previous Saturday morning. They had evidently made the place their home. The elder boy was armed with a catapult, and in his possession were a number of lead pellets. The extensive building had been almost stripped of its piping, and there were evidences that the lead so obtained had been melted down to make pellets for the catapults, which were used to shoot the numerous birds nested in the roof of the building, which were afterwards cooked and eaten. On the house where Arnold resided being searched a chisel fashioned like a burglar's \"jemmy\" was found, together with a silver-plated teapot and cream jug, and several plated spoons, which it was ascertained had been stolen from a house in Percy-terrace, Mandeville-street, Clapton. The owner was not present, and Constable 208 J said there was no further evidence to connect the prisoners with the robbery at that house. A solicitor representing the owner, who is away in Russia, said that during the past few years \u00a3700 worth of damage had been done to the buildings by boys. A wall eight feet high surrounded the building, and as the inner staircase had long since disappeared he was at a loss to know how the boys got to the top floor. Arnold said they got over the outer wall from some gardens at the back, and, having forced the windows, they climbed up the beams to the top floor. The solicitor added that great danger might arise to adjoining property by the boys kindling fires on the floor. The boys seemed to have been neglected by their parents, one mother admitting that she had taken a situation as a housekeeper and left the boy to shift for himself. Mr. Corser said Bushell appeared to be the ringleader, and he probably had led the other boys away. He would have ten days' imprisonment and be detained for five years in a reformatory. The younger boys would go to the workhouse for a week, and Mr. Hiscocks, the School Board officer, would find industrial schools for them.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200807886.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 578, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2414, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
