He stated that he had known the deceased woman Charwood for fourteen years. She had been in the service of his wife as a domestic servant, but owing to an intimate relationship existing between them she gave birth to a child. Since that time he had allowed her \u00a31 per week. She studied art under his tuition, and lived in Holland Park, where he visited her. In the early part of 1883 she gave birth to another child at Tunbridge Wells, named Ellen Franklin. In 1885 she was engaged by him with her, but at the end of that year they agreed to end their intimacy, although he still continued the allowance. After wandering about the country for some time deceased went to live at East Grinstead three years ago. He had not visited her there. She came and paid him a visit in December last, but the intimacy was not renewed. When the first child died he was communicated with by telegram, but did not go to the funeral. On October 27th last he sent a cheque for \u00a33 to deceased at East Grinstead. The cheque was passed through Lloyd's Bank at Guildford on November 21st of this year, receiving a letter from Charwood saying he wanted to see him relative to the deceased. He wrote to Mrs. Franklin (the name by which he knew the deceased) asking her if she wished him to see Charwood, but he did not receive a reply. On the 25th of October he heard from Charwood by letter that the deceased was ill, and asking him to make some arrangements for the funeral. He wrote asking for the bill for the funeral to be sent him, which was done by Charwood on October 27th, and the account amounted to \u00a326 11s. 2\u00bdd. He sent a cheque for the sum, and it was paid through Lloyd's Bank at Guildford. He thought that the deceased had died of natural death at East Grinstead, or he would not have sent the money.\n\nDr. T. Bond, who made the post-mortem after exhumation, said there was no evidence of thrombosis, embolism, heart disease, or fright's death. There was no evidence of any violent struggle, violence, or loss of blood. He found the imperfectly-developed body of a child in the coffin with the corpse. Cross-examined, he thought the injuries had not been caused by instruments, but by the hand. On re-examining the deceased said that, in order to produce the symptoms of the case, the knife must have been used of such a savage character as would be absolutely unjustifiable. He meant by that that it would be a crime for a medical man to use such violence.\n\nAfter a powerful speech from Mr. Dickens, Q.C., in defence of Charwood; Mr. Geoghegan followed on behalf of the female prisoner Francis; and Mr. Dale Hart for the male prisoner Francis.\n\nThen Justice Grantham proceeded to sum up the case, which he characterised as one of the most painful and difficult that had ever come before him. Dr. Francis was not in the dock with the other prisoners. The inquiry had clearly shown the dangers to which the community at large would be subjected if a form of burial by cremation was brought into general use. Supposing, for instance, Mrs. Franklin's body had been consumed by fire, the flames two weeks afterwards, the present inquiry could not have been instituted. He thought the present system of burial was by far the best.\n\nWhile the jury were away considering their verdict an animated conversation was carried on in court, the two prisoners being naturally the centre of attraction. Justice Grantham, who had been sitting back upon her ruby volvelot, had leaned over the front of the dock, and discussed the situation with her solicitor and father-in-law. Although her eyes were swollen with crying there was a nervous excitement easily perceptible in them; she faced both the solicitor and father-in-law with a white whiteness, which almost seemed to denote anger. Her lips quivered with suppressed emotion, and as she talked with her solicitor she pressed her hands tightly together, and was heard to say, in a whisper \"Oh! God, release me from this agony.\" Mr. Francis, however, maintained that there has been a great deal of misunderstanding between the two parties, and that the wife, who had been tried twice, stood by the side of his wife, and talked in quiet monosyllables with his father. Charwood apparently had no friends in court, as during the absence of the jury he entered into conversation with one of the wardens in charge.\n\nOn the return of the jury, Justice Grantham delivered five minutes' address. He charged the prisoner Francis with murder, and the prisoner Charwood with manslaughter. Francis was only guilty of being an accessory before the fact.\n\nIn passing sentence on Charwood\u2014of five years' penal servitude\u2014Justice Grantham said that he had been guilty of most despicable conduct, and added that no one could have more sympathy with him. Mrs. Francis, whom he sentenced to three years' penal servitude, had, in his opinion, lent only a too willing hand to Dr. Freeman in his illegal practices. The man Francis was held, worthy of sympathy, as he thought that he had only taken the action he had for the purpose of protecting his wife. He sentenced him to six months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200811239.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 602, "total-output-tokens": 1287, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 5716, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
