This was an extraordinary case in consequence of the pertinacity with which the prisoner had striven to make away with himself.\n\nThe indictment to which the prisoner pleaded was an unusual one. From the evidence adduced it appeared that about four o'clock one afternoon during last month the prisoner was seen to run along Hammersmith-bridge, mount the parapet, throw his hands wildly into the air, and precipitate himself into the river. The prisoner disappeared under the water, and was some time before he came to the surface. He was observed by a waterman, who put off in a boat and dragged him from under the water into his boat. The prisoner was quite insensible, and it was a long time after he was taken on shore before he spoke.\n\nMr. Payne inquired if the prisoner had been seen by the surgeon.\u2014William Turnock, the dock officer, was sworn: He said the prisoner had been under the supervision of Dr. Smiles, the prison surgeon, during the last month, and he said that he was quite sane.\n\nFrederick Williamson was examined: He said he was inspector of the detective police at Scotland-yard. He had known the prisoner since March, 1864, when he gave himself up to the police authorities at Essex, and charged himself with committing a murder. The murder that he accused himself of was upon the person of Emma Jackson, that created a great sensation for some time. The prisoner was taken before the magistrate at Bow-street and remanded to allow inquiries to be made. Inquiries were made, when it turned out that there was no foundation for it at all, and the prisoner was not the murderer. Since then the prisoner has attempted to commit suicide by throwing himself out of window, and has suffered imprisonment for it. When the prisoner committed the act of which he was then charged he had only been discharged from Bow-street police-court about two hours, having been charged with a similar offence. He went straight to Hammersmith-bridge, and must have hurried there.\n\nThe prisoner said he sometimes entertained strange notions of things. He thought sometimes that he could raise the dead and make people fair and beautiful forever.\n\nMr. Payne said that after what the prisoner had said he must be seen again by the prison surgeon. The prisoner was then put back and again examined by the prison officer.\n\nDr. Smiles was then sworn. He said that he had examined the prisoner, and he had been under his notice for some time past. He believed he was sane, but was a silly, foolish fellow.\n\nMr. Payne, having remarked that it was very wicked to attempt to take away his own life, sentenced the prisoner to three months' imprisonment. The prisoner was then removed.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206223311.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 970, "total-output-tokens": 658, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2987, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
