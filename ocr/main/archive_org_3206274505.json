Prisoner was the manager of a business in the York-road and of another in the Plough-road.\n\nEvidence was given to the effect that in November last the prisoner purchased a revolver from a pawnbroker\u2014a friend of his\u2014in the York-road, and a retired constable deposed that in July last the prisoner instructed him to watch his wife, who, he said, was in the habit of going out in the evening at about seven o'clock. The prisoner afterwards told him that he should not require his services again, as the woman had gone away, and \"there was a good riddance of her.\"\n\nSerjeant Hudson deposed that the prisoner came into the Battersea police-station at about half-past eight in the morning, and said that he had shot his wife. He asked for a piece of paper to write to his brother, and, taking the revolver from his pocket, said, \"Here's the revolver; it is loaded in three chambers.\" Witness asked if his wife was dead, and he said, \"I don't know.\" Prisoner wrote on the paper asking his brother to go to 17, Plough-road, and take charge of the place. He also asked his brother to take care of his children.\n\nInspector Milloney said two of the chambers of the revolver had been recently discharged. The deceased was found dead in bed. She had been shot through the head. When charged with the murder prisoner said, \"Yes, that's all right.\"\n\nThe medical evidence went to show that deceased was shot while asleep, and that she had been dead three or four hours when discovered. She had been shot through the temple.\n\nThe jury, after about an hour's deliberation, found the prisoner \"Guilty,\" but recommended him to mercy on account of the medical evidence as to the state of his mind.\n\nPrisoner had nothing to say, he said, why sentence should not be passed.\n\nMr. Justice Day sentenced prisoner to death, and said the recommendation should be forwarded to the proper quarter.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206274505.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 786, "total-output-tokens": 513, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2133, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
