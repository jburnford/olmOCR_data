The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary; and if the result of such inquiries, in the case of any Candidate should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India, and if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4.

In the following Rules,\n   \"Actual Service\" includes the period during which an officer is on duty, also periods spent on Privilege and Subsidiary Leave, and periods during which an officer, not on leave, may be out of employ on subsistence allowance in India.\n\n   \"Extraordinary Leave\" means any leave granted otherwise than under these Rules.\n\n   \"Long Extraordinary Leave\" means extraordinary leave extending beyond a period of three months.\n\n   \"Long Furlough\" means furlough extending beyond a period of three months.\n\n   \"Salary\" includes acting allowances.\n\n   An officer's \"Station\" means that station to which he stands appointed, or such other place as the Government to which he is subordinate may determine.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\n2. The maximum period of furlough which can be granted to any officer during the whole period of his service is limited to six years.\n\n3. Subject to the above limit, furlough shall be placed to the credit of each officer, at the proportional rate of one year's furlough for every four years of actual service.*\n\n4. No furlough shall be taken before the completion of eight years' actual service, except under Rule 8.\n\n5. Furlough shall not be repeated until three years from the date of the last return from Long Extraordinary Leave or Long Furlough, except under Rule 8. Leave taken under Chapters II. and III., but no other leave, shall be reckoned as part of the said three years.\n\n6. The maximum term of furlough to be taken at any one time shall be two years.\n\n7. Except as hereinafter provided, an officer, when on furlough, shall retain a lien on his substantive appointment, or on an appointment of similar character and not less salary, and he shall be granted allowances at the rate of 50 per cent. of his average salary for the previous three years, or for the period which has elapsed since his last return from Long Furlough or Long Extraordinary Leave, if that period be less than three years.\n\nIn calculating such average, the time spent and the allowances drawn under any leave, excepting Privilege Leave under Chapter II., shall be omitted.\n\nProvided that no officer on furlough shall draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3300 per annum.\n\n8. Under medical certificate\u2014\n   (a) Furlough may be taken on the above-mentioned conditions, without reference to the amount at credit under Rule 3.\n   (b) Furlough for a period not exceeding one year may be taken, even if less than three years have elapsed since the last return from Long Extraordinary Leave or Long Furlough. When on furlough under this clause, an officer will not retain a lien on his appointment, and will be entitled only to subsistence allowance, unless he has completed six months' actual service since his last return from Long Extraordinary Leave or Long Furlough, and there remain some leave to his credit under Rule 3, in which case the officer will retain a lien on his appointment, and will draw allowances as calculated under Rule 7, until that credit be exhausted, but in no case for a period exceeding one year.\n   (c) Furlough taken without medical certificate, or under clause (a) of this Rule, may be extended beyond two years for a period not exceeding one year. When on furlough under this clause, an officer will not retain a lien on his appointment, and will be entitled only to subsistence allowance.\u2020\n\n9. Furlough taken or extended under Rule 8 is subject to the provision of Rule 2.\n\n10. Furlough taken in India will be reckoned from the date of the officer quitting his station to the date of his return thereto. Furlough taken out of India will be reckoned from the date of embarkation to the date of return.\n\nIn the event of the furlough being taken partly in India and partly out of India,\n\n* A Civil Servant who has taken leave on medical certificate under leave rules prior to those of 1868, will not be debited with such leave, up to the limit of one year, against furlough which would otherwise be at his credit. All such leave shall, however, be included in the maximum amount of six years fixed in Rule 2 of the Rules of 1868.\n\n\u2020 The rates of subsistence allowance are:\u2014\n\nPer Mensem.\n\nFor a Civil Servant of 12 or more years' standing .................. Rs. 400\nFor a Civil Servant of more than 8 but less than 12 years' standing Rs. 320\n\" \" \" of not more than 8 years' standing .................. \" 250\nthe commencement and termination of the furlough will be determined by the above rules, according as the furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n11. For the interval elapsing between departure from his station and the commencement of furlough, and between the termination of furlough and the re-arrival at his station, an officer shall be allowed subsidiary leave not ordinarily exceeding in each case thirty days. During those periods his allowances will be calculated in the same way as his furlough allowances, but without limitation as to maximum and minimum. Provided that, if the officer has, under these rules, lost his lien on his appointment, he shall draw subsistence allowance of his rank. Subsidiary leave shall count as service and residence.\n\n12. Applications for furlough will in all cases be submitted to the Government to which the applicant is subordinate, and will be dealt with in such manner as the Governor-General of India in Council may from time to time prescribe.\n\n13. Subject to the exigencies of the service, both as regards the number of furloughs available at any one time, and as regards individual applications, of which exigencies the Government of India, Madras, or Bombay, as the case may be, shall be exclusively the judge, furloughs will be granted under these rules.\n\n14. All applications for furlough under medical certificate, in accordance with these rules, will be granted without restriction.\n\n15. If, owing to the exigencies of the service, it may be necessary to place any limit on the number of officers who may be absent on furlough at the same time, applications not supported by medical certificate will be granted in the following order:\n\nThe applicant to whose credit the greatest amount of furlough remains under Rule 3 shall have the preference.\n\nIf two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, the preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in India is longest, reckoning, in the case of an officer who has not taken long extraordinary leave or long furlough, from the date of arrival in India, and in the case of an officer who has taken long extraordinary leave or long furlough, from the date of his last return from such leave or furlough.\n\nIf two or more applicants are equal in both respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Gradation List.\n\n16. The term of residence qualifying for pension shall be twenty-one years, but no leave, except privilege leave and subsidiary leave, shall count as residence.\n\n17. The term of service qualifying for pension shall be twenty-five years.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n18. Subject to the exigencies of the state, an officer who has completed eleven months' continuous duty may take privilege leave for one month without deduction from his salary, retaining a lien on his appointment whether substantive or officiating. Provided that, in the case of his holding an officiating appointment, such lien and his acting allowance will cease on the resumption of charge by the officer to whom the substantive appointment belongs.\n\n19. In the same manner, and under the same conditions, two or three months' privilege leave may be taken when an officer has completed continuous duty of twenty-two or thirty-three months respectively.\n\n20. Privilege leave may, at the discretion of the local Government, be taken in separate instalments. No second instalment shall be taken until after the completion of six months' continuous duty from the expiry of the first instalment. In this case, the eleven months qualifying for fresh privilege leave will be reckoned from the expiry of the first instalment, the period of the second instalment being omitted from the calculation.\n\nProvided that the whole privilege leave taken at any one time shall not exceed three months, and that no accumulation of privilege leave beyond that period shall be admitted.\n\n21. If an officer shall over-stay his privilege leave, he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent; and, if he shall so continue absent for more than one week, his office shall become vacant.\n\n22. Privilege leave shall be reckoned as residence and service.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE.\n\n23. Special leave, on urgent private affairs, may be granted at the discretion of the local government for a period not exceeding six months. In respect of retention of a lien on appointment, of allowances drawn during the leave, and of subsidiary leave, the conditions of special leave shall be the same as those prescribed for furlough. Special leave shall not be reckoned as residence.\n\n24. Rule 21 shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to an officer over-staying special leave.\n\n25. Special leave may be repeated with cut allowances after intervals of at least six years' actual service.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n26. Furlough, privilege leave, and special leave shall not be taken as such in continuation of each other; but, if an officer absent on one of these classes of leave be allowed to change it for another, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under the class of leave for which it was changed.\n\n27. Subject to considerations of State, there will be no restriction as to the places where an officer may reside when on leave.\n\n28. Leave allowance shall be payable monthly, if payment is taken in India, and quarterly, if payment is taken in England.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTEMPORARY RULES.\n\n29. Whatever aggregate amount out of the three years' furlough and three years' sick leave under the rules until now in force, at present remains to be taken by an officer under the said rules, shall remain to be taken by him under rules now promulgated.\n\n30.*\n\n31. Any officer now absent on leave, who has no appointment, may, on his return, and until he again holds an appointment carrying equal pay to that of the substantive appointment which he last held, draw the subsistence allowance of his rank, together with 75 per cent. of the pay of any appointment in which he shall officiate. Provided that the total salary so drawn by\n\n* Cancelled.\n\nRULES FOR THE REGULATION OF LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO THE JUDGES OF HER MAJESTY'S HIGH COURTS OF JUDICATURE IN INDIA.\n\nDEFINITIONS.\n\n1.

One year's furlough shall be placed to the credit of each Judge after the completion of every four years of actual service.\n\nhim shall not exceed the pay of the appointment in which he is officiating. This rule shall apply to any officer who may have already returned from furlough.\n\n32. Any officer now absent on furlough, or under medical certificate, may elect whether the remainder of his leave shall be taken under these rules from the date of their promulgation. If he shall so elect, Rule 30 shall not apply to him.\n\nRules regarding Acting Allowances.\n\n1. An officer holding a substantive appointment, and officiating in an appointment of a higher grade or class, shall draw acting allowance calculated at 30 per cent. on the first Rs. 2,000, and 20 per cent. on the remainder of the pay of the appointment in which he is officiating.\n\nProvided that, if the acting allowance so calculated do not amount to two-thirds of the difference between the pay of the two appointments, it shall be raised to two-thirds.\n\nProvided further, that in no case shall the whole salary so drawn exceed the pay of the appointment in which the officer is officiating.\n\n2. An officer holding no substantive, but only an officiating appointment, shall, subject to the provisions in Rule 1, draw, in addition to the subsistence allowance of his rank, 50 per cent. of the pay of the appointment in which he is officiating.\n\n3. In the case of an officer officiating in an appointment the pay of which is progressive, his acting allowances shall be calculated on the mean pay of the said appointment, provided that the whole salary so drawn shall not exceed the minimum pay of the said appointment.\n\n3. Except under Rules 6 and 7, no furlough shall be granted until at credit under Rule 2.\n\nProvided that any Judge who may have been already in the service of the Government at the time of taking office in the High Court, and who was at that time entitled, under the Rules applicable to the branch of the service to which he belonged, to furlough without medical certificate, may be granted furlough for a term not exceeding that to which he was so entitled, upon the condition that such furlough shall not be taken until the completion of two years' actual service in the High Court, and shall not exceed one year.\n\n4. Except under Rule 7, furlough shall not be repeated until after the completion\nof three years' actual service from the date of the last return from furlough or extraordinary leave.\n\n5. The maximum term of furlough to be taken at any one time shall be fifteen months.\n\n6. Under medical certificate, furlough may be granted before it is at credit, under Rule 2.\n\n7. On urgent private affairs, furlough may be granted before it is at credit, under Rule 2, and although three years of actual service have not been completed since the last return from furlough or extraordinary leave. Provided that furlough under this section shall not exceed six months, and shall be granted only once during the whole period of a Judge's service in the High Court.\n\n8. The aggregate amount of all furlough which can be granted to a Judge during the whole period of his service in the High Court shall not exceed two years and a half.\n\n9. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date of the Judge quitting his office to the date of his return thereto. Furlough taken out of India shall be reckoned from the date of embarkation to the date of return.\n\nIn the event of the furlough being taken partly in India and partly out of India, the commencement and termination of the furlough shall be respectively determined by the above Rules, according as the furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n10.

If, owing to the exigencies of the service, it may be necessary to place any limit on the number of Judges who may be absent on furlough at the same time, applications not supported by medical certificate will be granted in the following order:\n\nThe Judge to whose credit the greatest amount of furlough remains under Rule 2 shall have the preference.\n\nIf two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, the preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in a High Court is longest, reckoning in the case of a Judge who has not taken furlough or extraordinary leave from the date of his commencement of service in the High Court, and in the case of a Judge who has taken furlough or extraordinary leave from the date of his last return from such furlough or leave.\n\nIf two or more applicants are equal in both respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Court.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n14. Subject to the exigencies of the service, a Judge who has completed eleven months' continuous duty, inclusive of vacations, may, if the Government be satisfied that there is an urgent necessity, but not otherwise, be granted privilege leave for one month without deduction from his salary or acting allowances.\n\n15. In the same manner, and under the same conditions, an additional month of privilege leave shall be held to accrue to a Judge after each further period of eleven months' continuous duty.\n\n16. Privilege leave shall not be taken in instalments, but any balance of privilege leave that may not have been taken shall be added to the next privilege leave which may accrue. Provided that the whole privilege leave taken at any one time shall not exceed three months, and that any accumulation of privilege leave beyond that period shall be forfeited.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n17. Furlough and privilege leave shall not be taken as such in continuation of each other, but if a Judge absent on one of these classes of leave be allowed to change it for another, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under the class of leave for which it was changed.\n\n18. Applications for leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Government may, from time to time, prescribe.\n\n19. Leave allowances shall be payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\n20. No substantive appointment shall be vacated merely by reason of leave being granted under these Rules.\n\n21. If a Judge shall overstay any leave, he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent, and if he shall so continue absent for more than one week, his office shall be liable to become vacant.\n\n22. No leave, except privilege leave and leave subsidiary to furlough, shall count\nas service for pension. The period of service at present qualifying for pension as a High Court Judge shall be diminished by six months for full pension, and by three months for half pension.\n\n23. Each Judge at present standing appointed to a High Court shall, on the first occasion of his taking leave, be given the option of accepting these Rules or abiding by those at present in force for Judges of the High Courts of Judicature.\n\n24. If a Judge, who is a Covenanted Civil Servant, shall be permitted to resign his office and remain in the service, all leave which he may have taken as a Judge of the High Court shall be reckoned as if it had been taken under the Rules for the leave of absence of Covenanted Civil Servants.\n\nThe above Rules are, with the sanction of His Grace the Secretary of State for India in Council, hereby declared applicable, with the modifications below stated, to the following Officers:\n\n- Barrister Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab;\n- Recorders in Burmah;\n- First Judges of Small Cause Courts at the Presidency Towns;\n- Secretary to the Council of the Governor General for making Laws and Regulations.\n\nModifications above indicated.\n\n1. The allowances of these Officers, while on furlough or subsidiary leave, shall not exceed half their salaries, and shall be limited also to the rate prescribed in Rule 11.\n\n2. With reference to Rule 22, the pensions to which these Officers are entitled under medical certificate after nine years' service shall be due after eight years and eight months' actual service; and the pensions to which they are in like manner entitled after seven years' service shall be due after six years and nine months' actual service.\n\nThe following Notification is also published, for general information and guidance:\n\n**NOTIFICATION No. 3,070.**\n\nA question having been raised as to whether the Resolution of the Financial Department, No. 101, dated the 24th April, 1869, and published at page No. 917 of the \"Gazette of India\" of 1st May, 1869, on the subject of privilege leave, is applicable to Judges of Her Majesty's High Courts of Judicature, the Governor General in Council observes that privilege leave to these and certain other officers, under the Rules recently prescribed, differs from ordinary privilege leave, in that no Judge of a High Court is held entitled to such leave, unless Government be satisfied that there is an urgent necessity for it. Leave under Chapter II. of the Rules in question is therefore rather in the nature of short leave on urgent private affairs, while vacation takes the place of privilege leave.\n\nOn these considerations, His Excellency in Council is pleased to declare that the Resolution above quoted shall not be held to apply to Judges of Her Majesty's High Courts of Judicature, or to the other Officers to whom the Rules governing the leave of those Judges have been declared applicable.\n\n**NOTIFICATION No. 3,486.**\n\nWith reference to the Notification of this Department, No. 3,070, dated the 2d instant, published at page 255 of the \"Gazette of India,\" the Governor General in Council is pleased to explain that the Resolution No. 101, dated 24th April, 1869, shall not be held to apply to any High Court Judge or other Judicial Officer to whom the new Rules governing the leave of High Court Judges have been declared applicable, even though, under Rule 23 of those Rules, he may elect to abide by former Rules. Whatever Rules any of these Officers may elect, privilege leave will not be granted to him except on urgent necessity being shown, since all of them have equally the benefit of vacation.\n\nHis Excellency in Council is further pleased to declare that the only exception will be the Secretary to the Council of the Governor General for making Laws and Regulations, since this Officer does not enjoy vacations. He will therefore be exempted from showing urgent necessity for privilege leave, but the Resolution No. 101, dated 24th April, 1869, will be applicable to him.\n\n**RULES REGARDING LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO CHAPLAINS.**\n\n**DEFINITIONS.**\n\n1. In the following rules, \"Actual Service\" includes the period during which a Chaplain is on duty, also periods spent on privilege and subsidiary leave, and periods during which a Chaplain not on leave may be out of employ in India.\n\n\"Extraordinary Leave\" means any leave granted otherwise than under these rules.\n\n\"Long Extraordinary Leave\" means extraordinary leave extending beyond a period of three months.\n\n\"Long Furlough\" means furlough extending beyond a period of three months.\n\n\"Salary\" includes acting allowances.\n\nA Chaplain's \"Station\" means that station to which he stands appointed, or such other place as the Government to which he is subordinate may determine.\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFURLOUGH.\n\n2. The maximum period of furlough which can be granted to any Chaplain during the whole period of his service, is limited to six years.\n\n3. Subject to the above limit, furlough shall be placed to the credit of each Chaplain at the rate of one-fourth of his actual service after adding thereto one year.\n\nExample.\u2014A Chaplain who has completed nine years' actual service, will be credited with one-fourth of ten years, i.e., two and a half years' furlough.\n\n4. Subject to the same limit, leave on medical certificate to the extent of one year taken prior to the promulgation of these Rules, shall not be deducted from the furlough credited to a Chaplain under Rule 3.\n\n4a. Except under Rule 8, furlough shall not be taken until the completion of seven years' actual service, nor in excess of the period of furlough at credit under Rules 3 and 4.\n\n5. Except under Rule 8 (b), furlough shall not be repeated until three years from the date of the last return from long extraordinary leave, or long furlough. Leave taken under Chapters II. and III., but no other leave, shall be reckoned as part of the said three years.\n\n6. The maximum term of furlough to be taken at any one time shall be two years.\n\n7.\u2020 Except under Rule 8, a Chaplain when on furlough shall be granted allowances at the rates noted in the margin.\n\n8. Under medical certificate\u2014\n\n(a) Furlough may be taken on the above conditions, without reference to the amount at credit under Rule 3.\n\n(b)\u2020 Furlough for a period not exceeding one year may be taken, even if less than three years have elapsed since the last return from long extraordinary leave or long furlough. When on furlough under this clause, a Chaplain shall be entitled to only the allowances noted in the margin, unless he has completed six months' actual service since his last return from long extraordinary leave, or long furlough, and there remains some leave to his credit under Rule 3, in which case a Chaplain shall draw the full allowances mentioned in Rule 7, until that credit be exhausted, but in no case for a period exceeding one year.\n\n(c) Furlough taken without medical certificate, or under clause (a) of this rule, may be extended beyond two years for a period not exceeding one year. During the period of extension of furlough beyond two years under this clause, a Chaplain shall be entitled to the allowances mentioned in the margin of Rule 7 (b).\n\n9. Furlough taken or extended under Rule 8 shall be subject to the provision of Rule 2.\n\n10. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date of the Chaplain quitting his station to the date of his return thereto. Furlough taken out of India shall be reckoned from the date of embarkation to the date of return.\n\nIn the event of the furlough being taken partly in India and partly out of India, the commencement and termination of the furlough shall be determined by the above rules, according as the furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n11. For the interval elapsing between departure from his station and the commencement of furlough, and between the termination of furlough and the re-arrival at his station, a Chaplain shall be allowed subsidiary leave not ordinarily exceeding in each case thirty days. During those periods his allowances shall be the same as during the furlough to which the said leave is subsidiary.\n\n12. Subject to the exigencies of the service, both as regards the number of furloughs available at any one time, and as regards individual applications, of which exigencies the Government of India, Madras, or Bombay, as the case may be, shall be exclusively the judge, furloughs shall be granted under these rules.\n\n13. All applications for furlough under medical certificate, in accordance with these rules, shall be granted without restriction.\n\n14. If, owing to the exigencies of the service, it may be necessary to place any limit on the number of Chaplains who may be absent on furlough at the same time, applications not supported by medical certificate shall be granted in the following order:\u2014\n\nThe applicant to whose credit the greatest amount of furlough remains under Rule 3 shall have the preference.\nIf two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, the preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in India is longest, reckoning in the case of a Chaplain who has not taken long extraordinary leave, or long furlough, from the date of his arrival in India, and in the case of a Chaplain who has taken long extraordinary leave, or long furlough, from the date of his last return from such leave or furlough.\n\nIf two or more applicants are equal in both respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Gradation List.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n15. Subject to the exigencies of the State, a Chaplain who has completed five months' continuous duty may take privilege leave for one month without deduction from salary or house-rent, but with loss of conveyance and gaol allowances.\n\n16. In the same manner, and under the same conditions, two or three months' privilege leave may be taken when a Chaplain has completed continuous duty of ten months and fifteen months respectively.\n\n17. If a Chaplain shall overstay his privilege leave, he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE.\n\n18. Special leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at the discretion of the Government for a period not exceeding six months. In respect of allowances to be drawn during the leave and of subsidiary leave, the conditions of special leave shall be the same as those prescribed for furlough under Rules 7 and 11.\n\n19. Rule 17 shall, mutatis mutandis apply to a Chaplain over-staying special leave.\n\n20. Special leave may be repeated without allowances after intervals of at least six years' actual service.\n\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS OF 1796.*\n\nOfficers (of whatever rank) must be ten years in India before they can be entitled (except in cases of certified sickness, and as hereafter specified) to their rotation to be absent on furlough, and the same rule is applicable to assistant surgeons and veterinary surgeons. The furlough to be granted by the commander-in-chief at each presidency, with the approbation of the respective governments.\n\nOfficers who have not served ten years in India, but whose presence in England is required by urgent private affairs, may be allowed a furlough for one year without pay.\n\n* These Regulations do not apply to officers who entered the service after the 1st of February, 1854.\u2014Vide Military Furlough Regulations of 1854, p. 21.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n21. Applications for leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Governor General of India in Council may from time to time prescribe.\n\n22. Furlough, privilege leave, and special leave shall not be taken as such in continuation of each other; but if a Chaplain absent on one of these classes of leave be allowed to change it for another, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under the class of leave for which it was changed.\n\n23. Subject to considerations of State, there shall be no restriction as to the places where a Chaplain may reside when on leave.\n\n24. Leave allowance shall be payable monthly, if payment is taken in India, and quarterly, if payment is taken in England. When furlough is taken in England, an advance of the first quarter's allowances may be made in India. Such advance shall not be recoverable in case of death.\n\nThe term of residence qualifying for pension shall be, in the case of Chaplains appointed before the 11th January, 1854, fifteen years, and in the case of Chaplains appointed on or after that date, seventeen years, but no leave, except privilege leave and subsidiary leave, shall count as residence.\n\n26. The term of service qualifying for pension shall be, in the case of Chaplains appointed before the 11th January, 1854, eighteen years, and in the case of Chaplains appointed on or after that date, twenty years. Leave of absence in India taken prior to the 25th August, 1864 shall count as service for pension, and shall not be reckoned as furlough under these rules.\n\nPublished by order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\nE. H. LUSHINGTON.\n\nSecretary to the Government of India.\n\nNOTE.\u2014Chaplains who came to Europe under the furlough rules previously in force are allowed the benefits of the above rules, should they so elect, from the 1st August, 1868.\nOfficers coming to England on furlough are required immediately to report their arrival by letter, with their address, forwarding at the same time the certificates they received in India.\n\nThe period of furlough is three years, reckoning from its date to the day of the return of the officer to his presidency.\n\nOfficers are required to join the establishment to which they belong at the expiration of the three years' furlough, unless they shall have obtained an extension of leave, six months before the expiration of that period. No furlough will be extended, except in cases of sickness, certified in the manner hereafter mentioned; or in cases in which it shall be proved that a further residence in Europe is indispensably necessary.\n\nAll officers finding it necessary to solicit a further leave of absence on account of sickness, must, if resident in London or its vicinity, appear before the Medical Board appointed for that purpose, who will report their opinion on the state of such officer's health. And if resident in the country in any part of the United Kingdom, they must transmit with their letter of application for such leave, a certificate according to the following form, signed by at least two gentlemen, eminent in the medical profession, viz.:\n\nI hereby certify, that I have carefully examined (state the nature of the case, as well as the name of the party), and I declare, upon my honour, that, according to the best of my judgment and belief, is at present unfit for military duty, and that it is absolutely necessary, for the recovery of his health, that he should remain at least longer in this country.\n\nAlso, previously to such extension of furlough being granted, such further proof shall be adduced by personal examination, or by such other evidence as shall be deemed satisfactory.\n\nOfficers abroad in any part of Europe, applying to remain a further time from their duty on account of sickness, are to furnish a certificate of two eminent physicians, in the above form, with the attestation of a magistrate, that the persons who signed the certificate are physicians.\n\nOfficers having obtained an extension of furlough to a given period, must at its expiration apply for permission either to return to their duty or to reside a further time in England.\n\nIn every case in which an officer has had his furlough extended beyond the prescribed period on the ground of his health not being sufficiently restored, and shall apply for permission to return to his duty, he shall produce a certificate from the examining physician that his health is completely re-established, and that there is every probability of his being able to perform the active duties of his profession in India.\n\nNo officer who has failed to obtain an extension of furlough will be considered eligible to return to the service after five years' absence, under the Act of 33 Geo. III. cap. 52, sec. 70.\n\nEvery officer upon leaving India will receive a printed copy of the General Order on this subject, published agreeably to the instruction of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the plea of ignorance of the regulations will not be admitted as any justification of the breach of them; officers, therefore, who shall come home on furlough, and who shall not in due time apply, so as to effect their return to the Presidency to which they belong within the period of three years from the commencement of their furlough, will subject themselves to the loss of the service, unless they shall be permitted to remain a further time in Europe.\n\nNo officer on furlough can receive pay for more than two years and a half from the period of his quitting India until he returns, excepting colonels of regiments and general officers; the latter are then allowed to draw the pay of their brevet rank beyond the above period.\n\n### Furlough Allowances\n\n| A DAY | Cav. | Art. | Inf. |\n|-------|------|------|------|\n| Colonels | \u00a31 12 s. d. | \u00a38 1 s. d. | \u00a35 0 s. d. |\n| Lieut.

1854.\n\nWith the view of adapting the regulations to the present increased facilities of communication, and to correct, as far as possible, any tendency in them to deter officers from resorting to the places which may be most conducive to the restoration of their health, when a change of climate is required for that purpose, the following rules are established, and are to have effect from the 1st February, 1854:\n\n1. All regimental officers in the service on the 1st February, 1854, who prefer retaining what may be considered the advantages of the old regulations, may do so, provided they signify their wish to that effect when they next apply for furlough or leave of absence, without any limitation whether such leave be in India or elsewhere; and officers who once make their election will not be entitled to any other choice, but will be afterwards subject to the new or old regulations, according to their decisions.\n\n2. Staff officers, as such, have not the above option allowed them, but they may retain the advantages of the old regulations by giving up their appointments, which, in such cases, will be considered vacated from the date of embarkation.\n\n3. To those officers who adopt them, the new regulations will apply retrospectively in respect of furlough and leave of absence beyond sea, and in computing their time of service for retirement, so that their furloughs or leaves of absence, whether under the old or the new rules, and whether on private affairs or sick certificate, within or beyond India, will count for service to the authorized extent only, in computing the time for retirement on full pay.\n4. Officers who have availed themselves of the option of the old rules are allowed to reconsider the question under the modifications now sanctioned.\n\n5. Officers who have not taken leave subsequent to the publication of the new rules on the 1st February, 1854, and who, consequently, may not have been called upon to declare whether they would abide by the old or the new regulations, will, on retirement from the service, be entitled to take full advantage of the privileges given by the new regulations.\n\nFURLoughs ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n6. Every officer will be allowed a furlough to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of two years at the expiration of ten years' service, and for a second period of two years after twenty years' service in India.\n\n7. The second furlough of two years will only be granted after ten years' service in India, from the date of the return to duty after the first furlough of two years. These furloughs are not to be cumulative, under any circumstances, but are limited to two years. Officers who have taken leave of absence on sick certificate to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, will be ineligible to a furlough on private affairs until they have served six years from their last return to duty. This rule does not apply to short leaves to sea.\n\nOfficers who take their first furlough after twenty years' service in India, may take their second furlough after an additional service of five years from the date of their first return to duty. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n8. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and to the regulations framed for the preservation of the efficiency of each regiment by limiting the number of absentees.\n\n9. Officers holding staff or other detached appointments, may be allowed furlough for a period of six months without losing their appointments; but, during that period, they will not be entitled to any portion of their staff salary, which will be drawn in full by the officers officiating for them.\n\nAbsence for six months under this rule does not preclude an officer from taking his furlough to Europe after ten years' service. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n10. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on furlough on private affairs, will be entitled to \"Furlough Pay\" only.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE ON SICK CERTIFICATE.\n\n11. Leave of absence on sick certificate will be granted for a term not exceeding eighteen months, whether it be to any place in Europe, or elsewhere out of India.\n\n12. Extensions of such leave may be granted, as at present, on production of medical certificates, for further periods not exceeding eighteen months in the whole.\n\n13. An officer holding a staff or other detached appointment, will be allowed to be absent on sick certificate in England, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of twenty months, without losing his appointment; and, during the first six months only of such absence, he will be entitled to draw half the staff salary of his appointment, the officer officiating for him drawing the remaining half salary during the first six months, and the whole salary during the remainder of the time.\n\n14. An officer's claim to half staff salary for six months, as sanctioned in the preceding rule, will not be affected by his subsequently retiring from the service in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n15. No portion of command allowance, medical staff salary, or other similar allowance, which under the old rules was inadmissible to officers absent from their corps or stations, at the Cape or elsewhere, will be allowed to absent officers under these regulations.\n\n16. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on leave of absence on sick certificate, will be entitled for a period of six months to the same rate of Indian pay and allowances as was allowed under the old regulations to officers proceeding to the Cape on medical certificate, and for the remaining period of their leave they will receive furlough pay only.\n\n17. If the leave on sick certificate be extended, furlough pay will be continued; but under no circumstances for a longer period than three years altogether, from the commencement of the absence.\n\nSTAFF OFFICERS.\n\n18. The term, \"staff officers,\" applies to all officers holding staff or detached appointments, military (general or regimental), political, or civil; also to general officers commanding divisions, members of the Medical Board, superintending surgeons, and others who, under the old rules, were entitled to draw half staff allowance when absent at the Cape.\n\n19. Staff officers absent on leave beyond the periods stated in Rules 9 and 13 respectively, cannot retain their appointments and allowances except on special grounds to be sanctioned by the Government of the presidency. Any such special grant of leave is to be reported at once, with the reasons for it, and to be subject to approbation.\n\n20. The privilege of retaining staff appointments during leave of absence on sick certificate, or on furlough on private affairs, will not be available a second time, if the\nfresh leave is on sick certificate, until an officer has been three years, or, if on private affairs, until he has been six years, in the discharge of the duties of his appointment, from the date of last return to it.\n\n21. This rule, however, does not apply to leaves of absence, whether on sick certificate or on private affairs, in India, or for brief periods to Ceylon, the Mauritius, or other places out of India.\n\n22. Officers commanding troops of Horse Artillery and Light Field Batteries, and officers generally in employment, will be allowed leave out of India under the same rules with respect to allowance and tenure of command or office, as regulated the grant of leave to the Cape to such officers under the old regulations, except as to the duration of those advantages, the time for their continuance being subject to the provisions of the new regulations.\n\nDATE OF FURLOUGH AND ADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n23. The period of furlough on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, is to be calculated from the date of the departure from India of the ship in which the officer proceeds.\n\n24. Advances of pay and allowances, staff and regimental, to officers proceeding on leave of absence on sick certificate, who may be entitled to them, will be made in India for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England at the rates of exchange fixed annually for repayment of advances made on account of Her Majesty's Government. Furlough pay will continue to be issued in advance for six months when required by officers obtaining furlough on private affairs.\n\n25. The existing regulations regarding passage-money to officers are not affected by these rules.\n\n26. The certificates issued to officers who are granted furloughs on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, are to specify the time each officer has been absent on leave within Indian limits, as well as the time of his previous absence in Europe; but will not include the periods allowed for proceeding to the presidency or port of embarkation, and to enable officers to rejoin their regiments or stations after their return to India, nor the leave of one month's absence in six months, as authorized by the regulations. The last pay certificate of all officers proceeding to England on sick certificate is to specify the rate of regimental pay and allowances and staff salary to which they would have been entitled under the old regulations if proceeding to sea on medical certificate. This information is necessary in order that no difficulty may arise in the Pay Department of the India Office in adjusting the several payments which may be due.\n\nOFFICERS OF H.M.'S SERVICE.\n\n27. Officers of Her Majesty's service in India, whether employed regimentally or in staff or detached situations, are entitled to the advantages above laid down in respect to allowances and tenure of office when on furlough or leave of absence.\n\n28. In the case of officers of Her Majesty's service on furlough or sick certificate, in England or elsewhere, who may retire or exchange into regiments not on the Indian establishment, the grant to these officers of Indian allowances will cease from the date of their retirement or exchange, if it take place before the expiration of six months from the date of quitting India.\n\nPERIODS OF ABSENCE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AS SERVICE FOR RETIRING PENSIONS.\n\n29. In order that all officers quitting India on furlough or sick certificate may be placed on an exact equality as regards loss of time, the period allowed by regulation for proceeding to the presidency, or to the nearest port of embarkation, as well as the time to enable officers to rejoin their corps or station after their return to India, will be considered as time counting for service for the retiring pension.\n\n30. No furlough or leave of absence, as announced in General Orders, exceeding two years in twenty years' aggregate service, three years in twenty-five years' service, and four years in thirty years' service, shall be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension; and no difference will be made in this respect between leave of absence taken in Europe or elsewhere, in or out of India, or whether the leave be on sick certificate or on private affairs.\n\n31. In the term \"Leave of Absence as announced in General Orders,\" is to be included all leave of absence, except the period allowed in Rule 29, and the ordinary indulgence of one month's leave in six months, as authorized by the existing regulations, and which are, in all cases, whether of regimental or staff officers, to be allowed to count as service for the pension. All leave to a greater extent, granted by political and other authorities, which may not hitherto have been published in General Orders, must be so announced hereafter.\n\n32. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of their regimental rank (under the regulations of 1796), must have served twenty-two years in India, out of which leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension.\n\n33. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of captains and majors (under the regulations of 1835-37), must have served\ntwenty and twenty-four years respectively; out of which time leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n34. Officers to be entitled to retire as lieutenant-colonels must have served twenty-eight years; out of which leaves of absence for three years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n35. Officers to be entitled to retire as colonels must have served thirty-two years; out of which leaves of absence for four years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n36. The scale for medical officers and veterinary surgeons of privileged furlough and leave of absence as counting for the retiring pension, will be as follows:\n\n| Years | Months |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 8      |\n| 2     | 0      |\n| 3     | 0      |\n| 4     | 0      |\n\nin 17 & under 20 yrs.' service\n\nin 20 \" 25 \"\n\nin 25 \" 30 \"\n\nin 30 and upwards.\n\n37. It is to be distinctly understood, that under no circumstances whatever will an officer be permitted to retire on full pay until he has completed the full time of service above specified, whether he be in England at the close of his service or elsewhere.\n\n38. The privileged time of absence may, with the permission of the local government, be taken at any time, subject to these regulations. If, therefore, at the end of twenty years' service, of which eighteen had been passed on actual duty in India, an officer should be on furlough or sick certificate in Europe or elsewhere, he will be entitled to retire on the full pay of a captain without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pensions. In like manner, a medical officer on furlough or sick certificate, in Europe or elsewhere, at the end of seventeen years' service, fifteen years and four months of which have been passed on actual duty in India, will be entitled to retire on the lowest rate pension, without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pension.\n\n39. These rules do not in any way affect the existing regulations regarding the grant of leave in India, or for short periods to sea, whether on private affairs or on sick certificate, except as to the periods of such absence being taken into calculation in the time allowed to count as service for retirement on full pay.\n\n---\n\n**INDIAN MILITARY FURLOUGH RULES.\u2014July 1, 1868.**\n\nThe Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India having, with certain modifications, approved generally of the Rules relative to the absence on leave of Military Officers, published in Government General Order No 613, dated 19th June, 1868, the following revised rules are published in substitution of those contained in the order above referred to.\n\nThese rules will be applicable to all officers who may elect to adopt them belonging to the several Indian Staff Corps or to the Indian Army, and in regard to the period of leave of absence during which appointments may be held, and in regard to the increased allowances, they will also be applicable to officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, late of the Indian Army, holding permanent staff appointments not of a regimental nature.\n\nTo obviate confusion or misconception as to the rules referred to, those previously in existence and those now sanctioned will be severally designated as the Furlough Rules of 1796, of 1854, or of 1868.\n\nThe term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and twofold signification, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits, specified in paragraph 5 of these rules, converted at the exchange of two shillings for the rupee, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English pay under the Rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\n1. The distinction with respect to allowances hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtaining of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\n2. Leave taken under the rules now prescribed will not involve forfeiture of appointment, except in the cases herein specially provided for.\n\n3. The rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII. of George III., Chapter 52, Section 70; but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the\nrules now prescribed.* Nor do they affect the regulations by which general officers commanding divisions and brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their commands.\n\n4. Leave of absence will, in future, be of three kinds, viz.:\n\n1. Furlough in or out of India.\n2. General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India or short leave to sea.\n3. Privilege leave.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFURLough.\n\n5. An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on furlough, will be allowed pay at the rate of 50 per cent. of the salary of his substantive office. But an officer on civil employ, and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary drawn by him for three years prior to his proceeding on furlough. No absentee shall, in either case, draw more than 1,000l. or less than 250l. per annum. The term \"salary\" will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances. It is to be clearly understood that an officer absent on furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his furlough, to pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, provided that an officer whose term of office shall lapse during his furlough shall cease to draw his half staff salary from the date of such lapse. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher staff corps or regimental rank whilst on furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\nOfficers not in staff employ will receive half the Indian pay of their rank, provided that in no case will an officer entitled to furlough receive less than the above minimum of 250l. per annum.\n\nNote.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the Military Fund during absence in Europe, will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\n6. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, of which exigency the Government is to be exclusively the judge, and to any regulations that may be found necessary for limiting the number of absentees.\n\n7. The maximum amount of furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time, carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years.\n\n8. A period of at least three years' service after return from last furlough, except furlough under Rule 11, must be completed before furlough can again be taken, unless obtained under medical certificate. (See Rules 13 and 14.)\n\n9. An officer will be eligible for two years' furlough on the completion of eight years' actual service in India, for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years. The grant of furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules 6 and 7. The fact of having taken furlough on medical certificate will not affect the grant of these furloughs, except as to the conditions laid down in Rules 8, 13, and 16.\n\n10. An officer eligible for furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of furlough to which he may be entitled.\n\n* The section referred to is quoted below:\n\nSection 70. \"And be it further enacted, that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the forces, and who, having departed from India, by leave of the Governor General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or native corps of troops or in the civil line of the Company's service, unless in the case of any civil servant of the Company it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or unless such person be permitted to return within his rank to India by a vote or resolution passed by way of ballot, by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days' previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any military officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors, and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India, that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\"\nILLUSTRATIONS.\n\n(1) An officer who has served nine years in India is entitled to two years' furlough. He takes only one year, and after his return remains in India for five years. He is then eligible for two years' furlough, as follows:\n\n| Years |\n|-------|\n| Total service in India | 14 |\n| Furlough due on that service | 3 |\n| Furlough already taken | 1 |\n| Balance for which he is eligible | 2 |\n\n(2) An officer who has served 20 years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\n11. Furlough on urgent private affairs for six months, with pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, may be granted, when the officer is not eligible for ordinary furlough. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule 9.\n\n12. Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during furlough.\n\n13. Absence on medical certificate for a longer period than two years at one time, or departure on such furlough within three years of the date of return from a previous furlough, except furlough under Rule 11, will involve forfeiture of the appointment. Such furlough may, however, be extended to a third year on English furlough pay.\n\nIn the event of an officer not being able to return to his duty after an absence of three years, it will rest with the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India in Council to order him to appear before a medical board, with a view to placing him on the Retired List, if entitled to pension, or on the Half-pay List.\n\nShould the circumstances of the case warrant a further extension of leave, it can only be granted without pay.\n\n14. An officer not entitled to furlough, whose health may necessitate his taking it within three years from the date of last return may, under the usual medical certificate, obtain such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health, but will only receive English furlough pay, and must vacate any appointment he may be holding.\n\n15. An officer entitled to furlough, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, will be compelled to take leave as furlough under Rule 9, but without forfeiting any passage-money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules, or if a Subaltern, by Regulation when proceeding on medical certificate. Any extension of this furlough beyond the period to which he may be entitled under Rule 9, will be regarded in all respects as furlough on medical certificate. Such extension will not be allowed to take effect until the officer shall have exhausted the entire amount of his available furlough on private affairs. If the aggregate of two years' leave is exceeded, the officer will after that date come under the provisions of Rule 14.\n\n16. The aggregate amount of furlough with pay and retention of appointment, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, that may be granted to an officer during his service, will be limited to eight years.\n\n17. If taken in India, furlough will be reckoned from the date of the absentee quitting his station to the date of his return thereto; if taken out of India, from the date of the sailing of the vessel in which he may have embarked to the date of his disembarkation in India.\n\n18. Preparatory leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere on furlough will be granted for any period not ordinarily exceeding thirty days. Leave to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date of his disembarkation in India.\n\n19. Furlough allowances shall be payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\n20. Advances of furlough pay will continue to be made in India to those officers who desire it, for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of six months from that date.\n\n21. The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and Staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule 5.\n\n22. An officer acting in India for an absentee will be restricted for the entire period of such acting to the half Staff salary of the appointment in which he may be acting, in addition to the full pay of his rank, and the half Staff salary of his own appointment, if he possess one. The Staff salary granted to an acting officer will, however, in no such case be less than Rs. 100 per mensum.\n\n23. The privilege heretofore granted to\nmilitary officers of counting the proportion of leave noted in the margin as service for pension, is retained. The periods of service qualifying for pension remain unaltered.\n\nILLUSTRATION OF THE MODE OF COMPUTING SERVICE FOR PENSION IN ANY CASE.\n\n| Total service from date of arrival in India, say | Yrs. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Leave\u2014                                           |      |\n| In Europe, say...                                | 6    |\n| In India...                                      | 3    |\n| Of which he can reckon                           | 4    |\n| Remaining to be deducted                         | 6    |\n| Service counting for pension                     | 24   |\n\n24. In computing the furlough on private affairs to which an officer who has already enjoyed some portion of such furlough will be entitled under these rules, it will be necessary to deduct the total amount of the furlough on private affairs of which he may have availed himself during his service from the total periods to which under Rule 9 he can lay claim. The balance will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty.\n\nILLUSTRATION.\n\n(1.) An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns to India on the date on which this order is promulgated. He accepts its conditions, and serves four years longer in India. On the expiration of that term, he can take one year's furlough, thus:\n\n| Total service in India | Years. |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| Leave to which that service entitles him | 3     |\n| Already enjoyed       | 2     |\n| Balance               | 1     |\n\n(2.) An officer of four years' service has proceeded on sick certificate to England for twenty months, extended afterwards to two years. He returns, serves six years in India, takes two years' furlough, and returns to India about the time of the promulgation of these rules, which he accepts. He must serve four years before he can take an additional year's furlough, thus\u2014\n\n| Total service up to return from furlough | Years. |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Total service in India                   | 14    |\n| Furlough enjoyed on that service         | 2     |\n| Further period of service to entitle him to one year's furlough | 4     |\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGENERAL LEAVE ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS AND SICK CERTIFICATE IN INDIA.\n\n25. An officer will be eligible, as at present, to take leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, for any period not exceeding six months, at the discretion of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, or of the Government under which he may be serving. During the entire period of his absence on this account, the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay, and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively, the officer will lose his staff appointment.\n\n26. Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a medical board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in his entire period of service, but will not be regarded as furlough, nor will it affect the intervals entitling to furlough laid down in Rule 9. During this leave the absentee will draw a moiety of his staff salary in addition to the pay of his rank.\n\n27. Short leave, not exceeding three months, on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be taken to sea, on the above condition, but absence from India for any longer period will be treated as furlough.\n\n28. All general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n29. Privilege leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year, to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General leave, in extension of privilege leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\n30. In the case of the stations noted in the margin,* privilege leave may, as at\n\n* Assam, Shillong, Erinpoora, Deolee, Khairwara, Khotra, Bunnoo, Dera Ishmael Khan, Dera Ghazee Khan, Rajanpore, Jacobabad.\npresent, be granted for 90 days to officers of local corps, or of corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\n31. An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on privilege leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\n32. Privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on privilege leave, the privilege leave will be converted into general leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMILITARY OFFICERS IN CIVIL EMPLOY.\n\n33. Military officers in civil or political employ taking leave in India come, as respects periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted, under the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules.\n\nSUBSIDIARY RULE.\n\n34. Officers of the Indian military and medical services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules, or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made. Officers who may determine to abide by existing rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules 7, 8, and 13, to the extent to which they may be entitled under the furlough regulations of 1854, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule 15 must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\nIf an officer under the Furlough Rules of 1796 elects the present rules, his service for pension will be reckoned under the former rules up to 1st July, 1868, and thenceforward under the rules of 1868.\n\nThe foregoing rules will take effect from the 1st July, 1868, as respects retention of appointment, and terms under which leave will be granted, but half staff allowances will not be available for officers now on leave in cases where the acting officer has already come into receipt of the full staff salary. Nor can officers who have vacated appointments which have since been permanently filled up have any claim to be restored to them.\n\nFURLOUGH RULES FOR WARRANT OFFICERS.\n\nIt has been decided:\u20141st, that the furlough rules of 1868 shall apply to all warrant officers holding veteran or honorary commissions, the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of the commission. These officers will receive, during furlough, half their total receipts, without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate.\n\n2nd.\u2014That conductors and sub-conductors shall only be entitled to a furlough on sick certificate.
