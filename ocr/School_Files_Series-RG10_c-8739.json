The total cost, including labor, material and freight charges from Prince Rupert will amount approximately to $29.90 as follows:\n\n- 8 cedar posts, 8 ft. long - @ 4 ft. @ 10\u00a2 = 6.40\n- 200 feet lumber @ $25.00 = 7.50\n- nails = 1.00\n- labor = 10.00\n- freight charges to Kitkatla = 5.00\n\n$29.90\n\nApplication has also been made by the school teacher Mr. Shearman for calsimine and varnish to renovate the interior of the teacher's residence. The work will be carried out by himself. The following material will be required:\n\n- Calsimine 6 packages @ 75\u00a2 = 6.00\n- Varnish 1 gallon @ $6.00 = 6.00\n- Paint brushes 2 @ 75\u00a2 = 1.50\n\n$13.50\n\nIn view of the fact that the painting of the interior walls, ceilings and doors of the teacher's residence was not completed at the time the house was put up three years ago, the addition of a little paint to renovate the rooms would add considerably to the comfort of the teacher and his family.\n\nI would recommend that the repairs to the toilet and painting of the interior of the teacher's residence be carried out if funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

GOODREID, TEACHER,\nKITKATLA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, Dated May 3rd, 1937.\n\nOrig. on 168-18-1\n\nThe work of a teacher in this village is greatly handicapped by the school building. It stands on one of the poorest sites in the village. On two sides it is surrounded by houses and is within a few yards of high water mark. The school is too small, so old that the foundations are gone and of its last coat of paint only traces remain.\nOttawa, April 16, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your report for the month of March, you refer to the Kitkatla Indian Day School.\n\nProvision has been made in our appropriation this year for an amount of $150.00 to provide repairs at this school. Please let me have a detailed report, stating what repairs can be done for the amount mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nApril 6th, 1937.\n\nThe following report is forwarded for the month of March.\n\nTo my mind, the outstanding need at Kitkatla is a new school building as the present one is quite antique and should be replaced at the earliest opportunity. Some years ago the sum of $500.00 was spent on repairs, but now the foundation is in bad shape which would necessitate a further expenditure until a new building can be provided.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following articles for use at the Kitkatla Indian Day School:\n\n- 7 - stove pipes 6\"\n- 1 - stove pipe elbow\n- 10 - wooden slats for desks\n- 80 - \u00bd\" screws\n- 2 - padlocks\n- 2 - rolls paper roofing\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Collison\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 25th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to repairs required at the Kitkatla Indian Day School.\n\nProvision was made in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for an expenditure of $150 at this school, and you may, therefore, proceed with repairing the foundation. It is noted from your letter that the cost, including material, labour and transportation, will not exceed $150.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to authorize the exterior painting of the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nDear Sir:-\n\nRE: Repairs Kitkatla Day School.\n\nI wish to draw the attention of the Department to the need of repairs for the above named school.\n\nThe building is over 25 years old and is badly in need of repairs. When the building was first put up, the rear end was allowed to rest on the ground with the result that the sills are rotted and should be replaced, as the building is settling. It will be necessary to dig away part of the bank on which the end of the school rests in order to give free ventilation. The roof needs repairing, and, also new panes for the windows.\n\nThe entire cost of repairing the foundation, including labour, material and transportation, will be approximately $150.00 as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Labour                        | $65.00 |\n| Material (Lumber, nails, cedar posts, etc.) | $60.00 |\n| Transportation from Prince Rupert to Kitkatla | $25.00 |\n\nTotal: $150.00\n\nThe outside of the building should be painted at a cost of $25.00.\n\n3 gallons of paint @ $5.00 = $15.00\nLabour = $10.00\n\nTotal: $25.00\nI would recommend that this necessary work be carried out as soon as possible, and shall be glad to hear from the Department in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOffice of the Skeena River Indian Agency,\n\nMay 20-37\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 9058, amounting to $10.80 in favour of Gordon's Hardware.\n\nfor school supplies, hardware and transportation of same to Kitkatla A.U.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose application from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett to expend the sum of $40.15 on repairs to Kitkatla Indian Day School, the necessity of which was taken up in Mr. Inspector Barry's report of May 9th last.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Gillett states that if funds are not likely to be available next year for the replacement of this school it will be necessary to expend the sum of $400 in general repairs. I would point out, however, that Mr. Barry's construction program of July 6, 1939, with reference to distribution of Coqualeetza children set down the replacement of this school for the fiscal year of 1941-42 as Project No. 14.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour file 15/8/5614\n\nI submit herein a report on Kitkatla Indian Day School as requested in your letter of May 10.\n\nThe building was erected about 30 years ago and is in an unsuitable locality, being among the Indian houses and too near the beach. It does not now present a very good appearance as the roof is covered with lichen, which it would not be advisable to move as leaks may develop. The outside walls are weather worn and a number of boards are missing around the base. Three of the foundation posts need renewing. The inside walls are dark and dingy.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to build a new school in the near future, I recommend that only the minimum and necessary repairs be made this year, which are as follows:\n\nRepairs to windows.\n- 10 panes glass 14 x 22 $8.00\n- 5 lbs. putty .50\n- putty knife .35\n- labour (approx.) $8.00\n\nRepairs to ridgeboard.\n- 100 ft. lumber 1 x 6 4.00\n- labour 2.00\n\nRepairs to foundation.\n- 3 posts including labour 5.00\n\nRepairs to toilets.\n- 12 pcs. lumber 6\"x1\"x12\" 3.00\n- 4 lbs nails .30\n- labour erecting partition 4.00\n\nFreight on material. 5.00\n\n$40.15\nIf, however, it is foreseen that a new school is not likely to be built for a number of years, extensive repairs should be made next year. This would mean reshingling the roof, painting the walls inside and out and clearing up the surroundings at an approximate cost of $400.00. I will place such an item in the estimates for 1941-42.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG-B\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\nOttawa, July 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, you may expend an amount of $40.00 for material and labour to make necessary repairs at the Kitkatla Indian Day School. I note that you consider a new heater is required. Would it be possible to avoid replacing the heater this year?\n\nWhile you were advised in official letter of the 11th ultimo that $300.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for minor repairs and improvements at all the schools in the Skeena agency, it is now found necessary to incur a considerable expenditure in furnishing the Gitladanix teacher's residence. Consequently, when these purchases are made and payment made for the repairs at Kitkatla, there will be very little money left on hand.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.,\nJuly 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 11,\nI wish to state that the sum of $40.00 will be required\nfor repairs for Kitkatla Indian Day School. This would\ncover the following:\n\nWindows\n10 panes glass 14 x 22 $8.00\n5 lbs. putty .50\nputty knife .35\nlabour (approx.) 8.00\n\nRidgeboard\n160 ft. lumber 1 x 6 4.00\nlabour 2.00\n\nFoundation\n3 posts including labour 5.00\n\nToilets\n12 pcs. lumber 6\"x1\"x12\" 3.00\n4 lbs. nails .30\nlabour erecting partition 4.00\n\nFreight\n$40.15\n\nIndian Labour will not be available until\nSeptember. Rev. Mr. Shearman, the teacher, is watch-\nman at Kitkatla during the summer, and if it is in\norder I would recommend that he be allowed to under-\ntake the work.\n\nA new heater is required. This would cost\napproximately $42.00 including stove pipe.\n\nI hope the Department will purchase the desks\nwhich, as Captain Barry states, are urgently needed.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReporting on his inspection of the Kitkatla Indian Day School on the 9th ultimo Inspector Barry writes as follows:\n\n\"School is a very old building which requires much work done on it, foundations etc. Windows are now out of plumb. Glass broken in eight places. Windows boarded up in places to keep out wind, can not be opened. Indian Agent will no doubt do what he can to improve conditions till a new school can be erected on a better site. S No. 4 and S No. 3 single desks are most urgently needed, also new heater to burn coal.\"\n\nFrom previous reports received from you this Branch is aware that the Kitkatla School is in bad condition. Due to present conditions it was impossible to obtain the funds required for the erection of a new school. However, it is possible that a reasonable expenditure during the coming summer would place this building in a habitable condition for another year. In this connection I may say that an amount of $300.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for minor repairs and improvements required at all the day schools in the Skeena Agency. Please let me know what portion of this amount you would recommend be expended at Kitkatla.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Kitkatla Indian Bay School visited on May 9, 1940.\n\nSchool is a very old building which requires much work done on it, foundations etc. Windows are now out of plumb. Glass broken in eight places. Windows boarded up in places to keep out wind, cannot be opened. Indian Agent will no doubt do what he can to improve conditions till a new school can be erected on a better site. S No. 4 and S No. 3 single desks are most urgently needed, also new heater to burn coal.\nIt was pointed out that dilapidated buildings should be dismantled and when this was mentioned at Kitkatla, Chief Gamble replied that the department should teach the Indians an example by taking down the old school and building a new one.\n\nJ.

Provision was made in the current year's Estimates for this expenditure.\n\nThe Kitkatla school should be replaced by a new structure as soon as funds can be provided. It is not expected, however, that a new building can be erected during the existing emergency and it will be necessary to get along with such repairs as may from time to time be needed. The application is recommended for approval. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

I therefore recommend that the necessary repairs be carried out this year. This could be undertaken sometime this month when the Indians return home. The approximate cost will be:\n\nMaterial as per Requisition $83.75\nLabour 45.00\nFreight on material 15.00\nCartage from boat to school 5.00\n\nI recommend that the hardware be purchased from Messrs.

The teacher, Mrs. Grace Vickers, lit a candle in the morning and unfortunately placed it on a shelf near a window. A gale was in process and blew the candle over and set fire to the baby's bed. The mother heard the crackling of flames, but before the fire could be put out considerable damage was done to windows and interior.\n\nI ordered new glass on the 25th and sent it on a company packer but in a violent storm the crate was knocked over, the glass all smashed, hence the duplication of order, which is regretted.\n\nThe account is recommended for payment.\n\nF.

Of this amount it will be noted that $1128.64 will be for the purchase of equipment that could be used in another school on this or some other Reserve.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend approval of the application, and authority to engage an additional teacher for the extra room at the current salary.\n\nD.

Of this number, nine children are in Residential Schools leaving 75 to consider as the Day School population for the academic year 1946-47.\n\nA complete inspection of this village Day School was made on June 25th, in company with the Bishop of the Diocese, Rt.

It is considered that the following work will make the present classroom suitable for classroom use for two years if necessary:\n   (a) Paint the walls and ceilings two coats of cream paint.\n      Estimated cost, labour $27.00 - materials 7 gallons @ $4.01 $28.07.\n   (b) Paint the floor two coats green floor paint.\n      Estimated cost, labour $14.50 - materials 3 gallons @ $5.75 $11.25.\n   (c) Install 32 feet (4 - 8 foot sheets) green hyloplate, with framing and chalk rail.\n      Estimated cost $54.30, freight $3.70, total $58.00\n      labour $7.00 - total $65.00.\n   (d) Install new desks as follows:\n\n| Desks | Front | Rear |\n|-------|-------|------|\n| size  | 1-3-5 | 1-3-5 |\n| required | 8 8 8 | 1 1 1 |\n\nCost of desks - Clarke & Stuart Ltd., Vancouver.\n\n| 8 only desks size 5 @ $9.01 | $72.08 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 8 only desks size 3 @ 9.35  | 74.84  |\n| 8 only desks size 1 @ 9.75  | 78.00  |\n| 1 only desk front size 5 @ $6.72 | 6.72 |\n| 1 only desk front size 3 @ 7.63 | 7.63 |\n| 1 only desk front size 1 @ 8.47 | 8.47 |\nPage 3 continued:\n\n1 only desk rear size 5 @ $6.72  6.72\n1 only desk rear size 3 @ 7.63  7.63\n1 only desk rear size 1 @ 8.47  8.47\n\nFreight & handling to Kitkatla  31.00\nLabour an installation  36.00\n\nTotal cost of desks for room  $ 270.36\n\n(e) Install new concrete block chimney 24 ft. high.\nEstimated cost 48 blocks @ 75\u00a2 $36.00 - labour\n$25.00 - cement and lime $2.15 - total $62.15.\n\n(f) Provide a 12\" Coleman Oil Circulator, cost $117.80\nProvide 8, 6 inch stove pipes @ 20\u00a2  1.60\nTotal $119.40.\n\n(g) Provide a teacher's desk and chair - cost $55.60\n\n(h) Provide an install cupboards for school supplies -\ncost $36.00\n\nIt is considered that this installation would take care of the junior room of the school.\n\nTo take care of the older pupils it is recommended that the Department rent the Church Army Hall at a rate of $25.00 per month; that said Hall be used exclusively for a school and that the following labour and equipment be supplied for same.\n\n2. That a partition be erected across this Hall making a classroom 40' x 30' and that blackboards be installed on this partition.\n\nMaterials - 32 ft. green hyloplate 4' high, with framing and chalk rails complete - cost $54.30 - freight $3.70 - Total $58.00.\n750 f.b.m. 8\" shiplap for partition $56.00\n250 f.b.m. 2 x 4 for framing  15.00\nLabour installing boards and partition  15.00\n\nCost of partition and blackboards installed. $143.00\n(b) Install new desks as follows:\n\n| Desks | Front | Rear |\n|-------|-------|------|\n| size 1-3-5 | 1-3-5 | 1-3-5 |\n| required 918 9 | 1 2 1 | 1 2 1 |\n\nCost of desks - Clarke & Stuart Ltd., Vancouver.\n\n| Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 9 only desks size 5 @ $9.01 | 9 | $81.09 |\n| 18 only desks size 5 @ 9.33 | 18 | $167.94 |\n| 9 only desks size 1 @ 9.75 | 9 | $87.75 |\n| 1 only front size 5 @ 6.72 | 1 | $6.72 |\n| 2 only front size 5 @ 7.63 | 2 | $15.26 |\n| 1 only front size 1 @ 8.47 | 1 | $8.47 |\n| 1 only rear size 5 @ 6.72 | 1 | $6.72 |\n| 2 only rear size 5 @ 7.63 | 2 | $15.26 |\n| 1 only rear size 1 @ 8.47 | 1 | $8.47 |\n\nTotal cost of desks installed $397.68\n\nFreight and handling to Kitkatla $44.00\nLabour on installation $52.00\n\nTotal cost of desks installed $493.68\n\n(c) Provide a teacher's desk and chair, cost $55.60\n\n(d) Paint floors, 2 coats floor paint.\n\n4 gallons @ $3.75 $14.00\nLabour 19.00 - total $33.00\n\n(e) Install a 14\" Coleman Oil burning circulator $117.80\n18 lengths 6\" stove pipe, dampers & elbows $2.60\nTotal $121.40\n\n(f) Provide and install cupboards for schools supplies - cost $36.00\n\n(g) Purchase janitor's supplies as follows: 3 brooms @ $1.00; dustpans 2 @ 75\u00a2; dustbags, 1 keg 180 lbs. @ $6.80; paper towels, 1 doz. rolls @ 25\u00a2; soap, 1 doz. @ 15\u00a2; lysol, 1 gallon @ $2.10; paper handkerchiefs, 2 doz. @ 50\u00a2; 2 Coleman lamps @ $9.80\nTotal of supplies - $49.20\nPage 5 continued:\n\n(h) To build 2 outside toilets, cost, lumber, and material (for both classrooms) and labour $76.00\n\n(i) Stacking and piling Church Army equipment, pews, etc. at unused end of Hall, labour only $5.00\n\nGeneral:\n\nThis will make a working set-up at Kitkatla. It should be said that almost all of the material purchased will be usable in the new school to be built eventually at this village so little of the recommended expenditure will be lost.\n\nThe plan as suggested was approved by the Council of Kitkatla and concurred in by the Bishop, and is recommended to the Department for immediate action.\n\n| Summary of Expenditure | Old Classroom | Church Army Hall | Totals |\n|------------------------|---------------|------------------|--------|\n| Janitor's supplies (both rooms) | 49.20 | 49.20 |        |\n| Material for repairs, painting, etc. | 113.47 | 158.00 | 271.47 |\n| Desks, pupils and teachers, blackboards | 380.26 | 507.58 | 887.84 |\n| Heating equipment, stove pipes, etc. | 119.40 | 121.40 | 240.80 |\n| Labour on job | 109.50 | 129.00 | 238.50 |\n| Freight and handling | 34.70 | 47.70 | 82.40 |\n| Extra for contingencies on getting work in hand | 50.00 | 50.00 | 100.00 |\n\nTotal for two classrooms - $807.53 $1062.88 $1870.21\n\nThe Indians are fishing till September or October and no reliable labor from that source will be available. If the Department sanctions the plan as outlined, material can be purchased locally and white labour contracted or hired through local employment channels.\n\nIf the Department cannot finance the two rooms, it is recommended that the old classroom be repaired and equipped as noted and the School put on a half-day basis. The condition of the School at present is such that the provision of any less equipment or repairs would be a waste of public funds.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent\n\nPEA/pb\ncc.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia,\n\nWe have received a copy of Indian Agent Anfield's letter of July 2, addressed to you, with reference to the Kitkatla Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware, from your letter of June 12, Miss Anne Schmidt resigned, and at the present time we have not been advised of the nomination of any new teacher.\n\nIf two teachers can be secured, you may expend the amount recommended by Indian Agent Anfield. This means an expenditure of $807.33 on the old classroom and $1,062.88 for the new classroom.\n\nHowever, if only one teacher can be obtained, the Department does not see any necessity for expending the amount on the new classroom.\n\nThis authority is being given to you now, so that no time will be lost in the event of your receiving a nomination for either one or two teachers.\n\nBernard F.

If the Department sanctions the plan as outlined, material can be purchased locally and white labour contracted or hired through local employment channels.\n\nIf the Department cannot finance the two rooms, it is recommended that the old classroom be repaired and equipped as noted and the School put on a half-day basis. The condition of the School at present is such that the provision of any less equipment or repairs would be a waste of public funds.\n\nFr. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent\n\nFEA/pb\ncc.

Earl Anfield, Indian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of May 4, addressed to the Supervisor of Family Allowances, with reference to the condition of the Kitkatla School.\n\nOwing to conditions existing at the present time, I regret very much that I cannot see any prospect of erecting a new school at Kitkatla during the current calendar year. However, the necessity for such a building has been noted and we will endeavour to obtain funds for its erection in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nIn the meantime we are prepared to spend a reasonable amount in repairing the present building so as to make it as habitable as possible. If there is any building at Kitkatla that we could rent, temporarily, for school purposes, we would be willing to do so.\n\nPlease let me hear from you further regarding the above suggestions.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from letter from F. Earl Anfield, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C., dated May 4, 1946.\n\nOriginal on Family Allowance File\n\nThe Kitkatla school plant and general condition are bad. Seventy children are enrolled in a building that should be torn down. At best it should not seat more than 25; thirty to forty are jammed in at a session. The floors are in a dangerous condition and the walls and ceiling very poor. In cold weather the building is damp and drafty and it is almost impossible to heat the building, which is in charge of one teacher. Parents have refused to allow children to attend in bad weather, attendance being in their stated opinion a risk to the children's health. In this statement, I am compelled to concur.\n\nIt is urgent that this school be replaced with a modern two class-room building, including teachersage, and provision for a dispensary and Field Matron's quarters.\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Feb 28 | To material supplied to Kitkatla Indian Day School as per attached account | $4.00  |\n\nI took the liberty of ordering the above without authority as it was necessary for the school.\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

It is considered that the agent's estimates are low but, even should the estimated cost be exceeded by 50%, the use of the building would represent a considerable saving over new construction.\n\nMr. Davey in his memorandum points out that the proposed new construction at Hazelton cannot likely be proceeded with this year and funds allotted for this project might be used to meet our requirements at Kitkatla.\n\nMr. Anfield's proposal is recommended for favourable consideration and I should appreciate an immediate decision in order that the contractors with whom Mr. Anfield has been negotiating may be advised accordingly.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nAugust 30th, 1947\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: Kitkatla School\n\nThis school is very overcrowded and in addition is very old and extremely dilapidated. Estimates for 1947-48 included items for a new school. These have been repeated for the fiscal year 1948-49. There is a need for at least a two roomed and possibly three roomed school for this village. To date one teacher, Mrs. Nellie Campbell, has been appointed for this school. She arrives in Prince Rupert on August 30th and arrangements are being made to take her to Kitkatla next week.\n\nIn Kitkatla there is a real need for a medical dispensary and nursing station, with quarters for a nurse or village matron. Items to cover this construction have been placed in the current medical estimates. The Indian Health Services have authorized a radio phone installation for this village. It is obviously impossible to get materials for a new school this fall and consideration is requested to the following plan, which may solve the temporary school needs of this village.\n\n(1) There is available at Group 4, ex R.C.A.F. Camp, Prince Rupert, a loxstave building 76 x 24 x 10. Specifications of this building are attached here-with. The prices of same, as is, where is, being $1,050.00\n\n(2) I have inspected this building very carefully inside and out and have secured the following bids on the dismantling and removal of same. The cost of taking down and rebuilding at Kitkatla - $800.00; cost of transporting material to scow, loading same and transporting to Kitkatla and unloading there approximately - $1,450.00, though the outfits contacted are unable to give a firm bid at this time, as it is almost impossible to know exactly how long the scows may have to remain on charter.\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nPage 2.\n\n(3) The cost of new equipment including stoves, cupboards, blackboards and a coat of paint in the interior will cost approximately $500.00. To this should be added $200.00 for a Barrett roof.\n\nThe total cost of putting this building into operation as a two roomed school at Kitkatla should not exceed $4,000.00. The building is only three years old, it cost the Government $7,000.00 to erect and the loss on demolition of this type of building should not exceed 4%. Attached please find two snaps of the building in question. Contractors demolishing Group 4 agree to give us ten days in which to accept or reject this building. It is considered that this would be a good buy from every point of view. The building has a life expectancy of at least twenty years and it would be readily convertible to a nursing station, combined with quarters for field matron and two teachers, should the Department later decide to build a modern school at this village. It should be remembered in considering the urgency of the needs at Kitkatla that during the past two years only senior grade children have been able to go to school in this village. It was suggested last year that the Church Army Hall be converted for temporary use as a class room. This is no longer possible, as last winter storms weakened this building to the place where it is now propped up with poles and would be unsafe for a school.\n\nConsideration of the purchase and re-erection of this building #12 is recommended. If the plan is not feasible for financial reasons, would you please advise at once so that the contractors may be given an opportunity to dispose of it forthwith.\n\nF.

This is 2 x 6 tongued and grooved loxstave cedar. It has mineralized roofing. Three ply veneer board, fir floor, 29 windows, 6 lights 16 x 10, 7 doors, 11 toggle switches, 9 wall plugs, 3 receptacles, 1/4 glass bowls, one wash basin and one toilet. We have 1 - 60 amp 2 - 20 volt switch box, 1 - 18 circuit panel, 4 night latches. There are two partitions in this building and our price on this is $1050. This cost the government $7,000.\n\nWe enclose picture from two different sides of this building, and if you purchase; the sight must be left with all the rubbish burned and must be dismantled and taken away in 40 days time from date of your acceptance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSpies & Meckling.\n\n(Sgd.) per R.P. SPIES.\n\nRPSif\nencl.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner\n\nFrom: Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nI refer to Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter dated August 30th, 1947, in which he proposes the purchase of a building of logstave construction at Prince Rupert for use at Kitkatla for school purposes. There has been considerable correspondence on the need for further accommodation at the point, and in February of this year, when I visited the school, I noted that it was impossible to accommodate all of the pupils, the beginners and Grade I pupils being excluded. It seems improbable that this need can be met by ordinary methods for some time, and the use of this building will relieve the situation for a considerable period. In a report dated July 2nd, 1946, Mr. Anfield stated that there were 75 children of school age who should be accommodated in the Day School in the 1946-47 academic year. He also stated in the same report that the foundation of the present school was in fair condition. This building could be used to accommodate a third class if necessary.\n\nMr. J.M. Wardle, Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, in a report dated November 10th, 1946, on similar buildings at the Port Hardy Camp, stated that it was practical to transport these buildings within a radius of sixty miles. The distance from Prince Rupert to Kitkatla is well within this limit.\n\nThe estimate of $4000. for this work seems to be rather small, but the use of the building would represent a considerable saving over new construction, which, under the present condition of shortages, is impossible.\n\nAlthough no funds have been allocated for this work, it might be possible to divert some of the money intended for the construction of the new school at Hazelton, which cannot be undertaken this year.\n\nI recommend that the purchase of this building be authorised subject to Mr. Anfield securing the services of a contractor to dismantle, transport and re-erect the building at Kitkatla.\nIt is also suggested that Mr. Anfield secure the release from the Band of a suitable site for the location of this building at Kitkatla.\n\nR.F. Davey\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1947-48    | Sept. 9 To storage &on Kitkatla school desks while awaiting shipment to village, as per att'd account | $1.50  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Attached is a statement indicating the situation as we see it now.\n\nYou will note that we have actually allotted an amount of $47,500, and in view of the increased cost at Alert Bay over the amount estimated, we are inclined to feel that the estimated expenditure at the other proposed schools will be over the original estimate.\n\nWith the above in mind we have hesitated authorizing the purchase and moving of the loxstave building.\n\nIt is possible that you do not propose to build all the buildings mentioned in the attached statement. If so, and if there is an amount of $4,050 available from the total mentioned on our statement, we have no objection to you proceeding with the Kitkatla project.\nThe point to be kept in mind is that the total expenditure that we can allow for the erection of new day schools in British Columbia during the current fiscal year is $47,500.\n\nBernard F.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th instant, file 6-11-3 with reference to the erection of buildings at the Alert Bay Day School as a result of securing camp buildings from Fort Hardy Military Camp.\n\nWe note that the cost at Alert Bay will amount to approximately $25,000, and arrangements will be made to forward you an additional accountable cheque for $5,000.00.\n\nAs mentioned in our letter, the cost of the buildings at Alert Bay will be considerably more than the original estimate. However, the main fact to keep in mind is our letter of October 4th, 1947 in which you were advised of the total amount allotted for new buildings in British Columbia this year. The total mentioned in that letter cannot be exceeded but outside of that feature, we are quite prepared to be guided by any recommendations that you make.\n\nI might add that we have submitted the contents of your letter of October 14th regarding attention to the Deputy Minister. We have not yet received his reply but when this reaches us we will communicate with you immediately.\n\nBernard Henry\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 24, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Kitkatla Indian Day School,\nKeena Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nThe Kitkatla school is in very bad condition and we have received a report from Indian Commissioner MacKay suggesting that the following action be taken:\n\n(1) The purchase of a locustave building 76x24x10 from the K.C.A.R. camp at Prince Rupert $1,200.\n\n(2) Removing building from present site, shipping and re-erection by Northwest Construction Company $2,600.\n\n(3) Purchase of desks, blackboards and other equipment and miscellaneous expenses $466.\n\nTotal expenditure - - - $4,266.\n\nOwing to the fact that we have not been able to erect other Indian day schools in British Columbia this year, funds to the above amount are available in the current year's appropriation.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate it if you would approve Indian Commissioner MacKay's recommendation to use the amount mentioned above in order to provide a proper school on the Kitkatla Reserve.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of October 4th and correspondence from Mr. Indian Agent Anfield in connection with the proposed purchase and re-erection of a logstave building for school purposes at the Kitkatla reserve, Mr. Anfield has now secured firm bids from Messrs. Spies and Mackling and North-West Construction Company covering purchase of the building and its removal and reconstruction at Kitkatla.\n\nThe Agent's letter of October 15th and enclosures referred to therein are attached hereto for your information. It is regretted that the proposal has now become somewhat confused in that the Agent's original submission was for the purchase, removal and reconstruction of a building to provide two classrooms, whereas the plan prepared by North-West Construction Co., submitted herewith, shows one classroom with living quarters, which, in my opinion, are unnecessary as we already have accommodation for the teachers at Kitkatla. I am today writing to Mr. Anfield for clarification of the proposal and am prepared to recommend approval of the project if the construction of the logstave building is such that it can be converted to provide two classrooms.\n\nWith regard to the question of funds, and referring to the list submitted with Mr. Neary's letter above-referred to it is not anticipated that we will be able to take advantage of the funds provided for school construction at\nPage 2.\n\nAt Hazelton this year, nor does it appear that construction at Seabird Island will be proceeded with unless a contract can be let.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is reasonable to suppose that use of $8,000 of the $7,500 allotted to the Province for the construction of a school at Kitkatla will not interfere with construction which we would otherwise be able to carry out.\n\nI should appreciate therefore authority for Mr. Anfield to proceed with his proposal on the understanding that the cost will not exceed the amount mentioned in his letter of October 15th, namely $4,266.00 and that the building will provide two classrooms.\n\nA reply by airmail would be appreciated.\n\nD.

Earl Amfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nenclosure.\nJanuary 12, 1943.\n\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nRe: Kitkatla School Building\n\nI have to refer to your letter of December 30th and previous correspondence in connection with the contract covering the purchase, removal and re-erection of a 76 x 24 loxstave building at Kitkatla for school purposes. Your voucher in favour of the North west Construction Company is returned herewith as the account does not conform with the construction Company's contract, and although I realize the Company is not in any way to blame and the necessity for delaying payment of their account is regretted, I feel that it would be advisable for Messrs. Spies and Mackling to make an adjustment with the Northwest Construction Company in connection with insulation costs.\n\nI also feel that Messrs. Spies and Mackling should make an adjustment with the Northwest Construction Company for the additional materials required and supplied to increase the length of the loxstave building from 60 feet to 76 feet. We are in a position to take a firm stand insofar as Messrs. Spies and Mackling are concerned as the building supplied was not in accordance with their tender, being 16 feet short and not a standard loxstave. It would not be unreasonable to require Spies and Mackling to reduce the amount of their bid to us by $741.67, being the cost of additional materials supplied by the Construction Company, and the difference between the cost of second hand insulation material and new material, $310.00. We could then make a reasonable settlement with the Northwest Construction Ltd., but if this proposal is not satisfactory to Spies and Mackling they can make their own adjustment with the Construction Co., and both companies should be required to give written evidence of satisfaction with respect to any agreement reached. In your further report you might advise what action was taken to ensure that the building supplied by the Company was the one originally agreed upon.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCompany but if not consideration can be given to this problem at a later date when their account is received.\n\nW.S.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached please find Voucher #1324 in the sum of $2,690.00 being made up as follows:\n\n| Contract          | $2,500.00 |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| Insulation        | $390.00   |\n| **Total**         | $2,890.00 |\n\nLess $200.00 - credit on towing\n\n$2,690.00\n\nThis account is in order for payment, with the following explanations:\n\nAn item of $80.00 was included in the estimate for purchase of used insulation for this building. When we came to get it, the insulation had been sold and rather than delay the job I instructed the North West Construction Company to buy it and proceed. This was done at a cost of $390.00. To help meet the cost of this material I arranged for Indians to tow the scowload of material for the building to Kitkatla and the North West Company allowed a credit of $200.00 for this service. This leaves a sum of $190.00, which is chargeable to the total Vote of $4,266.00 for this school. I intend to debit the account of Spies and Mackling for part of this sum as they agreed to see that the used insulation was available.\n\nI went over this building at Kitkatla yesterday and having in mind the difficulties of construction, believe that we have a strong and warm building which will fully meet the needs of the school for some time to come. I arranged for the moving of desks and equipment into the new building in which we have put a temporary stove to dry it out. The blackboard and a new stove will be shipped out as soon as present stormy weather abates. I would anticipate that school could start by the end of January next. Would you ask the Department to\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 168-18-5 (WT)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's army signals' message of November 5th advising that approval had been secured for an expenditure up to $4,266 for the provision of a two classroom school at Kitkatla, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of December 20th and Skeena River voucher No. 1324 in the amount of $2,500 payable to the North-west Construction Company, covering the removal and re-erection of a loxstave building at Kitlatla in accordance with their tender. This is not the voucher referred to in the Agent's letter, it having been returned to him for amendment, reference my letter of January 12th to Mr. Anfield, a copy of which is attached.\n\nYou will note from the correspondence attached that the vendors did not supply a 76 ft. loxstave building but a 60 ft. building, and that the construction company provided loxstave material to complete the structure in accordance with their contract. This will obviously necessitate some adjustment between the vendor and the construction company but inasmuch the Department has a two classroom building 76 x 24, completed in accordance with the construction company's tender in all respects, I feel that their account should be passed for payment and I would so recommend and would ask that the cheque be forwarded to them by air mail as requested by Mr. Anfield.\n\nWith regard to the account of the vendor, Messrs. Spies and Meckling, I have no doubt that they will be able to make some adjustment with the Northwest Construction\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

The coding is as follows: 516-821-13-491.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nVancouver, Feb. 3, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 168-18-5 (WT)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's army signals' message of November 5th advising that approval had been secured for an expenditure up to $4,266 for the provision of a two classroom school at Kitkatla, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of December 20th and Skeena River voucher No. 1324 in the amount of $2,500, payable to the North-west Construction Company, covering the removal and re-erection of a loxstave building at Kitkatla in accordance with their tender. This is not the voucher referred to in the Agent's letter, it having been returned to him for amendment, reference my letter of January 12th to Mr. Anfield, a copy of which is attached.\n\nYou will note from the correspondence attached that the vendors did not supply a 76 ft. loxstave building but a 60 ft. building, and that the construction company provided loxstave material to complete the structure in accordance with their contract. This will obviously necessitate some adjustment between the vendor and the construction company but inasmuch the Department has a two classroom building 76 x 24, completed in accordance with the construction company's tender in all respects, I feel that their account should be passed for payment and I would so recommend and would ask that the cheque be forwarded to them by air mail as requested by Mr. Anfield.\n\nWith regard to the account of the vendor, Messrs. Spies and Meckling, I have no doubt that they will be able to make some adjustment with the Northwest Construction Company but if not consideration can be given to this problem at a later date when their account is received.\n\n(Signed) W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJanuary 12, 1948.\n\nF.E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nRe: Kitkatla School Building\n\nI have to refer to your letter of December 30th and previous correspondence in connection with the contract covering the purchase removal and re-erection of a 76 x 24 lorstave building at Kitkatla for school purposes. Your voucher in favour of the Northwest Construction Company is returned herewith as the account does not conform with the construction Company's contract, and although I realize the Company is not in any way to blame and the necessity for it would be advisable for Messrs. Spies and Mackling to make an adjustment with the Northwest Construction Company in connection with insulation costs.\n\nI also feel that Messrs. Spies and Mackling should make an adjustment with the Northwest Construction Company for the additional materials required and supplied to increase the length of the lorstave building from 60 feet to 76 feet. We are in a position to take a firm stand insofar as Messrs. Spies and Mackling are concerned as the building supplied was not in accordance with their tender, being 15 feet short and not a standard lorstave. It would not be unreasonable to require Spies and Mackling to reduce the amount of their bid to us by $741.67, being the cost of additional materials supplied by the Construction Company, and the difference between the cost of second hand insulation material and new material, $310.00. We could then make a reasonable settlement with the Northwest Construction Ltd., but if this proposal is not satisfactory to Spies and Mackling they can make their own adjustment with the Construction Co., and both companies should be required to give written evidence of satisfaction with respect to any agreement reached. In your further report you might advise what action was taken to ensure that the building supplied by the Company was the one originally agreed upon.\n\n(Signed) D.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6397, File 821-5, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Kitkatla Indian Day School\n\nWe have had considerable correspondence with Superintendent Anfield regarding the above-mentioned school building, half of which apparently was occupied by the Indian Health Services nurse last year, school being conducted in the other half of the building and the old classroom building. Although Mr. Anfield suggested that the arrangement with regard to classroom accommodation should be continued this year and the half of the building occupied by the Indian Health Services converted for use as a teachers' office did not agree with the proposal in view of his comments on many previous occasions with regard to the condition of the old classroom.\n\nIt has been decided that it would be preferable to complete this building which was constructed last year at a cost of $4266.00 for use as two classrooms and to carry out minor repairs to the United Church Mission House to accommodate the teachers. Superintendent Anfield's letter of August 9th in this connection is enclosed and I would recommend the Department endeavour to make funds to the extent of $960.54 available and that $601.00 of this amount be forwarded to Mr. Anfield to meet labour costs. While this is quite a large expenditure we will, following completion of the work, have a satisfactory two room school for approximately $5100.00.\n\nW.S.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRes: Kitkatla Indian Day School\n\nAttached please find 37A and bids on material required for repairs to the Kitkatla Indian Day School in the ensuing fiscal year. These are submitted in compliance with a circular from the Department asking for lists of material required for school repairs as early as possible in the fiscal year.\n\nThe Kitkatla School requires a coal storage shed. Up until now we have tried to keep the coal and fuel for this school underneath the building but it is an unsatisfactory system and a proper shed under lock and key is essential.\n\nIt is also necessary to carry out considerable repairs on the school toilets, which suffered severely under the heavy gales of the past winter.\n\nPurchase of this material is recommended and an accountable advance for $150.00 for labour requested.\n\nF.

The extra expenses are incurred for the following items\u2014\n\nFinishing new building 100.00\nPulling down old missionhouse 50.00\nNew wood and coal shed 40.00\nToilet 30.00\nWater tank 30.00\nBox drains 10.00 \u00a3250.00\n\nThe building appears to be very satisfactory and has been well put up. All the outside doors and window facings etc., have received one coat of paint to protect them from the weather. I would recommend that the whole building be given another coat of paint next summer when weather conditions are better.\n\nAs far as the old mission house is concerned, the building is very old, and no use could be made of the windows or doors. The house must be over thirty years old. The best part of the old\nlumber will be used in the erection of the coal shed, construction of box drains, and plank walks around the building.\n\nIt will also be necessary to partly furnish the new building, and in this connection I would recommend the purchase of the following, as per my wire to the Department.\n\n1 cookstove, McClary's Regina $60.00\n1 heater for living room, McClary's $30.00\n12 window blinds @ $1.25 $15.75\n6 kitchen chairs at $1.75 $10.50\n62 sq.yds of linoleum for liv.room $33.00\nLino for kitchen & dispensary @ $1.50 per sq.yd.\n2 lin.squares for bedrooms @ $16.00 $32.00\nFreight to Kitkatla $10.75 $250.00\n\nThe prices quoted are the lowest obtainable in Prince Rupert consistent with quality and service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.C., JJ Indian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the erection of a teacher's residence at Kitkatla, for which authority has already been granted you to have this work carried out.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that the only available site for this house requires clearing and that you recommend that a small bedroom be added to the original plan to provide accommodation for the teacher's family. The Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of approximately $500 to cover the cost of this additional room and the clearing of the ground, which will make a total of approximately $2,800 for the construction of the building and clearing of the land, and the Department will be pleased if a saving in this amount can be effected. You will be forwarded under separate cover accountable cheque No. 1759 for $1,000 to pay the cost of the labour employed on this work, and this should be accounted for by time sheets, in duplicate, covering the amount paid by you from this advance to the individual labourers employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB.C.\nSir:\u2014\n\nWith further reference to the erection of a teacher's residence at Kitkatla, for which authority has been given by the Department, I beg to state that on further consideration of the plans, copy of which was forwarded to the Department, I beg to recommend the addition of another small bedroom for the accommodation of the teacher's two children, which is very necessary.\n\nThe only available site for the house will need clearing and I think an extra $500.00 will cover both cost of additional room and clearing of ground.\n\nThe plan and estimate submitted to the Department had been prepared by Mr. J. Mitchell of Prince Rupert, who superintended the erection of the Massett Bay School in 1923 and had also carried out repairs to the school building at Kitkatla two years ago and therefore is well acquainted with conditions at that place. I will however, interview Mr. W.J. Greer as requested, with regard to the building of the residence.\n\nTo expedite matters I shall be glad to receive an advance of $1,000.00 so that work may be put in hand at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 7th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of July 27th of last year with reference to the proposed teachers' residence at the Kitkatla Indian Reserve, I beg to advise you that you may proceed with the erection of this building by day labour in accordance with the plan submitted with your letter.\n\nMr. W. J. Greer may be employed as foreman. The lumber required may be purchased from the Hanson Lumber and Timber Company and Messrs. Albert and McCaffery of Prince Rupert. Hardware may be purchased from Messrs. Ross & McNulty.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, for all material should be forwarded to the Department in detail, duly certified by yourself.\n\nTime sheets are being sent you, under separate cover, and should be forwarded to the Department in duplicate for all labour employed on the work. An accountable cheque for payment of labour will be sent you on application.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of this building at $2500.00.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. B. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOttawa, December 10, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, relative to your telegram requesting authority to incur an expenditure of approximately $250 in the purchase of furnishings for the teacher's residence at the Kitkatla Indian Day School, and also requesting authority to expend a further amount of $250 in completing the building.\n\nIn reply I have to confirm the following telegram of the 2nd instant, relative to the purchase of equipment for the residence:\n\n\"Reference your telegram you may purchase after securing prices from suitable sources equipment for teacher's residence Kitkatla School. Do not exceed your estimate.\"\n\nThe Department will also approve of your incurring an expenditure of approximately $250 in finishing the new building, building wood and coal shed, toilet, water tank, box drains and in pulling down old mission house.\n\nAfter you have made purchase of the furnishings as mentioned in your letter to the amount authorized above, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. You should also forward properly certified vouchers covering the advance sent you to pay the labour in clearing the site and erecting the residence, and certified accounts covering the cost of material purchased for use in erecting the residence.\n\nRegarding your recommendation that this building be given another coat of paint next summer, I have to say that you should draw this matter to the attention of the Department next spring, stating, at that time, the approximate cost of material and labour in having the work recommended by you carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, January 25th., 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose cheque for $630.62, which please wire to the credit of W.E.Collison with your branch at Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nI enclose blank telegraph form franked.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[F.H.

Vouchers Nos. 3829 and 3840 with accounts attached for blue prints and incidental expenses are also enclosed. Accounts for material were forwarded under cover of my letter dated January 10th.\n\nAs will be seen from the statement attached, the building has cost $3,407.97, being $157.97 in excess of the authorized appropriation. Unfortunately, this could not be avoided owing to unforeseen expenses and delays caused by continued bad weather, and the fact that the building was put up by day labor.\n\nThe appropriation having already been exceeded, the painting of the building and bathroom fixtures have been deferred until funds are available. I would recommend that this work be done during the coming summer, if satisfactory to the Department.\n\nThe $250.00 authorized for stoves, linoleum etc. was expended and proper vouchers will be forwarded. The house has been well constructed, and it is satisfactory to know the work is now completed as it entailed much time and trouble.\n\nIndian labor was employed as much as possible. One copy of Mr. Scott's return of labor is enclosed for the Department's information, and I shall be glad to receive the amount due to him for wages as shown thereon\u2014 if possible by wire to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Prince Rupert.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nStatement of Expenditure in connection with construction of new residence for teacher at Kitkatla Indian Day School, Kitkatla Reserve.\n\nLumber, Hardware etc. as per vouchers- 3793 to 3802 1749.10\nWages paid as per returns of labor 970.62\nIncidental expenses, blue prints, plans etc. 28.25\nWages due Geo.

(RG 10, Volume 6398, File 821-8, part 1)\nOttawa,\nApril 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo it is found necessary to return your voucher No. 664 in connection with supplying electricity to the Kitkatla School.\n\nThe Department was not previously aware that this building was wired for electricity. For your information I may say that it is not our practice to install electricity in any Indian day school in Canada. However, it has been decided to pay the account which you submitted but it is felt that the Kitkatla Council should be willing to supply electricity for this building free of charge in the future. Otherwise the service will have to be disconnected.\n\nHowever, before paying the account it will be necessary to have more detailed information regarding the first entry on the account; namely, a charge of $15.00. An explanation of this item should be attached to the voucher which should then be returned for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.

The $25.00 is the charge the Council makes to all houses for supplying and installing the wire from the main line to the residence. Fifteen dollars of this amount was evidently paid by the former teacher, Mr. Goodreid, from his own funds.\n\nThese are the first bills that have been received in connection with light supplied to the teacher's residence, at Kitkatla.\n\nIt is regretted that the Council did not submit the 1940 bills last year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

This will give that place the number of children, of school age, of 13 instead of 6 as heretofore; and the indications are favourable that that number will be augmented by more in the near future. The process of taking up the new settlement has been much slower than I, at first, anticipated, but hope that the long patience will be rewarded in this respect.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Green in his report on the Kitsegukla Day School states that Miss Edgar is maintaining two Indian girls whose parents live too far away from the school for them to attend and he considers that some allowance should be made her for their board.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department have a report on this matter, with a recommendation as to what allowance you think should be made Miss Edgar.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I am of the opinion that the Indian Agent can greatly assist in this if he will try.\nOttawa, December 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of September 26th, last, in reference to the removal of the Indians from the old to the new Kitsegukla village and to ask when the Department may expect the report asked for therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOttawa, September 24, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Green in his report on the Kitas-akla school refers to the fact that there is still a number of Indians of this band who live in the old village.\n\nIt is sometime now since the Department has heard from you with regard to the progress being made in the removal of these families. I have to ask you to be good enough to report by return mail and also to use every influence you can to induce the members of the band to take up their residence on the new reserve, where conditions are more favourable and where there is school accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith regard to the Departmental letter, dated the 27th of February, last, in the matter of remunerating Miss Edgar (Mrs. Mary Anne Edgar) of New Kitsegukla for the maintenance of four Indian girls, who are kept in residence there owing to the fact that they live too far distant from the school to attend; and stating that the Department were not prepared to pay $5.00 per week, but would allow that sum per month for the care of each of these children, and to submit a voucher at the end of the quarter for the months of January, February and March, last, and voucher No. 78, for $60.00, followed, and the payment to Mrs. Mary Anne Edgar by cheque, I have the honour to state that I was requested to ask of the Department to likewise have extended that allowance for the current quarter, for the months of April, May and June, inclusively.\n\nIn regard thereto, I would respectfully recommend that this request be granted, since this school (Kitsegukla) has of late been making great improvements, and out of consideration that the Revd. Geo. Edgar and family are very deserving of consideration, not only in the respect of conducting the school, but the good work amongst the Indians of that settlement in general.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 27, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the matter of remunerating Miss Edgar, teacher of the New Kitsesukla school, for the maintenance of four Indian girls who are kept in residence by her owing to the fact that they live too far distant from the school to attend, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to pay $5.00 per week, but will allow that sum per month for the care of each of these children.\n\nIf this is satisfactory you may submit a voucher at the end of the quarter for the months of January, February and March. This with the help that she should receive from the parents ought to compensate her for the work involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Lorin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nRegarding the Departmental letter, dated the 19th of September last, in that Mr. Inspector Green in his report on the Kitsegukla Day School stated that Miss Edgar is maintaining two Indian girls whose parents live too far away from the school for them to attend, and considers that some allowance should be made for their board, and whereupon I am asked to let the Department have a report on this matter, with recommendation as to what allowance I would think should be made Miss Edgar, I have the honour to state the following, to wit:-\n\nThe said report should have read that Mrs. Mary Anne boarded and cared, under the conditions named, for four (4) girls, namely:-\n\nFanny Wesley 8,\nMaria Wesley 10, Hetsey Brown 11, and Selina Brown 9 years of age, respectively,\n\nwhich in the instance may be arranged to come into force, @ $5.00 per week each, since the 11th of October, last; this being the date whereupon the Health Officer, Horace C. Wrinch, M.D., gave permission to re-open this school as having passed the late measles period.\n\nIn this connection I can conscientiously recommend the payment to be arranged for at that rate. Revd. Geo. Edgar and family are poor but very worthy people, and do a considerable lot of good amongst the Indians in general. In this instance, Mrs. Mary Anne Edgar cares for the aforementioned four girls as if they were her own daughters, and the charge of $5.00, for each, for board, lodging, inclusive of washing and mending their clothes, and with other incidental concerns, I consider fair and just under the extremely high cost of subsistence here.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letters, dated the 26th of September, last, and the 12th ultimo, regarding to the removal of the Indians from the Old to the New Kitsegukla village, with the request of my report thereupon, I have the honour to state the following in connection therewith,\n\nto wit:-\n\nFor the last 17 years have I incessantly been working on finding ways and means whereupon to effect this purpose, but with very poor results, though one family, since the receipt of the former cited letter, has been making that move.\n\nThough for nearly a quarter of a century among these people, I have not early enough made use of the experience that instead of coaxing, had I made the dictum:-\n\n\"You must not get upon the New Kitsegukla Reserve, it is forbidden ground,\" the result would have been as by magic in the perverse order, and would have had them crawling there over night. This can be instanced in the case of Andimaul becoming established. There, about 14 years ago I discouraged the Indians all I could. So soon as they heard of my leaving for a visit to Fort St. James, the people of Old Kitsegukla took down as many as a dozen houses, and rafted them thither, even at night, and Andimaul had become, with others of Kitwanga and Kitwankool joining, a fixture upon my return. I incline to the opinion that upon garden produce becoming more of steady demand, the worthless land about the old village will in the near future become, in toto, exchanged for the fertile soil of the new settlement.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, June 5, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo with reference to the allowance made to Mrs. Mary Anne Edgar, teacher of the Kitsesukla Indian School, for the maintenance of the four Indian girls while attending her school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will continue the grant for the maintenance of these children at the rate mentioned in official letter of the 27th of February last, and you may submit a voucher at the end of the current quarter for this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Wrinch, M.D., in charge of the Methodist Missions in these upper parts of the Skeena, joins.\n\nIn support thereof, I can state that in the premises the said pupils are extremely well taken care of, and for their use much of larger clothing is being remodelled and fitted; and by Mrs. Edgar the children are regularly being bathed, and those of the girl pupils (4) are being trained in house-keeping and other domestic science.\n\nIn view of the high prices of provisions prevailing, I beg to recommend that an additional allowance of at least $1.00 per each pupil (6) per month may kindly be granted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose the results of the diary of the work done with the six children in my care from the old Sagamok.

(RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-1, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have learned that George Edgar who has been teaching at Kitsegucka, assisted by his daughter Hanna, is quite crippled up with rheumatism and neither he nor his daughter will be able to continue teaching the school.\n\nHe is a worthy man and they have been doing work there for some years. If we were to send a lady teacher at a salary of $600.00 would the Department favor the appointment of Mrs. Edgar as deaconess nurse to the band at a salary of $400. The Church could then pay Mr. Edgar a small salary of about $400.00 for what missionary work he would be able to do.\n\nIn this way we could retain their services among these people. This proposition would mean an expenditure of $900.00 on the part of the Department. On the other hand if we were to dispose of their services we would have to provide for a male teacher at the cost of at least $300.00.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

Perry, was passed on to me under date of the 29th ibid., relative the change of locality of the Indian Day School from New Kitsegukla to Old Kitsegukla, and wherein I find it mentioned that a Miss Wright would be its prospective teacher, and that some arrangement would have to be considered in securing suitable quarters for her class room work, and, if possible, for her residence, etc.\n\nNow, because of the transport of the desks, etc., from one locality to the other, I respectfully beg to be informed whether the authority may be extended me of incurring the necessary expenses in transport of the desks, which, at a distance of about nine miles, because of a very steep hill, may have to be accomplished by rafting, or by teaming for reasons that in the former instance it prove somewhat too hazardous on account of a passage of some rapids.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE KITSOGUKLA DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is closed. The school has not been in operation since June 30.\n\nThe people have nearly all moved back to Old Kitsogukla which is six miles away. There are only seven children left on this reserve. Five of these are of school age. I expect that two or three of these five will go to a boarding or industrial school.\n\nI am informed that it has been decided to open a day school at Old Kitsogukla.\n\nI received a letter from the Rev.

He has also been informed that the school at this point will be closed, as the Indians have moved back to old Kitsegukla, where the school will now be conducted.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to take the necessary steps to secure a competent teacher to take charge of the Old Kitsegukla School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev.

Kindly advise Mr. Ferrier, who stated that he could secure the services of a competent teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, October 21, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to discontinue the grant allowed you for the maintenance of certain Indian girls, who were kept in residence by you owing to their residing too far distant from the day school, which was conducted by you in New Kitsegukla, to attend regularly.\n\nThe Department is informed that the Indians have moved from this point to Old Kitsegukla, and a day school will be opened there for the benefit of the Indian children at that place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nMiss Hannah Edgar,\nHazelton,\nB.

The school at this point will be closed as the Indians have moved back to Old Kitsegukla and a school will be conducted at that point.\n\nMiss Edgar is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nR.

He states that this house is situated in an ideal locality and has the advantage of having ground suitable for a garden in connection therewith.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state that by Miss M. B.

J. Smeaton who is substituting for the regular teacher at the Kitseguala Indian Day School. Your letter of the 5th instant, in which you nominated this gentleman, did not indicate that you had made any specific offer and the Department took it for granted that he was on the ground and was employed by his Church. It was considered, therefore, that a smaller stipend would be fair. I telegraphed Mr. Indian Agent Hyde for his recommendation and he stated that the substitute was satisfactory.\n\nPlease bring this matter to the attention of the Department when you are in Ottawa next month and a decision will be reached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You have failed to make a recommendation regarding salary, and the Department is in doubt as to what amount to allow. I note that he will be a missionary teacher, and in this event, I believe the Church should pay a fair share of his stipend. You might let me know what are Mr. Ede's qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

The Department does not appear to have received any reply from you regarding this matter but the September quarter return of the school has just been received and it shows a Mr. Ede in charge.\n\nIn forwarding the return, Mr. Indian Agent Hyde draws attention to the fact that, previous to the opening of the school, he had not received any intimation in connection with Mr. Ede's appointment. Please let me know, as soon as possible, if Mr. Ede was nominated by you and, also, the salary which you recommend be paid. From the quarterly return submitted by Mr. Ede, it is shown that, while he arrived at the school on September 8th, he did not begin teaching until September 17th. It would appear, therefore, that he is only entitled to salary for part of the month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

I wrote Miss Wright and in reply she informed me did not resign her position at Kitsegukla. I was very much surprised to see a foreign lady installed as teacher; the Department has not notified me of the change, neither have I had notice of the change from the officials of the United Church.\n\nI am sure the Department cannot be aware of this appointment and I therefore request that Miss Wright be appointed as teacher at Kitsegukla Indian Day School at the rate allowed Miss Wright. I have seen Miss Wright and believe her to be competent to fill the position. She has had a good teaching experience among the Indians at Fort Simpson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 16, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, informing the Department that Miss M. B. Wright, teacher of the Kitsegukla Indian Day School, intends to resign. In view of the services that Miss Wright has performed at this school, the Department regrets that she is giving up duties. It is noted that you have corresponded with her requesting her to forward her resignation. When you receive same, it should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nIn the meantime, we are taking up with Rev. T. Perrier, Inspector of Indian Schools and Hospitals, United Church of Canada, the matter of obtaining the services of a teacher to succeed Miss Wright, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. You will be informed later of the name, qualifications, salary, etc., of the teacher nominated by the church authorities for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. Hyne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa, July 16, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Hyds, of Hazelton, stating that Miss M. B. Wright, teacher of the Kitsegukla Indian Day School will not be returning to resume duties when the school opens after the present summer holidays. She has not tendered a written resignation. In view of the services which Miss Wright performed at this school, the Department regrets that she is giving up duties.\n\nIt will be necessary to engage the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Wright, to begin duties on or about the first of September, next, and I have to request that you will nominate a teacher with the necessary qualifications. The name, qualifications and experience of the worker nominated by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention, in order that a teacher can be secured in due time to commence duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Wright, teacher at the Kitsegukla Indian Day School for the quarter ended 30th June 1920.\n\nI understand that Miss Wright is not coming back to teach school at Kitsegukla. She has not tendered her resignation and have written her asking that she forward same on for acceptance.\n\nI might say Miss Wright has been a most faithful servant to the Department and the Indians at Kitsegukla hold her in high esteem. Besides teaching she used to attend to the sick and dispense medicine to the sick Indians. It is with regret that I hear of Miss Wright's resignation, such teachers do great service without complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

I met an Indian from this village as a camp on the other side of the river, which I visited but he was away at the time.\n\nAt Kitsequickla I visited the schoolmaster, who reported that everything was alright in the village at present, and told me that should he hear or see anything wrong, he would communicate with us as soon as possible. He was very pleased with the attendance at school and the general run of things in the village. They have just got over an epidemic of flu in the village, without any deaths resulting from it.\n\nHazelton Detachment usually covers this reserve, but the trail has been impassible for a car during the last month or so, but it is fairly easy to reach from here, as long as the ice is on the river.\n\nThe trail was in fairly good shape, although the soft snow made it hard going for a saddle horse.\n\nI arrived back at the detachment at about 7.30 P.M. of the same date; distance covered 45 miles.\n\nNo complaints were received.\n\nR.

Bishop Black, is qualified to teach in a high school he will never make any great success in teaching elementary school work. Under these circumstances the Inspector considers that it would be in the best interests of the Kitsegkla school to make a change in the teaching services at the end of the current academic year.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate it if you would keep this in mind and arrange for a new teacher to take charge of the Kitsegkla school for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Kitsegukla Indian day school on October 18, 1938:\n\nThe report will be self explanatory.\n\nI believe that it would be well for the Indian Affairs Branch to inform the teacher at Kitsegukla, the Rev. Bishop Black, B.A., that unless he can improve greatly the standing of his school during the present academic year, it may be necessary to request the United Church to make a change of teachers as from September 1939, or September 1940.\n\nMr. Black is of course the United Church Missionary at this village. The fact that he has a B.A. and took his training in the University Teacher Training Course in no way fits him for the elementary work of this school. He might be suitable as a High School teacher, but I very much doubt that he will ever make a success of elementary school work either in a Provincial or an Indian school.\n\n..................................\n\nIt is perhaps too early in the year to be very critical about the achievement of the children. I am however forced to say that the progress has not been very good since my last inspection. Very little has been achieved except perhaps in reading.\n\nIn my last report I stated that the progress here was poor and I can see no reason to modify that statement on this occasion.\n\n(Sgd.)

Black, was in hospital from February 28 to March 15, 1938 inclusive.\n\nWhile he was absent from duty William Milton was employed for 12 teaching days as substitute teacher at a salary of $1.50 a day.\n\nPlease issue cheque in favour of William Milton and send it to him care of G. C. Mortimer, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B. C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSkeena Crossing, B.C.\nMay 15th, 1938\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes Esq.,\nSec. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. MacInnes,\n\nI am a teacher at an Indian School at Kitasooxla B.C., Babine Agency. I am writing for information on the law governing Indian Schools and teachers. In case a teacher falls sick is any provision made for a substitute?\n\nAccording to our B.C. School law we are allowed a number of days with pay, and the substitute\u2014\nis paid by the Government. Is there such arrangement re Indian teachers?\n\nTake my own case, I was sick for 19 days in the Hazelton Hospital and several days with friends confined to the house.\n\nMy sickness was \"Stomach Flu\" caught no doubt from the natives. One is more exposed here than in a white school. I have to visit in missionary homes, administer drugs all hours of the day, and the teacherage is a disgrace\u2014\u201ca refrigerator\u201d merely a shell, rustic on studs, and Beaver board on inside, nailed on studs, open to wind.\nI have stoves red hot, and in cold weather I sit and shiver by the fire, \nwith my overcoat on. I wouldn't live like this, but for the fact that \nI had a cold from November until Feb., when \nI was taken on a stretcher to the Hospital.\n\nNow the school was closed for two weeks, Capt. Mortimer did his best, he tried \nlocally and in Prince Rupert, but could not get a supply anywhere. Finally he asked \nD.W. Hilton an Indian, a graduate of the Edmonton Residential School, to supply for \ntwelve days. He did good work, and expected to receive satisfactory remuneration.\nHe would have taught longer but I was anxious to be back. I started work on the Wabasso.\n\nOn my return I filled up five days learning only a week without any school. Surely I did my best for the Department.\n\nNow I understand from a letter received in the Office at Hazelton that your department is not going to pay this young man? I feel it is a slight on me. I personally assured him you would pay. I never thought for a moment it would be otherwise. Now this young man feels very keenly that an injustice has been done him. I have to live here\nI feel we must give these Indians fair-play. If it had been a white school, and he a white man, he could have gone to a court of justice and got his rights, but he is an Indian.\n\nI didn't engage him as a teacher, if I had, I would pay him. My salary is so small considering my qualifications and opportunities that I think, rightly or wrongly, I am entitled to three weeks sick pay in two years? If not please let me know what the Indian School law does allow, if it allows anything.\nI am not complaining. I am asking so that I can make my future plans on a reasonable basis. I wouldn't care to have another case like this in Kitasooxla.\n\nThese young men are not fools; they are no longer children, and they know what is right. This young man could have earned $3.50 a day or at least $2.50 in loggers' camps which he left in order to teach school. Personally I think the very least he should be paid is $2.50 a day, $24.00 in all.\n\nNow this is a personal letter and absolutely confidential. I write as a man to a man.\nI don't want you to even mention it to Capt. Mortimer. We are the very best of friends. I like Capt. Mortimer; he has been a gentleman to me and I have had nothing but the kindest consideration, and deepest interest in my work, from him. I wouldn't injure him if I could, nor allow a shadow to cross his administration. I am satisfied with him.\n\nPlease write me direct. Whatever the cost I must have justice done these Indians at least in my personal affairs. If the Department cannot pay well I guess I must. Though I may feel the injustice.\nWell I am better able to bear it than an Indian, with my centuries of Christian love and righteousness as a background.\n\nTrusting you will consider this very long letter, I consider you are my head\u2014it is from you anyway that my commission came\u2014forgive any seeming bitterness, I don't feel that way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop Black\nOttawa,\nApril 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo I regret that payment cannot be made for the services of the Indian teacher who substituted for a few days for Mr. Black, teacher of the Kitsegukla Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department does not employ substitute teachers when it is found necessary to close a school for a short time owing to the illness of the teacher. You should have advised us when Mr. Black became ill.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter No. S-1D-363 dated 25th March received from Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer, with regard to the dangerous illness of the Rev. B.

If at all possible, I would recommend that the expenditure recommended by the Indian Agent be authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nENCL.\n\nD. M.

Bishop Black, B.A., a graduate of the University of British Columbia with specialist training in Education. Mr. Black has taught in both city and rural schools, as well as in a private school for boys and should, therefore, be well equipped for the task which he is assigned.

H. Goodridge, I beg to advise the Department that, in agreement with Dr. S. S. Osterhout, Superintendent of the United Church Missions, Mr. Irving W. Bell, of Hazelton, was appointed to this position temporarily and commenced duties at the school on March 12th last. My night letter of today's date reads:\n\n\"Irving W.

No doubt, by this time you have received a copy of our letter of the 25th instant to Mr. Agent Mortimer.\n\nThe Department understands that the temporary appointment of Mr. Irving W. Bell meets with the approval of Dr. Oosterhout. You will note from our letter that we only approved of Mr. Bell's appointment until the end of June. This will leave you free to nominate an experienced, married teacher, with the necessary qualifications, to take over the work on September first.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 26th,\n1936.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nWe had a telegram two weeks ago announcing the death of Mr. Goodridge, and informing us that Mr. Mortimer was putting a substitute teacher into the school temporarily.\n\nI was waiting for the arrival in Toronto of Dr. S. S. Osterhout, the Superintendent of Missions mentioned in your letter of March 23rd. Unfortunately, Dr. Osterhout has been seriously ill with bronchial-pneumonia since his arrival in Toronto, and I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing the situation with him.\n\nAs the Indians at that particular point will begin to scatter for the canning season about May 1st, I wonder if the Government would consider that any very serious harm had been done by closing the school for this season on May 1st. That would give us more opportunity to find an experienced married teacher, with the necessary qualifications for community leadership to take over the work during the summer and make preparations for the opening of the school on September 1st.\n\nI shall be glad to know whether this proposition appeals to you, or not.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth Beaton\n\nKJB:OWF.\nHon.

The reason for writing my previous letter was that Mr. J. H. Burley was leaving and I did not wish to find my future jeopardized by an instant dismissal after our Conference had been which would be in a few days now, I would have been stranded.\n\nAs I stated in my letter I knew no personal reason why I should not return for another year or years. Certainly the verbal report given me by Capt. Inspector Barry was not perfect, but he led me to believe he was satisfied. The only criticism was of my Grade I class which he said was the worst in the Agency. This was easily explained, all the other schools had been in regular session for a whole month, my children only a few days, some came that very day for the first time after a three or\nIn many cases four months' vacation. One could not expect 6 and 7 year olds, who at best get only five months in a school year, to know much so soon. You will recall the school was not open for two months longer.\n\nPersonally, I am working for the children. I am perfectly satisfied with my own accomplishments, thank God I have a clear conscience and this gives me continuous inward peace. But I wanted to know that you are satisfied, your letter has assured me that you are and now I have confidence to go forward (PD) for another year of service in a work I love.\n\nI must confess it is very hard work but I am getting splendid results. Children who had been on the register 4 years when I came couldn't read a first primer today they read well any part of Grade II Reader. Others I took in two years ago, can already read well a first primer; next fall they can start Highroads.\n\nOn every hand I have had compliments from the parents praising my work and assuring me that their children have never made such rapid progress in so short a time as under my present tutelage. These are the real wages, my meagre salary is a mere pittance, when you consider the hours of service I render. Often after spending an evening settling some domestic quarrel or visiting the sick, in some cases travelling three miles in the cold to phone the doctor for advice.\nI come home and work until midnight preparing my lessons for the kiddies. I believe in giving them my very best of mind as well as affection. Again I say I have had my reward, the boy in 7th Grade often asks on Friday night (not for the funnies) but a text book on History, Geography or Science. I am pestered to death with even younger children coming for books to read. I have exhausted my own resources. You will remember my former request for a school library\u2014Capt. Baring did not favour it\u2014so I dropped the idea. I am buying, begging from friends, all the children's books I can get. It seems to me foolish to create a thirst for reading and supply no water.\n\nIf only I had the time there is a great work among the young people I could do; they are always asking for evening classes, they say, \"We want to read like your school children read.\" Unfortunately for a few years my dear wife cannot join me, (nervous trouble due to over-study) she would be such a help, being an expert primary teacher, a B.A. with honours B.C. University, and a graduate in music. Perhaps sometime we may be able to live a normal life again. My present task is absolutely impossible, I teach, at least, am often in the school until 4-30 p.m. or 5 p.m. from 5 p.m. until 11 p.m.\nI serve drugs, bind up wounds, give advice even to the care and feeding of babies. I even had a request to attend a woman in childbirth\u2014no one else they could trust \"being handy,\" they said. I had to assure them only a doctor or nurse could attend such cases.\n\nThe United Church a few weeks ago gave me an unanimous invitation to return as their minister. They said, \"We are wrong and do wrong, you are right\u2014a good man we want you to stay with us for years.\" One man said, \"while I live.\" It's a great ideal (ideal) to have to live up to, but I believe in God who is sufficient.\n\nI gather from your letter that Dr. G. Dorsey called upon you and together you arranged for my return to Kteewinoka School Sept. 1-1739. I wish to express again my deepest and most heartfelt thanks, to you personally, also to the Department for this happy cooperation with our Church in the work of training and educating the Indian people.\n\nWith sincerest regards,\n\nI remain, Yours very truly,\n\nBishop Black.\nKitescugkla, B.C.\n(P.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 25, 1941.\n\nRe: Kitsegukla Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Hanson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 22 and also a letter and resolution, relating to the operation of the above noted school, enclosed therewith.\n\nThe records here indicate that the attendance of pupils at Indian day schools during the month of September has never been satisfactory at any time in recent years. This condition exists on such large reserves as Iyendiniga and Six Nations in Ontario and exists also in outlying districts throughout the Dominion. Indian agents have from time to time sought to explain that the nomadic habits of the Indians, berry-picking, fishing, the harvesting of potatoes both in Canada and the United States and general farm work at that particular season of the year have all contributed to lack of attendance at our schools.\n\nWhen the work of this Branch was carefully reviewed, in the light of the critical events now confronting us, and when an attempt was made to conserve to the utmost extent possible the public funds at our disposal for the regular services and for the Nation's war effort, it was decided, for the time being at least, to operate our schools on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis. I should perhaps point out that the Premier of Ontario,\n\nOlof Hanson, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-1, part 1)\nabout the same time that this decision was reached by our Branch, announced that the public schools of Ontario would remain closed until the first teaching day in October. The Premier, in his announcement, stated that this action had been taken in an attempt to solve the labour problem in the province. You are aware, no doubt, that a large number of white schools in the drought-stricken regions of western Canada have been operating on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis for a number of years. Indeed, it can be stated that a number of these schools have been operating on an 8 month basis. In other words, the taxpayers of Canada have been providing the funds to keep Indian day and residential schools in operation on a 10 month basis while many of their own schools were operating, annually, on an 8 and 9 month basis.\n\nOur schools in British Columbia are inspected from time to time by an Inspector who is an employee of this Branch. This Inspector, in his recent reports, has expressed the opinion that it is quite possible for a pupil to complete the annual course of study in a 9 month period, provided the attendance of the pupil is regular and not interrupted by sickness.\n\nThe decision to operate Indian schools for the shorter period was reached after very careful consideration had been given to the matter, and I am not at all hopeful that this period will be extended at any time in the immediate future. No provision for the operation of Indian day schools on a 10 month basis has been made in the 1941-42 estimates.\n\nI am returning herewith the letter and resolution received by you from Mr. Jones.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOTTAWA, Ontario,\nFebruary 22, 1941.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nRe: Kitsegakla Indian School.\n\nI enclose herewith original letter, dated February 10th, together with resolution, which were forwarded to me by Mr. Moses William Jones, of Skeena Crossing, B.C. They speak for themselves.\n\nI would be pleased if you would give me your comment on same at your convenience, at the same time returning the enclosed for my files.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nOlof Hanson.\n\nOlof Hanson.\nSkeena Crossing, B. C.,\nFebruary 10, 1941.\n\nMr. O. Hanson, M.P.,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached copy of a resolution presented by residents of the village of Kitsegukla tp the meeting of the Prince Rupert Presbytery of the United Church assembled in Prince Rupert, Feb. 5 & 6, 1941, and endorsed by that meeting, is self-explanatory.\n\nOur people place great value upon the school and fully appreciate its usefulness to us, and because we consider it to be the centre around which our Canadian life revolves we urgently solicit your support of our request that the Kitsegukla School be kept open for ten months in 1941 and also in the ensuing years.\n\nWe feel very deeply on this matter and shall be extremely grateful for any assistance you may be able to render.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) Moses William Jones.\nResolution presented by the residents of the Village of Kitsegukla to the meeting of the Prince Rupert Presbytery of the United Church, held in Prince Rupert, Feb. 5 - 6, 1941.\n\nThe residents of the village of Kitsegukla deeply regret that the Department of Indian Affairs closed the school for three months in the summer of 1940 and urgently request that this meeting of the Prince Rupert Presbytery of the United Church pass a resolution strongly urging that the school be kept open for ten months during the year 1941, for the following reasons:\n\n1. All Provincial schools for white children at which schools Indian children whose parents are taxpayers and residents may attend, are open for ten months each year.\n\n2. The handicap of language requires that the Indian children should have at least as much time in school each year as the white children, especially as they follow mainly the same course of study.\n\n3. The school is the main force in the community for building Canadians, and Canada has no more loyal subjects than the Indians.\n\n4. The break of three months is too long to keep apart children, parents and teachers.\n\n5. The reduction of the teacher's salary by one tenth means that good teachers will not remain in the schools - in fact they will not consider even coming to the schools. Indian schools require good teachers and they should be encouraged to teach and remain in these schools.\nOttawa,\nNovember 19, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Kitsegukla Indian Day School\nNo. 822\n\nIn my memorandum of June 19 last I advised you of the resignation of the teacher, Mr. Norman McEwan.

The department has no alternative but to make these deductions from salary as the rules and regulations for the application of National Defence Tax embodied in the Act distinctly state that an employer, which in this case is the department, must make the necessary deduction from all salaries that are taxable.\n\nTo recover any portion of this tax, application must be made by the employee direct to the Inspector of Income Tax for his district.\n\nTrusting the above information may be of assistance to you,\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W.

We have a suggestion of employing a Mr. Arcue, who quite a few years ago obtained a second-class teacher's certificate in the Province of Saskatchewan. He has not taught regularly since - has done quite a bit of farming - and I understand his certificate has really lapsed. At the present time he is teaching in a frontier school in Saskatchewan, but I think we could get his services for Kitzeuela. He is well known to me personally and I should have no hesitation in recommending him. Before I finally write him to say that we will appoint him as missionary to Kitzeuela, I should like to know if your Department would accept our nomination of him as teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MIT\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has a good many reverses and is now teaching again.

Argue began duties as teacher of the Kitsegukla Day School on October 2. The Department was under the impression that he was in charge of the school for the month of September and consequently he was forwarded a cheque for September. However, it would appear from your letter that he did not re-open the school until October 2. Please let me have definite information on this matter as, if he did not teach school during September, we will omit sending him his October cheque.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am advised by Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson that Mr. R. A. Argue commenced duties as teacher of the Kitsegukla Indian Day School on October 2nd. As Mr. Argue was employed at this school last year at the same salary, it is presumed that it will not be necessary for him to complete new forms in connection with his employment.\n\nD.M.

Mallinson, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a letter from Mr. Argue, teacher of the Kitsegukla School, with reference to a deduction of $8.00 from his January salary. This amount was deducted for two $4.00 war savings certificates. A similar amount had been deducted from Mr. Argue's salary up to the end of December and we had no definite instructions from him to discontinue the deduction in January.\n\nThe two certificates for which the money has been deducted will go forward to him in the usual course. No further deductions will be made for this purpose.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. R.A.

Dubno, an applicant for the position of teacher at the above mentioned school and apparently was satisfied with her qualifications and instructed her to assume her duties as soon as she could. A review of our files in connection with this school reveals that the Department was not advised of the assignment of Mrs. Dubno, apparently for the reason that she omitted to complete and return to this office application, questionnaire and T.D. 1 forms, which omission might have gone unnoticed even longer had not been noticed. Boys under date of September 27th advised that Mrs. Dubno was suffering from some type of nervous breakdown and requested a transfer to a less isolated school.\n\nAs Inspector Davey was proceeding north at the time the matter was left in abeyance until he had an opportunity to interview her. Word received from Mr. Davey indicates that Mrs. Dubno was not suitable for employment as a teacher in even less isolated schools than Kitsegukla and she has agreed to resign effective October 30th. We anticipate receiving application and other forms from Mrs. Dubno which will be forwarded immediately. I would recommend that on receipt of these forms Mrs. Dubno be paid salary for the period September 23rd, the date she assumed her duties, to October 30th, which will provide her with sufficient funds for her return to Vancouver which, I might say, is not possible at the moment because of lack of funds.\n\nWith regard to a replacement, I am enclosing an application form from Miss Margaret Wernock, an experienced\nqualified teacher. I have not interviewed Miss Warnock but of the vacancies offered to her she has expressed a preference for Kitsegukla and I would recommend her assignment to that school.\n\nW.S.

I enclose herewith the original duly signed by me.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 16th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of July 16th last with reference to the securing of a teacher for the Kitsegukla Indian Day School. The Department does not appear to have received any reply from you regarding this matter but the September quarter return of the school has just been received and it shows a Mr. Ede in charge.\n\nIn forwarding the return, Mr. Indian Agent Hyde draws attention to the fact that, previous to the opening of the school, he had not received any intimation in connection with Mr. Ede's appointment. Please let me know, as soon as possible, if Mr. Ede was nominated by you and, also, the salary which you recommend be paid. From the quarterly return submitted by Mr. Ede, it is shown that, while he arrived at the school on September 6th, he did not begin teaching until September 17th. It would appear, therefore, that he is only entitled to salary for part of the month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.A. McLean\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

Hazelton., B.C.,\n\nMarch 2, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the Kitzequela Reserve at the site of the old village the Department has no school building of any kind. Fire issues have been rented from time to time for use of school. About two years ago they were burnt down. Subsequently to that school was held in the church owned by the Methodist Church on the Reserve. During this winter this was found to be too cold for the children, and the teacher moved his school work into a room of a building which he occupied as his residence, which of course is not by any means satisfactory.\n\nThe Indians themselves are moving in the matter and have now come to me with a definite proposition over the signature of seventeen of the leading Indians of the Band to the effect that if the Department will pay $500.00 towards it, they will themselves provide the balance of material and labour and erect a school.\n\nIt appears to me that this is a very favorable offer and I would recommend its acceptance by the Department.\n\nIf this offer is approved by the Department, and we could be so advised without delay, the Indians would still have time to get out logs to their little saw-mill so that the lumber could be cut this Spring, and the building erected during the summer. I would like to see this done, and would appreciate an early reply so that it could be facilitated.\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDictated by Mr. Which and signed by Mr. Scott during his absence.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-5, part 1)\nfunds necessary would have to be supplied from the vote for\nthe next fiscal year, and, although an item for the purpose\nwas not specially provided, funds to the extent of $500.00\nwould, no doubt, be available. Mr. Wrinch would see that\nthe work of erecting the building was done satisfactorily\nand that value was received for any expenditure authorized\nby the Department.\n\nI might also add that, since the former school\nbuilding was burned, the teacher has had to use a house\nowned by the Methodist Mission for living quarters and the\nsum of $5.00 per month is also allowed towards the payment\nof the rent of the same. We are, therefore, paying a total\nof $120.00 per annum for rent and this could be avoided by\nthe erection of the new building, as asked for by the Indians.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your instructions in\nthe matter.\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nre. school building for the Kitsegukla Reserve.\n\nAt present there is no school building on this reserve. The Department has always rented a building at this point. The former school was burned about two years ago and, since that time, the school has been carried on in the church owned by the Methodist Church and the Department pays a rent of $5.00 per month for the use of the building. The church has been found to be cold during the winter and the teacher has moved the school into a room of the building which he occupies as his residence. This school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, and, during the past two years, there have been good teachers and there has also been a good attendance of pupils. The enrolment for the past quarter was 22, with an average attendance of 17.\n\nMr. Acting Agent Wrinch now informs the Department that the Indians themselves have come to him with a definite proposition over the signatures of seventeen of the leading Indians of the band to the effect that, if the Department will provide $500.00 towards a new building, they will themselves provide the balance of the material and the labour to erect the building. The Acting Agent states that he considers this a very favourable offer and recommends it for acceptance and requests to be advised without delay, in order that the Indians will have time to get out logs to their saw-mill so that the lumber could be cut this spring and the building erected during the coming summer. The Indians on this reserve take an active interest in the education of their children.\n\nAs the present facilities are unsatisfactory and the Indians are prepared to do a considerable amount of the work themselves in the erection of the building, I consider they should, if possible, receive the assistance they require. The funds...\nMarch 21st, 1921.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Sir James Loughheed -\n\nThe school on the Kitsogukla reserve, Hazelton agency, B.C., was destroyed by fire some two years ago. Since that time the school has been conducted in the building owned by the Methodist church, for which we pay a rent of $5.00 per month. This building was so unsatisfactory that the teacher found it necessary during the winter months to move into a room of the building which he occupies as a residence.\n\nThe school on this reserve has been one of our successful day schools, the enrolment during the past quarter being 22 and the average attendance 17. The Indians have come to the acting Indian agent, Dr. Wrinch, with a proposition to the effect that if the Department will provide $500.00 towards a new building, they themselves will provide the balance of the material and the labour to erect it. They have a saw-mill where necessary lumber can be cut. Dr. Wrinch recommends the acceptance of this offer and asks to be advised without delay.\n\nIn view of the circumstances I think we should encourage these Indians to this extent. Payment can be made from the school appropriation and with your consent I shall authorize expenditure taking necessary steps at the same time to secure the Department for any expenditure that will be made.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon.

You have not furnished any particulars as to the kind of building it is proposed to erect, the dimensions of the same, nor who will oversee the work and advise the Indians during construction. The Department would have to receive assurance that the building will be completed and will be suitable for the purpose of providing accommodation for the Indian children of school age in the band. You should furnish the Department with full particulars regarding the type of building and the dimensions of the same and also how you would propose that the grant allowed by the Department should be expended for the purpose, and also who would be responsible for seeing that the work is satisfactorily performed. If the amount of the Department's grant is expended in the purchase of material, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices before the purchase is made and proper vouchers will have to be submitted covering the expenditure.\n\nIf you are satisfied that the Indians are capable of performing the work, you may instruct them to proceed and get out the logs and have the lumber sawn, and, as soon as you have furnished particulars as asked for regarding the manner in which the building is to be erected and how it is proposed to utilise the amount which the Department will provide, you will be further instructed before undertaking any expenditure.

I will take up the matter with them very carefully, and have them prepare particulars covering the various phases of this proposed building, and will have them report same to you in due course. I will particularly ascertain from them the manner in which it is proposed that the Grant from the Department should be expended, and will instruct them to incur no liabilities in the name of the Department until receiving further instructions.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, April 2, 1951.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd ultimo, in which you inform the Department of the proposition made by the leading Indians of the Tsit-sa-gukla Band to erect a building for school purposes and state that, if the Department will provide the sum of $600.00 for the purpose, the Indians themselves will get out the logs, have the lumber sawn and furnish the labour in the erection of the building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter having been submitted to the Superintendent General he has approved of the granting of the sum of $500.00 to assist the Indians in putting up a suitable building for school purposes.

It is noted that you have obtained prices from two firms for the greater part of the lumber required and that submitted by G. Little of Terrace, is satisfactory.\n\nBefore the purchase of any other material is made it will also be necessary to obtain competitive prices and you should purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. The sketch submitted of the proposed building is satisfactory.\n\nIt is noted that the Indians will furnish all the labour in the erection of the building without charge to the Department and that they are capable of doing the work. The work should be undertaken as soon as possible and completed before the winter sets in. The work should be under the direct supervision of Mr. Orchard and should be completed to his and your satisfaction.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to obtain itemized accounts from the firms from whom you make the purchase of the material and you should certify the same and forward to the Department for payment.

Sir:\n\nReferring to the claim of Arthur McDames, an Indian of the Kitsegukla Band, for payment for lumber supplied by him some years ago and used for building a covered-in verandah in front of the Kitsegukla Indian Day School\u2014which matter you brought to my attention during your last visit\u2014I have to say that the local Indian Agent reports this lumber was ordered by the teacher without authority and he informed the Indian that, if the Church authorities did not pay for it, he would try and get the Indian Department to do so. The Agent reports that, upon repeated application by McDames for reimbursement, he has arranged to supply regular monthly relief in lieu of pay for material. The Agent reports that McDames readily consented to accept relief and has been issued with same for some time. This, therefore, disposes of any claim which McDames has for payment for the material supplied by him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Arthur Barnier,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, April 28, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the claim of Arthur McDermes, an Indian of the Kitsegukla Band, for lumber supplied for building a covered-in verandah at the Kitsegukla Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you have made arrangements to supply this man with regular monthly relief in lieu of his claim for payment of materials supplied by him, and that he has consented to accept relief as settlement of his claim. Your action in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nre - Arthur McDames of Kitsegukla Reserve.\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 4th, No. 151-15-5, dealing with a $50.00 claim for materials supplied by Arthur McDames of Kitsegukla, I respectfully beg to state that I have had this matter under investigation for some considerable time and I am of opinion that McDames did supply lumber on January 3rd 1921 to Mr. E. A. Orchard, teacher of the Kitsegukla Indian Day School at that time. Lumber, which was supplied, was used for building a shed, in the nature of a large covered-in verandah, in front of the Day School at Kitsegukla. Investigations go to show that Mr. Orchard had ordered the lumber without any authority but had informed the Indian that, if the Church Mission did not pay for it, he would try and get the Indian Department to do so. Apparently no further action was taken in the matter by Mr. Orchard and there is no data in this office concerning the erection of this porch.\n\nRepeated applications have been made to me by McDames for reimbursement and after due consideration, and finding this Indian - who is a married man and a cripple - in reduced circumstances, I have made arrangements to give him the regular monthly relief in lieu of pay or material. He readily consented to take relief and has been issued with same for March and April.\n\nI trust this meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed that, some years ago, an Indian of the Kitsegukla Band, named Arthur McDames, supplied approximately $50 worth of materials for a porch at the front of the Indian Day School. I can find no record of any payment or reimbursement having been made in this connection. Will you please make enquiries, and, if you believe that the Department should give McDames some materials in reimbursement, please let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The exterior of the buildings should be given two coats of a good grade of paint - you to select the colours and trim. You should arrange for the purchase of the paint from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with departmental instructions. Indian labour should be engaged to do the work, and you should see that competent Indians are employed. The cost of both the material and labour should be kept as low as possible. The Department will leave the matter of the painting of these buildings in your hands to make the best arrangements you can, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job, and at the lowest possible cost. You should arrange in due time for the purchase and forwarding of the paint and for the engaging of Indians to do the work.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint, oil, etc., used, and also vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified, in payment of the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHaselton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nre - Painting of Indian Day School and Teacher's Residence at Kitsegukla.\n\nI respectfully beg to reply to your letter of November 9th, 1931, No. 151-15-5, dealing with the matter of the above mentioned unpainted buildings at Kitsegukla.\n\nDuring my recent visit to the village I examined these buildings and I am of opinion that they should be painted this summer, although it is quite possible that the buildings would not be in the least damaged by waiting another year. The cost of paint would be $4.25 per gallon but I cannot say what quantity will be needed as the buildings have never yet been painted. Indian labour could be utilized at $2.50 per day.\n\nOwing to the last winter being long and severe no painting could have been done earlier than the present month and even now the weather is rather cold for painting. The Kitsegukla village is practically isolated from early December to early May, therefore you can readily see the reason for delay in this report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nSIR,\n\nRe- Glen Vowell Indian Day School lunches\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr A.F. Parkenson Teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian School.\n\nOn my last visit to the above school I could see that the children were not up to the standard of previous years, although their health in general appeared fairly good, nonetheless I could see that they appeared somewhat under-nourished. I explained to the teacher that I did not think there was much chance in getting any grant this fiscal year, but would submit his letter to the Department.\n\nAbout 20 children attend this school and if anything can be done to give the pupils a midday meal at a cost of $5.00 per month it certainly would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEncl-\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nG.C.

Some are living on potatoes and dried fish.\n\nCould you secure a grant so the children can have nourishment at school from Nov. 1st to April 1st? That is for the five winter months. I believe it essential and will be much appreciated.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

H. Goodridge\n\nSheena Crossing\nSept 28th 34\nThe present room is some 25 feet by 17 feet with the long sides on the North and South. The interior is lined with shiplap lumber which was put on green and has shrunk. The floor was laid with green lumber and is very poor now.\n\nThe whole of the West end of the school room should be moved out another ten feet, the roof and sides of the building being extended at the same time. A new porch turned towards the teacher's cottage on the South side of the school should be constructed, as well as a small woodshed to care for the wood now kept in the entrance to the school.\n\nThe present entrance through the woodshed should be done away with and the lumber used in the new porch. A complete new floor should then be laid.\n\nThe two old windows at present in the South side of the school should be taken out and placed with two new windows and the present two to make a total of six windows along the North side of the new schoolroom.\n\nFour lengths of Asbestoslate Board each four feet by eight feet will then be required and these should be placed at a convenient height for children along the South and East interior walls. The remainder of the interior will need to be lined with these ply or plaster board.\n\nThe school as well as the teacher's cottage is the property of the Indian Affairs Branch I understand.\n\nIt is hard to estimate what the whole of the above reconstruction of the school would cost, but I consider that the sum of $750.00 should be inserted in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 to cover the material and work. I have informed the Acting Indian Agent that I could not recommend this work this year as it is not as urgent as that.\n\nI do however consider that a large heater of the circulatory pattern should be placed in this school this summer in time for school opening in September. The cost of a large enough heater of this kind would be around $60.00 and it could of course be used in the reconstructed school should my suggestion be carried out later.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1936 | School material. |        |\n| Dec. 17 | For one broom purchased for use at the Kitasoo school.

No funds are available at the present time for this work, but you might include an item in your Estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 and, when these are received, the matter will have further consideration.\n\nIf you consider a larger heater is required in this school, you should so advise the Department, giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hedy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Mallinson, Esq.,\nIn charge - Indian Agency,\nHazelton, B. C.\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR BARRY'S REPORT REGARDING HIS INSPECTION OF THE KITSEGULIA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON MAY 26, 1937.\n\nSuggested reconstruction of school building:\n\nThe present room is some 25 feet by 17 feet with the long sides on the North and South. The interior is lined with shiplap lumber which was put on green and has shrunk. The floor was laid with green lumber and is very poor now.\n\nThe whole of the west end of the schoolroom should be moved out another ten feet, with roof and sides of the building being extended at the same time. A new porch turned towards the teacher's cottage on the south side of the school should be constructed, as well as a small woodshed to care for the wood now kept in the entrance to the school.\n\nThe present entrance through the woodshed should be done away with and the lumber used in the new porch.\n\nA complete new floor should then be laid.\n\nThe two old windows at present in the south side of the school should be taken out and placed, with two new windows and the present two, to make a total of six windows along the north side of the new schoolroom.\n\nFour lengths of Asbestoslate blackboard each four feet by eight feet will then be required and these should be placed at a convenient height for children along the south and east interior walls. The remainder of the interior will need to be lined with three ply or plaster board.\n\nThe school as well as the teacher's cottage is the property of the Indian Affairs Branch, I understand.\n\nIt is hard to estimate what the whole of the above reconstruction of the school would cost, but I consider that the sum of $750.00 should be inserted in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 to cover the material and work. I have informed the Acting Indian Agent that I could not recommend this work this year as it is not as urgent as that.\n\nI do however consider that a large heater of the circulatory pattern should be placed in this school this summer in time for school opening in September. The cost of a large enough heater of this kind would be around $60.00 and it could, of course, be used in the reconstructed school should my suggestions be carried out later.\n| DATE | DESCRIPTION | DEBIT AMOUNT | CREDIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n|      | Account rendered |              |               |         |\n|      | Supplied to Kitequela Indian Day School |              |               |         |\n|      | 1 only B.C.

It was found, later, that a detached woodshed would be far better and safer, thereby using extra material for building same.\n\nI trust the Department will favourably consider this extra expenditure which was really necessary.\n\nI may say that the provision made in the 1938-1939 Estimates more than covers all expenditures incurred on both school and teacher's residence on the Kitsegukla Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $250.00 for repairs to the roof and interior and exterior painting at the Kitsegukla Indian Day School. It is noted that this amount will cover both material and labour. When forwarding the account for the material you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson's letter of the 4th ultimo requesting authority to expend $250.00 for roof repairs and interior and exterior painting of Kitsegukla Indian Day School, which was provided for in his current estimates. Some delay has occurred in this connection as it was necessary to refer the matter back to Mr. Mallinson for further details regarding the roof, copy of his reply of the 7th instant being enclosed herewith.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nFor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nD.M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nre-Painting and Repairing of Kitsegukla Indian Day School Building.\n\nIn the 1943-44 Estimates an amount of $250.00 was entered to cover the above noted project. If this amount has been allotted, will you kindly procure authority for me to have the work carried out during the summer months when the school is closed?\n\nFollowing is a list of the materials it is estimated will be required to complete the project:\n\n6 Squares, Hexagon Asphalt Shingles @ 10.00 per Square 80.00\n\nWith reference to this item, I would advise that cedar shingles are un procurable here at the present time, and in any case I believe that if consideration is given to the durability of asphalt shingles, the fact that no paint or stain is required, and the fire protection provided by them, they would prove to be less expensive than cedar, over a period of time.\n\nExterior Paint:\n10 gals. Outside Cream Approximate price 2.90 per gal\nin 5 gal. tins 29.00\n1 Brunswick Brown Approx. 3.00\n1 White 1.65\n\nInterior Paint:\n4 gals. Light Gray approx. 3.50 per gal 14.00\n1 Green 1.75\n1 White 1.75\n10 Pkgs. White Kalsomine .75 per Pkg. 7.50\n\nIt is considered that the balance of the estimated $250.00 total cost will be ample to cover the cost of labour, and incidentals such as paint brushes and turpentine which can be procured locally.\n\nWhen authority is procured for carrying out this work,\n\np.t.o.\nD.M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour File 215-1-4779\n\nre: Painting & Repairing of Kitsegukla Indian Day School Building.\n\nReplying to your letter of June 8, I would advise that it is intended to lay the asphalt shingles directly on top of the old cedar shingles, as is recommended by the manufacturers, on the Kitsegukla Indian Day School building.\n\nThe spaces between the roof boards, which in this case are very small, will not therefore matter.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-5, part 3)\nD. H. MacKay Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour file: 215-1-8607.\nRe: Kitsegukla I.D. School.\n\nWith reference to your letter Dec. 2/43, I wish to advise you that the labor in connection with painting of both inside and outside of Kitsegukla I.D. School, has cost more than was at first estimated. For this work alone there were 360 hours of labor $.40 per hour, totaling $144.00. Three coats of paint had to be applied on all plain woodwork which added considerable to the number of hours. The price of $.40 per hour I considered particularly reasonable as a general payment is at least $.65 per hour.\n\nThe known accounts to date are as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Paint                       | $59.94 |\n| Paint Brushes               | 15.15  |\n| Shingles, F.O.B. Delivered  |        |\n| Kitsegukla                  | 58.25  |\n| Shingles, FOB Delivered, Vancouver | 25.27 |\n| Shingle Tacks              | 6.00   |\n| Labor (painting on y)      | 144.00 |\n\nTo which will be added freight on second shipment of shingles and labor of shingling.\n\nIt would appear from the above that the original estimate is almost $100.00 short of the actual cost and I would ask if you would kindly obtain authority, from the Department to cover this amount.\n\n(Sgd.) S. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nIn reply to your letter of January 11th and previous correspondence I wish to advise you that I have investigated the time of 360 hours taken in painting both the inside and outside of the Kitsegukla school and I am certain no time was wasted in doing this work. The Indian concerned informs me that on several occasions he stayed up to half an hour longer in order to finish the part he was doing, but never charged extra time. I also figured out the time I considered it should have taken and there was not more than 8 hours difference. I wish to emphasize the fact that only .40c per hour was the wage agreed upon. This price is not more than half that paid for such work.\n\nBesides the painting there were four blackboards badly cracked. These were taken down, the usable portions cut and four small but perfectly good blackboards framed and put up. Two other new blackboards were framed and also put up.\n\nArrangements were made for the work to be done on September 7th 1943 and five visits were made while the work was in progress.\n\nI am enclosing a voucher with attached accounts for the painting and shingling the roof of the school, together with an account for the material not previously submitted.\n\nThe following is a summary of all accounts in connection with this repair work:\n\n| Voucher | Description       | Amount |\n|---------|------------------|--------|\n| 131     | Paint            | $59.94 |\n| 132     | Brushes          | 15.15  |\n| 262     | Shingles         | 58.25  |\n| 263     |                  | 32.80  |\n|         |                  | 165.14 |\n| 320     | Shingle Tacks    | 6.00   |\n| 319     | Painting and Roofing | 177.60 |\n\n$349.74\nThe foregoing shows an expenditure of $99.74 in excess of the authority and I trust the Department will approve of this extra cost.\n\n\"S.

I also enclose copy of Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson's letters of December 14th and December 17th, wherein it will be noted that the total of the above-mentioned vouchers and others previously submitted exceeds the amount authorized by $99.74.\n\nThe actual cost of labour in excess of the estimated cost is largely responsible for the overexpenditure, and, although the rate per day is low, the time spent on the project would appear to be excessive.\n\nHowever, as the project is now completed and Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson is satisfied with the work done, there would appear to be no alternative but to recommend the accounts for payment.\n\nD.

(RG 10, Volume 6398, File 822-5, part 3)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am advised by the Reverend W. P. Bunt that he has recommended the nomination of Mrs. B.N. Kitchenmaster as teacher of the Kitsegukla Indian Day School. Mr. Bunt advises that Mrs. Kitchenmaster is exceptionally well qualified and experienced, and if conditions at the village are satisfactory would like to remain for some time. In view of this it is considered advisable that some repairs be carried out to the teacher's residence and that a few items of furnishings be supplied. Mr. Mallinson estimates that repairs and alterations to the teacherage would cost approximately $360.00; this amount to provide for the removal of a partition and painting of the interior of the building. Although no specific provision was made in the estimates for this expenditure, there are a number of other improvements provided for which will not likely be carried out and if funds are available it is recommended that Mr. Mallinson be authorized to proceed with the work on submission of full details through this office.\n\nFor D.M.

As you are aware the Department has never paid a grant for a teacher at this school and I would ask you for a full report upon the situation, dealing the numbers, locations and religion of the Indians and the work performed during the past by teachers who were appointed by the Methodist Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Lorink, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOttawa, June 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to official letter of March 13, last, in which you were asked for a full report in regard to the New Town School in your Agency. The Department would like to have your report at once, as up to the present time this school has not been recognized. A requisition has been received for school supplies, which cannot be supplied until your report comes to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. R. Lorim, M.A.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nIn reference to the receipt of your letter, dated the 13th of March last, stating that Chief A. Wedildahlt, now of Kitselas, had written to the Department, and among other things had asked for the appointment of a teacher, and was requested to give a report upon the situation, dealing with the numbers, locations and religion of the Indians, and the work performed during the past by teachers who were appointed by the Methodist Church.\n\nIn reply thereto, I have the honour to state that, collectively, there are 79 Indians of this band, of whom there are about 17 of school age.\n\nIts main village is New Town, about 7 miles below the canyon. Of religion, the people are Methodist.\n\nFor some time, since this band became incorporated with this Agency, a native teacher named B.S. Tait was at New Town. Though repeatedly requesting a report on the school there, I failed.\n\nThereafter a young white man named R.S. Cole came thither as a teacher. The latter I sent time and again samples of how the reports ought to be made out, a lot of forms, letters, etc., but for my pains never even received a reply.\n\nLater on, upon enquiry, I was told that Wedildahlt was trying to have R.S. Cole as a sort of private secretary, and because of that the latter had left his post, and had gone to work in an hotel at the canyon.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 26, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. R. F. Lorine, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B. C., in regard to the establishment of a school at Kitselas. As you visited the locality during the past summer I should be pleased to receive any information that you may have in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev.

I have some knowledge\nof this point but not sufficient to\nreport. I will look into this case\nand report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, January 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a requisition for supplies for the New Town school. This is the first intimation it has had that the school was in operation. The last communication from you in the matter was dated June 19th, last, and contained nothing definite as to the appointment of a teacher. It seems strange that you should now forward a requisition with no information as to when the school was opened or with regard to the qualifications of the teacher. In the meantime until the Department has decided to recognize the school it cannot be responsible for the school material or for the salary of the teacher. You will be good enough to report fully by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E. Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nwho is well qualified and a man of an attractive personality, and has a large and interesting family whose presence I found to lend a good influence to the community.\n\nBy Mr. Edgar I was asked to forward the requisition referred to, and recommend it to be filled.\n\nI am quite confident that Mr. Edgar will give a very good account of himself as a teacher, and otherwise.\n\nBy him I was told that the people raised objections to having their church building used any longer for school purposes, and that a building were required to meet the case.\n\nSince Mr. Edgar is likewise a good carpenter by profession, I asked him to submit to me a plan with an estimate for the building required, and promised to forward the same at once to the Department for approval.\n\nThe latter I am awaiting, and deferred my report in this respect till the time of their receipt. In the meantime a building can be improvised wherein school can be taught.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 18th ultimo, regarding a requisition for supplies for the New Town School, and therein it is stated that it were the first intimation the Department had that a school there were in operation, and refers to my last communication thereupon, dated the 19th of June last. It is also remarked that in the meantime, until the Department has recognized that school, it cannot be responsible for the school material or for the salary of its teacher.\n\nIn explanation to the foregoing I beg to state that since the 1st of April 1906, New Town, with Kitelas, became part of this Agency, and a native teacher, named Robert Tate, was counted as such, but was not at all qualified in any respect. During the summer months the children accompanied their parents to Port Essington. This feature will in the near future obtain no more.\n\nThereafter a young white man, named R.S. Cole, came there unannounced as a teacher, and departed in like manner.\n\nTo the latter I sent a list of school material, which I thought would meet the requirements there. I also sent him a carefully made out sample of a school return, with forms, and descriptive annotations.\n\nOf the latter teacher I heard no more until being casually informed that he went to work in the hotel at the canyon.\n\nBut, reporting under the present conditions, I beg to state that a teacher, Mr. Louis Edgar, is at New Town.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 6, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of November 13th last, in reference to the school at Kitselas (New Town) and I have to ask you whether you have as yet obtained such information as will enable you to report on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nFor Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, May 2, 1912.\n\nMr. Fedley,\n\nAt intervals from as far back as 1905 an Indian day school has been conducted in the Kitselas (New Town) Indian Village, Babine Agency. This reserve has a population of 79 and the census returns show a school population of 15. The school has not been in operation since the New Year, but Mr. Edgar, the Missionary teacher appointed by the Methodist Church, conducted a school from May to December, 1911. His average attendance during that period was as follows:\n\nMay and June average 9\nAugust and September 7\nOctober 7\nNovember 12\nDecember 14\n\nThe school is conducted in the church, which was built by the Indians. The Agent, Mr. Loring, reports in favour of the Department recognizing this school and paying a grant towards\ntowards the salary of the teacher and the Indians themselves have asked for the establishment of the school.\n\nIn view of the number of children of school age and the fact that a teacher who is well spoken of by the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is available, I would recommend that this school be allowed a grant of $300.00 per annum and that the necessary stationery be forwarded to the teacher.\n\nPlans for a school-house were submitted sometime ago by the Agent, who was informed that the Department was not prepared to consider the matter at that time, but, should the attendance be satisfactory, the question of building a school would be dealt with next year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6398, File 823-1, part 1)\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to yours of November 13th 1911, and also of March 6th 1912, re necessary information regarding the school at Kitselas (New Town) B.C., I enclose you copy of a letter I have received from our Missionary today. Mr. Edgar was sent there to do the work of Missionary and teacher. I had the pleasure of meeting him and he is a very bright energetic fellow, and ought to have these supplies sent in at once. I am also of the opinion that it might be wise for the Department to build a school house. However, I will look into this matter very fully and see what kind of buildings we have and whether it would be necessary for the Department to go to the expense of a new building. In the meantime, I trust all necessary supplies will be sent in at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. L.\n\nEnc.\nNew Town, B.C., Apr. 3rd, 1912.\n\nRev. Ferrier,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier,\n\nYour letter of the 20th March to hand.\n\nAs I informed you at Prince Rupert, we have not opened school at Kitselas (New Town) since the New Year.\n\nThere are eighteen children of school age in the village here. There is a population of eighty on the Reserve. My work consists chiefly of preaching and also assisting all I can as Chairman of the Village Committee. We have church services on Sunday at 11.00 a.m., 3.00 p.m., and 7.00 p.m., also on Tuesdays and Fridays at 7.30. The school certainly ought to be opened with the least possible delay. It is shameful the way we have been held up in this important part of our work. When we came to New Town at the end of May 1911 we found no equipment whatever to carry on our work, save an old register and four or five badly torn readers, 2nd Primers. There were no slates or any other material. I wrote to the chairman of the District and also to Mr Green, School Inspector, about supplies. We opened school and did our best without help until the end of June, when school closed for the holidays, and I was down at the mouth of the Skeena preaching the Gospel at the\nCanneries. The school was re-opened after the holidays on August 29th, (Friday) by Bro. Deans. I got up in September and relieved him. No supplies had come. I received a schedule from Mr. Raley to fill in, showing what our needs were. This was attended to at once, and forwarded at once to Indian Agent Loring at Hazleton. He told me that he had sent my request to Ottawa and that books and other things would soon be here. Handicapped as we were, we continued to teach school up until Christmas. We had written to Mr. Loring several times, and also to Mr. Raley, explaining the difficulty we were in, trying to hold the children and instruct them without books. Mr. Loring assured us the books would be here any time, and we postponed opening school until these arrived. So far we have seen no sign of them and have lost practically three months work. Had a letter from Mr. Loring last week and he tells me now that he has been in touch with the Department at Ottawa and hoped to have my supplies here soon. In February I visited him at Hazleton and while there he promised he would do his best to get a grant for the school house at New Town. The school is at present held in the church, which was built entirely by the people, save for a grant of $100.00 from the Missionary Society, and the Government has not spent a penny on buildings here. The old church was burned down some time years ago, whether that was built with the assistance of the Government we do not know. The people would very much like a school house, so the church would be kept for the regular services only. The children\ndo not give the chairs the best sort of treatment. But at present what we do need and must have if our work is to go on is books and slates as we asked for in that schedule. I think this puts our position clearly.\n\nMay and June, average 9.\nAug & Sept. 7\nOctober 7\nNovember 12\nDecember 14\n\nYour sincerely,\n\nSgd. Louis Edgar.\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of March 6th, #275604A, re the School at Kitselas (New town) B.C., we have a man there by the name of Louis Edgar, who has charge of the Indian work at that point. I am not quite positive about the school interests, whether he teaches the children, or whether there are sufficient there to open a school. However, I will write him and ask him to give me all particulars concerning his work and let the Department know.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. J. C. Spencer, the present Superintendent of Methodist Mission work of this district, highly recommends Mr. Van Gorder for the position, and requested me to communicate with the Department in view of having arranged for this new teacher's salary, and for that purpose gave me an outline of what teachers, of other localities of his district had been accorded,\n\nto wit:\n\n| Location     | Per Month |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| Metlakatla   | $80.00    |\n| Port Simpson | $80.00    |\n| Massett      | $75.00    |\n\nand a free house, respectively; and in regard thereto, I beg to enclose herewith Mr. Spencer's letter to me, dated the 3rd instant, in bearing thereupon.\n\nIn the matter of a free house, I think that the little old Mission house, though now bare of all furniture, stove, etc., could be utilized for the teacher's home.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nPort Simpson Oct 3rd 1914\n\nMr. R.

Also that I should give him any assistance that I can toward making this school a success, and informing me that the continuance of the said grant will be dependent upon future results.\n\nLikewise am I advised thereby that the requisition, forwarded some time ago, for supplies for that school will now be filled, with the exception of the twelve (12) slates, which I may purchase, and that Ontario Readers are being sent me, and to inform the teacher that lesson cards are not published with these readers.

A supply of school material was also sent in. It is not proposed to take any action at present towards erecting a permanent building until it is seen with what success the school meets.

Inspectorate,\n3616 Pt. Grey Road, Vancouver B.C.,\nMay 10, 1912.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\non\nNew Town Indian Day School, Kitselas, Babine Age\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on my way down the Skeena River I visited the Indian village of New Town (Kitselas) at the request of the Indians. They called a meeting and spoke at great length requesting a school house, and help for the school, from the Department.\n\nMr. Lewis Edgar, a married man with five children, has taught school for one year. He has had an average of twelve. There are about twenty children of school age in the village, healthy, bright children, and they are doing well in their studies, in fact considering that he has poor equipment, especially well. The teacher had purchased a few small books, slates, a few bibles and hymn books.\n\nThe village has improved greatly during the year that Mr. Edgar has been there. The Indians are now able to keep the drunken men off the reserve, and the village is orderly. The teacher has a splendid garden, fruits, vegetables, and flowers, and the Indians are trying to imitate him. At the time of my visit he was showing them how to plant garden seeds. He is also a good carpenter and shows them how to build.\n\nThe Indians themselves have built a good church, nicely seated with chairs. The school is held in this, but some of the Indians object, they complain it scratches the chairs, and they wish for a separate building.\n\nThe village is beautifully situated, the land excellent, the people progressive, and worth encouraging. I would respectfully recommend that this school receive assistance from the Department.\n\nMr. Edgar is a most valuable man on the reserve. When I visited the village a year ago, a month before he went to the village,\nI find five drunken white men there, and the Indians unable to send them away. This is all changed, the teacher has shown good tact in dealing with white men. \"Van Arsdale\" Station on the G.T.R.R., the terminus of the line from Prince Rupert, is only a quarter of a mile away from the village, and hundreds of navvies and all sorts of people get to this point by rail, then often stay days before starting up river on ice, etc. Many of them go to the reserve to get shelter and food. Only by the watchfulness of the teacher have the Indians been able to protect themselves from being demoralized.\n\nThe officials of the Railway told me that they admired the good sense of Mr. Edgar in dealing with the people, and that he had assisted much in keeping order, and preventing drinking.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 7, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence in connection with the Indian School at Kitselas I beg to say that the Department has decided to allow a grant of $500.00 per annum from the date of the receipt of this letter by you towards the salary of the teacher at this point. You will be good enough advise Mr. Edgar accordingly and give him full information with respect to the returns, etc., that will be necessary. You should also give him any assistance you can towards making this school a success. The continuance of the grant will be dependent upon future results.\n\nThe requisition forwarded sometime ago for supplies for this school will now be filled, with the exception of the twelve slates, which you may purchase, and the lesson cards and histories of British Columbia. Ontario Readers are being sent and you will be good enough to inform the teacher that lesson cards are not published with these readers. The histories will be forwarded if you will ascertain the name of the publisher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Loring, ESQ.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOttawa, May 7, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to make a grant of $300.00 per annum towards the salary of a teacher at Kitselas (New Town) B.C., and to supply the necessary school material. This is a temporary arrangement and the continuance will be dependent upon the results as shown by future reports on the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSup. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith reports on the Kitescan, Kitkatla and Hartley Bay Indian day schools, to the end of April, ultimo.\n\nI would point out that it is most unfortunate that, owing to the nomadic pursuits of the Indians of these villages, the attendance is so poor at this time of the year. There will be poor attendance at these schools in fact one may safely say there will be no attendance worth reporting on - till about October first next. Most of what the children learn whilst at school will be forgotten during these months of absence, thus it is almost impossible for the children to advance beyond the third grade or standard. The boarding school, it would seem, is the best medium of education and, in view of the expense of keeping these schools in operation, it seems questionable whether any advantage is gained by having the schools at these points continued. At\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6398, File 823-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nthe same time, if the Department has no alternative policy in view, and it is decided that these schools shall continue, my recommendation with respect to the purchase of the building at Witekela will be in order.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nSKENA RIVER AGENCY, I.C.\nOttawa, August 29, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, in which you request that a supply of mechanical toys of an educative value be supplied for the use of the pupils attending the Kitselas Indian Day School in order to increase the interest of the children in their work and to encourage a more regular attendance.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is regretted that the Department cannot comply with your request as there are no funds available from which supplies of the nature mentioned by you can be furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. H. Young, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nKitselas Indian Day School,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMr. Duncan & Scott\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been told by certain of our church officials who are also connected with the Indian Dept., that you are liberal-minded in regard to advancing the work of Indian schools and always ready to help along the cause with which you have been so long connected. I have been teaching Indian schools now for eight years and have found it at times a great drag and very monotonous. The average Indian child is slow to grasp the essentials of a common education but on the contrary, is naturally gifted in a mechanical sense. What he sees, feels or touches, or in other words\u2014object lessons\u2014appeal to him. This part of a child's education is becoming more and more practiced in all our schools, but from my practical experience in India...\nschools I feel the need is imperative in connection with the education of our Indian children.\n\nIn connection with the Kitzeloo school with which I have been connected for over three years, I find the situation even more exhausting of energy and requiring more tact and patience than in either the Skidegate or Fort Simpson schools with which I was connected for two years in each. This school has a very small average attendance and the children are nearly all in the Primer or low grade classes. It has been very difficult to keep up enthusiasm as an incentive to steady attendance or a desire to push ahead and advance so I have been thinking seriously over the whole situation as to how I might make school life more attractive and have been wondering whether you would give your permission to allow the purchase of a limited\nsupply of mechanical toys that would have an educative value. He is handy with tools and is a good mechanic, considering all the chances he has had to learn. For the boys I would suggest a set of Meccano which costs up to $20 according to the amount purchased. This game would be entertaining, instructive and of an educative value. For the girls, I have not yet made a selection but feel confident something suitable can be found. I honestly believe that if these toys were in our school, it would be an attractive as well as an educative agency, which would mean a great deal toward supplementing book study.\n\nTrusting you will give this subject your special and hopeful best from you very truly,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.H. [signature]\nOttawa, September 21, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you state that Mr. J. H. Young has been placed in charge of the Kitselas Indian Day School in place of Mr. Franklin VanGorder.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this change of teachers is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR. E. Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton,\nB.

Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that it will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher for the Kitasla Indian Day School to succeed the present teacher, Mr. Chas. M. MacKinnon, who should, on account of advanced years and the fact that he is in poor health, retire at the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next. I have to request that you will nominate the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Mr. MacKinnon for the next school year, beginning on or about September 1st, 1932. Please forward in due time the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom the authorities of the United Church in Canada nominate for this school.\n\nI might add that at the present time Mr. MacKinnon is absent from his duties on account of illness; it being necessary to make temporary arrangements to carry on the work. I would suggest that Mr. MacKinnon be informed in due time that his services will not be required after June 30th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. K. J.

As the Rev. A. Barner, Superintendent of Indian Missions of the United Church, and Capt. C. H. Barry Inspector of Indian schools, were both visiting the city at the time, the matter was discussed with them and it was decided to recommend a change owing to Mr. MacKinnon's advanced years and the fact that he is not in the best of health, the change to become effective at the end of June if approved by the Department.\n\nW. N. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department that Mr. Chas. M. MacKinnon, teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, has been obliged, on account of illness, to discontinue his duties, I have to say it is noted that arrangements have been made for Mr. Burnett to carry on the work until Mr. MacKinnon is able to resume duties. It is hoped that Mr. MacKinnon will be able to again take up work as teacher at an early date.\n\nYou might inform the Department as to what arrangements were made for salary for Mr. Burnett's services during the period he is temporarily engaged, and also state his Christian name. When the quarterly return of attendance for the current quarter is prepared, it should be stated thereon the dates between which Mr. MacKinnon was absent and also the period Mr. Burnett taught.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Whilst Mr. MacKinnon is not a young man and may be old-fashioned in his methods of teaching he is giving the best service he can under conditions which are not always encouraging.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter (undated), enclosing a petition received from the Kitselas Indians regarding the services of Mr. C. M. MacKinnon, teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, and requesting that a new teacher be engaged.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted, have already arranged for the continuing of the services of Mr. MacKinnon. The Department has approved of his re-engagement for the coming school year, and it would, therefore, be difficult to make any change at the present time. If Mr. MacKinnon's services prove to be unsatisfactory to the Indians during the next school year, you should bring the matter to the attention of the Department about the 1st of April, next, when the question of obtaining the services of another teacher for the school year 1930-31 could then be brought to the attention of the Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI am forwarding the enclosed petition received from the Kitselas Indians regarding Mr. MacKinnon, teacher of the day school. Previous requests from the Indians along the same lines having been made from time to time I am now placing the matter before the Department as the continued dissatisfaction among the Indians is not conducive to the progress and regular attendance of pupils at school.\n\nThe Indians complain that the children are not making satisfactory progress, and that Mr. MacKinnon's methods of teaching are not up-to-date. Personally, I have always found Mr. MacKinnon\u2014who is an elderly man\u2014most conscientious and interested in his work but at the same time I can sympathize with the Indians in their desire to have more modern teaching for their children. The school is a small one, and might be difficult to fill, as it would not be advisable to place a young teacher in charge on account of the isolation and the fact that there are no other white people near.\n\nAs the present situation is not satisfactory, I would recommend that the matter be taken up with the United Church authorities for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nWEC, JJ.\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nVancouver B.C.\nJune 4/29\n\nW. E. Collison\nIndian Agent\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe the undersigned members of Ketselas Band wish to apply for a new school teacher, and have Mr. McKinnon the present school teacher be removed from our village, as his work for our children is found a failure.\n\nResolution is passed in our meeting that Mr. McKinnon should work his time out at the close of school this summer.\n\nBut the new school teacher is needed in his place who will educate our children.\n\nEducation is needed for our children as well as other peoples' children.\n\nSigns:\n\nChief Richard Cecil\nChief Mark N.

Brown - Chairman\nBen Seymon - Secty\nEXTRACT FROM AGENT'S REPORT ON THE KITSELAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1924.\n\nThe number of children attending this school is comparatively small, the average attendance for the month being only 8.5. Indian parents have, on several occasions, made complaints against the teacher, Mr. McKinnon, but these have proved on investigation to be of a most trivial nature. It has, nevertheless, resulted in a certain amount of indifference on the part of the Indians as to whether their children attend school or not. Personally I have always found Mr. McKinnon very pains-taking in his work. No doubt he has to put up with a great many disadvantages - especially since the school was burnt down - as the use of the Indian church has not proved satisfactory.\n\nW. E. Collison, Agent.\nOttawa, October 7, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that the Department will approve of an increase in salary being granted to Mr. Charles McKinnon, Teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, from the first of September, last, the beginning of the present school year.

T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, for particulars as to the qualifications, experience, etc., which Mr. MacKinnon possesses; also regarding the salary he is to receive.

BARNER.\n\nAs teacher of the Indian Day School at\nKitselas, the position left vacant through the\ndeath of Mr. MacKinnon, I would recommend the\nappointment of Mr. Percy H. Gladstone, 1020\nBroughton St., Vancouver. Mr. Gladstone, as you\nknow, is an Indian boy of 21 years of age, who\nhas just completed his training at the Vancouver\nNormal School, which entitles him to a Second\nClass (Interim) Teacher's Certificate for British\nColumbia, though this certificate may be changed\nto a First Class in September if Mr. Gladstone\nis successful in a supplementary examination which\nhe hopes to write then.\n\nI have enquired very carefully into the record of\nthis boy during the period while he was a student\nat the Cocoualeetza Residential School and the\nProvincial Normal School. As a result, I consider\nthat Mr. Gladstone should be appointed on probation\nin the first instance. I shall be visiting the\nKitselas Indian Day School during the latter part\nof September or early in October, and shall take\nextra care in inquiring into Mr. Gladstone's\nmethods and success with the children of that\nvillage.\n\nIt may also be mentioned that Mr. Gladstone\nis highly recommended for appointment in an Indian\nSchool by Rev. G. H. Raley and officials of the\nUnited Church of Canada.\nOttawa, June 8, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Barner:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing the cheque for two months' gratuity for the late Mr. C. M. MacKinnon. The regulations are such that payments of this nature must be made to the widow. I note that your Board has already made payment to Mrs. MacKinnon, and, in these circumstances, it is a matter of regret that the Department cannot have the two months' gratuity made payable to you. I am sure, however, that you will be able to make some satisfactory arrangements to have Mrs. MacKinnon endorse the cheque in the Board's favour. A new cheque, in her favour, is being directed to you under separate cover.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

M. MacKinnon, but I find it necessary to return the same on account of the fact that we have already made an advance to Mrs. MacKinnon of this amount because of her straitened circumstances at the time of the death of her husband, and I beg to quote from the letter which we received from the Superintendent of Indian Education, dated May 18th - #168-20-1:\n\n\"Salary to May 5th and two months' gratuity to Mrs. MacKinnon can be granted. Both cheques will be directed to your office, so that you can make any adjustment that is necessary with Mrs. MacKinnon.\"\n\nI shall be much obliged if you will kindly send us a cheque for this amount, namely, $190, made out to the United Church of Canada, and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAP: NEF\n\nEncl.\nMay 25th, 1932.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Immediately upon receiving Mr. Gibson's report of the death of Mr. MacKinnon we forwarded to the widow a cheque to help her in her time of trouble.\n\nWe have received one cheque from the Department covering the period of Mr. MacKinnon's services to May 5th. If you will kindly forward the other cheque at your convenience made out to the United Church of Canada we will settle this matter with Mrs. MacKinnon.\n\nWith kindest wishes,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barner\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department of the death, on the 5th instant, of Mr. C. M. MacKinnon, teacher of the Kitelas Indian Day School. In this connection, I have to inform you that the church authorities notified the Department of Mr. MacKinnon's death. Salary has been allowed to the date of his death and a cheque for the amount due has been forwarded to the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada. In addition, a cheque has been sent to Mrs. MacKinnon, being gratuity equal to two months' salary, to the amount of $190.\n\nThe church authorities informed the Department that they will send a nomination for the position as teacher for the coming school year to succeed Mr. MacKinnon. It is noted that you have also written them in the matter. When we have particulars as to the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher nominated, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department of the death of C.M. MacKinnon, teacher of the Indian Day School at Litselas Indian Res., Vanderdol, which took place on the 5th May en-route to Vancouver.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Indians will be away most of the time between now and the present term and will all be gone to the canneries by the 15th June, I would recommend that the appointment of a successor be deferred until September.\n\nThe position of dispenser is also vacant as Mrs. MacKinnon will now reside in Vancouver.\n\nI am writing Rev. A. Parmer in the matter as the United Church authorities may wish to make a recommendation to the Department with regard to the appointment of a new teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWBG JJ\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 18, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of this file of yesterday's date, relative to gratuity in the case of the late Mr. MacKinnon, formerly teacher at the Kitselas Indian Day School. I find, upon reviewing the regulations, that it is impossible to give more than two months in his case. The procedure is different in the case of those who have not been continuously in our service from the year 1918. The Department regrets that this is all that can be done in this case.\n\nSalary to May 5th and two months' gratuity to Mrs. MacKinnon can be granted. Both cheques will be directed to your office, so that you can make any adjustment that is necessary with Mrs. MacKinnon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier, M.A.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have received the news of the sudden death of Mr. C. M. MacKinnon of Kitselas, B.C. This took place on the 5th of May. I have not heard what arrangement is being made for the school at Kitselas. This, I expect, will be cared for by Mr. Collison.\n\nWe have forwarded to Mrs. MacKinnon a cheque covering the salary for May and June which we felt would be perfectly safe in view of the decision of the Department to make a special grant of 3 months salary at the time of Mr. MacKinnon's retirement. This cheque will assist her for the time being.\n\nUnder these circumstances I would like to know the course of action the Department will decide upon in the matter of final settlement with Mrs. MacKinnon. Kindly inform me as soon as convenient and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barnes\nOttawa, April 16, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, concerning Mr. C. H. McKinnon, teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, who is giving up duties at the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next, on account of ill-health.\n\nMr. McKinnon was appointed teacher of the Kitselas School on September 1, 1921, and has taught continuously at that School up to the present time. The Department will, upon the termination of his services, allow him a retiring allowance equal to three months' salary, this being the full period for which a payment of this nature can be made in his case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

K. J. Beaton, I may say that I have had a letter from Mr. McKinnon making a strenuous appeal that his term of office at Klemtu be extended another year. As this does not seem possible in view of his failing health and advanced years, I would urge upon the Department sympathetic consideration in regard to a generous bonus to Mr. McKinnon at the time of his retirement. Both Mr. and Mrs. McKinnon are in poor health and recently they have had heavy medical expenses so I feel sure that the Department will give this case practical consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Barry, Inspector of Schools for the Province of British Columbia, and copy of your reply thereto, nominating the services of teachers for the senior and junior classes at the Port Simpson Indian Day School, also a teacher for the Kitselas Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which they possess.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Ruth Levins as teacher of the senior room at Port Simpson for the coming school year, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year. We will also approve of the appointment of Miss Florence L. Perry as teacher of the junior room, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Percy H. Gladstone as teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year, is also approved.\n\nThe local Indian Agent is being informed of the appointment of the above named teachers and the salary they will receive, and he is being requested to give them every assistance he can in their work. I should be pleased if you would inform these teachers of their appointment, and arrange with them to take up duties when the schools reopen after the present summer holidays, on September 1st, next.\n\nIt is hoped that these teachers will meet with success in their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

J. Hewson secured a position as teacher in the Continuation School at Terrace, B.C. He has made temporary arrangements to have the school at Kitselas supplied by Miss Marjorie Kenny, of Terrace, who holds a second-class British Columbia certificate, having graduated from the Vancouver Normal. She has been able to make suitable arrangements for boarding and since her home is in Terrace, it would seem to be advisable to permit her to continue for the academic year, September, 1936, to June, 1937.\n\nIn writing to the Agent, will you please tell him that the appointment is for one year only. During the year we hope that the new school and teachersage will be erected and we can again appoint a married teacher. Hewson's difficulty lay in the fact that it was impossible to rent a suitable house within reasonable walking distance of the school. It is not the type of place, however, to which either the Government or the Church should send a young inexperienced girl under normal circumstances.\n\nHoping that this arrangement will meet with your approval,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

He is considering returning to the University of B.C. to finish his University education.\n\nAs his successor I would like to nominate Mr. Haldane Blackwell, who holds a First-Class Teacher's Certificate, a Certificate in First Aid from the St. John's Ambulance Association, and has had an unusual amount of experience in work with boys in the matter of religious education, recreation and training in arts and crafts.

Gladstone, teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, to take effect June 30th, next.\n\nAs the nomination of teachers for this school is in the hands of the United Church, I would request that you nominate a fully qualified teacher to succeed Mr. Gladstone. Please inform the Department of the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for this school for the coming academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Osterhout,\nD.D.,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n411 Dominion Bank Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Dr. Osterhout:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to your nomination of Mr. Reginald Kelly as teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School in the Skeena River Agency, to take the place of Mr. Hewson resigned. With reference to this matter I would ask you to make the nomination direct to the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa, as I have nothing whatever to do with the recommendation or nomination of teachers. It is of course quite possible that you have nominated Mr. Kelly for appointment by the Department, and that your letter to me is just to let me know that this has been done.\n\nIf the Mr. Reginald Kelly to whom you refer is Thomas R. Kelly P.O. Box 1 Ocean Falls, son of the Rev. P. Kelly, I may say that I did see him, and at that time told him I had nothing to do with nominations. I did suggest that he would do well to see you then in Vancouver.\n\nI am leaving for Hazelton and Prince Rupert next Tuesday, September 8th, and shall make a point of visiting Vinsarbol while in the North. You may rest assured that I shall do everything in my power to help Mr. Kelly, though I am not certain that Kitselas is the best place for him. I should have preferred him to have another year in college and then to receive your nomination to a school where there could have been less actual missionary work than is the case at the Kitselas Indian village. However, I am glad he has come for this year and then it is possible I shall spend some time with him in outlining work and methods.\n\nWith all kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGerald H. Berry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSeptember 7, 1876.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Collison:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of correspondence with the Rev. Dr. Osterhout, of the United Church of Canada, All Dominion Bank Building, Vancouver, B.C., with reference to the nomination of Mr. Reginald Kelly to take the place of Mr. Brown, who has apparently resigned as teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School in your Agency.\n\nThis is of course the first that I have heard of any change of teachers at Kitselas, and I am not very clear as to whether the Department of Indian Affairs has been notified direct with regard to the nomination of Mr. Kelly as teacher by the United Church of Canada. From Dr. Osterhout's letter it would appear that he did write to you in the matter. To make quite certain, I am forwarding a copy of this file to Ottawa for the information of the officials of the Schools' Branch. You will no doubt hear from the Department in due course.\n\nAs you know I hope to be in your Agency during the latter part of the present month. With your help I propose to visit the Kitselas Indian Day School for an inspection in the morning and this will leave the afternoon free for any help I can give the new teacher with methods, programme of work, etc. This I feel certain will be along the line of the Department's wishes in the matter. When Mr. Kelly called on the Assistant Commissioner here and was later introduced to me, I had no idea that he would be teaching in one of our schools this year. Had I known that it was likely that he would be nominated for Kitselas I should have given him several hours instruction, as was done for each of the other new teachers calling here this year.\n\nYou have a copy of my proposed itinerary for September. Mr. Indian Agent Todd does not think I can finish certain necessary work in the Kwakwakwah Agency and go to Prince Rupert by the Canadian Pacific S.S. Princess Adelaide as arranged. If I am delayed at Alert Bay, I shall go on to Prince Rupert on the Union S.S. Caribou due to arrive there on Sunday evening, September 25th. You may therefore expect me to call at your office on Monday morning the 14th. We can then arrange a date for the inspection of the Kitselas Indian Day School.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $90 a teaching month. Mr. Kelly has completed two years in Arts and has a first class certificate from the Vancouver Normal School.\n\nI enclose circular regarding dates of opening and closing of Indian day schools, also staff questionnaire which you should have Mr. Kelly complete and return to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have your letter of September 10th acknowledging my communication concerning Miss Marjorie Kenny. I have just received word at the last moment that Miss Kenny got an opportunity to go to a white school and passed up the opportunity to teach at Kitselas. Her father, as you know, is a member of the Provincial Parliament for that riding and put a good deal of pressure on our Superintendent in British Columbia to get her appointed.\n\nAs they had only two days in which to find a teacher in time for the opening of school they sent in Mr. Reginald Kelly, son of Rev. Peter Kelly who is well known in the Department. Reginald has I understand completed two years in arts and has a first class certificate from the Vancouver Normal. I hope the Department will be able to agree to his appointment for at least one year. He has made a fine impression on our people in Vancouver during the last two years and it may be that in him both the Department and the Church will get some reward for the large expenditure which has been made on the Kelly Family.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB:JGA\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department of the resignation of Mr. Hewson as teacher of the Kitselas Day School. The Rev. Dr. Usterhout, Superintendent of Indian missions of the United Church, has written nominating Miss Marjorie Kenny, and I quote, as follows, from his letter:\n\n\"Since conversing with you recently about the Vanarsdol school and the work of Mr. Hewson as teacher there, I have returned home to find that Mr. Hewson has accepted a position offered by the School Board of Terrace, giving us scarcely two weeks to find a successor. It goes without saying that we are very disappointed over this change in the situation as, with yourself, we felt that the Hewsons were giving very fine service among the Kitselas people.\n\nAn application has come from Miss Marjorie Kenny, a daughter of Mr. E. T. Kenny Esq., M. L. A., of Terrace and although she is but 18 years of age and quite inexperienced we feel that perhaps her appointment for one year would be the best arrangement under the circumstances. Her youth is a decided objection but being of a representative family well known to the Indians and so near at home also, the age question may not be so much stressed in her case. She states that suitable boarding arrangements can be made and I presume she will be able to get home occasionally for the weekend. The reason why the \"one year\" appointment is stressed is because we feel strongly that a married male teacher is decidedly better for such a school, a male leader being much more acceptable to the Indians and the home of such being a decided advantage to the community as a social and religious centre. It will be our avowed aim to secure such a teacher for next year.\"\nI am not in favour of the appointment as Kitselas is not a suitable place for a young girl without experience. However, the appointment is to be for one year only, and I hope when the next appointment is made it will be possible to obtain the services of a married man or older person with experience. In view of the fact that the time is short and schools re-open this week, I would endorse the nomination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

S.S. Osterhout D.D., and to Mr. Indian Agent Collison, with reference to change of teachers at the Kitselas Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSeptember 28, 1936.\n\nMr. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Collison:\n\nI reply to your verbal query of today's date, I may say that the following information with regard to his qualifications was given to me by Mr. T.H. Kelly, the newly appointed teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, when I inspected there on September 22nd.\n\nMr. Thomas Reginald Kelly: Age 25 years and 6 months.\n\nMr. Kelly was educated in the Nanaimo High School, and later went to the Vancouver Normal School for his professional training. It was necessary for him to write certain supplementary examinations before he could be granted any sort of certificate valid in the B.C. Elementary schools. Mr. Kelly tells me that he has this week received information from Victoria that he has been successful in the above mentioned Supplementary Tests. He is now applying to the Registrar of the Department of Education in Victoria for his Second Class Interim Teacher's Certificate, which will be valid for two years.\n\nHad Mr. Kelly taken the First Year's Course at the University of British Columbia, as I advised him to do when he called on me last August, he would be entitled to a First Class Certificate (Interim), but this would take him another year of study.\n\nTo obtain his Permanent Certificate it will be necessary for Mr. Kelly to teach for two years on the Interim Certificate, attend the Provincial Summer School during each of the next two years, and receive from his then Inspector a recommendation that a Permanent Certificate be issued by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nI hope that the above will give you the information you desire. An outline of it will be included in my report on the Kitselas Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, File No. 168-20-1, with regard to the appointment of Mr. Reginald Kelly to the Kitselas Indian Day School. This school was inspected by Capt. G. H. Barry on the 22nd instant, during which time I was present.\n\nThe location of the new school was decided upon after due consideration, on a much better site than the old building, which was in a hollow.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Kelly's qualifications, I drew the Inspector's attention to the contents of the Department's letter, and I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from him, regarding this matter, by which it will be seen that Mr. Kelly does not hold a first class teaching certificate, nor has he had any University education.\n\nNo doubt, the Department is aware that Mr. Kelly is an Indian of the Skidegate Band, Queen Charlotte Islands, as will be shown on the questionnaire when Mr. Kelly returns it to the Department as he has been requested to do.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Collison\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of September 12th in reply to yours of September 10th, Mr. Reginald Kelly has been appointed teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School and the Indian Agent advises that he has begun duties.\n\nIn the second paragraph of your letter of the 10th ultimo, you mentioned the qualifications which Mr. Kelly had informed you he possessed. It is found, however, that Mr. Kelly is not as highly qualified as he advised you and, for your information, I quote the following information received from Inspector G. H. Barry:\n\n\"Mr. Kelly was educated in the Nanaimo High School and later went to the Vancouver Normal School for his professional training. It was necessary for him to write certain Supplementary Examinations before he could be granted any sort of certificate valid in the B. C. Elementary Schools.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 1st, 1942.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI sent on to our Superintendent in British Columbia, Rev. W. P. Bunt, your recent letter in which you told me that, on the advice of the Indian Agent, you had decided to ask the Salvation Army rather than the United Church to nominate the teacher for Kitselas in future. Mr. Bunt replied that the first intimation he had had of the proposed change was my letter. He also says that, in conversation with Major MacKay, he learned that the Major had no information that the Salvation Army had been asked to nominate a teacher.\n\nMr. Bunt goes on to say that conditions in Kitselas have not vitally changed in the last few years and that he does not think that there has been any sufficient reason advanced for withdrawing from the United Church the privilege of nominating the teacher for that School. He is of the opinion that Mr. Colwell, our new minister at Terrace, will be able to give much better attention to the Indians at Kitselas than the Salvation Army can give. Mr. Bunt thinks that we should have been consulted before the Army was asked to nominate a teacher. The fact is that the Salvation Army for years has been trying to undermine the work of a good many of our United Church Indian Missions. Mr. Bunt concludes by asking us to nominate Miss Ida M. Pearson, of Terrace, B.C. She holds a second-class B.C. certificate and has had thirty-five years' teaching experience. Miss Pearson is highly recommended, and Mr. Bunt thinks that she should be appointed to teach the school for the academic year 1942-43. If, at the end of that time, it seems unwise to retain any further hold on this village, we might advise Ottawa that we are withdrawing.\n\nWhen you wrote me, I offered no objection to asking the Salvation Army to nominate a teacher for Kitselas, because I took it for granted that Major MacKay had been consulted and that he had been in touch with our Superintendent in British Columbia. I have understood that, while we have not always been in favor of Mr. Bunt's going to Major MacKay for advice as to what teacher should be nominated, you have taken in the past the position that this was the proper procedure. Why has this procedure not been followed in connection with Kitselas? Now, I know that Kitselas is not a very important Indian village, but it seems to me that, even at this time, I should express the opinion that to make a change\n\np.t.o.\nAugust 19th, 1942.\n\nMr. K.

The real cause of the dispute was that rent of the church building when used as a school had been paid to the United Church instead of to the Christian Band of Workers. The latter, to all intents and purposes, were owners of the building but unfortunately had not been functioning properly in recent years.\n\nRev. M. Bunt, Superintendent of United Church Missions, agreed with the agent's suggestion that the rental be returned to the Christian Band of Workers through the Indian Agency Trust Account, if and when that organization had legally elected its officers, the money to be used only for repairs to the church building at Kitselas.\n\nJ.

In view of the fact that practically all the children attending this school are the children of Salvation Army Soldiers, we feel that we are being reasonable when we request that we be granted the privilege of nominating a teacher.\n\nWe will appreciate hearing from you on this matter at your earliest convenience, and thank you in anticipation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Geo. W. Peacock)\nChief Secretary\nDecember 9, 1938.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nColonel Peacock of the General Headquarters of the Salvation Army, Toronto, visited the Department yesterday and discussed with Dr. McGill, Mr. Hoey and myself the situation at the Kitselas Indian day school.\n\nColonel Peacock pointed out that with the exception of two families all the Indians on the Kitselas Reserve are adherents of the Salvation Army. As a consequence Colonel Peacock expressed the opinion that the Salvation Army should be given the privilege of nominating the teacher. He further stated that the Salvation Army have no objection to the present teacher but in the event of the present teacher giving up duties and a new teacher being appointed he earnestly requested that the Salvation Army be given the privilege of nominating the successor.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of June.\n\nA visit was made to the day school where I met the teachers, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. The school at this place appears to be served very satisfactorily. Mr. Wilson takes a keen interest in the pupils and has done a lot of work improving the school grounds which are now fenced in. I consider the Kitselas Bay school a model in the agency.\n\nW. R. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 20, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing copy of petition signed by certain members of the Attasina Band, requesting a change in the teaching services.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mrs. Wilson is giving satisfactory services, the Department is not prepared to make any change for the academic year 1938-39.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a petition signed by Walter Wright and other Indians of the Kitselas band. Also copy of a letter received from Brigadier W.J. Caruthers, Divisional Commander of the Salvation Army, with headquarters at Wrangell, Alaska. The petition is self-explanatory.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Kitselas, I was informed that Adjutant Mark McKay, Indian adherent to the Salvation Army, was responsible for the petition.\n\nI also found upon enquiry that the Indians were by no means unanimous regarding the matter.\n\nThe present teachers, Mr and Mrs Wilson, were nominated by the United Church of Canada. Mrs Wilson is a very capable teacher and received an excellent report from Inspector Barry when he visited this school.\n\nI consider the Indians at Kitselas are very fortunate in having Mr and Mrs Wilson and certainly would not endorse a petition for their removal which I think was engineered by Salvation Army interests.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.H. Collison\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nWHS/JJ\nenc.\nPetition\n\nTo Rev.W.E.Collison,\nIndian Agent\nPrince Rupert B.C.\n\nWe, the resident members of the Kitselas band of Skeena River natives, respectfully petition the Department of Indian Affairs, to arrange for the appointment of a Salvation Army teacher for our school at Kitselas Village.\n\nSeeing all our people with the exception of two families who belong to the Christian Band of Workers, all members of the Salvation Army, we would like you to permit the Salvation Army to submit an application for a fully qualified teacher for our school.\n\nWhile the United Church have no membership in our village, they have been permitted to supply teachers for our school, but we would now ask that this be discontinued and that the Salvation Army be allowed to supply a suitable teacher.\n\nSigned:\n\nWalter Wright\nAdgt.M.G.McKay\nBen Seymour\nS.H.Bevan\nSilas W.Bevan\nKenneth Richard Cecil\nRoy Bolton\nJohn Cecil\nAlbert Young\nEddie Bennett\nPeter Spalding\nA.Bolton\nSalvation Army\n\nWrangell, Alaska,\nJuly 8-38\n\nRev.W.E.Collison\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert B.C\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe Kitselas School\n\nOn my recent visit to Kitselas, the resident Indians interviewed me with reference to a Salvation Army teacher being appointed to this school.\n\nThey pointed out to me that with the exception of two families all the rest of the village were Salvationist. The two families are Evans and Hudsons, who belong to the \"Christian Band of Workers\". They too, are in favor of an Army teacher.\n\nIn company with Adjutant Mark McKay I took a census of the village and found there were only the two families that were not Salvationists.\n\nI told these Kitselas Indians, the matter would have to be brought to your notice and that I would write you on my return to Headquarters.\n\nIf you are making a change at Kitselas this year, I would be glad to submit the name of a good Army teacher with proper certificate, and in every way capable of teaching this school. I would not want to work any hardship on the present teacher who I understand has been giving good service.\n\nIf a change is being made I would be pleased to hear from you as soon as possible so that a good teacher could be placed before you for appointment to this school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"W J Carruthers\"\n\nBrigadier, Divisional Commander\n\n(copy)\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your letter of the 8th inst. regarding the Kitselas day school.\n\nIn reply, I would state that no change is contemplated in the teaching staff of this school.\n\nThe Indians evidently do not realize the fact that they have a very competent teacher, and are fortunate in having Mrs. Wilson.\n\nMay I point out that the Department is mainly concerned in the education of the children, and where satisfactory service is given, it cannot be expected to make changes such as requested, it would be most unfair to those concerned.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Kitselas, I found that the Indians were by no means unanimous regarding the change of a teacher notwithstanding the petition forwarded to this office.\n\nWhile the Department is willing to give careful consideration regarding appointments when vacancies occur, I certainly could not endorse the present request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW E. Collison\nIndian Agent\n\nBrigadier W.J. Carruthers,\nSalvation Army, Div. Commander\nWrangell, Alaska.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith x x x x x and beg to report as follows:-\n\nThe following new appointments have been made in the teaching staffs of the day schools in the agency.\n\nThe vacancy at Kitselas has been filled by the appointment of Mrs. Irene M. Wilson; and the appointment of Mr. Earl Severson for the Fort Essington school following the resignation of Mrs. E. Pogson.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 31, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nOn the nomination of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, the Department has approved the appointment of Mrs. Irene Margaret Wilson as teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School to succeed Mr. Reginald Kelly who has been transferred to the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Wilson will begin duties on September 1st, and will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have her complete and return to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. H. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOttawa, September 3, 1942.\n\nRe: Kitselas Indian Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 1st, in which you send forward additional information, received by you from Mr. Hunt, in respect to the nomination of a teacher for the above-noted school.\n\nI must express regret that a misunderstanding seems to exist in regard to this matter. A careful survey of the files shows that Mr. H. Peacock, Chief Secretary of the Salvation Army in Canada, interviewed the Director of this Branch on December 8th, 1925. Mr. Peacock, during the course of this interview, stated that he had no objection whatever to the work of the teacher then in charge of the Kitselas School. He did feel, however, that should the teacher resign at any time, the Salvation Army should have the privilege of nominating her successor. Mr. Peacock informed the Director that practically all the children attending the school are the children of Salvation Army soldiers. On December 9th, 1925, instructions were received from the Director by the officers of the Welfare and Training Division that when a vacancy occurred at this school the desirability of having the Salvation Army nominate the teacher should be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed, and on December 27th, 1925, a letter was written to Mr. Peacock, in which we stated that these instructions from the Director would be acted upon when the nomination of a teacher for the school came up for review.\n\nOn June 2nd, 1926, a petition signed by Chief M.C. McKay, Chief Waiter Wright and a large number of Indian parents of the Kitselas Band, was received by the Department. In this petition they requested a Salvation Army teacher for their Indian day school. The petitioners in their appeal stated:\n\n\"Since all our people, with the exception of two families who belong to the Christian Band of Workers, are members of the Salvation Army, we would like you to permit the Salvation Army to submit to you an application for a fully qualified teacher for this school. While the United Church have no membership in our village, they have been permitted to supply teachers for the school, but we would now ask that this be discontinued and that in future the Salvation Army be allowed to supply the teacher.\"\n\nThe Department was notified by Dr. Dorey, in a letter dated July 18th, 1942, that Mrs. Robert Wilson was anxious to transfer to the Cape Mudge School, and this transfer was approved in a letter dated July 21st, 1942.\n\nRev. R.B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\np.t.o.\nthe same date an air mail letter was sent forward to Indian Commissioner MacKay by Mr. Phelan. In this letter Mr. Phelan referred to the visit of Mr. Peacock and to the petition received from the Kitselas Band and asked for the Commissioner's comments and recommendation. On July 31st Major MacKay replied, sending forward a copy of a letter received by him from Indian Agent Gillett. A copy of the Indian Agent's letter was forwarded to Dr. Dorey on August 4th. Major MacKay in his letter states:\n\n\"I would advise that I have enquired of Mr. Indian Agent Gillett and enclose his letter herewith - from which it appears that almost the entire reserve are adherents to the Salvation Army. In my opinion, therefore, this denomination might be requested to nominate a teacher for the vacant position.\"\n\nThis letter has the printed signature of Major MacKay but is also signed by Inspector Coleman. It is just possible that Major MacKay was absent from the office when the letter was written. You will note, therefore, that Mr. Bunt is in error when he states that Major MacKay had no information that the Salvation Army had been asked to nominate a teacher. Not only was Major MacKay asked to express an opinion on the matter, but he was requested also to consult the Indian agent.\n\nI am personally in agreement with Mr. Bunt when he states that he should have been consulted before the Army was asked to nominate a teacher. In this connection I am fully persuaded that when Mr. Phelan wrote to Major MacKay on July 21st he did so with the feeling that Major MacKay would not only consult the Indian agent but the other parties, including Mr. Bunt, interested in the nomination of the teacher and in the operation of the school. These misunderstandings do arise, regardless of the care exercised from time to time, and we do attempt to exercise the utmost care in dealing with these somewhat delicate matters. We are, as you know, working with a very limited staff here, as the result of enlistments, and Major MacKay has been without even a clerk for the last six months.\n\nIn my judgment it would be very unwise for us to accept the nomination of a teacher by the United Church in this case. The Salvation Army have been requested to nominate a teacher and have replied that the necessary steps to do so have been taken by them and that the name and qualifications of the teacher will be sent forward in due course. Indeed, it is just possible that a teacher, nominated by the Salvation Army has already incurred expenses in making ready to take up this position at Kitselas. I feel confident we shall experience the utmost difficulty in securing teachers for the vacant positions at our Indian day schools. Consequently, Miss Pearson will experience no difficulty whatever in securing a position.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n317 Ave. D South\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nOct. 27, 1942.\n\nThe Indian Agent\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Oct. 6, I received a wire that I was accepted by your Department as teacher for Driftless school, and for me to proceed there. I at once wired a refusal on account of my health. A Salvation Army Headquarters still urged me to go. I wrote on Oct. 8th asking what I believe is a pertinent question. As I have received no reply, I feel it a duty to ask you to please answer it.\n\nWere you informed prior to or since my acceptance by your Department that (because I have what Dr. J. Scott of Edmonton calls neuro-circulatory asthenia from which I cannot expect a full recovery till August 1943) I am unable at times to do any work at all for periods of one, two or even three days? In our regular work my wife can substitute for me though she has never been to school. Has authority given her to substitute for me during those periods when I could not officiate as teacher?\n\nI enclose a stamped self-addressed envelope for reply, for which I thank you in advance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRichard Boyce, Adjutant.\nOttawa, September 22, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, in which you intimate that Mr. J. T. Gillingham, Divisional Commander of the Salvation Army at Wrangall, Alaska, has nominated Adjutant Russell Boyes as teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School. This nomination is acceptable to the Department and approved. Mr. Boyes will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month plus cost-of-living bonus.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

M. Wilson had been transferred from the Kitselas to the Cape Mudge Indian Day School.\n\nTo succeed her at Kitselas, the Department has approved the appointment of Adjutant Russel Boyes, at a salary of $90.00 a teaching month, effective October 1, 1942.\n\nCopy of letter of appointment is attached and other documents will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nR.

He has had previous experience in teaching Native\nchildren, having taught in the Glen Vowell School, some years\nsince.

His appointment was approved, effective October 1, 1942, at a salary of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay in which he states that Adjutant Boyes did not report for duty on October 1, due to ill health. His letter regarding his physical condition reads as follows:\n\n\"Were you informed, prior to or since my acceptance by your Department, that (because I have what Dr. J. Scott of Edmonton calls Neuro-circulatory Asthenia from which I cannot expect a full recovery till August, 1943) I am unable at times to do any work at all for periods of one, two or even three days? In our regular work my wife can substitute for me, though she has never been to school.

This, I believe, was done after he had received a letter from Mr. Boyes giving his reasons for thinking it unwise for him to accept the position. The attached letter is the first intimation I have had of the nature of Mr. Boyes illness.\n\nPersonally, I think the Salvation Army should be asked to nominate another teacher. The mail services between here and Alaska, headquarters of Brig. Gillingham, are such that I would recommend the Department contacting Salvation Army Headquarters at Toronto, in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M.

Captain Bailey taught at the Kitselas School from February 1 to 11, both dates inclusive, at the rate of $30.00 a month.

C.,\nJanuary 10th, 1948.\n\nRe: Kitselas School.\n\nCaptain E. L. Bailey was transferred to Canyon City. Unfortunately, she did not arrive at the Iaas in time to reach Canyon City while navigation was open.\n\nIn my letter of November 31st, I stated: \"If the transfer is approved, it will be necessary to take quick action so Miss Bailey can be transported to Canyon City before the river freezes over.\" On December 11th I received word from the Commissioner that the transfer was approved. We wired Miss Bailey and Canyon City for boats to meet her. She left here on the first boat going to the Iaas, December 17th, arriving at Lincoln on the 18th, to find that the river had completely frozen over the day before.\n\nIt is not within my province to criticize the Department, and it is not my intention to do so, but I cannot refrain from pointing out the fact that when all matters have to go through the Vancouver office, considerable delay and inconvenience is caused.\n\nJ.

I believe it will be more satisfactory to get it as regular salary, and we will not be afraid of having it cut off.\n\nI have just received the amount equal to bonus for June quarter from the Treas. of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChar M. MacKinnon\nTeacher\nOttawa, August 20th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that payment of bonus to teachers in Indian day schools was discontinued from March 31st, last. Previous to that date you were paid salary for the academic year at the rate of $800 and bonus at the rate of $150, or a total of $950 for the ten teaching months. The cheque for your salary was sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, and the bonus cheque was sent direct to you.\n\nOwing to the discontinuance of the bonus, your salary was increased from $800 to $950 from April 1st, last, and payment at this rate was made for the June quarter, and a cheque for $265 was forwarded to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society. You will receive this amount from him, and you will note that you are now being paid at the same rate as when you were allowed bonus.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChas. M. MacKinnon, Esq.,\nVanarsdol,\nB.C.\nTo the Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nMy bonus cheque for the quarter April-June, has not come to hand yet. This being considerably past the usual time, and as mail frequently gets astray on this line, I would like to know if it has been mailed, and if so, on what date, so that I might take the matter up with the Postal authorities.

F. MacKenzie.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to confirm my telegram of the 20th relative to the total loss by fire of the Kitselas Indian Day School and teacher's residence.\n\nOn receipt of word respecting the fire, I visited Kitselas and found that the conflagration had been caused by an overheated stove. The fire took place at night when the teacher was sleeping and although upon awakening he did his best to subdue the flames the fire had already gained too much headway.\n\nThe Indians gave every assistance possible. Everything was destroyed including the teacher's personal effects.\n\nAs stated in my wire temporary arrangements were made to carry on the school in the United Church building as soon as possible. The church authorities however, may not care to prolong the present arrangement and there is no other building that can be used for the purpose. As the teacher is without accommodation some assistance should be given towards securing a room in the village, and I would suggest that $10. per month be allowed for this purpose.\n\nI would again express the opinion that fire extinguishers should be supplied for these out-of-the-way school buildings where water pressure is not available as by this means fire may sometimes be held in check until assistance arrives.\n\nThe Indians did everything possible in fighting the fire and supplied the teacher with necessary clothing as he escaped from the building in his night attire, all his other belongings having been\ndestroyed.\n\nNecessary supplies only, as authorized by the Department, are being purchased locally. A further requisition however will be forwarded for school desks as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 1, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, reporting the total loss by fire of the Kitselas Indian day school building and teacher's residence, which was caused by an overheated stove. The arrangements made to carry on the work have been noted. It is hoped that the Church authorities will agree to the work being carried on in the church, as it will not be possible during the ensuing fiscal year to provide the expenditure required in the erection of a new school and residence. It is noted that you are forwarding a requisition for the school desks required, and this will receive consideration.\n\nRegarding the providing of some assistance towards the cost of a room for the teacher's use in the village, I have to say that the Department has never paid for services of this nature. Our Estimates for next year have been cut to such an extent that we could not, in any event, pay the cost of a room for the teacher's use. It will be necessary for you to limit, to the lowest possible point, all expenses in arranging for suitable classroom accommodation. If the church authorities will not agree to the use of their building during the next school year, it may be necessary to discontinue teaching activity at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJanuary 31st,\n1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fire - Kitselas Indian Day School.\n\nA few days ago we received a telegram from Rev. H. T. Allen, of Terrace, B.C., that the school on the Kitselas Reserve had been burned. I enclose a copy of a letter which has just been received from Mr. Allen, giving further details. Undoubtedly, you have received a report of the occurrence from Mr. Indian Agent Collison.\n\nSchool is being conducted in the church and we are very glad to place it at the disposal of the Department until such time as a new school can be erected.\n\nI would appreciate the privilege of looking over the plans for the new school before they are finally approved and the grant made.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\n\nEnc.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM MR. H.T. ALLEN TO REV. A. BARNETT, DATED JAN. 23RD, 1935.\n\n\"Supplementing the telegram of Jan. 20th re the Vansardol fire.\n\nI heard about it just after dinner on Wednesday the 16th, word having been brought down by Paul Mason. He stated that Percy Gladstone needed immediate medical care, and I made immediate preparations to take Dr. Mills by speeder. But there was none in town, so eventually I had to walk against that winter wind.\n\nI found P.C. in bed at McKenzie's. He was still a bit weak but had gotten over a chill from exposure that night. He stated that the first sign of fire was the smoke that awakened him about 12:30 a.m. (not 1:30 a.m.) only an hour or so after returning from basketball. At that time the fire in the heater was diminishing. On coming down he saw smoke issuing from the V-joint cedar lining just to the north of the front entrance. He smashed the wall in with an axe and it immediately burst into flame. Seeing that it was beyond control even by this time, he hurried upstairs to rescue some effects. So strong was the smoke by this time, that it almost overpowered him, as he drew in a breath. He managed to save the register of the school which he had brought into the living quarters, and then went out and collapsed in the snow about 30 yards from the house in the direction of the river. He had on only his pajamas, which was his only article saved from the fire. He must have stayed there 15-20 minutes and was picked up by Eddie Peak, one of the village Indians, as he came to fight the fire. They rescued only the school table. Percy came down to us on Thursday and is leaving tonight. The poor boy feels he has nowhere to go now nor a place to call his own, so we just let him stay as long as he wanted.\n\nMr. Collison was up, and thinks new buildings ought to be erected more suitable than the last. He also suggests use of the church. I think there ought to be some rental, as there is the wear and tear on the building at least. The Salvation Army were willing to let him use their hall until a new school etc. was built. The Indians gave him almost a complete outfit, suit, socks, shirts and underwear. We had a few things for him and there were some other articles given us for him. He expects to start teaching on Wednesday of this week.\n\nPercy is not sure how the fire started. It seemed to be from the chimney at the point where the stovepipe enters the brick, and to have spread from there. I have done what I could to look after everything there and I trust there will be greater appreciation among the people of the school etc. They asked to have Percy retained as the teacher.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6398, File 823-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 3, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing an extract from a communication which you received from Rev. H. T. Allen regarding the destruction by fire of the Kitselas Indian Day School building.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that the Department was advised by Mr. Agent Collison regarding this matter and that he was arranging for the temporary use of the United Church building in which to carry on the school work. He was instructed to arrange for the purchase locally of the necessary classroom equipment, with the exception of desks. The Department is pleased that the Church authorities will place the church building at its disposal until such time as a new school building can be erected. Our Estimates for the next fiscal year have been cut to such an extent that it will not be possible during the coming fiscal year to provide the expenditure required in the erection of a new combined school and teacher's residence. It is hoped, therefore, that the use of the church for school purposes will be continued for an indefinite period. Should a small rental be required, the Department might favourably consider payment of same.\n\nThe loss occasioned the teacher by the destruction during the fire of his clothing and other effects is regretted. It will not be possible, however, for the Department to reimburse him for any loss.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. A. F. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nA. F.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 13th,\n1933.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Use of Church Building at Kitselas for Day School.\n\nAfter communicating with our people in the area and discussing the matter with our Superintendent of Missions for British Columbia, who was in Prince Rupert Presbytery recently, our Board at its recent session decided to request the Department of Indian Affairs to pay at the rate of $12.50 per month rent, or $150.00 per year, for the use of the church building at Kitselas as long as it is occupied by the Day School.\n\nThis money will be kept to the credit of the church and applied towards repainting and redecorating it when it is no longer used as a school.\n\nHoping that this will be satisfactory to the Department,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\nOttawa, April 22, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the payment of a rental for the use of the church building at Kitselas during the period it is occupied for day school purposes.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our funds this year have been considerably reduced, and, upon consideration, the Department will only be able to provide for the payment of rental at the rate of $100 per annum as from the first instant. The rental will be paid quarterly, it being presumed that the cheque should be forwarded to the Treasurer of the United Church. It is noted, further, that the amount received will be kept to the credit of the church and applied towards repainting and redecorating the building when it ceases to be used for school purposes. I hope, in view of our present financial condition, that the amount of rental allowed, as stated above, will be satisfactory.\n\nThe local Indian Agent is being informed of the rental allowed and requested to forward a voucher, in favour of the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada, 299 Queen Street West, Toronto 2, Ont., at the end of each quarter for the rental due at the above rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We understand that the mess-house contains a small quantity of plain furniture, linoleum and a few miscellaneous articles; a good cook stove with hot water boiler and certain other equipment; and that, in the basement, there is a McClary hot air furnace, complete with hot and cold air pipes.\n\nI have therefore to request that, when the building is ready, you will arrange to have the furnace removed from the mess-house at the hatchery and installed in the school building. When the building is ready, you should also remove any furnishings and equipment that would be useful in the residence and school. The Department would pay any costs involved in having the furnace, stove and other furnishings removed to the new school building. It is hoped that there will not be a large expense involved in the transportation of the equipment that is taken from Lakelee to the school.\n\nNo doubt, it will be necessary to supply desks for the classroom and equipment for the teacher's living quarters. Please furnish the Department with a list of the desks and other equipment required. Regarding the desks, you should give the size and the number of each size that will be needed.\n\nI may add that Mr. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, has been informed that the Department is taking over the buildings and equipment of the hatchery.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith my Diary and Expense accounts for the month of September and to report as follows:\n\nI also met Mr. William Little at Terrace and conferred with him regarding the work on the new school and teacher's residence for the Kitselas Reserve. Mr. Little has been engaged on other work and informed me that he would not be able to start on the school until some time in October. No specifications were received with the blue print plans of the proposed building and it will be necessary to have these prepared before the work commences.\n\nBefore leaving Kitselas, I went over the school plans again with Mr. Little and together with Capt. Barry decided upon a new location for the building, which will be more suitable than the old one.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Albert & McCaffery,\n\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1936 Nov. 5th | To supplies supplied for new Kitselas Day School, as per attached account. |        |\n|            | 1 Piece 8\" Vitrified Pipe                     | 1.80   |\n|            | 1 Barrel Lime                                 | 3.95   |\n|            | 1050 Common Brick                             | 42.00  |\n|            | 98 Sax Cement                                 | 110.25 |\n|            | Cartage                                       | 10.50  |\n|            | Prepaid Freight                               | 88.68  |\n|            |                                              | **227.18** |\n\nAuthority No. 666, August 18-36\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 506\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

I consider the account reasonable for the services rendered.\n\nOn account of the cold weather and deep snow it was necessary to temporary suspend work on the building until conditions are more favorable.

An inspection was made of the new school building in course of erection. This work is progressing very slowly and I did my best to hasten matters up. Weather conditions and other unforeseen delays have held up the work to a large extent. It will now be necessary to carry it over to the new fiscal year.

This is partly due to the fact that a part cement basement called for in the plans was not provided for, and partly to the slowness of the work most of which had to be undertaken during the winter months. notwithstanding, the work has been well done and the building when completed will be one of the best of its kind in the agency.\n\nThe following furnishings will be required for the classroom and teacher's residence:\n\n**Classroom**\n- Blackboard 30 x 4 feet.\n- Book cupboard\n- Window blinds\n- Teacher's desk and chair\n- 6 single desks\n- 1 lamp\n\n**Residence**\n- Crockery & kitchen ware\n- Table for living room\n- 1 occasional chair\n- Blinds for windows.\n\nPrices and specifications for the above will be forwarded later.\n\nOther articles and furniture have been provided from the Lakelse hatchery buildings including one furnace for central heating of school and kitchen range, linoleum, bathroom fixtures etc., which items very considerably cut down the cost of furnishings.\n\nAs it will probably be June before the painting can be done it will be advisable to defer the opening until September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.E.S. J.J.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs branch\nOttawa.\nApril 22, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nAn amount of $4,500 was provided in last year's Special Supplementary Estimates for the building of a Day school on the Kitselas Reserve, Skeena River Agency, B.C.\n\nThe work was carried out by day labour employing Mr. William Little of Terrace, B.C. as foreman carpenter.\n\nI am just advised by the Indian Agent that it will require a further expenditure of approximately $856.00 to complete this building. It is necessary that the work be continued without interruption and the Agent has instructed Mr. Little to carry on, up to April 15th, on the understanding that he cannot be paid until the new appropriation is available.\n\nI would ask you therefore to kindly arrange to provide an amount of $856.00 for the completion of this work.\n\nArchitect.\nthat they were not included in the original plan. You should, also, return the plan, showing in what part of the building you propose placing the bathroom.\n\nThe Department does not consider it necessary to paint the shingles and, unless it is advisable for the preservation of the building to paint the exterior, item No. 2 above will have to remain until next year. A final decision will not be made until your reply is received.\n\nWith regard to item 1, you might let me have an estimate of the cost of the kalsomining that you consider necessary. Would it not be possible to use the building in its present condition without kalsomining until next year?\n\nWith reference to item 6, if a well is required for the supply of drinking water, you should let me know the cost of digging it and, also, the cost of a pump. For your information, I may add that it is not usual to pipe water from the pump into the teacher's residence.\n\nYou may arrange for the erection of two outside toilets at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nAs pointed out in the first paragraph of this letter, no funds have been specifically provided for this building in our present year's appropriation and, as a result, it will be extremely difficult to find additional funds. Therefore, only the work absolutely necessary to make the building habitable can be considered this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 19, 1937.\n\nGentlemen,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department regrets the delay in forwarding you payment of $3.50 for hauling supplies to the Kiteclan Indian Day School.\n\nThis account was forwarded to the Department some time ago by Mr. Agent Collison but was inadvertently overlooked on our file. Arrangements have been made to forward your cheque today.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMessrs. Doney & Jordan,\nc/o J. Doney,\nTerrace, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have just received cheque from the Dept. of Finance for $650 for team hauling done by us for the Vancouver Indian school in Dec. 1936. We were advised by the man in charge of work that he would need our team again shortly, but as the supplies he expected did not arrive we presented our bill some time in February. Early in March we hauled the expected supplies 2 days work $3.50, and we presented total bill of $4.50 to the Prince Rupert agent, reminding him the previous bill had not been paid. These bills were made in quadruplicate as required. We have not received our $650.\n\nWhy all this delay? We are not in the transfer business. We are ordinary working men, loggers, and we left our work at an inconvenience to do this hauling because other teams were not easily available. You have had other men working on the building who get their pay regularly. Why discriminate against us? We are in no position to advance credit to the Dept. of Indian Affairs. We have to buy hay at 27\u00a2 per ton and oats at 3.5\u00a2 per bushel, and pay our men wages, to do this work for you. It may be a small sum, but we need every cent we make, and it is extremely annoying.\n\nWe hesitate to believe that this dilatory method of paying your debts can be the regular policy of your Dept., and are inclined to believe it is due to some neglect or irregularity in your local agent. We have already billed him twice, and are therefore writing to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDoney & Jordan\n\nPlease address J. Doney\nTerrace, B.C.\nOttawa, April 28th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the construction of a new school on the Kitselas Reserve.\n\nIt is regretted that this work was not completed before the end of March, last. The appropriation in which the expenditure for this school was provided has now lapsed and no provision was made in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for additional funds.\n\nYou mentioned in your letter that the following items are unfinished:\n\n(1) Finishing of interior and kalsomining classroom and living quarters.\n\n(2) Painting of exterior of building and shingles.\n\n(3) Finishing of brick chimney.\n\n(4) Putting in bathroom fixtures.\n\n(5) Service water tank for kitchen and bathroom supply.\n\n(6) Digging well for water pipe, pump and piping.\n\nOn reviewing the copy of the plan sent to you for this building, it is noted that no provision was made for a bathroom. Please let me know why you consider it necessary to place in this building items 4 and 5 in view of the fact\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23th ultm. relative to the Niselas Indian Bay School, which arrived at this office during my absence in the south.\n\nWith regard to the delay in completing the building I would state that the work was not started until late in October owing to the fact that the carpenter appointed by the Department to put up the school was employed on other work at the time. Added to this, a severe winter made it necessary to close the work down for a time making it impossible to finish the building by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the cost has exceeded the original appropriation of $4500.00 which no doubt is due to the extra expense of putting in a cement foundation and basement.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that on my recommendation the cement work called for in the plans was considerably curtailed, thereby saving further expenditure.\n\n(1) With regard to item 1 in your letter covering kalsomining of the interior in the classroom and teacher's residence which will cost in the neighborhood of $35.00. This work can be deferred till next year.\n\n(2) With respect to the painting of the exterior of the school and shingles, this must be done to preserve the building and prevent the boards from warping and cracking.\n\nThe paint for this purpose has already been purchased and paid for under vouchers numbers 7945 and 7984 in favor of M.T.Kenney Ltd., leaving the labor only to be provided for. This will cost approximately - $75.00.\n2.\n\n(3) Finishing the brick chimney on the outside of the building. This must be done before another winter sets in, otherwise the bricks will deteriorate. Cost approximately $10.00\n\n(4) Installing bathroom fixtures etc. The small addition on the plans intended for a summer kitchen which was unnecessary, has been utilized as a bathroom. The bath and other fixtures were brought from the dismantled lakeview hatchery building, authorized by the Department in letter dated Oct. 29th 1936.\n\nThe bathroom will prove of the greatest convenience, especially in the case of a woman teacher, as however, the cost of the building has already exceeded the appropriation, I would suggest that the bath and basin only be installed at present, and an outside toilet provided. This would do away with the necessity of purchasing and installing a service tank and kitchen hot water boiler and other fittings. The cost of putting in the bath and wash basin with drain pipe will be approximately $45.00\n\n(5) Already answered.\n\n(6) It will be necessary to have a well dug and a suitable pump installed for domestic use and fire protection. There is no running water nearby. Probable cost of pump (No. 1059 McLennan, McGeely Ltd., Vancouver) including freight $35.00, labor and material $20.00. Total $55.\n\nI would recommend that the following enclosed amounts for wages and material be paid.\n\nReturns of Labor, weeks ending April 3rd, 10th & 17th. $302.60\nMaterial, No. 8063, Vanarsdol Lumber Co. $2.86\n\" 8064 E.T. Kenney Ltd., hardware etc. $3.20\n\" 8062 Mitchell & Currie, Cyproc etc. $65.36\n\nTotal $375.02\n\nThe total amount required to temporarily finish the building for use at the beginning of September will be approximately $185.00. I would recommend that this amount be provided.\n3.\n\nA list of necessary furnishings for the classroom and teacher's residence the cost of which is not included in the above sum, has already been forwarded to the Department in my letter of April 14th.\n\nAs requested, a blue print plan of the school is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the Kitselas Indian Day School. In view of your recommendation, you may make the following expenditures:\n\n1. Painting exterior of school and shingles, at a cost not exceeding $75.00\n\n2. Finishing brick chimney, at a cost not exceeding $10.00\n\n3. Installing bath and wash basins, with drain pipe, at a cost not exceeding $45.00\n\n4. Digging well and installing pump, at a cost not exceeding $55.00\n\nThe total amount of the expenditures authorized above is $185.00, which must not be exceeded.\n\nIt is presumed that you have discontinued work on this building, and the labour returns for the weeks ended April 3rd, 10th and 17th will be paid.\n\nThe other accounts mentioned in your letter have not yet reached us but will probably arrive in the next few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

You may also purchase a new pump at a cost of $30.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW.E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to the Department's letters dated April 28th and June 1st last, authorizing expenditures to furnish the Kitselas Indian Day school, I beg to enclose herewith, returns of labor amounting to $272.50; and accounts for material amounting to $14.72, making a total of $287.22 for work done as follows:\n\n- Painting exterior of shingles of school\n- Finishing brick chimney\n- Installing bath, wash-basin and drain pipe authorized in official letter No.168-20-5, June 1st.$185.00.\n\nConstruction of outside toilets, (1 double for school\n\n- Painting; and digging pits authorized in official letter No.168-20-5, April 28th.$75.00\n\nMaterial, Albert & McCaffery, cement etc. $3.17\nE.T.Kenney Ltd., hardware $11.55 $14.52\n\nRemoving school desks from old church to new building and putting same on strips.\nTaking down blackboard and replacing same in new school. $12.50\n\n$287.22\n\nOn account of continued wet weather during the past summer, the work of painting the school was held up and has cost more than the original estimate. There not being sufficient funds, it was not possible to have the well dug.\n\nFurther examination showed that it would be necessary to sink to a depth of 40 feet before reaching water. This will cost $2.50 per foot for digging and casing, bringing the total cost of sinking the well to approximately $100.00, this does not include the cost of a pump which will be another $30.\n\nI would recommend that this work be done as soon as possible as a protection against fire hazard, the nearest well\nwell being about three hundred yards distant from the school.\n\nThe school and residence are now completed and in use. Progress of the work on the building was slow at times owing largely to severe weather conditions, and other difficulties.\n\nThe work, however, was well and satisfactorily carried out by Mr. Little and the building as it stands is well worth the money expended.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1937-38    | To cement, lime etc., for Kitigan I.O.

The Government shall have the right to make such holes or other alterations in the walls, floors, ceilings and roofs of the subscriber's premises and to attach such brackets, wires or other appliances as it shall deem necessary or expedient for the purpose of installing and maintaining the said telephone service and shall not be accountable or held liable for any damage caused thereby.\n\n2. If the telephone in a residence is used in whole or in part for the purpose of a business or profession or otherwise than for the usual requirements of a residence, the Government may charge the same rate therefor as that charged for telephones in places of business at the location in question.\n\n3. The Subscriber shall take good care of the instruments and all accessories connected therewith, which are and remain the property of the Government and shall not damage, alter or remove the same or any part thereof, nor make any additions thereto; should they be damaged, altered, removed or any attachments to be made thereto, and in any case that any of the said instruments and accessories therewith shall be broken, injured, or damaged, ordinary wear and tear, or damage by fire excepted, the Subscriber agrees to compensate the Government for such breakage, injury, or damage on demand.\n\n4. The Subscriber shall permit the Government, its agents or workmen to have access at all times, to his, her, its premises or every other place under his, her, its control, through or over which its wires pass or apparatus is fixed, and in case the Government desires to inspect or to remove, or in any way deal with or handle its instruments and accessories on the premises of the Subscriber, it shall have the right to enter such premises without delay or inconvenience and if unoccupied or found to be empty or inaccessible, or if entry be refused by the Subscriber or any occupier of said premises, the wires entering the building in which the instruments are installed, may be forthwith disconnected (in the interest of the line as a whole) and the Subscriber will have no claim for interruption of service pending its restoration.\n\n5. The Government reserves the right to remove its instruments and accessories from the premises of the Subscriber at any time, on returning the unearned rentals if any, if the Subscriber or any other user makes any improper use of the said instruments and accessories by using foul, abusive or profane language, or by permitting any other improper use over the said instruments and accessories, or her or its instruments or fails to pay the monthly service charge, long distance call and other rates stipulated or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this contract; the Government shall not be liable for any damages caused by such removal unless the same are caused by the negligence of the Government servants.\n\n6. The service furnished under this contract is for the exclusive use of the Subscriber, his, her, its employees or members of his, her family, upon his, her, its business and the Subscriber shall not extend the use of this telephone to any other persons nor shall it be used by the Subscriber to transmit messages for any other persons with or without any consideration.\n\n7. The Government will endeavour to furnish as perfect and continuous means of communication between the Subscriber and other Subscribers as possible but will not be liable for any loss or damage that may occur during or through the connection or the failure of any connection of any Subscriber with any of its exchanges or through the employment of any messengers' vehicles or other service.\n\n8. All messages transmitted by the employees of the Government orally by telephone or by messenger will be at the risk of the sender and addressee. The Government will assume no responsibility in respect to such messages and will not be liable for loss or damage by reason of delays, errors, non-delivery or any other cause, and shall not be held liable for interruptions to the service or other annoyances from weather conditions, sleet or snow storms, atmospheric or induction disturbances, or from strikes, accidents or other causes beyond the Government's control.\nAIR MAIL\n\nApril 2, 1948\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th ultimo,\nfile 12-11-1 (168) with reference to the proposed\nprovision of telephone facilities at the Kitselas\nIndian Day School.\n\nWe are prepared to pay the cost of in-\nstallation on the understanding that such cost would\nnot exceed $25.00.\n\nHowever, we would expect either the\nteacher or the Salvation Army to pay the full cost\nof the monthly rental. We are not prepared to pay\nany part of the latter item.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MOD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of March 13th in connection with the proposed provision of telephone facilities at the Kitselas Indian Day School. I have discussed this matter with District School Inspector Davey who agrees with the Agent that the circumstances are such that an expenditure for the installation and rental of a telephone is warranted.\n\nYou will note that the Salvation Army is prepared to pay 50% of the monthly rental, the Department to pay the other $1.50 each month and installation costs amounting to approximately $25.00. In view of the circumstances I concur in Mr. Anfield's recommendation and would ask the Department to approve the installation.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAt Kitselas we have a Day School with an average attendance of between 12 and 15. There are about 45 people living in the village all told. Access to this village is difficult at any time. Present modes of travel to Kitselas are by railroad from Prince Rupert to Kitselas and to walk up the track about 3 miles to the Indian village; the other way is by road from Terrace to Copper ferry and to walk up the track about 5 miles.\n\nThe teacher at Kitselas is an unmarried Salvation Army Officer and she has been a bit disturbed at having to live alone without any means of communication with the outside. Recently this village came down with a very serious outbreak of flu and as the ferry service was frozen out, it was some time before we received word of conditions in the village. Arrangements were made at once to send a Doctor into these people and Dr. Macdonald sent a Field Nurse up there for a few days this week-end.\n\nIt is recommended that a telephone be placed in this village so that a direct communication can be had with the exchange at Terrace. The Dominion Government Telegraph Service have been approached and have agreed to put this line in provided that the village people supply the poles and look after the line men as to board and room for 3 days. I have consulted with Brigadier Gillingham of the Salvation Army and he authorizes me to state that his organization will pay 50% of the monthly rental of $3.00 for the phone, if and when installed. It is, therefore, recommended\n\n(1) that the Department make available a sum of $25.00 for installation costs.\n(2) that the Department authorize the installation of this phone by the Dominion Government Telegraph Service at a monthly rental of $3.00 - 50% to be paid by the Salvation Army.\nI have consulted Dr. Macdonald, the Agency Medical Officer, regarding this matter and he is of the opinion that the phone would prove of real value in connection with Health Services at this village. I attach herewith contract forms forwarded to this office by the Dominion Government Telegraph Service.\n\nYour instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF.

The alternative suggested by Mr. Anfield, involving the provision of oil heaters, is not considered desirable in view of the uncertainty of fuel oil supplies and the availability of wood fuel in the district.\n\nAlthough no specific provision is made in the Estimates for this work, I would recommend that the Department endeavour to make funds available by transfer, if necessary, and that the tender of Thom Sheet Metal Ltd. for $659.00 be accepted.\n\nW. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEncl.\nI sent furnace men to Kitselas to repair the furnace. Attached please find their report on this equipment which has been left dismantled pending further advice. I have absolute reliance on the manager of Thom Sheet Letais. He is an expert in his line and I am satisfied with his report that the furnace is beyond repair.\n\nI have instructed him to submit a bid immediately on the replacement of this equipment and installation. It is the old story of trying to do a job on the cheap. The furnace was installed by incompetent labour in the first place and now we must pay the price. It is no wonder that the teachers at Kitselas have always complained of the cold. On receipt, bids and installation costs will be forwarded. I inspected this furnace this spring and at that time was nervous about its condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nSuperintendent,\nSkeena River Agency\n\nEnclosure 2\nSeptember 23rd, 1948.\n\nMr. B. E. Amfield,\nIndian Superintendent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Amfield:\n\nWe herewith submit our report on the furnace at the Indian School, Kitselas, B. C., as follows:\n\n1. On being dismantled, this furnace was found to be badly burned out and beyond repair.\n2. There was found to be a shortage of cold air return to the furnace which tended to slow down the warm air circulation. This let the furnace get too hot that it could easily have set fire to the building and yet insufficient heat was getting into the school.\n3. The warm and cold air ducts were actually reversed from the correct method. The warm air was coming up along the side of the buildings with the windows and the cold air the opposite side. This procedure should be exactly the reverse for proper efficiency.\n\nWe strongly recommend to balance up the cold air and install one new warm air register, as the present set-up would, in all probability, burn out a new furnace the first winter, should the Department decide to install one.\n\nThe school teachers residence would appear to be in good shape. Trusting we may be of further service to you, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\nTHOM SHEET METAL LTD.\n\nE. Speers,\nManager.\n\nES/wb.\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Kitselas School furnace\n\nAttached please find bids from Thom Sheet Metal Ltd., for (a) new McClary \"Magnet\" wood furnace #4190B with needed changes to make the installation workable and safe (b) new McClary \"Magnet\" wood furnace #4190B using the present set-up of hot and cold air piping.\n\nPurchase and installation of bid (a) is strongly recommended for immediate installation as to put a new furnace in present set-up will only result in burning it out and possibly losing the School by fire.\n\nAs weather is getting colder it will be necessary to close the school unless an immediate installation is made.\n\nAs an alternative, should funds be unavailable, I could purchase a \"Norge\" Oil circulator for the school room at $115.00 installed and a smaller oil heater for the residence at $80.00. It should be noted that furnace wood, 12 cords, has been cut for the present winter's use.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent,\nSkeena River Agency.\n\nEncl.\nSept.25/48\n\nMr. F.E.

May I recommend that the school be given a grant of $100.00 per year to cover the following:\n\n(a) The provision of a set of simple manual training tools so that some half dozen boys might be taught carpentry by Mr. Wilson.\n\n(b) The purchase of suitable lumber for the construction of two work benches, cupboard for tools, and the later construction of display boards, tables, and bookcases etc. for the school.\n\nOne of the halls not now used by the children would make a very satisfactory if small manual training shop.\n\nThe sum of $50.00 should cover items (a) and (b) and I would suggest that the remaining $50.00 be used to\n\n(c) Pay an Indian woman, Mrs. Sam Kennedy, to instruct the girls in basket and mat weaving twice a week from October to April inclusive.\n\n(d) Purchase the material needed for making the baskets and mats suggested in the above paragraph (c).\n\nI understand that Mrs. Sam Kennedy is good in this type of work. She might well be given fifty cents for each lesson of an hour or so, or $1.00 per week while the work was being carried on. It has been found in other parts of the Province that two lessons a week, each of an hour or so, are better than one lesson taking the whole afternoon. The children can practise the work or continue it on the other afternoons. In any case the teacher must take charge at all times. The boys would of course be working at the suggested manual instruction while the girls were being instructed by Mrs. Kennedy.\nI have asked the teacher in any case to devote the mornings to the strictly academic work of the school, and the afternoons to all those subjects suggested by Mr. Hoey - singing, arts and crafts, sewing, vocational work and manual training, physical training and games etc. Health is now being taught and considerable success achieved in sewing.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIn the covering letter from Inspector Mackay dated June 13 he wrote as follows:\n\nI would call attention to his recommendation that an annual expenditure of \u00a3100.00 be made at this school, of which \u00a350.00 is to be used in the purchase of tools and lumber for manual training, and \u00a350.00 with which to engage an Indian instructress for Indian arts and purchase of necessary material.\n\nI would recommend approval of these expenditures for the current fiscal year.\n\n(Sgd.) D.M.

Mr. Puce's letter is dated 4th inst.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that there is at present no school open at Kittadamicks nor is there a likelihood of one being required there for some time as the Indians living there are persistent pagans and if the grant for Kittadamicks can be made available I would suggest that it might with advantage be transferred to Kittewanagah.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nFor\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nExtract.\n\nGitwingak Babine Agency.\nSkena River\nB.

Price.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter dated 3rd instant having reference to your request that a grant be made for the Indian Day School at Kitwanga. I beg to state that a grant for this school has been requisitioned for several years back, but owing to the fact that the Department has not received any returns therefrom for several years it may be surmised that the Department was not aware that the school was regularly open it having no evidence to show that such was the case. There was no grant for this school for the current fiscal year, the reason for which may be attributed to the cause above given.\n\nThe name of the school is on the Estimates for the coming year and if you continue to send in satisfactory quarterly Returns regularly you may ultimately obtain the usual grant provided for both schools.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Revd Alfred T.

If this is the same school as that for which you apply under a different name you will be entitled to the grant upon the receipt by the Department of properly certified quarterly returns of attendance, which are to be forwarded through the Indian Office at Victoria.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Price.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith the Teacher's Return, on the Kitwanga Indian Day School, for the Quarter ended with the 31st ultimo.\n\nI here beg leave to draw your attention to the Teacher's annotations in the Return's Remarks Column:- \"Parents dismissed from the village,\" applies to an Indian named Stephen Morgan, a notorious agitator, who by staying at Kitwanga, - where centrally located - he made himself offensive in meddling with affairs, against the wishes of the people of that village, and allying himself with some malcontents of the Indians of Kitwankool.\n\n(Go-Hach)\nHence, the said Stephen Morgan was ordered by me to betake himself to Kitsegukla the village and reserve whereupon he belongs; and here may add that since then, and with admonitions properly applied, peace has been prevailing along the Skeena.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6399, File 824-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 10, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn your last report on the Kitwanga school you state that \"There is only a Government grant and when that is expended they close the school. More salary should be given to secure a competent teacher.\"\n\nAccording to returns received from this school it was open during the past fiscal year 215 days. In view of this Department would like some explanation of your remarks, which would appear to indicate that the returns are not accurate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Lorins, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nPrince Rupert\nJuly 14th\n\nTo the Secretary of\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs it takes some time to get a letter up the Skeena River and back, I am enclosing a copy of my letter to Mr. Loring, Indian Agent, Hazelton. I am anxious to know soon when I can offer a teacher for Gitwangak.\n\nYours faithfully,\nF.H. Dunham\nBishop of Caledonia\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nJuly 14, 1911.\n\nR.E. Loring Esq.\nIndian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is a matter that I wish to bring before the Indian Department at Ottawa. It is regarding the Day School at Gitwangak.\n\nAs you may have heard Rev. A.E. Price is leaving our Gitwangak Mission next September for a year in England and may not return to this station.\n\nIt is, therefore, necessary for me to make as soon as possible some arrangement for a teacher. I wish to secure a competent white teacher but the Day School Grant is only $400, while most of the other schools receive $500. I wish to point out to the Department:\n\n1. The Department has for years been using our school building without paying us a cent of rent.\n\n2. The expense of bringing a qualified teacher from Vancouver to Gitwangak is about $50, according to the state of the Skeena river. The Department has never to my knowledge paid this.\n\n3. Without a married missionary resident at Gitwangak no white woman teacher could live alone in the Indian village as there are no other white people with whom to live. We must, therefore, have a white male teacher this winter.\n\n4. A white male teacher cannot be obtained for $400 a year. We could not live on this.\n\nUnder all these circumstances I feel fully justified in asking for at least the standard salary of $500, and I think to cover the\nthe travelling expenses, as well as the upkeep of the building and such like demands upon our Funds the Department should allow us a rental for our school-house.\n\nI should like to know soon whether I can count upon this increased Grant so that I may have time to secure a well qualified teacher by September. I can assure the Department that it is most difficult to secure proper teachers and the Church has in most cases to add greatly to what the Government allows in the way of salary.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) F. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\n\n392207\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 10th ultimo, headed \"Rev. Sir,\" informing me that in my last report on the Kitwanga school I stated that \"There is only a Government grant, and when that is expended they close the school. More salary should be given to secure a competent teacher,\" and that according to returns received from this school it were open during the fiscal year 215 days, and that in view of this the Department would like some explanation of my remarks, which would appear to indicate that the returns were not accurate.\n\nIn reply to the aforementioned, I fail to conform the passage as quoted with any remarks that I should ever have had occasion to make on the subject. For the returns that have passed through my hands, I can vouch for as having been correct.\n\nIt would occur to me that the letter referred to was intended for Mr. Inspector Green.\n\nIn reference with this school's closing, I have no other explanation to offer than that it is diligently being kept open till such time when the children leave the village with their parents on their various avocations.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ultimo of the 5th instant, and in reply I beg to say that official letter of June 10th, last, should have been addressed to the Rev. A. E. Green and not to yourself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOttawa, August 2, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn your last report on the Kitwanga school you state that \"There is only a Government grant and when that is expended they close the school. More salary should be given to secure a competent teacher.\"\n\nAccording to returns received from this school it was open during the past fiscal year 215 days.

Green,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n1076 Fender St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, August 2, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 14th ultimo in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Kitwanga school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that for a competent teacher who will take a thorough interest in the work the Department will pay a salary of $500.00 per annum.\n\nWith regard to the building I may state that the question of the erection of a new building next summer for school purposes will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter 184711/1, dated August 2nd., referring to my last report on the Kitwangah School, in which I remarked that \"there is only a government grant and when that is expended they close the school. More salary should be given to secure a competent teacher\".\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when I questioned the Rev. A.B. Price, the Missionary in charge, as to why a new teacher secured in the fall invariably left the following spring, he replied that the small grant was the chief reason. The Church does not assist with any grant, and as he has to pay traveling expenses of teacher from Vancouver to Kitwangah, and then forty dollars a month salary, he could not keep one longer. But to fill up the school days his son (a young boy), and other unqualified persons, taught when they were unable to pay a teacher. The last teacher was but poorly qualified for the work, but he said it was the best he could do with the present grant. I told him I was not satisfied with the way the school was being conducted.\n\nMr. Price informed me that he would be leaving the place in September (next month) and so, some one else would look for a teacher for the fall of 1911. I think that, with a new Missionary in charge, the school will have a better chance.\n\nI think it would be an improvement if the Missionaries or Church authorities were required to notify the Department, when they dismiss or change teachers in any of the schools receiving Government grants.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has just received the quarterly returns from the Kitwanga School. These returns show that the school is being taught by Mr. Albert Sinclair under the direction of Dr. Vernon Ardagh. His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia was informed in August last, that the Department would allow a salary of $500.00 for a competent teacher at this school. Evidently Mr. Sinclair has undertaken this work, but the Department has not been informed in any way as to his qualifications, in fact this is the first intimation it has had that he is engaged in the work. Payment of the first quarter's salary is being made at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nI have to ask you to advise as soon as possible as to what qualifications are held by Mr. Sinclair in order that the Department may decide whether the grant at this rate may be continued or not. I may say that you should have advised the Department of the fact that this man was in charge of the school as soon as he commenced the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. F. Lorina, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 16th ultimo, stating that the Department had just received the quarterly return from the Kitwanga school, and that the same showed that that school was being taught by Mr. Alfred Sinclair, under the direction of Dr. Vernon Ardagh. That $500.00 had been allowed for a competent teacher of this school, and that the Department had no intimation of his qualifications, &c.\n\nThereupon, am asked to advise as soon as possible as to what qualifications are held by Mr. Sinclair in order that the Department may decide whether the grant at that rate may be continued or not; also is it remarked that I should have advised the Department of the fact that this man was in charge of the school as soon as he commenced the work.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Sinclair's qualifications, they are not what they should be. I was advised that he were to be under the supervision of Dr. Ardagh for a short time, whilst the latter was busy making habitable his abode for his family upon his arrival, and a proper teacher were to arrive in a few weeks or so.\n\nBy a letter of Revd. A.B. Price, the former principal of this school, becoming miscarried, the then prospective teacher did not arrive till about several weeks later. That teacher, Miss F. B. Kemp has been at work there since about the beginning of the present quarter. She is fully qualified, and a most efficient teacher, and left the Kispiax school to take over this school.\n\nAnd Miss Kemp's school, at Kispiax, was taken over by Revd. Robert W. Lee, fully qualified, and also the resident Missionary there.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nExtract from Inspector A.F. Green's report on the Kitwanga Indian School. Dated March 26, 1913. Original on file\n\nFlorence B. Kemp, age 44 yrs. Spinster Salary $500.00 per year. Trained at Missionary College, Liverpool, England. An excellent teacher, doing good work. She has taught in the Babine Agency for some seven years, with satisfactory results. Miss Kemp has taught the girls cooking sewing, etc.\n\nShe asks for an increase of salary, stating that when she has paid for her room and board, she has but little left. I would respectfully recommend an increase of one hundred dollars per year.\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that, in view of the very favourable report made by Mr. Inspector Green on the services of Miss Florence B. Kemp, teacher of the Kitwanga School, the Department has decided to increase her salary from $500.00 to $550.00 from the first of the current quarter and you may make your requisition accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Lorins, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nHence this my application for the above increase of salary, in return for my nursing services when required.\n\nI remain yours faithfully,\n\nFlorence B. Kemp\n\nThe Mission House\nGitwangak\nB.C.\nDecember 1-14\n\nDear Mr. Loring,\n\nIf you can see your way to consider, I recommend to the Indian Dept., an application from me for an increase of salary\u2014say $50 p.a.\n\nI should feel very grateful.\nThis is now my eight year of teaching Indian Schools in this district.\n\nAnd my average attendance of school children has been on the increase - there are now 46 pupils on the register.\n\nBesides the school work, the Doctor here (Dr Ardagh) often needs my assistance in medical, surgical work occurring among the Indians.\n\nSo that I am now looked upon as nurse deaconess in the village.\n\nNaturally after the years spent among the Indians I am well acquainted with them, am well received by them, I am able to help, I assure them in many ways.\nDear Mr. Brown,\n\nI should feel very much obliged & grateful if you could in any way further my work here among the Indians by taking into consideration the need, so a doctor I often feel in my medical & Surgical work, if some one whom I can rely on, to help me in anaesthetic & operative cases when myself have died & away from the near help of any other Doctor I have to do the best I can. To this end, with a view to finding a place where I may be of service to the One whom I love & who is also in sympathy with the religion.\n\nKitwanga,\nB.C.\nNov 25th 1914\nwork amongst the Indians. I have come to the conclusion that there is a way to meet this need by using one person at the Indian School (Mr. Kemp) who has been working there for many years. This individual would be able to help the Indians who are now being connected with the medical work here. Although not a \"fully qualified\" nurse, I have found him to be a very capable worker for the task.\n\nMay I suggest that a small stipend allowance be given to Mr. Kemp so that he may continue his work? The Indians will benefit greatly from his services.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.S.C.R.C.

Mr. Loring encloses a letter from Dr. Ardagh, medical officer, recommending that her salary be increased, as he claims that she is of great assistance to him in his work on the reserve. She asks for an increase of $50.00 and I think the Department would be quite justified in giving it to her after the first of the New Year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, December 28, 1914.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing an application from Miss Florence B.

H. Cairns had remarked that the attendance at the Kitwanga, Kispiox, Kitselas and Hazelton Bay Schools had been very unsatisfactory, and that the Department trusted that I would do everything possible to increase the attendance at those schools.\n\nIn regard to the foregoing, I here beg to mention that the Inspector visited those schools on or about the 13th of October, last, and that for reasons of an unusually prolonged fall, many of the children were with their parents assisting in picking berries and late in coming in, and am somewhat surprised that the respective teachers did not furnish a context to that complaint.\n\nOtherwise, it affords me great satisfaction to state that the attendances in the several schools mentioned, have properly picked up; and that also the pupils' parents are taking a laudable interest in having them comply with an intent to that respect.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 6, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the unsatisfactory attendance at the Kitwanga, Kispiox, Kitselas and Hazelton Day Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your explanation in regard to this matter is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

When this reaches me, I will notify you.\n\nIn the meantime I have received an application for this position from J.R.A.Gell (late Capt.-Adjt. C.E.F.) which is strongly endorsed by Archbishop F.H.du Vernet.\n\nCopies of this application and the Archbishop's recommendation are enclosed herewith, for your information.\n\nAlthough I do not know Mr. Gell personally, I conclude from the Archbishop's recommendation that he is a man most suitable for Kitwanga. I feel sure that a married man residing on the Reserve and living amongst the Indians will do much for their welfare, and that it will help to elevate them morally and in every other respect.\n\nAdded to this is the fact that Mr. Gell is well educated, of sensible age, used to the control of men of all kinds, is obviously versatile, and used to varying conditions of life. His wife, also, being well educated and capable would be of immense use, and I feel sure that two such people would exert a good influence and do much good amongst the Indians in general.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA:\nOnt.\n\nEncs. 2\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is a returned soldier who suffered in the war, the son of an Imperial General. He has been many years in this country and is good at farming, carpentering, etc., but the war has left him weaker and so he is not able for hard manual work. He is 46. His wife is a well educated Irish woman, very anxious to do missionary work among the Indians. They have two children 13 and 11.\n\nIf the Indian Department appoints him I am willing to give them the free use of our Kitwanga Mission House adjoining the School House in return for the good influence which I hope they will exert upon the Indians. At least, I offer this for one year to try them.\n\nI understand that Mrs. Gell is a very capable woman and she might possibly act as field matron in the Kitwanga village.

R. A. Gell, as well as a copy of the Archbishop of Caledonia's recommendation as to his appointment.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the resignation of Miss Kemp is accepted, and the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Gell. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $600 per annum, the same as was paid Miss Kemp. He will also be entitled to receive the bonus during the present fiscal year at the rate of $150 per annum.\n\nI will be pleased if you will inform Mr. Gell of his appointment, and arrange with him to take up duties as soon as possible, and you should inform the Department later as to the date on which he takes charge of the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. Hyde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nKITWANGA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n184711-1. Sept. 19th 1921.\n\nAdverting to my letter dated September 10th 1921 and to yours of above mentioned date regarding the payment of salary for the two holiday months, viz: July and August 1921, to Miss Kemp, formerly teacher at the Kitwanga Indian Day School, I submit for your further consideration the following facts regarding Miss Kemp from which you will understand my reason for again bringing this matter before you.\n\nTwo other resignations of Teachers have occurred during this year in this Agency, and in each case resignation was made at the end of September 1921, and, in only one case was notification sent to me at the close of the School Year 1920-21, and no such consideration was shown for the work of the Department as in the case of Miss Kemp and her resignation.\n\nMiss Kemp informed me, during my visit to Kitwanga in June that she intended resigning her position at the end of the School year, but I received no formal written notice from her until I requested her to do so in a letter dated August 15th. Subsequently, Mr Inspector Cairns informed me that Miss Kemp had told him of her intention to resign at the end of the year, in order to allow the Department time to appoint another teacher at the commencement of the new term, and year, in September. Mr Cairns told me that Miss Kemp had been in the employ of the Department as teacher for over 10 years and had done very good work assisting the women in cases of sickness where a woman's attention is imperative. In her resignation Miss Kemp expressed her willingness to continue to do what she could in cases of sickness amongst the women and in assisting in the dispensing of medicines to her old pupils.\n\nAlthough Miss Kemp did not actually teach school during the months of July and August, she is, in my opinion, entitled to payment for these two months equally as much as the other teachers of the Indian Day Schools in this Agency who received their full quarters salary for the quarter ending September 1921.\n\nIt appears to me poor consolation for such a devoted servant to the Department that \"virtue should be its own reward\" as Miss Kemp is undoubtedly, in this case, a victim of her own continued...\nSir,\u2014 continued.\n\nKITWANGA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n184711-1.Sept: 19th 1921.\n\nher own conscientiousness.\n\nI have therefore respectfully request the Department to exercise its authority as contained in the Regulations regarding Indian day schools, and under the above extenuating circumstances to grant Miss Kemp that portion of her salary for the months of July and August 1921 as paid to all the other teachers in this Agency.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept: of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa. Ont.:\nOttawa, November 29, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, recommending that salary be allowed Miss Kemp, former teacher of the Kitwanga Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the school year ends on June 30th, and she was paid in full to that date. If she had taught during the month of September she would only have been entitled to payment for the number of days she actually taught during the month.\n\nThe Department has adopted the method of paying teachers who are in continuous service the full quarter's salary for September, but, in reality, they are not legally entitled to this amount. Each school year begins on September 1st and ends the following June 30th. Summer holidays are not taken into account in the payment of teachers salaries. In some cases the teachers have delayed forwarding their resignations until after they have been paid their full quarterly salary and, by so doing, they have been paid more than the amount which they earned.\n\nHowever, in view of Miss Kemp's long service and owing to the fact that during the past summer she did a certain amount of work on the reserve, the Department has decided to allow her the full quarter's salary, a cheque for which amount is being forwarded to you under separate cover. She will also be allowed bonus for the month of September, the same as allowed the teachers in other Indian day schools.\n\nThe action taken in allowing payment in this instance is not to form a precedent for future cases of a similar nature.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nE. Hyde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton,\nB.

Kinley, as teacher to the Kitwanga Indian Day School.\n\nI have communicated the information to Mrs. Ashmore, and I have received the enclosed letter, which I have just received from her, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIn my letter to the Department of November 12th, I gave Mrs. Ashmore's qualifications, but later I find she holds the highest teacher's certificate in B.C., the Academic. I might say it is very difficult to get teachers in these out-of-the-way places, especially those holding certificates.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter further consideration,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nEnc. (1).\nKilwanga, Dec. 5, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Hyde,\n\nI have just received your communication about my salary, and I have no words to express my amazement. Surely there must be some mistake. To offer me the same salary that was paid to a man with no qualifications whatever, and who most undeniably could not teach is surely a most extraordinary thing. Cannot something be done about it? In Mission had $180, and in Doreen $108. I am undertaking\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., by Mr. Samuel Kinley, who resigned as teacher of the Kitwanga Indian Day School at the end of October, last. In this connection I beg to say that a cheque for the amount due him for his services will be sent to the address given by you.\n\nThe Department notes that you have obtained the services of Mrs. Mary Ashmore to succeed Mr. Kinley and that her appointment was recommended by the Church authorities. The qualifications which she possesses are also noted, and the Department will approve of her appointment. It is hoped that she will meet with every success in the work. The salary allowed her will be at the same rate as was paid Mr. Kinley, viz., $80 per teaching month. I shall be pleased if you will give Mrs. Ashmore every assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Hyde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nRe: Teacher, Kitwanga Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 26th ult., having reference to Kitwanga Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Kinley's School Return for the month of October last, his address in the Anglican Theological College, Point Grey, Vancouver, B.C.,\n\nI am pleased to inform you that I have secured the services of a qualified person, in the name of Mrs. Mary Ashmore, who is recommended by Archdeacon Rix, of Prince Rupert and the Rev. Mr. Proctor, of Hazelton.\n\nMrs. Mary Ashmore was educated at the Victoria College, Belfast; and graduated M.A. from the Royal University of Ireland. She has been teaching both in the Public and High Schools of this Province. She has knowledge of the Indians who live on Kuper Island. Her strong subject is French and she is well up in other subjects. She has been in this country some 18 years, her husband was killed in France in 1917.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending Mrs. Ashmore for the position. I am sure she improve the situation at Kitwanga and the pupils should show better signs of progress, in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, October 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department of the resignation of Mr. Samuel Kinley as teacher of the Kitwanga Indian Day School to take effect at the end of the present month. In this connection it is noted that you are endeavouring to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed him. If you are unable to obtain the services of a suitable teacher, you should take the matter up with Mr. Inspector Cairns, as he might be able to nominate a teacher having the necessary qualifications. The salary allowed will depend upon the qualifications which the teacher obtained possesses. Please endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher for this school at the earliest possible date, and furnish the Department with full information as to the name, qualifications, etc.\n\nMr. Kinley should prepare a return before leaving showing the attendance and days taught by him, and the same should be forwarded to the Department through your office, in order that payment of any salary due him for his services can be made. The address to which his cheque should be sent should be stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Hyde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOctober 15th 1927\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have received the resignation of Mr. Samuel Kinley, teacher at the Kitwanga Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of October 1927.\n\nI am looking out for a suitable person to fill the position, one with experience, and should I be successful will notify you at once.

The hospital at Hazelton is, without doubt, an agency which makes for better living conditions and sanitation on contiguous Indian reserves. For this reason I am somewhat doubtful concerning the need of a field matron for each or both of the Hazelton and Kitwanga Indian communities.\n\nRussell V. Harris\nMr. Samuel Kinley - No teacher's certificate. No training nor aptitude as a teacher.\n\nMr. Kinley and his wife take a great interest in the welfare of all the people of this village. They are very kind and sympathetic, liked and respected by all who are brought into contact with them.\n\nTwo girls are reading from the Third Reader. They read fairly well and spell correctly. There are four pupils in the second reader. Their knowledge of English though is very limited. All the pupils of the first reader were struggling with word recognition.\n\nOn the whole this school cannot be considered efficient.\nKITWANGA DAY SCHOOL.\n\nMr. Kinley is doing well at this C. of E. cause. His wife is a qualified nurse and is doing good work among the children.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIf you will observe from my Monthly Report for September that I had to put Miss Kemp, Field Matron at Kitwanga, temporary in charge of the Indian Day School at that point.\nOttawa, October 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia, nominating Mr. Irwin Bell as teacher of the Kitwanga Indian Day School. It is presumed that Mrs. Ashmore has resigned, although the Department had not previously received any information to that effect.\n\nPrevious to the appointment of Mrs. Ashmore, salary was allowed the teacher of this school at the rate of $80 per month but, owing to the fact that Mrs. Ashmore was so well qualified, being the possessor of the highest teacher's certificate in British Columbia - the Academic - a salary of $100 a month was allowed in her case.\n\nPlease let me know definitely the academic and professional qualifications which Mr. Bell possesses, as well as his experience, in order that the Department can decide what salary is to be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 18th instant, with reference to a teacher for the Kitwanga Indian Day School. The Department was not previously aware that Mrs. Ashmore had resigned.\n\nIn view of your nomination of Mr. Irwin Bell as teacher, Mr. Agent Mortimer is being advised that his appointment is approved. In connection with the salary at this school, I might point out that previous to Mrs. Ashmore's engagement salary was allowed at the rate of $50 per month, but, owing to the fact that Mrs. Ashmore was so well qualified, being the possessor of the highest teacher's certificate in British Columbia - the Academic - a salary of $100 a month was allowed in her case.\n\nI am requesting Mr. Mortimer to advise the Department definitely regarding Mr. Bell's academic and professional qualifications, as well as his experience.

At the time the Department approved of your appointment it was not aware as to the qualifications which you possessed. A communication has, however, been received from Mr. Agent Hyde, Hazelton, in further reference to your qualifications. In view of same, the Department will allow you salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month from the date you began duties.

Hyde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby the teacher of the Indian School at Nelson, left the end of October to enter college to prepare for the ministry. He had been here for six years giving satisfaction as far as his ability went. He received the small salary of $500 per month, which was augmented by the church at the rate of $300 per year plus a house in which to live. This was granted in return for services rendered to the church. On his leaving he was informed by the Indian Agent that the Indian Department regarded certificated teachers for all schools as far as possible. I immediately proceeded to obtain the application for a teacher in the form of an Indemnity Act. He was recommended to me by inspectors from the school. No question was asked as to salary believing that the Indian Department would pay the sum in the Provincial Government, who don't pay less than $100 per month. Mr. Johnson was informed me that she has been notified that her salary will be only $800 per month for ten months, until no house.\nwho is at present living in our mission house, which has nothing to do with the school. Under the salary is nothing & I wish she could be taught that she has been brought up & educated at least that she should have an educated teacher who instructs & learns, and I am quite sure that an educated teacher who is any good at all can be obtained for $100 per teaching month.\n\nI trust that you will look into this matter and see that justice and fair dealing is meted out.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Duncan Scott,\nMinister of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am taking the liberty of appealing to you with regard to my salary as teacher of the Indian Day School here.\n\nOn Oct. 31, on Inspector Fraser's recommendation I was appointed teacher of the Indian Day School here by Mr. Proctor. This appointment was subsequently confirmed by the Indian agent, Mr. Hyde of Hazelton. In reply to an enquiry from Mr. Hyde, I told him that I had the highest P.C. teaching certificate\u2014the Academic\u2014and I understood from his letter and from a conversation with Mr. Proctor, that the salary would be in accordance with my standing as a teacher.\n\nYesterday, to my inexpressible\nI received a communication from Mr. Hyde, stating that my salary would be $80 a month, the same as that paid to my predecessor, a man who had no qualifications whatever, who didn't know how to teach, and who consequently left the school in a despicable condition, both as to work and discipline.\n\nI have undertaken a very difficult task; may I hope that you will see that I am paid a salary commensurate with my ability and my experience. The lowest tyro in B.C. in the provincial schools would not be offered $80 a month. It is less than half what I formerly had.\n\nI beg to enclose a testimonial from the mission school trustees, and my latest inspectors' reports.\n\nHoping you will see justice done in this matter, I am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Own) Harry Ashmore.\nTESTIMONIAL FROM THE MISSION BOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES\n\nThis is to certify that Mrs. Mary Ashmore, M.A., has taught in the Mission High School for the last six years, during which time she has proved herself to be a most hard-working and conscientious teacher. Her strong subject is French, at which she is second to none, though by no means behind in her other subjects. During her sojourn with us she has made many friends who, one and all, regret that she has decided to make a change.\n\nThe Board take great pleasure in recommending Mrs. Ashmore to any Board requiring the services of a highly qualified teacher, especially one having her attainments in the subject of French.\n\nJune 1924 (Signed) \"Ed Hicklin\" Chairman\n\"A.

Oct. 1927\n\nCharacter of Teaching: Satisfactory.\n\nSchool management and control: Good.\n\nGrading and standing of pupils: Good, except Grade IV which seemed to be somewhat neglected.\n\nRemarks: Mrs Ashmore is more at home with the advanced classes than she is with the smaller children; however I found her following approved methods in Grade II. In a school like this a great deal of individual work should be done, which may easily be checked.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter, 151-16-1, dated October 25th, 1930, I respectfully beg to state that I had no knowledge as to the transfer of Mr Ashmore until I visited Kitwanga and found no teacher at the Indian Day School.\n\nI at once installed Miss Kemp, Field Matron, as temporary teacher until such time as the Anglican Mission, with the Department's approval, appointed a suitable teacher.\n\nWhen the Rev. Bishop Rix visited the office he informed me that he had appointed a young man named Mr Irwin Bell, a resident of Hazelton, as teacher at Kitwanga.\n\nMr Bell has no academic qualifications except four years in the Vancouver High School, a six months' course in the Sprott-Shaw School of Commerce and two years business training with the Hudson's Bay Company at Hazelton. Apparently Mr Bell is following up his studies with a view of entering Normal School to qualify as a School Teacher.\n\nSince Mr Bell took over Kitwanga School I have visited same and am satisfied that in course of time he will make a good teacher.\n\nAs F.

Scott,\nIndian Department,\nOTTAWA, QUE.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI write to bring a few matters to your notice.\n\n1. Re: School Teachers.\n\n(a) The young man who has been teaching at Citwangan will be leaving there at the end of May. This was the arrangement with him last fall. In his place will be the Rev. Henry Flores, who has for some time been doing excellent work as a teacher at Aiyansh. Your agent, Capt. Mortimer at Nelson, knows of this plan and suggested that I write to your department about it.\n\n(b) The Rev. S. Kinley, who at one time was teacher at Citwangan, and who has just completed three years of training at the University of British Columbia, at Vancouver, will be taking over the school at Aiyansh, where Mr. Flores has been carrying on.\n\nBoth these men are excellent men, and will merit the most generous treatment the department will find possible. They will both be on their respective fields at the last of June, and cheques for them could be sent to:\n\nRev. Henry Flores - Citwangan, B.C.\nRev. Samuel Kinley - Aiyansh, B.C.\n\nThe young man who is now teaching at Citwangan will continue to do so until the end of May and should, as you will know, be paid up to that time. I am glad to have been able to suggest to you such excellent appointments for these two schools.\n(c) May I remind you of the $200.00 promised the Diocese for the material from the old mission house at Kitkatla. It has not come to hand yet, and may have been forgotten among the many things crowding your department. We would be glad to have a cheque drawn in favour of the Diocese for this amount.\n\n(d) Some long time ago, your agent at Massett recommended the purchase by the department of our mission house at Massett for a house for the teachers, at the cost of $1000.00. Upon a visit there a few months ago, I suggested that the land reaching halfway between the house and the Church would probably be appreciated by the department and that for the house and the land a fair price would be $1200.00. Your agent said he would write you about this matter, and so you have probably heard of it. We would be glad to have the matter settled, at an early date. For some time the teachers have been using this house, and so far as I know, no rental has been paid for it. If the purchase is arranged for the $1200.00, the matter of the rent can be forgotten, but if otherwise, you will agree with me that rent should be paid. I understand the mission house has proved quite satisfactory, as to the teachers as a residence.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.A. RIX.\n\nR.S. Since calling upon you in Ottawa, I have had the experience of being knocked down by a motor car, and after four months am only now beginning to get around.\n\nG.A. RIX.\nOttawa, April 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed by His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia that Mr. Irwin Bell, teacher of the Kitwanga Indian Day School, intends giving up duties at the end of May, next. His Lordship has nominated Rev. Henry Flores, who has been teaching at the Gitladamix Indian Day School, to succeed Mr. Bell at Kitwanga. Mr. Flores will take up duties about June 1st, next, and salary will be allowed him at the rate of $85 a teaching month. The Department trusts that you will give him every possible assistance.\n\nYou should arrange with Mr. Bell to prepare and forward, at the end of May, a return for the months of April and May. When forwarding this return, you should give the address to which Mr. Bell's salary cheque should be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C.

Henry Flores from the Gitladamix Indian Day School (Aiyanah) to the Kitwanga Indian Day School is approved. The appointment of Rev. S. Kinley as teacher at Gitladamix to succeed Rev. Henry Flores is also approved.\n\nIt is noted that these gentlemen will take charge of the respective schools on June 1st, next, and the salary allowed each of them will be at the rate of $65 a teaching month. Mr. Agent Mortimer and Mr. Agent Collison are being informed regarding the above arrangements.\n\nYou will be advised under separate cover regarding the payment for the old mission house at Kitkatla and in connection with the suggested purchase of your mission house at Massett.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In fact I wanted to say glad if you will.

You should see that he prepares and forwards the usual return, showing attendance, days' taught, etc., in order that the salary due him can be paid.\n\nIt is understood that Henry Flores, whom you were informed by official letter of April 10th, last, has been appointed to succeed Mr. Bell, and will begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. G. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, DATED MAY 22, 1933, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KITWANGA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe school is very far from being a success. The room is a little less untidy and dusty than when I inspected this school in October, 1931. I am certainly far from satisfied with conditions here.\n\nAs far as school work is to be considered, there would not appear to me to be much use carrying on this school. No suggestions that I could make would help much, as the teacher is not adapted to this sort of work. The children find it very hard to understand his way of speaking, which is mainly due to a peculiar French accent. I doubt that this man has any general command of the English language. The school leaves much to be desired in the way of cleanliness. No one could possibly be interested in the school as conducted at present; though I think the teacher is doing his best to make things a little better.\n\nThe attendance is so very poor in this school that I should like to suggest to the Department the consideration of closing the school as a matter of economy. It will never be a success with this teacher, who is the local Missionary. With a trained teacher the school might be worked up during several years till it was of some use to the people. At present the parents are not very interested in the school. I am quite in sympathy with the Indians, as I can see no reason why any child should want to attend such a dismal place. The teacher is not trained for this sort of work.\n\nThe school is not in a satisfactory condition. As I have recommended above that the Department consider closing this school, I would ask that a check be kept on the reports of attendance during the school year starting in September, 1933. I would ask that the Indian Agent be asked for a report on this school early in 1934, as I shall not be able to visit there this year if I am to inspect schools not visited this last year. Should the Indian Agent's report be as poor as this present one, I should recommend the closing of the school to save the salary being paid to the missionary now, as well as the other expenses of the school.\n\nNOTE: Returns for the last three quarters show the following:\nDecember, 1932 - Enrolment 23, Average 15,\nMarch, 1933 - Enrolment 25, Average 9,\nJune, 1933 - Enrolment 23, Average 6.\nOttawa, September 14, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nIn a report regarding his recent visit to the Kitwanga Indian Day School, the Inspector of Indian Schools writes in part as follows:\u2014\n\n\"As far as school work is to be considered, there would not appear to me to be much use carrying on this school. No suggestions that I could make would help much, as the teacher is not adapted to this sort of work.

It is considered that a trained teacher should be secured to begin duties from January first, next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

C.\nOttawa, September 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of official letter of today's date, which is being forwarded to His Lordship Bishop Rix, with regard to the teacher at the Kitwanga Indian Day School.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\n\"Bishop's Lodge\"\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOct. 13, 1935\n\nA.F. McKenzie, Esq.,\nSecy., Dept. Indian Affairs,\nIndian Day Schools,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept. 14th, 1932 re Inspector's Report on Indian Day School at Kitwanga.\n\nI can only first of all say that the report was an extreme surprise to me. Will you allow me to reply to some of the criticisms of the Inspector?\n\nThere is no teacher with such experience in teaching native children in this and other countries as Mr. Flores has had. He has been the principal of a native school in Arabia with 300 pupils and won the commendation of all in authority. He is a more than ordinarily cultured man, not only speaking French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and English, but is able to, and has taught at times all these languages.\n\nThe statement that it is useless to carry on the school under Mr. Flores is completely unsound. I spent half a day in the school yesterday and listened to the exercises of the children, and having been at one time a teacher myself, I am in a position to form something of an accurate opinion of the work done, and can unreservedly say that the work was above the average. I noticed in particular that certain pupils, who up until now have been in residence in an Edmonton boarding school for natives, but are at present in this school, did not make as good a showing as the pupils who have never been in any other school except the Kitwanga school.\n\nMr. Barry unfortunately visits a number of the Indian schools at a time when many of the families are off the reservations, either fishing or trapping, or hunting. It so happened when he last visited Kitwanga, many of the families were away. Had he visited this school a month earlier, he would have found a full school.\n\nYesterday, when again several families were away, there were yet 18 pupils in the school. There are 26 on the school roll. When the inspector was here there were only four at school, and these were nearly every child then in the village.\nHe had practically no opportunity of judging the work accomplished, nor did he inquire into the methods.\n\nWherever I visit Indian reservations, if there is any complaint about teachers, the Indians at once let me hear all about their complaints. Such complaints have never been made by the parents of Kitwanga. Before this, there is not a reservation in this diocese with which I have anything to do, where there is such harmony on the part of all as there is here, this was not the case before Mr. Flores took charge.\n\nWhile I know the department expects the teacher paid by it to be efficient as a teacher, I still believe the department would be pleased to know that he was also a good moral and religious influence in the community. Mr. Flores is eminently that.\n\nSomething can be done with paint to make the school look brighter; this we are quite willing to do. As for the lack of cleanliness to which Mr. Barry refers, I can only say that I am assured that the school has always been swept out twice a day and sometimes oftener. That is a matter however which can be easily righted.\n\nAs to Mr. Flores' French accent, I can only say that he is not French, but he has an accent. I heard him give an address to the natives this other night, and I am sure he was clearly understood by everyone who understood English at all, and in listening to him teaching yesterday, there was not the slightest difficulty along that line.\n\nMr. Barry himself has his limitations. His brusque manner has been complained of to me by several teachers, the children being worried by it and not able to show their best work. I am also convinced that he is unfairly prejudiced against Mr. Flores, whom I consider one of our finest and most efficient men.\n\nI would like you to write to the very efficient and level-headed Indian agent at Hazelton, asking his opinion about school matters in Kitwanga. He is interested in Mr. Flores and is ready to help him in every possible way he can.\n\nI consider it would be a real misfortune if any change were made in the Indian day school at Kitwanga.\n\nTrusting that you will give weight to the opinion of one who has for many years had a vital interest in the natives of Northern B.C., both as to their material, moral and spiritual welfare, and who would hesitate to recommend anything which would not be a real help in such things.\n\nAwaiting a favorable reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, October 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to official letter dated September 14th, last, enclosing copy of a communication forwarded to His Lordship Bishop Rix, with regard to the services of Mr. Flores, teacher of the Kitwanga Indian Day School. In replying, His Lordship states that the report of Inspector Barry is an extreme surprise to him.\n\nI have to request that you will give your opinion regarding the services being performed by Mr. Flores and his success in the work. His Lordship states that he would consider it a real misfortune if any change were made in the teaching service at this school. Please comment on the report of Mr. Inspector Barry, an extract from which was included in our communication to the Bishop of Caledonia and a copy of the letter sent you under cover of the communication above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa, October 24, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 13th instant, regarding the report of Mr. Inspector Barry on his inspection of the Kitwanga Indian Day School. In this connection I have to say that, as suggested by Your Lordship, the Department is referring this matter to Mr. G. C. Mortimer, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B. C., for his report.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nOttawa, November 16th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to refer further to your 15/30895 of September 5th, last, enclosing Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Kitwanga Indian Day School on May 22nd, last. Following receipt of your letter, the Department communicated with His Lordship Bishop Rix and, also, with Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer.\n\nThe replies received indicate that they do not agree with the conclusions reached by Mr. Barry. Both of them consider that Reverend Mr. Flores is doing good work. It appears that, at the time Mr. Barry visited the school, the attendance was small owing to the fact that a number of the families were away fishing or hunting. When all the families are at home, the attendance is reported to be very satisfactory.\n\nThe Department has decided not to take any action at the present time with reference to dispensing with the services of Mr. Flores.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir,\n\nre - Kitwanga Indian Day School,\nRev. Henry Flores, Teacher.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 24th regarding the report of School Inspector Barry with reference to the Rev. Henry Flores, Indian Day School Teacher at Kitwanga.\n\nAfter careful perusal of Inspector Barry's report on this school, may I be permitted to say that, in all fairness to Mr. Flores, conditions were very unfavourable on the day of inspection. Only four very young pupils were then in attendance; the majority having gone with their parents to the coast canneries. Naturally the teacher was greatly embarrassed and the four little children were nervous at the prospect of a school examination which resulted in the examination being a partial failure. Therefore Inspector Barry was unable to see if any progress had been made since his previous visit on October 19th, 1931.\n\nWhen Mr. Flores took over this school no doubt the children found that his English was difficult to understand, the cause of same being that the children who attended this school were all young and had no knowledge of English prior to their admittance. Quite a number of the older children of the village were in the Edmonton Residential School, some of whom now attend the Kitwanga School.\n\nSince Inspector Barry's inspection of this school I have made several visits and spent some time with Mr. Flores in going through each grade and I am pleased to say a great improvement is noticed when all the children are in attendance. These visits will be continued during the winter and reports made accordingly.\n\nMr. Flores is greatly liked by the Indians of Kitwanga and is doing good work amongst them.\n\nRegarding the cleanliness of the school buildings, a coat of paint inside would considerably add to the cleanliness of same. The floors are often scrubbed.\n\nIn conclusion may I say that if Inspector Barry could visit this Agency at a more opportune time of the year - say November or April - I am of opinion that a better report would be submitted by the Inspector on the Kitwanga School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nre - Kitwanga Indian Day School. Teacher,\nRev. Henry Flores.\n\nI respectfully beg to report that on December 7th I made a visit to the Kitwanga Reserve.\n\nAfter a general meeting with the Indians I examined many homes and found conditions fairly normal. However, the Kitwanga Indians feel somewhat disappointed with the Canadian National Railways in failing to give them a small tie contract so as to enable them to pass the winter free of relief.\n\nMost of December 8th was spent in inspecting the Indian Day School there and I am pleased to say that the school is in a satisfactory condition. There were 24 children in attendance. I examined each class separately and an improvement was noticed, especially in class 5. I followed the usual course of studies in my examination as laid down by Mr. School Inspector Barry.\n\nIn the evening I had an interview with the Rev. Mr. Flores and strongly stressed the following points:\n\nDiscipline, punctual attendance and strictly keeping to instructions as laid down by the Department.\n\nDuring the winter I will visit the school monthly and submit reports to the Department regarding improvements etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe - Kitwanga Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to report that I visited and inspected the Kitwanga Indian Day School on Friday, January 26th, the Rev. Henry Flores, Teacher, being in attendance with fifteen children.\n\nI am pleased to say the pupils are progressing favourably, grades 1 to 5 being examined.\n\nGrade 5: I found these children good in geography, reading, spelling, arithmetic, composition and nature study.\n\nGrade 4: There was only one pupil in this grade who was fairly good in geography, reading and spelling.\n\nGrades 2 & 3: The children were fairly good in all the subjects examined.\n\nGrade 1: These children were rather backward, very few of them understanding the English language.\n\nAll the children were well dressed and appeared healthy and well nourished. Quite a number of children were absent owing to the inclement weather.\n\nThe school was clean and tidy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C.

I am more than ordinarily pleased with the staff of teachers in charge of the Native Day Schools in the Diocese of Caledonia. I have had the privilege of visiting nearly all of them recently and everyone of them seems to be doing well.\n\nI beg to recommend certain changes at Hazelton and Gitwangah.\n\nMr. Flores has left Gitwangah for Australia and Gitwangah has been temporarily supplied by a Mrs. Orne, a certified teacher, who has given satisfactory service there so far. She will be in charge until the end of the year. At the beginning of the year it is Mr. Shearman's wish to leave Hazelton and take up the work at Gitwangah. This is agreed to both by the Indian Agent and myself. In his place at Hazelton we are fortunate in securing the services of Mr. Noel Stewart, who for some time has been a successful teacher at St. Paul's Indian School at Cardston, Alta. He has a first class certificate and several other special certificates which will probably be of use to him.\n\nWould you kindly confirm the changes and new appointments herein stated,\n\nThanking you for the courtesy and help of the past\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

Hoping to see you before I leave yours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6399, File 824-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 1, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Shearman:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 5th ultimo, in which you express a desire to secure specific information with respect to our welfare programme and the relationship of this programme to Indian pupils immediately following the completion of the regular school course.\n\nThe departmental circular of January 25, 1937, was an introductory circular, sent out in the hope that it would establish a point of contact between the officials here and the teachers in charge of our Indian day and residential schools. It was our hope, also, that the teachers would reply to the communication, giving us a brief outline of local conditions and the difficulties confronting them. I am glad to be able to state that the majority of the teachers have communicated with us from time to time and have forwarded many helpful suggestions. It was not our intention, nor is it our intention now, to send out these circular letters individually. We have not, at the central office, a staff that would enable us to undertake such a task. In addition to this, Indian agents, under the direction of Indian inspectors, are responsible for departmental administration on the reserves. These men are notified of any changes that may take place in departmental policy from time to time. In the outlying districts, of course, it may be exceedingly difficult for Indian agents to keep in close contact with the teachers in charge of our schools, but the majority of agents attempt to do so.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to submit a brief summary of the departmental welfare programme. At this date, approximately one-third of the Indian population in Canada are in receipt of relief. This condition is due, in part, to drought conditions in Western Canada, particularly in the province of Saskatchewan, and to the difficulty experienced by Indians in securing trapping and fishing areas free from the competition of white trappers and white fishermen. Last year, however, in addition to the general effort, an appropriation of approximately one million dollars ($1,000,000) was set apart as a special rehabilitation appropriation. This money has been spent in an attempt to clear land, build houses, purchase farm machinery and trapping leases and in an attempt to purchase horses and equipment for Indian pupils who have completed their courses at our schools. It is encouraging to note that, despite prevailing economic conditions, the programme has been, on the whole, very successful. Consideration has also been given to a health programme, designed to restrict and ultimately eradicate the ravages of tuberculosis amongst the members of our Indian ...\n\nRev. B. Shearman,\nTeacher,\nKitwanga Indian Day School,\nKitwanga, B. C.\nIndian population. It is our hope that in the estimates of this year an amount of $150,000.00 will be included for this work.\n\nIndian pupils who have obtained a creditable standing on their Entrance Examinations and who are in good physical condition are eligible for departmental tuition grants, which grants enable them to proceed with either the regular high school courses or special vocational courses. A large number of Indian pupils throughout the Dominion take advantage of these tuition grants from year to year. This year, by way of experiment, we have sent a group of girls ranging in age between 16 and 20 to a vocational school at Ste. Anne's, Quebec. At this school these girls will be given a special course in handloom weaving, handicraft work, domestic science, sanitation, etc. Arrangements have also been completed with the Superintendent of National Parks, whereby a group of boys, graduates of our residential schools, will proceed to these parks this spring and take up a two-year course, thus qualifying to become national park rangers. A few months ago, we entered into negotiations with the management of the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific dining car service and with the automobile manufacturers in Canada, in the hope that positions might be secured for a number of Indian boys. In view of the fact, however, that thousands of fully qualified white boys are seeking such positions, our negotiations, while still open, have not proved very successful.\n\nIn your letter you refer to a regulation preventing Indian pupils from proceeding with high school studies. I have no knowledge of such regulation. This does not mean, of course, that all Indian pupils who apply for tuition grants succeed in their request. The appropriation for this work is somewhat limited, owing to the steadily multiplying demands for relief allowances. Then, too, it is often difficult to secure for Indian boys and girls accommodation in towns with high school facilities where their conduct and general moral welfare would be under the direct supervision of responsible individuals. I am not at the moment fully convinced that the regular high school course is the course that Indian pupils should be encouraged to proceed with. I am rather inclined to think that they should be encouraged to take courses in diesel engineering, auto mechanics and carpentry work.

If you have done so, however, and the grant has been refused, I would be glad to be supplied with full particulars.\n\nI notice that it has been the policy of the Department...\nDepartment in the past to allow a certain number of pupils from your district to proceed to the residential school at Edmonton. This matter was carefully reviewed about six months ago and a decision reached that, in future, pupils would not be permitted to attend schools outside the province of British Columbia. It is my understanding that the Indian Commissioner, the Indian Agent and the Principal of the residential school at Edmonton have been informed of this decision.\n\nIn circular letter already referred to, I expressed the hope that provision would be made for a certain amount of vocational instruction at all our schools. The requests for vocational supplies reaching the Department from day to day would indicate that a majority of our teachers are making provision for such courses. The Indian pupils appear to be deeply interested in these new assignments.\n\nI have written at considerable length in the hope that I might be able to remove any misunderstanding that may exist in respect to the attempts that are being made by the Department to work out a welfare programme designed to gradually re-establish the Indian population of the Dominion on a satisfactory and self-supporting basis.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Kitzwanga Indian Day School, Anglican Church, Babine Agency, which I inspected on September 25th.\n\nOwing to the lack of bridges and road between Hazelton and Kitzwanga this is a difficult school to visit and it was necessary for me to make use of the westbound C.N.R. train on the 25th instant from Hazelton. This involved staying for the night at Kitzwanga school inspecting the next morning and coming on here by the eastbound C.N.R. train early on Saturday morning.\n\nIt would appear the school has suffered since my last visit in October 1938 from the fact that the last teacher, the Rev. B. Sheerman now moved to Kitkatla, allowed the standard of academic work to degenerate, and the school to become dirty. The present teacher is highly efficient and has worked hard to clean up the room and desks since she arrived here. I have no doubt that very good work will be done by Mrs Hayhurst. The Indians are much pleased that the change in teachers has been made.\n\nThe flag pole which has for some reason been taken down should have a new rope and be replaced in its cement socket. This should certainly not cost more than $5.00 for labour and material.\n\nThe steps to the schoolroom, which belongs to the Anglican Church, need immediate repair to make them safe for the children's use. Kalsomine and paint have been purchased for the decoration of the inside of the schoolroom, and the sum of $16 set aside by the Department, though why this was done I do not know as the Anglican Church does appear to be responsible for such work in a general way. I do not remember this matter being taken up in your office. I certainly consider that it would be well for those in the Commissioner's office to have an opportunity to recommend or otherwise expenditures on Indian day schools in B.C.\n\nIt would also appear that the matter of the appointment of Mr. John Hayhurst as Dispenser has been taken up with the Department direct through the Acting Indian Agent's action. You will remember that Mr. Hoey wrote about this when Mrs Hayhurst was appointed. I understand that the Right Rev. Bishop did more or less promised Mr. Hayhurst such an appointment when he nominated Mrs. Hayhurst as teacher. I most certainly consider that such matters should be given consideration by you before the Department is asked to make appointments in British Columbia.\n\nThere are now some thirty seven children at the school, or at least on the school roll, with a number of small children to come when the parents are all back in the village. Mr. Hayhurst is very good in Manual Training and with the actual academic work of the Primary Grades. You will remember he did this work at Lakelsap, and also acted as Dispenser there. If the Department has any funds for this purpose, and it would appear that there are some available for Mrs Sheerman was paid I believe $15.00 a month, it might be well to appoint Mr. Hayhurst as assistant teacher here.\nI explained to Mr. Hayhurst in answer to his questions that the conditions at Kitwanga were not the same as those at the Lakalsap Indian Day School, and that in fact Mrs Hayhurst was fortunate to be permitted to hold a teaching position, for there were very strict Civil Service and Departmental regulations governing the appointment of married women as teachers.\n\nIt is only right for me to point out for your information that Mr. Hayhurst is acting as an Anglican missionary at Kitwanga though not of course an ordained man. He did not hold a corresponding position at Greenville (Lakalsap).\n\nThe Hayhursts on their own statement did not seek the Kitwanga appointment but were urged to accept it by the Right Rev. Bishop Kix.\n\nMr. Hayhurst is deaf in one ear. This might prevent his regular employment as a carpenter or machin shop workman, for which trades he is qualified. I suggested that he might attempt to enlist in a technical military unit such as an engineering or searchlight company. He had thought of this himself. His chance of acceptance owing to deafness in one ear is however perhaps slight.\n\nUnder the combined circumstances of this case I am prepared to recommend that Mr. John Hayhurst be appointed assistant teacher at Kitwanga, on the understanding that he take charge of the Dispensary and later teach elementary manual training to the older boys. I would suggest that he be paid $20.00 per teaching month for such services.\n\nMay I also ask that a sum of $50.00 be included in the 1940-41 Estimates to provide for some simple carpenter tools at this school, and the provision of a small quantity of lumber to make a work bench and some simple articles, and a further $10.00 for sewing materials for the girls.\n\nI hope that the above will assist you and the Department to come to a decision in this matter, and I may say that I am aware that you may not agree with me in the slightest, for a very involved case has been made even worse by the fact that the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Macdonald, has communicated directly with the Department, and I am not aware at the moment of what his recommendation may have been.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOctober 26, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Inspector Barry's report of his inspection of the Kitwanga Indian Day School on September 22nd. The report would indicate that the matter of the employment of Mr. John Hayhurst in some capacity in connection with the school has been taken up with the Department by Mr. Mallinson, and possibly by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix.\n\nThe Department will have on file my letter of August 25th, wherein I advised that Inspector Barry was unable to recommend Mr. Hayhurst for any position in the service at Kitwanga. As a result, however, of his recent inspection of the school Capt. Barry is now of the opinion that Mr. Hayhurst would be quite helpful as Assistant Teacher and recommends his appointment as such. Promises may have been made by the Church to Mr. and Mrs. Hayhurst regarding the employment of Mr. Hayhurst in some such capacity, otherwise it is difficult to understand why they would wish to leave the Lakalsap School, where their departmental income was in excess of the salary paid at Kitwanga.\n\nAs the Department is understood to have paid Mrs. Shearman a small monthly sum as Field Matron at Kitwanga, no doubt the Indians will look for similar services from Mr. and Mrs. Hayhurst. Moreover, the Inspector considers Mr. Hayhurst could do good work in Manual Training and the actual academic work of the primary grades. Under these circumstances I am prepared to endorse the recommendation of employment of Mr. Hayhurst as Assistant Teacher.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Besides, Mr. and Mrs. Hayhurst transferred from Lakalsap to Kitwanga of their own free will. Under these circumstances the Department is not prepared to favourably consider allowing any salary for any work that Mr. Hayhurst might do at Kitwanga.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Salary of Teacher,\nKitwanga Indian Day School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 7th instant and also copies of correspondence relating to the above-noted subject, sent forward therewith.\n\nIn view of the salary schedule now in force in B. C., which was approved by you a few weeks ago, I found the recommendation for an increase in the salary of Mrs. Hayhurst somewhat disturbing. In this connection it would appear that a mistake was made when Mrs. Buddrus was granted a monthly allowance as medicine dispenser without first referring the matter to you. However, this decision was not reached by the officials of the Welfare and Training Division but was probably reached by an official who has little, if any, information on the attempts we have been making to bring about a uniform salary schedule at the Indian day schools of British Columbia. The payment of allowances for the dispensing of medicine or for work ordinarily undertaken by officers who are described as field matrons is not a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of this Division. However, I have today discussed the recommendation contained in the last paragraph of your letter with the officer in charge of Personnel. We are agreed that in view of all the circumstances it might be advisable to allow Mrs. Hayhurst the sum of $15.00 a month for the dispensing of drugs. Vouchers covering this amount\nmight be sent forward from month to month.\n\nI must state, however, that I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that day school teachers should be paid a stated salary and that this salary should be based, not only on their classroom duties and responsibilities, but upon other services that may be performed on the reserve, such as dispensing drugs, the organization of women's clubs, the visiting of homes, etc. In other words, I am disposed to think that our teachers should be classified, not as teachers, but as Welfare and Training officers. These teachers, in my humble judgment, should be permanent Civil Servants and should be employed on our reserves for 12 months in the year, less the regular Civil Service holidays. They should be paid a salary that would attract ambitious young men and women of ability, particularly men, to take up this work. In the meantime and until such a decision is reached, would it be possible for you to work out a salary schedule in British Columbia for next year, which would include remuneration for the services I have enumerated and others that might be added? I appreciate, of course, very fully the limited time at your disposal to undertake such a task, but I do feel that such action would be a substantial step forward toward our ultimate objective.\n\nA word in conclusion - It is noted that the allowance granted Mrs. Buddrus was granted on the recommendation of the Indian agent. It might help us here if Indian agents were definitely instructed to refer such matters to you. The members of our staff are changing so constantly in this critical period that it is exceedingly difficult for recently appointed men to keep abreast of all the decisions and understandings reached a few years ago.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of September 13th, regarding the salary of the teacher at the Kitwanga Indian Day School, and in particular to the reference to payment for services in dispensing drugs on this Reserve.\n\nThe last paragraph of my letter of September 7th, and previous correspondence in this connection advised that Mr. Hayhurst had been acting as Dispensor and his wife as school teacher and my recommendation was to the effect that Mr. Hayhurst be allowed the sum of $15.00 per month for his services. It is considered that this allowance should be entirely separate to that allowed Mrs. Hayhurst for her services as teacher, and I would ask you to please confirm that it will be in order for the Indian Agent to submit vouchers payable to Mr. Hayhurst.\n\nThat portion of your letter dealing with the classification of teachers and revision of their salaries accordingly will be dealt with in a future communication as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to the concluding paragraph of Mr. Hoey's letter, I would advise that all Agents throughout this Province have already been instructed that all questions dealing with personnel are to be submitted through this office, but there have been occasions when Agents ignore this ruling when they anticipate opposition from here to their recommendation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRE: Voucher No. 263 - $15.25\n\nIn favor of Woodward Stores Ltd.\n\nWith reference to the above mentioned voucher attached herewith, I would call your attention to the duplicate expense bill of the Canadian National Steamships which is unsigned. However, the goods have been delivered and no collect freight has been charged.\n\nIt is noted that only one sand-paper was shipped, whereas Mrs. Hayhurst, teacher at Kitwanga School, asked for one carton. I am informed that this supply is insufficient and I have granted Mrs. Hayhurst permission to order one carton. According to your authority, two items have not been supplied which may be obtained from some other source, namely:\n\n1 Coping Saw Drill\n1 3/8\" Gouge.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nHazelton, B.C. April 17, 1947\n\nMajor D.M. McKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nFurther in the matter of a place of residence for Miss Skatfeld, teacher at the Kitwanga Indian Day School, please be advised that I received permission from Bishop Gibson for Miss Skatfeld to occupy a room at the Mission House. On her return from the Easter Vacation, Miss Skatfeld went to the Mission House to which the Missionary and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Hayhurst had returned in the interim, and met with considerable unpleasantness. It would appear that Mrs. Hayhurst had hoped to be reemployed as teacher at Kitwanga and Mr. Hayhurst is most annoyed about the appointment of Mrs. Gregg as Field Matron at Kitwanga. The situation is such that it would be quite impossible from Miss Skatfeld to live under the same roof as the Hayhursts. She is boarding at Kitwanga at present on a very temporary basis and it is urgently necessary that some place of residence be made available to her without delay. To this end I have spoken to Arthur McDames, an Indian who owns a fairly presentable three-room house at Kitwanga which he would rent on a basis of $10 a month. Some interior redecoration would be required and Arthur McDames would agree to this in lieu of rent up to $60 which sum should be sufficient. It would be appreciated if you would authorize this arrangement as a purely temporary expedient, as I feel that it is the only alternative to closing the school. Miss Skatfeld is doing excellent work at Kitwanga and should be retained for as long as possible. When it was contemplated that she might move to Kitwancool I received a petition from the Kitwanga Natives urging her retention and emphasizing the progress that the children were making.\n\nIf this house is rented it will be necessary to make use of some articles of furniture from the School House at Kitwancool.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Kitwanga Day School.\n\nI enclose Indian Agent Boy's letter of the 17th inst., advising that difficulty has arisen following the return of the Anglican missionary, Reverend H. MacKintosh, formerly dispenser for the reserve, and his wife, formerly teacher. The school and residence are owned by the Church and located on a 2.5-acre parcel located in the centre of the reserve. We have been paying the Church a rental for the school for many years, but evidently this did not cover the residence. This created no difficulty so long as we employed the Church officials for duty on the reserve, but this couple had to leave last summer due to Mr. MacKintosh's health. Apparently they are not too well pleased to find the positions had been filled in their absence.\n\nThis will indicate the difficulties that arise in the use of church property and employment of missionaries. Under the circumstances, after discussing the matter with Major Davy, the school inspector, I would recommend approval of Mr. Boy's suggestion of renting a house from an Indian and putting it in shape for the teacher's use, the original furnishings being used. If and when Kitwanga opens we can purchase new furnishings for it.\n\nAPR 25 1947\n\nREGISTERED\nThe school building at Witanga is very old and decrepit and, as stated, owned by the Church. It is due for early replacement, which should include residence, and in the meantime it would be advisable to reduce our dependency on the Institution.\n\nI would, therefore, approve of Mr. Boys' proposal to rent the residence to him at $15 per month, Mr. Boys to be authorized to expend up to $200 for redecoration, to be deducted from the rental. Also to incur cost of all necessary furnishings from Atwood for the residence. If you concur, it will be appreciated if you would kindly inform Mr. Boys of Hamilton, Ont., direct and forward a copy to this office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Du Vernet - dated the 14th instant and addressed to me - which gives his view on a more many-sided question, and wherein he omits the mention of erecting a school there, altogether, but treats rather on an allowance for rent on the school building there existing, etc., etc., and an increased grant for that school's teacher.\n\nIn regard thereto, I have the honour to state that no qualified white teacher can be obtained under the conditions pointed out ($400.00 per annum) and sustain himself, or herself, under the abnormal prices for subsistence prevailing there, here and elsewhere on the Skeena.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nJuly 14, 1911.\n\nR.E. Loring Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is a matter that I wish to bring before the Indian Department at Ottawa. It is regarding the Day School at Gitwangak.\n\nAs you may have heard Rev. A.E. Price is leaving our Gitwangak Mission next September for a year in England and may not return to this station.\n\nIt is therefore necessary for me to make as soon as possible some arrangement for a teacher. I wish to secure a competent white teacher but the Day School Grant is only $400, while most of the other schools receive $500. I wish to point out to the Department:\n\n1. The Department has for years been using our school building without paying us a cent of rent.\n\n2. The expense of bringing a qualified teacher from Vancouver to Gitwangak is about $50, according to the state of the Skeena river. The Department has never to my knowledge paid this.\n\n3. Without a married Missionary resident at Gitwangak no white woman teacher could live alone in the Indian village as there are no other white people with whom to live. We must, therefore, have a white male teacher this winter.\n\n4. A white male teacher cannot be obtained for $400, a year. He could not live on this.\n\nUnder all these circumstances I feel fully justified in asking for at least the standard salary of $500, and I think to cover the\nTravelling expenses as well as the upkeep of the building and such like demands upon our Funds the Department should allow us a rental for our school-house.\n\nI should like to know soon whether I can count upon this increased Grant so that I may have time to secure a well qualified teacher by September. I can assure the Department that it is most difficult to secure proper teachers and the Church has in most cases to add greatly to what the Government allows in the way of salary.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nOttawa, June 10, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Green in his report on the Kitwanga school has recommended the erection of a new building and I have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department have a full report on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

F. H. Du Vernet, Bishop of Caledonia, what rent would be asked for the use of the church buildings at Hazelton and Gitwangak, for school purposes, I received a rather late reply upon a second enquiry, and of which I here beg to quote the following,\n\nto wit:-\n\n\"Prince Rupert, March 2, 1917.\n\n\"R. E. Loring,\nIndian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\n\"Dear Sir,-\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult., dealing with a letter of mine of Aug. 3rd, 1916 in regard to the Hazelton and Gitwangak school buildings. I am glad to learn that the Indian Department has noted for future consideration the matter of building a new school house at Gitwangak and draw your attention to the fact that the Department has for years past been making use of our building without allowing rent or keeping it in repair.\"\n\n\"In reply to your closing words in which you say: 'I am requested to ascertain what rent per month would be asked for the church (school) buildings at Hazelton and Kitwanga.' I wish to answer that after consultation with members of our Church committee we have decided that Eight ($8.) Dollars a month for each school would be a fair rental, it being understood clearly that this was for the use of the building during school hours.\n\n\"Further as on August 3rd, 1916 I notified the Department regarding the use of these buildings I consider that rent is due from the beginning of the school year last September.\n\n\"The item of insurance, the risk from fire, wear and tear on the building &c. have all to be taken into account in fixing a fair rental., etc.\"\n\nThe foregoing respectfully submitting for the Department's consideration,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 16, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a copy of a communication from the Bishop of Caledonia in regard to schools matters in your agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say with reference to the Gitwangak school that it is now too late in the season to undertake the erection of a school building at this point, but it will be noted for next year's estimates. The Department would like to retain the use of the church building for school purposes for the present and I have to ask you to be good enough to communicate with the Bishop in regard to this matter.\n\nYou might also ascertain from His Lordship what rent they would ask for the use of the church buildings at Hazelton and Gitwangak.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Lorin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nThe question of erecting a new school was previously brought up in 1912. At that time Mr. Loring was instructed to seek the church authorities what rent should be paid for its building. The answer was received at this latter.\n\nIn 1915-1916 was expended in building new toilets.\n\nIn 1915-1916 was expended in the purchase of land for the school. Scaffolding expenses have also been incurred from time to time.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nAug. 3rd, 1916.\n\nR.E. Loring, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have forwarded your letter of July 27th, to Archdeacon Collinson and asked him to explain the whole matter to Jonathan Mercer.\n\nFor the past ten years I have been working steadily towards the new policy. The Indian Department becoming entirely responsible for Indian school work, allowing the Church to impart religious instruction.\n\nIn all the other agencies except yours the old system has almost passed away. The Indian Department has erected fine school buildings and pays good salaries to the Indian school teachers and meets all expenses such as travelling etc.\n\nAt Hazelton and Gitwangak the Indian Department still makes use of our Church buildings without allowing anything in the way of rent.\n\nSome time ago I informed Miss Kemp, the Indian day school teacher at Gitwangak that she was to look to the Indian Department entirely for her salary and as a Church we have ceased to have any responsibility in regard to her.\n\nI think that the Department should erect a new school house at Gitwangak and set our school building free for Church Army purposes and also the school children sitting there for so many hours.\n\nUnder the old system there was divided authority, Church and State. Under the new system the Indian Department has full control which is far more satisfactory.\nThere is the Indian Agent, the Inspector of Indian Agencies, and the Indian school inspector,\u2014all looking after these schools.\n\nMay I ask you to notify the Department that we require our Church building at Gitwangak for Church Army purposes and that this building is no longer suitable for school purposes.\n\nAs I have said in nearly all our other Missions, such as Metlakatla, Kincolith, Lakelsep etc the Department has erected fine new school houses and there is no reason why Gitwangak should not have one also.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) F.H.B. Vernet\n\nBishop of Caledonia.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith voucher No. 18, for $5.65, in favour of R. S.
