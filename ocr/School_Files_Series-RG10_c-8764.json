(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 5)\nWilliams Lake, B.C.,\nFebruary 18, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nOn a recent visit to Cariboo Indian Residential School, the laundry situation was gone into, and I found that with existing facilities, it is absolutely impossible to keep the children's clothing clean.\n\nOne whole day per week is occupied by all the girls in washing clothes. The following day is taken up with ironing, and when the sheets from the boys' beds have to be washed, and their overalls, two days have to be spent in washing. Under this arrangement, I do not think that the sheets are changed more than once a month, and the boys' overalls, on various occasions, appear to be quite dirty.\n\nFather McGrath is quite aware of this situation; in fact, it was one of the first things he went into after coming to the Cariboo School. He made inquiries at Vancouver from Stanley Brock, Limited, and received a quotation on a 36 x $4 2-compartment belt driven Monarch Wood Washer, which was quoted at $713.00, f.o.b. Vancouver. The school, however, has never had the money available to purchase this machine.\n\nI understand that most of the other Indian Residential Schools are equipped with a suitable sized washing machine with all the other equipment such as an extractor for drying the clothes, and electric ironer. I am not aware whether these washing machines are supplied by the Department for the other Residential Schools or not, but I would imagine that where the Department has put up the buildings, that they have also equipped same.\n\nDespite the fact that the Cariboo Indian School buildings belong to the Oblate Mission, I feel quite certain that this expenditure for a washing machine would do much to improve the situation from a health standpoint. It stands to reason during the past epidemic that a terrific amount of washing would have been required to keep things as they should be.\n\nWhile it is no doubt advisable that these Indian\n\n(over)\nGirls should know how to do the laundry work without any of the modern conveniences, the amount of laundry that should be done in an establishment such as this would take up far too much time for the girls, to the detriment of their academic and other activities, which makes this institution less like a school and more like a penal institution.\n\nAs I said before, Father McGrath realizes this situation only too well, but apparently the funds are not available as far as the school is concerned, and I would strongly recommend that the Department consider the purchase of the washing machine as indicated above, and also one Canadian Underdriven Solid Curb Extractor, price for which can be obtained from Stanley Brock Limited, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nFather McGrath advises me that he will find a suitable power to operate this outfit.\n\nI understand a priority is necessary to get this equipment, but no doubt same could be obtained for an institution of this kind.\n\nW. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 5)\nOttawa,\nMarch 25, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, submitting a request for laundry machinery costing approximately $1600 for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen submitting the estimates for the fiscal year 1944-45 Indian Agent Christie requested $500 for laundry machinery for this school and this amount is included in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1944-45. As you know, the Cariboo School is a Church-owned building and funds for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment are provided in a special appropriation and we are only allowed to expend at such schools the amount actually included in the appropriation. As you are also aware, our estimates for 1944-45 were prepared last November, at which time, as stated above, we included the amount requested; namely, $500. You will, therefore, realize that it is through no fault of this office that consideration was not given to providing the larger amount but, in view of the conditions mentioned above, it will not be possible for the Department to consider an expenditure of $1615 for this equipment during the fiscal year 1944-45.\n\nI feel it is advisable for you to point out again to Indian Agent Christie that the requirements at his agency must be anticipated. If the requirements are not brought to our attention...\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letters of the 18th and 25th ultimo requesting the provision of laundry machinery for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nI have made local enquiry regarding the cost of such an installation and would advise that the prices are approximately as follows:\n\n1. Washer $713.00 36x54 2 compartment Monarch A wood washer belt drive\n2. Extractor 20\" $700.00\n3. Shafting, etc. $150.00\n4. Freight $50.00\n\n$1613.00\n\nAs pointed out by Mr. Christie, the girl pupils of the school are at present supplying the labour for carrying out this laundry work by hand and, in my opinion, the task is far beyond their physique and likely to result in medical costs much in excess of the cost of the appropriate equipment. While the school is not owned by the Department, I would recommend in the interests of the pupils' health the provision of suitable equipment as suggested above. There are 121 pupils attending this school.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nFebruary 25, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour file 215-16-1511\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd inst., the question of a power unit to operate the proposed laundry equipment for the Cariboo Indian Residential School was discussed with Father McGrath.\n\nThe present Delco plant at the School has not capacity enough for this equipment, but, having in mind the proposed rural electrification scheme after the war, Father McGrath contemplates an electric motor as the ideal power unit.\n\nFor the present, however, he will use the farm tractor which is also used for other belt work around the school. Approximately $150.00 would have to be spent on shafting, pulleys, etc. but the installation of this equipment is a comparatively simple matter.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 160-0-5\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of March 23rd, regarding laundry machinery for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Christie has discussed this matter with the Reverend Father McGrath who advises that, if the Department are willing to contribute $500.00 towards the cost of a washer, the School would subscribe the balance required for a washer and the necessary shafting to operate same.\n\nIf this suggestion meets with your approval, an item will be entered in the 1945-46 Estimates for the extractor and other necessary equipment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.

On the washer mentioned above Commissioner MacKay has received a quotation of $118, f.o.b. Vancouver, from Stanley Brook Limited, Vancouver. The Cariboo School is a Church-owned school and in the current year's appropriation we have only provided an amount of $500 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the school. The school authorities state that if we allow this amount toward the cost of a new washer they are prepared to pay the balance of the cost over and above the Department's contribution. In view of the information contained above, I suggest that the Indian Commissioner be authorized to proceed with the purchase of the washer mentioned.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nDirector\n\n(SEE OTHER SIDE)\n\nIndian Affairs.

In your letter of March 17 it was\nestimated that the cost of the extractor would\nbe $700. Consequently, in view of what has just\nbeen said, if the Principal purchases the extractor\nnow we will provide $500 in the 1945-46 appropriation\nand refund him to that extent.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter of May 18th, regarding the supply of laundry equipment to the Cariboo Indian Residential School wherein it is noted that Purchase Order No. 23902, Encumbrance No. 206 was issued by the Department for a 30\" x 46\" washer which has been supplied by Stanley Brock Ltd., Vancouver at a cost of $440.00\n\nI would bring to your attention Father McGrath's proposal that the other equipment requested, as listed in my letter of March 17th, be purchased from school funds immediately and that the Department re-imburse the school to the extent of the cost of this equipment out of the 1945-46 appropriation.\n\nIt would be appreciated if I could be advised regarding the Department's reaction to this proposal so that, if same is approved, provision can be made in the 1945-46 Estimates of an amount sufficient to cover the expenditure.\n\nM.

McGrath is now anxious to get an extractor and I believe Stanley Brock has a suitable machine available. Fr. McGrath is prepared to purchase this machine immediately and asked me to write the Department to see if it would be possible for them to reimburse the School to the extent of the cost of this equipment, out of next year's appropriation.\n\nIn your letter of March 29th it was suggested that I place an item in the 1945-46 estimates to cover purchase of an extractor and other laundry equipment in 1945-46. However it would seem preferable that all the equipment that goes with the washer should be installed at one time instead of piece-meal and if the School is prepared to finance the purchase and installation of the other equipment immediately, in the interests of efficiency, it might be possible for the Department to authorize a grant out of the 1945-46 appropriation to reimburse them for this expenditure.\n\nWill you kindly advise me as soon as possible if you think the Department could give any such guarantee.\n\nWm.

C.\n\nI have your letter of the first instant,\nwith reference to the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you state in the first paragraph of your\nletter, it is not possible for the Department to pay to\nthe school the amount of unearned per capita. We are\nonly permitted to pay per capita grant for the pupils\nactually in residence, as shown by the quarterly returns.\nI note in the Principal's letter he states that the\nMissionaries have endeavoured to have the children re-\nturned to the school. I suppose that Indian Agent\nChristie has been assisting them, but, in any case I\nfeel that the Agent might be again urged to make another\nattempt to have additional children placed in the school.\nThere is no doubt that there will be plenty of children\navailable in the Agency.\n\nWith regard to paying the accounts to which\nyou refer in the second paragraph of your letter, you\nare aware that as Cariboo is classed as a church-owned\nschool we are only permitted to expend, for repairs,\nimprovements and the purchase of new equipment, the\nspecific amount provided for the school in the current\nyear's appropriation. The sum allotted to them in this\nyear's Vote was $500.00, and we have already expended\nthat amount.\n\nMr. Hoey and I discussed your letter this\nmorning and while we appreciate the financial difficulties\nunder which the school is labouring, due particularly to\nlack of pupilage, we regret very much that for the reasons\nmentioned above we are not in a position to render any\nspecial assistance at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have received a letter from Reverend Father McGrath, Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, a copy of which is enclosed, in which he refers to the drop in the earnings of the school for the last quarter, the enrollment being some twenty-one children below the quota of one hundred and twenty allowed for this school, and requesting that the Department favourably consider payment of the per capita grant on the basis of the full quota in order to assist the school to meet operating costs. I fail to see how this could be done in view of the regulations governing the payment of the per capita grant.\n\nThe Principal lists two items on which outlays have recently been made from school funds, namely, renewal of flooring in the laundry $385.00, and laundry extractor $500.00, which expenditures probably would not have been incurred had the decline in enrollment been anticipated. If it were possible for the Department to reimburse the school for these outlays it would considerably help them through the present difficulty. Father McGrath is doing his best to carry on under very difficult circumstances and is deserving of any assistance in this respect that the Department is in a position to extend.\n\nI am afraid that the Oblate Order is going to find it extremely difficult to operate this school without loss even on the basis of a full attendance owing to the very high cost of maintaining in reasonably good repair the very old group of buildings comprising the school. The time is certainly approaching, if it has not already arrived, when the existing setup should be examined in the light of what should be provided to meet Indian educational needs in the district. The owners of the school should gradually replace the present structures with new up-to-date school buildings and if they are not in a position to do so the question of the replacement of the school by a Departmentally owned\n\n(over)\nCARIBOO INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n150 Miles House\nBritish Columbia\n\nJan. 9th, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner,\nFederal Bldg;\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nThank you very much for your kind\nrememberance of us at Christmas. I sincerely hope that you had a\npleasant Christmas and that the New Year will be a happy one for you.\nThe children here enjoyed themselves very much. For the staff it\nwas as usual a very busy and tiring time but it was worth it all\nto see the children so happy. Things are back to normal again now.\n\nI sent in our Quarterly Report a few days ago for the December\nQuarter. As you know our attendance has been down so far this\nyear and our reports showed only 99 children instead of our normal\nquota of 120. Our Missionaries have tried to round up the necessary\nnumber but there are many yet of school age whom the parents want\nto keep home for another year. It seems to have become the custom\nup here in very many cases to keep the children home till they are\naround 10 and 11 years old. That makes it very difficult to get\nthem into the higher grade before the time comes for them to leave\nat 16. However I am hoping that we will gradually be able to educate\nthe parents along the right lines. What is worrying me about the\nlast Report is that our Per Capita Grant will be reduced in accordance\nwith the lower attendance and if there was ever a time that we need\nour full Per Capita Grant, it is now. We have put quite a lot of money\ninto repairs and upkeep of the buildings. We have had to raise the\nsalaries of our Instructors. It cost us $385.00 to renew the\nLaundry building floor and $500.00 for the extractor. This has all\nleft us not only broke but a couple of hundred dollars in the hole.\nThis in itself is not unusual but if $900.00 is taken off our\nPer Capita Grant for the last quarter it will make things pretty\nawkward. So I would ask you if you would be good enough to recommend\nat Ottawa that we be given our full Per Capita. I have also written\nto Mr. Christie and I am sure that you will both see our position.\n\nI neglected to mention that there is also a bill of some $2000.00\nowing the Mission for food and wood which we will be unable to pay.\nThis was also the case last year. Hoping you will be able to help\nus out and wishing you again a Very Happy New Year, I remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. McGrath O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nJanuary 4, 1945.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School, situated near Williams Lake, British Columbia, requires a new lighting plant to replace their present equipment.\n\nThe school would like to obtain a 20 kilowatt Diesel A.C. outfit, without batteries. I should appreciate your advising if the above-mentioned equipment is available and, if so, at what price it can be secured. I should also like to know where such equipment, if available, is at present located, so that we can have it examined to make certain that it would suit our purposes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nThe War Assets Corporation,\n1212 Dominion Square Building,\nMontreal, Que.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 160-0-5\n\nI have for acknowledgement, your letter of the 9th instant regarding a lighting plant for the Cariboo Residential School.\n\nThe contents of your letter regarding the Department's attitude to church-owned property, has also been explained to Fr. McGrath the Principal.\n\nHowever, there is no question regarding the urgency of a suitable lighting plant and I had Fr. McGrath go over each building to ascertain the size of plant required, and there is a copy of his requirements enclosed.\n\nThe engineer who looks after the local town lighting system very kindly went down with me to the school and he recommends a 20 kilowatt Diesel A.C. outfit without batteries. Although the school may have to pay for part of this equipment, no doubt it can be purchased much cheaper from the War Assets Corporation through the Department. I would suggest that enquiries are made for a suitable lighting outfit as soon as possible.\n\nWm.

This year we provided an amount of $500.00 for repairs and improvements and new equipment at this school. Of this amount $440.00 was expended in purchasing a washing machine and the remaining $60.00 was used as a partial payment on the extractor purchased by the school management. You will therefore note that the full amount provided in the current year's appropriation has been expended. However, we have placed a similar amount in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46, and although I am not in a position at the present time to promise definitely that this will be allowed, I am inclined to feel that it will.\n\nAll surplus material from Military or Air Training stations is taken by the War Assets Corporation and a price is placed on it. As a consequence, none of this equipment or material will be turned over to the Department without some payment. There seems to be a general impression that a large amount of material or equipment will be available for free distribution. This is not the case.\n\nYou should let me have full particulars regarding the type and size of lighting plant and batteries that you think could adequately handle the\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nEducation;\n\nThe Cariboo Indian School was visited and Brother MacDonald seems to be holding the interest of the boys. The drum and fife Band is coming along and preparations are under way for hockey during the Winter.\n\nThe present Delco lighting plant is overloaded and the batteries are worn out. An old auxiliary plant is a complete wreck and it is doubtful if the present outfit will last the Winter. I would suggest that if might be possible for the Department even at this early date, to get a Diesel plant with sufficient capacity, that has been discarded by the military authorities. In view of the fact that several Air Training Stations are closing this might be possible.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Department of Mines and Resources\nOffice of the Director\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nYour letter of January 4th has been handed to the writer for attention.\n\nWe note that you require a lighting plant for the Cariboo Indian Residential School at Williams Lake, British Columbia. You suggest a 20 kilowatt Diesel A.C. Outfit, without batteries.\n\nWe regret at the present time we have no declaration covering equipment that would fill your requirements. However, we are keeping your request on file and when we have any material which would meet with your requirements as specified we will advise you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWAR ASSETS CORPORATION\n\nH. R. Mahoney\nDurable Goods Division\nElectrical Section\n\nHRM: BM\nOttawa, February 22, 1945.\n\nMr. Wm. Christie, Indian Agent, Williams Lake, B. C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of December 22, with reference to a lighting plant for the Cariboo Indian Residential School. We wrote the War Assets Corporation on January 4 and are now in receipt of their reply, dated February 20. They write as follows:\n\n\"We note that you require a lighting plant for the Cariboo Indian Residential School at Williams Lake, British Columbia. You suggest a 20 kilowatt Diesel A.C. Outfit, without batteries.\n\n\"We regret at the present time we have no declaration covering equipment that would fill your requirements. However, we are keeping your request on file and when we have any material which would meet with your requirements, as specified, we will advise you.\"\n\nEvidently, it will be some time before the War Assets Corporation will have the equipment that was requested. We are prepared to ask our Purchasing Branch to make enquiries regarding the possibility of securing one of these plants, but it should be understood that the amounts provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school have already been expended. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of December 9, 1944. When our appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46 is passed, there will be another $500.00 available, and before asking the Purchasing Agent to proceed, I would like to know if the school management is prepared to pay\n\np.t.o.\nthe amount that this machine may cost over and above\nthe $500.00 provided by the Department.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nYour File: 160-0-5\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 22nd inst. regarding lighting plant for Cariboo Indian Residential School. I note that the War Assets Corporation have been approached but have no equipment of this description at the present time.\n\nIt is also noted that there will be another $500 available for this school during the fiscal year 1945-46. In a letter received from Major D.M. Mackay, dated June 6, 1944, file 215-18-3825, he advised as follows:\n\n\"Father McGrath's proposal regarding purchase of the equipment other than the washer from school funds (the amount to be repaid to the School later) was referred to the Department who now advises that they can only see their way clear to promise to provide $500.00 for this purpose in the appropriation for the next fiscal year. Consequently, if the Principal purchases the extractor now, the Department will provide $500.00 in the 1945-46 appropriation and refund him to that extent.\"\n\nTherefore, since the grant for 1945-46 has already been used up on an extractor, there will, presumably, be no funds available until 1946-47. The matter has been discussed with Father McGrath, who states that the School is not in a financial position to meet the cost of the lighting plant, or even part of the cost, of such a piece of equipment.\n\nI should also like to point out that I am of the opinion that the present wiring in the Cariboo Indian Residential School buildings does not meet the standards required by the Fire Marshall, and that with the installation of a new plant, a large expenditure would have to be made for replacing the wiring throughout the buildings.\n\n-2- (over)\nFurther, it has become quite evident that the Department will have to make decision\u2014and the sooner the better\u2014as to whether they wish to continue this residential school, in which case provision should be made as soon as possible after the War for the erection of a modern building. There are several reserves in this agency which, in my opinion, could be better served by day schools, and which have a much greater chance of success with the enactment of the Family Allowance Act. At the same time, there are some outlying reserves where a day school is not feasible. It has occurred to me, however, that with the establishment of day schools in this and other agencies, the pupilage of the Kamloops Indian Residential School and the Lejac School would be reduced, and thus provision might be made for children from these outlying reserves at the institutions mentioned. You may no doubt recollect that a similar procedure occurred with the Coqualeetza Indian School when it was discontinued several years ago.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWC:MM\nOttawa, March 8, 1945.\n\nMr. Wm. Christie, Indian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the lighting plant at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have two Lister engines surplus to requirements at the Muscovequan Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan. One of these is a 27.5 amps. 5 H.P., reported in fair condition, and the other is a 55 amp. 10 H.P., which requires minor repairs. Would either or both of these engines meet the requirements at the Cariboo School? If so, we would be prepared to have them overhauled before forwarding them. It is understood that batteries are not required.\n\nI discussed with Mr. Hoey the latter part of your letter, with regard to the establishment of day schools. This is a matter that will have to receive very careful consideration before any definite action is taken. It is our hope to appoint an inspector of schools for British Columbia as soon as the war is over. It would be the duty of such an official to survey all reserves very carefully and decide on which reserves day schools should be established. Of course, such a survey would be undertaken in co-operation with the Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCariboo Indian Residential School\n\n150 MILE HOUSE\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nMarch 17th, 1945\n\nApplication for refund of expenses incurred in renewing of floor in Laundry Building.\n\nWork done.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated\n\nVoucher No. 512 Date March 19, 1945 Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nEnclosed herewith is Voucher No. 512 amounting to $385.00 for refund of money paid by the Cariboo Indian Residential School for renewal of floor of the laundry building with concrete.\n\nIn recommending this expenditure, I would like to point out that when Father McGrath, the present principal, took over these buildings, they were in a deplorable condition and there is a great deal that remains to be done. During the year 1943-44, due to a lack of staff, conditions in this school were not as they should have been, with the result that there has been a decline in the pupilage during the present year. I might say, however, that this condition has been entirely remedied with the employment of Brother MacDonald as boys' disciplinarian, the employment of a competent dairyman, and so on.\n\nFather McGrath has had to make extensive repairs and improvements all round which, in many cases, should have been done years ago. To mention some of the improvements during the present year, the boys' band was started, which has cost a considerable sum for instruments, a Calf Club and Potato Club has been organized and manual training instruction has also been organized on a proper basis.\n\nWith the installation of the laundry, an extra day is possible for the girls for academic studies, and has also resulted in the improvement of the hygienic conditions.\n\nWhereas boys used to have to saw most of the wood for the furnaces, this is now being done by\n\n-2- (over)\npower machinery. Although I am still of the opinion that a modern building is the only solution here if this school is to continue, I think that Father McGrath deserves every assistance and encouragement that the Department can give him, and in these circumstances I am recommending refund of the expenses mentioned.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 9, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated February 28, 1945, Mr. J. E. Morris, who was then acting Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask., advised this office that owing to the Muscowequan School securing electrical power from the Provincial Power service, there were two surplus Lister engines at the school.\n\nOne of these engines is stated to be 27.5 amps., 5 H.P., in fair condition, and the other, 55 amps., 10 H.P., requiring minor repairs.\n\nIt is our intention to ship these engines to the Cariboo Indian Residential School in British Columbia, but, before doing so, we would like to have them placed in good condition. Can you have the necessary repairs done in Regina or some other place close to the Muscowequan School. The Department would appreciate it if you would make inquiries and let us know where you can have the work done, the approximate cost and the probable length of time it would require to place these machines in good condition. As soon as we hear from you, further instructions will be given to you and at that time we will also inform you of the correct address to which these two engines should be shipped.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: Philip Phelan, Esq.,\nYour File: 160-0-5\n\nThe contents of your letter of the 8th inst. regarding lighting plant for the Cariboo Indian Residential School have been discussed with Father McGrath. While Father McGrath does not consider the two plants mentioned by you to be entirely satisfactory to take care of all requirements at this school, he believes that under the circumstances it would be advisable for them to be put into condition and shipped as soon as possible.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend that since these plants are already owned by the Indian Department and are surplus to the requirements of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, they should be forwarded, since I am quite satisfied that although they may not be able to hook up all the equipment they have at present that could be driven by electric motors, they could get along very well with them for the present and they will be quite sufficient for all lighting requirements.\n\nThese two plants will develop approximately 9 kilowatts providing that they are 110 volts, and if they were using the two plants it would be possible, when one is in need of an overhaul, to get along with the other. At present, the school is using an outfit that is only about 2 kilowatt capacity, used exclusively for lighting purposes.\n\nWm.

Having been called out to the Chilcotin, I could not accompany Mr. McArthur on his inspection, but following his report, I paid a visit to the School some days later, and paid particular attention to the matters on which complaint was made and had the fire alarm sounded.\n\nThe children were very orderly in getting out of the buildings and were all out in under one minute. Fr. McGrath had already taken the locks off all the escape doors, the subject of a very legitimate complaint by Inspector McArthur. It is felt, however, that Mr. McArthur has exaggerated regarding the condition of the boys' dormitory, which has been painted up and is very considerably improved since last year. The improvements in this school since it opened last September have been very considerable, and are as follows:\n\nEquipment: Laundry equipment, consisting of power washer and extractor, saving much time for the girls and improving hygienic conditions.\n\nVocational: Manual Training classes have been organized. Also Calf Club and Potato Club.\n\nRecreational: The Pro-Rec. program has been continued. Three Skating rinks were maintained during the past winter, two for the boys and one for the girls. Hockey games were organized and matches played with boys from the Williams Lake white school.\n\nA boys' pipe and drum band has been organized by Brother MacDonald and is making good progress. Brother MacDonald, who commenced duties as disciplinarian last September, has been a great asset to the school, and there has been only one occasion of truancy since last September. The morale amongst the boys was very low during 1943-44 and a number of boys were expelled in June, so that I consider Brother\n\n(over)\nBrother MacDonald has done a wonderful job considering the bad feeling amongst the boys which had to be overcome.\n\nWm.

Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAs I mentioned to you yesterday, I am just back from an inspection tour of the seven Indian Residential Schools of British Columbia, conducted by the Reverend Oblate Fathers.\n\nWhilst I found all these institutions in fairly good physical condition, the war years have no doubt left their mark and considerable repair, both within and without, has now become essential. The equipment also shows a good deal of wear and some of it must be replaced this year.\n\nFor the purpose of clarity, I think it will be better for me to write you a separate letter for each school.\n\nWilliams Lake School is one of the oldest in B.C. and is church-owned. It may have, for the above reason, been more neglected than government-owned institutions, although I fail to see any justification for this neglect. After all, if the church has seen fit to invest large sums of money in the building of these schools, this latter fact should be an extra reason for receiving special help and consideration from the Department.\n\nThe first and most needed improvement in this institution is a central heating plant which, we believe, would cost in the neighborhood of $20,000.00 and I hereby ask that this amount be provided for in the 1947-48 estimates.\nThe B.C. Electric Power will very likely build a power line along the Cariboo Highway either this Fall or next Spring and if this takes place, as it has already been promised, a sufficient amount should be included in the coming estimates to install its services in the school. We believe that this service will cost around $3,000.00.\n\nThe school is still using ice for refrigeration purposes with the consequent loss of food. With B.C. Electric Power, a frigidaire must be installed and should also be provided for in the coming estimates.\n\nThe above are the principal big items needed for this school, but the following items should also be added to the above list:\n\n1. Hardwood floors in the boys' recreation room and in the dining-room for both boys and girls.\n\n2. A new washing machine sufficient to take care of the needs of the present pupilage, with the increase that will be needed in the immediate future.\n\n3. The sewing machines of the school are all quite old and three new machines are necessary.\n\n4. The library should be increased to the necessary size both in quantity and variety, to answer the needs of the pupils.\n\n5. The present pupilage is 123 but should be increased to 140, as the school population is much larger than the latter number and must be provided for if we do not want the children of the present generation to grow up in ignorance.\n\nThe above is quite a programme of improvements for the one school, but the Department must approve it as by doing so, it will keep in operation an institution which it would cost at least $300,000.00 to replace.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.G.

C.\n\nRev. Father Morris, O. M. I., principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, approached me some time ago regarding the employment of a night-watchman at the School.\n\nThe matter was not taken up with the Department then on account of the fact that there was difficulty in getting a suitable man at the wages offered. The Principal succeeded in getting a man starting December 1, 1946 and I regret that permission from the Department was overlooked. However, the Principal considered that the school should have a night-watchman whether the Department paid or not, to which sentiment I entirely agree.\n\nI consider the services of a night-watchman at this school essential, in view of the fire-hazard present in the old type buildings and poor wiring, at least during the winter months when the furnaces have to be kept going.\n\nApproval of an expenditure of $50.00 per month until April 30, 1947 is requested.\n\nEnclosed is Voucher No. 30 for $50.00, a refund on night-watchman's salary for December, 1946.\n\nWm.

Father Scannell O.M.I.,\n151 Laurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nVery Rev. and Dear Father,\n\nWe were all sorry to hear of Father Birch's illness and we hope he has recovered by now.\n\nIn regard to the electric plant I have not heard anything further from the Indian Agent or the Department. Our position at present in regard to electricity is very unsatisfactory. We are operating a 2 kilowatt, direct current, 110 volt generator driven by a gasoline engine. It is an old rebuilt plant. Since November it has cost us between $4. and $5. a day to run this plant. We use it for lights only and cut our lights down to the very minimum. As you noticed while you were here our lights are very poor. For lights alone we require 3\u00bd kws, but this plant generates only 2 kws, as a result the voltage often drops to 85 or 90. We have no electric appliances or motors. The plant is a great fire hazard, being 110 volts direct current and a gasoline engine which has to be kept running all night. I said it was a rebuilt plant, but apparently the oil seals were not renewed or could not be obtained. As a result the oil has continually been running out of the crank case, much of it runs along the shaft and is splashed around by the fly wheel. I mention this because the floor and wall being saturated with oil add so much more to the fire hazard. If we had a diesel plant the cost of operation would drop to about $0.50 a day. We should have a 5 kw, 110 volt, alternating current plant and should be equipped to charge 32 volt batteries for night lights, this would shorten the daily operation of the engine by about 6 hours.\n\nSo far there is no indication that the B.C. Power Commission intends to supply power to 150 Mile House from Williams Lake.\n\nDiesel Electric Plants are sold here by the Interior Distributors, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nHoping it is possible to obtain a more suitable electric plant in the near future,\n\nI am yours in J. & M.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Phelan,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Welfare Department,\nBooth Building,\nSparks Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI have just returned after being three months in the West, during which time I visited all our B.C. Indian Schools with the exception of Kakawis. Unfortunately an attack of bronchitis prevented me from taking that trip.\n\nI feel that I should draw your attention to the hard struggle that most of these schools are experiencing in order to make ends meet from the financial angle, and I am respectfully asking you to submit\nthis matter to the Department for their very urgent consideration.\n\nWilliams Lake School in particular is in a very bad way. Already there is a large overdraft at the Bank, even though all the salaries on the part of the Fathers and Brothers have been eliminated. With the cost of living mounting to such high proportions it is impossible to finance a school on the present per capita grant. I am not in a position to carry the overdraft that I can see will be on the books by the end of the present school year. It seems to me that, unless some financial assistance is forthcoming to help to meet this crisis, we shall be obliged to close down the school.\n\nThere is another point upon which I beg you to give particular attention, and that is the electric plant now working in Williams Lake school. During the days that I spent there it was practically impossible to read by the light produced. The enclosed letter from the Principal, which has reached me since my return, speaks far more eloquently than I can upon the haunting fear that I had during my stay, namely should fire break out.\n\nDuring my stay in the West I was, shall I say amused, but at the same time annoyed, as I listened to a broadcast put on from the Vancouver Radio Station concerning Indian affairs. The speakers on the broadcast were Chief Michael from Lilloet, Mr. [illegible], President of the Native Brotherhood together with another speaker. There is no doubt\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 5)\nSt. Joseph's Rectory\n(Under the direction of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate)\n151 Laurier Ave. East\n\nOttawa, Ont. 22nd February, 1947.\n\nthat such broadcasts are doing considerable harm to the reputation of the Indian Department, because there seems to be no one authorized to reply to the very false charges made over the air. Perhaps I am going too far in suggesting that the Department should ask for a copy of the script of the Broadcast that was put over from Vancouver some weeks ago. I immediately called Father O'Grady's attention to it and suggested that he should get in touch with the Commissioner. One of the statements made in that broadcast, and naturally believed, because not contradicted, was that the Indian schools did not teach the Indian child anything beyond the third and fourth grade.\n\nWith my kind regards,\n\nBelieve me, dear Mr. Phelan,\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Scannell O.M.I.,\nPROVINCIAL.\n\nOVER:-\nP.S. I enclose a summary of the Broadcast as taken down by Rev. Father Forbes during the Broadcast discussion.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, we are including an amount of $5,000 for urgent requirements at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nRecently we received a letter from the principal intimating that their electric plant is very unsatisfactory and requesting that we purchase a diesel alternating current plant.\n\nThe principal is being advised that he should communicate with you and on receipt of specific information regarding the type of equipment he requires please obtain prices from different firms in British Columbia and forward these for our consideration.\n\nIn his letter the principal states the diesel electric plants are sold by the Interior Distributors, Kamloops, B.C. Possibly there are other firms.\n\nBernard E. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1947.\n\nDear Father Scannell:-\n\nI regret overlooking your letter of February 22nd with reference to the Cariboo Residential School. In the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 we have included an amount of $5,000. for repairs at the Cariboo School and this can be used for the purchase of the diesel electric plant mentioned by the principal in his letter to you of February 15th.\n\nI suggest that the principal communicate with Indian Commissioner MacKay, giving him full particulars regarding the size and type of machine required. We will send an official letter to Major MacKay, asking him to obtain prices. Purchase will eventually be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.

I am enclosing for your information a copy of Mr. C. F. Webb's letter of August 18th and quotations from the following listed firms:\n\n(1) Vivien Engine Works Ltd., - 18 kw. $4,257.00\nA letter dated September 12th from the Company amending their original delivery date on this model to eight weeks and advising of a net reduction of $150.00 in their quotation if a complete steel sub-base is not required is also enclosed.\n\n(2) Finning Tractor & Equipment Co. Ltd.\nModel D4400, 20 kw. $4,760.00\nDelivery 5 to 6 months\nOne used D-4400 Caterpillar diesel electric set 20 kw. $3,845.00\nI am of the opinion that we should not consider purchase of a secondhand plant.\n\n(3) Lipsett Engine and Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nSheppard diesel generating set. The Company quotes on a 15 kw model and an 18 kw model, but in view of the known electrical energy requirements at the school it is not considered that we should secure a model of less than 18 kws.\n18 kw model... $3,393.00\nDelivery three weeks after receipt of order\nIt should be noted that although earliest delivery is obtainable on the Sheppard diesel plant, this plant is manufactured in the United States and comparatively little is known with regard to its operating efficiency whereas the Vivian outfit is manufactured in Vancouver and units manufactured by this Company are giving satisfactory service in this and other Departments. I have been endeavouring to secure information regarding the Sheppard diesel electric units and have recently written to the Marine Division of the Department of Transport, Victoria, who have a Sheppard unit located at Bull Harbour. I also arranged for inspection of Sheppard diesel electric sets and parts located at the Lipsett Engine and Manufacturing Company, Vancouver, by an official of the Service Department, Civil Aviation Division, Dept. of Transport, Mr. Dennis' letter of September 15th in this connection being enclosed.\n\nPrior to receipt of Mr. Phelan's telegram above referred to consideration had not been given to securing tenders covering installation of the generating unit, but I am of the opinion that it would be inadvisable to permit the school staff to make the installation and consequently have contacted Vivian Engine Works and the Lipsett Engine Manufacturing Company to ascertain if they would be prepared to tender on the installation and have also contacted Mr. Indian Agent Christie by wire asking if there is anyone competent and available locally to do the work and if so would he estimate the cost. I will communicate with you further on receipt of this information and the views of the Marine Division of the Department of Transport with respect to the Sheppard Diesel Electric sets.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIRMAIL:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe - Lighting Plant - Cariboo Residential School -\n\nFurther to my letter of September 20th, I am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter dated September 20th from the Radio Branch, Department of Transport, in connection with their Sheppard Diesel Generating Unit at Bull Harbor. The views expressed by Mr. Bowerman indicate to me that it would be advisable to enquire further with respect to the operating efficiency of Sheppard Diesel Electrical Generating Units, and I have consequently directed an enquiry to Nelson Brothers as suggested by Mr. Bowerman and will communicate with you further on receipt of their reply.\n\nI may say I have yet to receive quotations covering cost of installing the new plants at the school.\n\nD.

MacKey,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nP.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 17th requesting information on our Sheppard Diesel unit now operating at our Bull Harbour Radio Station, we are rather hesitant to offer any definite opinions one way or the other due to the fact that this unit has only been recently installed. We are rather perturbed over your statement concerning the design of the lubricating and fuel injection systems. In this regard we can only state that so far no troubles have been encountered whatever with our unit.\n\nShould there be no immediate need for purchasing your unit we would suggest that you defer your decision for approximately two weeks when we will be able to give you a detailed operating report of this unit covering approximately one month's operation.\n\nOur determining factor in choosing a Sheppard was the fact that they are of simple design; compact, easily transported, low fuel consumption and absolutely reliable and rugged from all reports we could obtain up to the time of purchase. During a short test run in our shop prior to installation this engine proved equal to all our requirements. The voltage regulation is extremely good. Repairs can be made by relatively untrained personnel and the engine maintained without undue technical knowledge being required.\n\nReference caterpillars, we have one installed, a 15 HP, at our Estevan station which has given us very reliable service. This is a proven design and consequently a safe\npurchase. We have no real fault to find with this engine other than they do require a technical man to maintain. Over and above the diesel end you have also a gasoline engine which adds to the problem of storing gasoline etc. which our Department is attempting to eliminate entirely due to the hazards connected with this fuel.\n\nOur Vivian Diesel is an old engine and has been in service for 15 years or more. During that time it has been quite reliable. There is one weakness, however, in this unit in that the intermediate and main bearings require renewing at least every 12 months or sooner. The manufacturers claim that this is quite normal and cannot recommend anything to rectify this trouble.\n\nFor further information on the Sheppard we would suggest you write to the Nelson Bros. Fish Packers, c/o the Mechanical Superintendent. This firm has a number of Sheppards in use of all sizes. I am sure they could give you a much better report than we can at this time. However should you care to receive a copy of the operating report we are compiling we would be only too pleased to send you a copy.\n\nKindly advise us further on this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"W. J. Bowerman\"\n\n(W. J. Bowerman)\nDist. Sup't Radio\nD. M. MacKey, Esq., Indian Commissioner, O.P. Box 70, Vancouver\n\nRe: Cariboo Indian Residential School\nWilliams Lake Agency\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of August 2 re power plant for the above school. The most satisfactory layout would undoubtedly be two units so that they can be operated alternately to handle ordinary load and together to handle peak load. However, the question of synchronizing them may be difficult with untrained operators. Therefore, one unit only is recommended.\n\nEither of the units quoted would be satisfactory as while total load is 20 KW it is unlikely that full load would be on at any time, and probably peak would not exceed 10 KW except for short periods. While 15 KW would meet normal requirements for some time, it would appear advisable to install a slightly larger unit to meet possible increases in use of electrical energy.\n\nEither one of the units mentioned by you would give satisfactory service as would the other units on which quotations have been obtained.\n\nThe quotations available for A.C.

Installation costs in this case amount to only $50.00, covering the mechanic's travelling expenses, time etc., as the plant is a complete unit of the self-contained type complete in every detail and it is only necessary to make electrical connections to the switchboard.\n\nI trust the Department will now be in a position to place an order at an early date as the Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 5)\nOctober 10th, 1947.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI sent my Nightletter yesterday to you or Mr. Phalen, not knowing whether or not you were back in Ottawa. Before I left the Capital, you were out of the city. By the time this letter is in your hands, you will have given your kind attention to the matter of the new electric plant at the Indian School at Williams Lake, of this I feel confident. There is no need for me to picture the many, deplorable consequences of a school without electric light or power. In his wire to me, Fr. Morris said that he had no word of the new plant whatsoever and that he would have to close the school unless one was supplied immediately. The closing of the school would be a calamity that must be avoided at all costs. I am sure we all agree on that. If I am not mistaken, I mentioned the question of the new electric plant and also the water problem to Mr. Phalen, in your absence, some three weeks ago. I feel certain that Mr. Phalen took whatever action he could at once. I have the impression that the new plant was promised some few weeks ago, or longer; is the delay due to lack of this equipment, or some other similar factor over which one has no control? At any rate, I leave the matter in your capable hands, fully confident that you will leave no stone unturned in your willing effort to remedy the deplorable situation that has arisen at Williams Lake Residential school.\n\nAt Fort St. John, Bishop Jordan and I had the pleasure of a long conference with the Indian Agent. By this time, you have most probably heard from him. He wishes to erect an Indian Day School at Moberly Lake and to have it in operation by next Fall. He will give you the details. Bishop Jordan and I are very willing and anxious to further the plan and, one of the great difficulties being the supply of a teacher, we have promised one of our Fathers for the task. As a result of our visit to the district, Father Jungbluth the Indian missionary, formerly residing at Fort St. John, will take up his residence at Moberly Lake next month. The erection of a school and the appointment of a teacher will be a great step forward in our common attempt to further improve the status and condition of the Indians in that district. My purpose in mentioning this matter is to endorse the Agent's plan and to confirm what he undoubtedly will tell you of our willing cooperation with him in executing it. We trust that it will be favourably received by you.\n\nI fly to Fort McLeod tomorrow then I will visit Vanderhoof, Lejac etc. and I expect to reach Prince Rupert in about ten days where you may address me c/o The Bishop's House.\n\nWith every good wish, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph R.

The question of improvements to the wiring has been discussed with the Rev. Principal who is of the opinion that if changes were made to the circuit distribution panel and so to the outside wiring and if the girls' and boys' dormitories were rewired in exposed conduit the installation would meet minimum safety requirements for the time being.\n\nAlthough I have asked Mr. Indian agent Christie to contact local electricians with a view to securing an estimate of the cost and firm bids, it is altogether likely that there may be no one in the vicinity or Williams Lake sufficiently competent and reliable to undertake the work in which case we will have to arrange with an electrical contractor in Vancouver to make a survey and submit an estimate.\n\nThe construction of the Cariboo Residential School buildings is such that they constitute a fire hazard without any added risk from faulty wiring which leads me to believe that it would be advisable to have the wiring done by a reputable firm. It is difficult to estimate the cost without a survey but it is thought that the balance of the $5,000 appropriated for this school should be sufficient.\n\n(Signed) D.M.

C.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a requisition in duplicate for furnishings and equipment for the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would direct your attention to my letter of September 15th accompanying another requisition which included a washing machine still required. None of the equipment requisitioned for in September has yet been authorized according to our files.\n\nNo doubt the Department finds it difficult to authorize these expenditures on account of the fact that this is a Church owned school.\n\nThe fact remains however, that the Church is apparently unable to finance these necessary articles of equipment the lack of which seriously impairs the general cleanliness and efficiency of this school. Special consideration should also be given the purchase of equipment which can be used in a new school which will have to be built by the Department in the near future.\n\nWm.

We have already expended an amount of $3,603.65 for the purchase of a lighting plant. The Indian Commissioner has been authorized to expend the balance of $1,396.35 either in repairing the electric wiring or making other urgent repairs at this school.\n\nWhen our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 is available, we will communicate again with the Indian Commissioner regarding the Cariboo School.\n\nWith regard to increased operating expenses, we are only too well aware of the need for a higher per capita grant for all these schools. Representatives from the various denominations concerned met our Minister in late November and presented a strong plea for a higher rate of earning per pupil. It is understood that a request for the granting of higher per capita fees is now before the Treasury Board and that an announcement can shortly be expected with regard to these proposals.\n\nIt may interest you to know that the per capita grant rate at the various residential schools is set at a\n\nThe Honourable Gray Turgeon,\nThe Senate,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nfigure based on the cost of operation as shown by our Auditors' figures. However, I have carefully noted the request of the Reverend Father Morris for a higher per capita grant and will endeavour to see that a satisfactory adjustment is made, if and when we receive a favourable decision from the Treasury Board.\n\nI will be pleased to advise you further when we receive information in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFebruary 16th, 1948.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nReverend Father J.A. Morris, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at\n150 Mile House, B.C., has written me with reference to the very\nbad financial condition of this school at the present moment.\nSo that you will have the particulars set out by Father Morris,\nI quote from his letter as follows:-\n\n\"In view of the increasing financial difficulties\nin our work of Indian education at this school I find it\nnecessary to solicit your help. Our work here in the\nCariboo should be of interest to the present government,\nbecause to a great extent our interests are its interests\nalso. In addition to this school, there is now a community\nat Williams Lake and one at Anaham, both devoted to\neducation.\n\n\"We are in great need of financial assistance right\nnow. The cost of living has gone up 45% and the Indian\nAffairs Branch increased the per Capita Grant by only\n17% last year. We need, for this school, an additional\n25% increase and should be retroactive to October 1st, 1947,\nbecause we have not been able to meet many of our\nobligations since then.\n\n\"Compared with other schools our basic per Capita\ngrant rate is not sufficient. This is not my opinion\nalone, but also that of Major Davey, school Inspector\nfor the Indian Schools of British Columbia. Our basic\nper Capita Grant rate is $170.00, which is the same as\nthe schools on the coast and in the Vancouver area are\ngetting. Then including the special and emergency grants\n\n...........\nColonel B.F. Neary\n\nFebruary 16, 1948.\n\n\"Our rate is $215.00, which is less than some of the schools on Vancouver Island and the coast are getting. Rather than getting less we should be getting more than the schools in those areas are getting, because:\n\n1. Our food bill is almost double what theirs is. This principally on account of the rigor of the climate.\n\n2. Our clothing bill is more than double that of the schools on the coast. Because of the climate more and warmer clothing is needed and because of the fact that the parents supply so little, while on the coast the parents supply a large percentage of their children's clothing.\n\n3. Our freight and transportation in the Cariboo is much higher than elsewhere; e.g., coal is $5.00 or more a ton here than along the C.P.R. or C.N.R. lines or at the coast; oil is 8 or 9 cents more a gallon here than it is at such remote parts of Vancouver Island as Kakawis; bread is at least 4 cents a loaf more here than it is in Vancouver.\n\n\"Our buildings are very old and this is another cause of great expense. There are continual and innumerable repairs needed, the buildings are very cold, which all adds up to more expenses in maintenance, repairs and fuel. We need new buildings, which we hope will not be too long delayed. But we need financial assistance immediately.\n\n\"Until this year we were able to make up the deficit of the School from the revenue of the ranch, which is owned by the Oblate Fathers, but this year we cannot meet our obligation even with this help. The drain on the ranch has been so great that it too is now operating on an over-draft.\"\n\nI know that this matter will receive your serious consideration, and I shall appreciate anything you may be able to do to help.\n\nWith best personal regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70, Vancouver.\n\nRe: Cariboo Indian Residential School\n\nThis is a church-owned school and in the current year's appropriation we provided an amount of $5,000 for repairs and improvements to the above mentioned school. An amount of $3,603.65 was expended for the purchase of a lighting plant and in our telegram of December 20th to Major MacKay we advised him that the balance, namely $1,396.35 could be expended for electric wiring which is apparently necessary.\n\nWe have a letter from Very Rev. J.R. Birch, O.M.I., Provincial of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The Cariboo Indian Residential School is still without electric lights, nothing having been done regarding the wiring. There have been many electricians and estimates, but most of them want to do a completely new job of everything, which would run into thousands of dollars. The last individual to give an estimate was from Hume N. Rumble of Vancouver. He said that he would change only what was absolutely necessary to safety, without following the B.C. code. His estimate was $5,000. There is only $1,200 remaining of the special grant to do the work. Therefore, that offer could not be accepted, and now the Principal is endeavouring to find an electrician who will do only what is necessary to get the plant running. He is certainly doing his utmost to try to have the present wiring made safe, without spending more than the amount of money that remains of the grant made for that purpose.\"\nNo doubt your office has been in touch with the principal, Reverend Father Morris in connection with the matter, but we would appreciate it if you could communicate with him again with a view to ascertaining if there is anything you can do to assist him in securing someone to do the necessary electric wiring for the amount available in the current year's appropriation.\n\nIf you find that you cannot have the electric wiring done you may expend an amount of approximately $600. for the erection of a new chimney and other urgent repairs at this school.\n\nHowever, if you are successful in arranging for the electric wiring which will involve an expenditure of the amount available in the current year's appropriation, you may arrange for the repairs and new chimneys after April 1st at an approximate cost of $600.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 16, 1948.\n\nDear Father Birch:\n\nYour letter of the 12th instant with reference to the Cariboo Residential School has been brought to my attention. In the case of church-owned schools, present regulations require that we can only expend the amount actually provided in our appropriation for any one school.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we provided an amount of $5,000. for the Cariboo Residential School and a lighting plant was purchased in October last at a cost of $3,603.65. This left a balance of $1,396.35 which we could expend at the Cariboo School during the current fiscal year.\n\nFormer Indian Commissioner MacKay was informed to that effect on December 20, 1947 and presumably Reverend Father Morris has been acting on the authority received from Major MacKay in endeavouring to secure someone to do the necessary electric work.\n\nI am writing today to the present Indian Commissioner, Mr. Arneil, requesting him to co-operate with the Reverend Principal in endeavouring to secure some firm to do the wiring, at least to the extent which funds are available. If this is not possible, Mr. Arneil will be authorized to expend an amount of $600. for the repairs and new chimneys mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter. If the amount is expended for wiring, Mr. Arneil will be advised that the repairs and new chimneys will receive attention immediately after April 1st so that the cost may be charged to our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nVery Rev. J.R. Birch, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\nMissionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate,\n151 Laurier Ave., E.,\nOttawa.\n\nPP/MGD\nFebruary 12th, 1948.\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Cariboo Indian Residential School\nRepairs to Chimneys\nElectric Lighting\n\nAttached please find report of A. Fairbairn, S/Sergt.,\nCariboo District Fire Marshal, on the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to ask if it is not possible to obtain some financial help from the Department to defray the cost of these repairs and new chimneys. The contractor's estimate was $600.00. If my request is favourable received, will you please instruct me as to what procedure to follow.\n\nReverend J.A. Morris, the Principal, informs me that his entire list of requisitions for 1948, was rejected last week, on the grounds that when the wiring is done at the School there will have been spent all that a Church-owned school is allowed in one year, i.e., $500.00. Father Morris informs me that the same thing happened last year. His list of requisitions was held in the office at Vancouver, and did not get to Ottawa for the same reason.\n\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School is still without electric lights, nothing having been done regarding the wiring. There have been many electricians and estimates, but most of them want to do a completely new job of everything, which would run into thousands of dollars. The last individual to give an estimate was from Hume N. Rumble of Vancouver. He said that he would change only what was absolutely necessary safety, without following the B.C. code. His estimate was $5,000.00; there is only $1,200.00 remaining of the special grant to do the work.

He is certainly doing his utmost to try to have the present wiring made safe, without spending more than the amount of money that remains of the grant made for that purpose.\n\nI am, dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph R.

This chimney double flue, with one ash pit therfor a partition, to make each unit separate should be installed as a safety measure and to avoid downdraft. Should it be decided to discontinue the use of this chimney it should be closed with bricks or taken down.\n\nI recommended a new chimney for the furnace be installed with a flue area of not less than 56 square inches and to be constructed in accordance with Section 6 of the Regulations, governing the constructions of chimneys.\n\nLaundry:\nAn airvent partition thimble is required to take stovepipe through partition.\n\nKitchen:\nTo erect a new double chimney for use of Kitchen range, Furnace and bake oven.\n\nSisters House:\nThe three furnaces to be repaired generally; New heavy gauge intake thimbles required for all furnaces and installed at least 18 inches from ceiling, strap hangers to replace any wire used to hold heavy metal pipe between furnace and chimneys.\n\nContinued: -2-\nContinued:\n\nSisters House (continued).\nChimneys to be plastered in basement and 1st floor.\nChimneys to be air vented and flashed with the usual fire stops in accordance with regulations.\nAll chimneys to be topped with three courses of bricks laid in cement mortar.\n\nElectric Lighting Wiring:\nThe wiring generally throughout the buildings inspected and requires replacement but I understand you are having that matter given attention.\n\nI am not issuing a time order to have the necessary work completed, believing that you fully realize the necessity of all fire hazards herein mentioned.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you as to what is going to be done in this connection and I am at your service at any time if I can be of any help.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

I may say submission of these vouchers has been held in abeyance pending receipt of confirmation from Mr. Indian Agent Christie that the plant was installed and operating satisfactorily, which confirmation was received today by wire.\n\nI am also enclosing a letter dated April 9th from Lipsett Engine and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., from which you will note that the Department of National Revenue have refused to recognize the installation as for farm lighting use and consequently the lighting unit is subject to 25% duty, amounting to $510. The Company's quotation of August 13th, 1947, on which our order was based, quotes a net price for farm lighting service exclusive of sales tax and all other charges and under the circumstances it would appear that unless we can satisfy the Department of National Revenue that the equipment is used exclusively for farm lighting, the Company could reasonably expect reimbursement of the duty paid.

This school is owned and operated by the Dominion Government on behalf of the Indians of British Columbia. It is a Vocational School and its chief purpose is to train young Indian boys to engage in farm work. There are 5,000 acres in all in the property, including bush, pasture, and arable land.\n\nThe Vancouver Customs Office has ruled that this equipment cannot be imported duty free. However, it is our belief that since this equipment is for educational use that duty and sales tax are not applicable under Tariff Item 696. The engine was imported under Entry Number 10816A on June 22nd 1946, Port of Vancouver, and the generator under Entry Number 4003GA on Nov. 14th 1947, Port of Vancouver.\n\nIn view of the above will you kindly arrange with the Vancouver Office to cancel any charges for duty and sales tax on this engine and generator forming part of electric power and light plant, as per our purchase order No. 23523.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nDepartment of National Revenue,\nCustoms and Excise Division,\nConnaught Bldg., Ottawa.\nAttention Mr. Jean.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE\n\nOttawa May 7, 1948.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nGeneral Administrative Offices,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSubject: Tariff status of an Electric Power and Lighting Unit\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAttention: W. M. Vincent, Esq.,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, respecting the tariff status of an electric power and lighting unit, consisting of a diesel engine and generator, which was purchased from Lipsett Engine and Manufacturing Co. Limited, Vancouver, and cleared through Customs under Vancouver Entries Nos. 10316-A, June 22, 1946, and 40060-A, November 14, 1947. You contend that as the equipment is for the use of the Cariboo Indian Residential School at Williams Lake, B.C., same should be admitted free of duty and exempt from Sales Tax under Tariff Item 696.\n\nIn reply, I may advise you that, from information before the Department, the Model 6D Sheppard Diesel Engine, being mechanical equipment of a class or kind not made in Canada, is admissible free of duty under Tariff Item 696, when for the use and by order of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, Williams Lake, B.C., and not for sale.\n\nThe 15 K.W. Generator is, however, of a class or kind made in Canada and is not entitled to duty free entry under Tariff Item 696, but is dutiable under Tariff Item 445f at 25% ad valorem, under the Canada-United States Trade Agreement as in effect at the time of importation, notwithstanding the fact that it is for the use of an educational institution.\n\nArticles qualifying for entry under Tariff Item 696 are exempt from the Consumption or Sales Tax. Otherwise, this tax of 5% levied on the duty paid value is applicable.\nThe Collector of Customs and Excise at Vancouver has been supplied with a copy of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.R. Younger\n\nfor Deputy Minister National Revenue Customs Excise.\n(Your P.O. 23523 and letter of May 10, 1948)\n\nDuty on Model 6D Sheppard Diesel Engine for Cariboo Indian Residential School, Williams Lake, B.C.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe Account of Lipsett Engine and Manufacturing Co.\n\nIn official letter of April 30th, we explained the manner in which we handled your voucher No. 160.\n\nThe total payment requested on this voucher was $454.70. This included an amount of $80.40 for freight. If you refer to purchase order 22523 you will note it read f.o.b. Williams Lake and consequently the $80.40 was deducted from the account leaving the balance due $374.30. Of the above amount we have already paid $307.00 which leaves a net balance to the firm of $67.30. This amount is being sent to the Firm following receipt of your voucher No. 165.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Account - Lipsett Engine and Manufacturing Company - your file 160-0-5 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of May 27th, although Purchase Order No. 22523 reads f.o.b. Williams Lake, the Company's quotation was f.o.b. their plant, Vancouver, B.C. Will you please advise if payment of prepaid freight in the amount of $80.40 will be paid to the Company.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 3, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Purchase Order 23523\n\nThe above covered a generating set for the Cariboo Indian Residential School. The purchase order reads f.o.b. Williams Lake, B.C., but we are advised by Indian Commissioner Arnell that the Lipsett Engine and Manufacturing Company claim that their quotation was f.o.b. Vancouver, and as a result, they are requesting us to pay an amount of $80.40 for freight. Please advise in this matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nJune 8, 1948.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nCariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have had many representations concerning the need for replacing the above Residential School with a new plant.\n\nDue to our large residential school requirements elsewhere, we have not been able to include a sum in our estimates for the building of a new residential school. You are, of course, aware of the loss by fire during the war of several residential schools, and naturally these replacements have a priority over the Cariboo Residential School.\n\nHowever, we are aware, from reports received, that a major need at this school is for a new heating system. It has been suggested that a possible solution to this problem would be to take the following steps:\n\n(a) Erect a heating plant in a separate unit, which would handle the present school and which would form the first part of the new residential school.\n\n(b) Erect a new residential school, unit by unit, in the years to come.\n\nThe new residential school which we are building at Teslin, Y.T., will be of frame construction and will consist\nof the following units:\n\n(1) Administration building.\n(2) Girls' Dormitory building.\n(3) Boys' Dormitory building\n(4) Classroom block\n(5) Power house unit.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have your ideas as to the feasibility of the above suggestion. If you consider the above plan to be workable, we will then approach the Lands and Development Services Branch and request that they prepare the drawings and specifications for such a power unit at the Cariboo Residential School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIn the Murphy Diesel a simple, self-contained unit injector for each cylinder replaces the fuel pump and the complicated maze of high pressure lines found in the ordinary diesel fuel system. Eliminating these lines puts an end to such troubles as surging, erratic and irregular injection and after dribbling. No priming is necessary and the injector cannot become air bound.\n\nThe combination of a short direct drive with the Murphy Unit Injector provides smooth, precisely controlled injection. This is one of the reasons why Murphy Diesels deliver more power with less fuel, why they run smoother, give more dependable service and start instantaneously even in the coldest weather.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Cariboo Residential School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of June 8th (file 160-0-5), the problem of our educational facilities at Williams Lake has been carefully considered and discussed with District School Inspector Davey and although Supt. Christie, in a recent letter, mentions that the matter has been the subject of discussion with Father Morris who feels that a central heating system would not be feasible in view of the distance the present buildings are apart, it is thought that neither Mr. Christie nor Father Morris are aware that the proposed heating plant is the first of several units to be built with a view to eventually replacing the entire school setup.\n\nEven though the proposed heating plant cannot be used for the present buildings it should, I believe, be the first unit erected and I would recommend that the Lands and Development Services Branch be approached with a view to having the necessary plans and specifications prepared.\n\n-W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to the attached requisition for equipment for the Cariboo Residential School, I note from our files that the only provision made this year is $12,000 for general repairs and extensive alterations to the heating system, in view of which there would appear to be no object in obtaining quotations on the equipment requested unless the Department can make further funds available.\n\nW.

Under average conditions a Hobart Peeler will reduce the peeling loss by 12 to 14% or more.\n\nWith proper management it is possible to economically use smaller potatoes which usually cost less than the larger sizes.\n\nHobart Peelers are designed to peel potatoes and other root vegetables with minimum peeling loss, and are ruggedly constructed to insure continuous and satisfactory performance under the most severe use.\n\nThe Model 6015 is built to the same exacting standards established for the entire line of Hobart Peelers.

These model 12, 15 and 20 quart mixers take valuable bench space which can be used to much better advantage than just as a place to put the mixer. The auxiliary drive on these Mixers is conveniently located on the front of the machine for operating the numerous attachments illustrated in this folder.\n\nALSO AVAILABLE AS BENCH MODEL OR WITH A MODERN BLAKESLEE-BUILT CABINET STAND\n\nFor bench installations the Blakeslee-Built cabinet is definitely preferred to utilizing existing bench space since bench space is already generally at a premium and since many benches are not built to hold the weight and movement required by a mixer. Blakeslee-Built cabinet stands are available in sturdy galvanized painted or stainless steel construction and are especially designed and built for use with a mixer. Storage space for beaters, whips and auxiliary attachments is provided.\n\nRussell Food Equipment Ltd.\n\"Everything for the Modern Kitchen\"\n871 HOMER STREET - VANCOUVER, B.C.\nSPEED UP COUNTLESS KITCHEN JOBS WITH THESE\n\nBEATERS and WHIPS\n\nfor BLAKESLEE-BUILT Vertical Mixers\n\nBLAKESLEE MIXING MACHINES have a complete series of Attachments, Beaters and Whips especially designed and built to Blakeslee Standards of construction. Each attachment is the result of painstaking tests and thorough experiments. Each attachment for a Blakeslee Mixer will pay big dividends in the production and quality of the finished product.\n\n\"PK\" PASTRY KNIFE used for curling sugar and shortening together (in pie doughs, pastry shells, etc.) Available for use with 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 and 80 qt. bowls.\n\n\"L\" LATTICE BEATER designed specially for mashing potatoes, vegetables and fruits and for spongecake batches.

Batter beater should be used for dough mixing. \"H\" or \"SH\" dough hooks should be used for dough mixing.

Available for use with 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 and 80 qt. bowls.\n\nBrush and roller beaters for use with soup strainer and colander. See inside page for illustrations.\n\nSEE FOLLOWING PAGES FOR ATTACHMENTS AND ACCESSORIES\nThe Blakeslee-Built Model C20 Mixer is regularly supplied in a floor model which is definitely preferred to a bench model since valuable counter space is saved and since heavy beaters are not built up without the weight and mechanical action of a Mixer. When desired, the Blakeslee-Built Model C20 Mixer is also available in a bench model for installation on an existing bench, or preferably for installation on a Blakeslee-Built steel painted or stainless steel cabinet stand especially designed and built for use with a Mixer which also provides space for storing beaters, whips and auxiliary attachments.\n\n**Design and Construction**\n\nFloor type with variable speed drive, planetary action and speeds developed between 110 RPM and 540 RPM, with planetary action and single lever control. Mixing speeds rapidly increased or decreased by means of a conveniently located hand wheel. No clutch to operate or gears to shift. Beaters and whips are continually in motion as speeds are changed, eliminating wash and start strain, as well as stopping of materials being mixed. Column constructed of 10 gauge steel all welded construction.\n\n**Gear Box for Planetary Action**\n\nFirst speed reduction by worm and gear, insuring quiet operation at all speeds. Ball bearings used where advisable with oil impregnated Oliver bronze bearings at other points.\n\nOil is drawn into the planetary gear box and takes its oil supply from the lowest point of the lower gear box. This point is below the oil seals at the beater shaft so that no oil can possibly leak out around the beater shaft. Oil is pumped up under pressures through the bearings and circulates in a continuous manner over the gears effectively providing an oil film between all moving parts, eliminating any need for hand lubrication with its attendant neglect. Gear box need only have its oil sump kept full of oil, the oil pump taking care of its circulation.\n\n**Beater Lock and Bowl Raising Mechanism**\n\nBeater lock designed and built so that all surfaces are open and easily cleaned; Bowl raised and lowered by conveniently located hand lever and is self locking in up or down position. Mixing bowl raised and lowered by lever and drag link located within the column preventing contamination from the mix which greatly simplifies cleaning.\n\n**Motor and Switch**\n\n13 HP General Electric, Westinghouse, Continuous equal, grease packed, ball bearing motor. Approval number which mounted on side of Mixer convenient to operator.\n\nWeight\n\n20 quart Mixer, net weight 290 lbs.; Domestic shipping weight 405 lbs.; Export shipping weight 520 lbs.; Export Dimensions, approximately 28\" wide by 54\" long by 45\" high.\n\n**STANDARD EQUIPMENT**\n\nConsisting of 20 qt. heavy tinned bowl.

CHOSE).\n\nEAC/dem SALES DEPARTMENT.\nROYAL STEEL RANGES\n\nThese ranges are very popular in logging, mining, and fishing industries, also institutions and restaurants where a portable unit is required. Many of these ranges have been in use for over twenty-five years and are still performing satisfactorily. Their popularity has been built through the experience of chefs who have operated them. Their dependability in every respect tends to produce results. The Royal Steel Range has proven its worth to such an extent that it is probably the most highly rated range on the market today. A Good Chef is essential for preparing good food, but a good chef requires a good cooking unit. Why not have both? \"Buy a Royal!\"\n\nROYAL STEEL RANGE\nMODEL RO-3L\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nTop cooking surface is large and made in fewer sections than most other ranges. The top plates which are gray iron castings, range from 1-1/2\" over the firebox to 1-1/4\" in thickness at the grille section. End sections of the range are used for frying or grille work with adequate grease troughs provided. The front rail protects the grease trough from damage and the operator from burns.\n\nThe flues are arranged to maintain an even distribution of heat under the cooking surface and around the ovens. The flue box at the end of range assists in the even distribution of heat on the bottom of the ovens. (This can be secured in the back as is standard in our Regal Ranges, if the installation will not lend itself to the end flue.) The body of the range is made of extra heavy wrought iron and insulated with asbestos board and felt. This gives better insulation without adding weight or decreasing cooking area. The legs are made of 14 gauge steel bars (12 gauge wrought steel tops and bottoms) rigidly re-inforced with cast iron braces and top cast baffles. The top over the firebox has a special halfmoon casting, easily replaceable, which takes the brunt of excessive heat to which a range is sometimes subjected.\n\nThe firebox is in balance with the size of the range, and when a water coil is required, furnishes an ample supply of hot water.\n\nThis range can be supplied in two, three, and four oven sizes, with either right or left hand firebox.\n\n(See Over for Sizes and Dimensions)\n\nPage 3\nROYAL STEEL RANGES\n\nWherever fuel such as sawdust, oil, or coal is to be used, it is advisable to have the range fabricated to suit. Ranges can be supplied complete with sawdust burner, oil burner, or coal stoker. In these instances, we construct the firebox in such a manner as to give the maximum of efficiency with regard to the fuel being used. The advantage to the customer is that the firing unit being supplied is in proper proportion to the size of the range and eliminates the possibility of having an expensive and improper installation made on location. Our craftsmen have had years of experience in range problems and can make recommendations with regard to any unusual range condition you might have.\n\nROYAL STEEL RANGE\nMODEL RO-2L\n\nSIZES AND DIMENSIONS\n\n| Model RO-2 | Model RO-3 | Model RO-4 |\n|------------|------------|------------|\n| Top Size   | 40\" x 88\"  | 40\" x 117\" | 40\" x 145\" |\n| Cooking Surface | 30\" x 88\" | 30\" x 117\" | 30\" x 145\" |\n| Height to Surface | 34\" | 34\" | 34\" |\n| Fire Box   | 12\" x 22\" x 11\" | 13\" x 22\" x 11\" | 14\" x 22\" x 11\" |\n| Smoke Collars | 12\" | 12\" | 12\" |\n| Ovens      | 24\" W x 26\" D x 16\" H | 24\" W x 26\" D x 16\" H | 24\" W x 26\" D x 16\" H |\n| Shipping Weight | 1900 Lbs | 2300 Lbs | 2700 Lbs |\n\nWhen ordering, please specify type of fuel to be used, also whether right or left hand firebox, with or without coil.\nCoast Commercial Ranges are really built with the most desirable features for practical commercial use.

There are literally hundreds of these fine ranges travelling the seven seas. Frequent inspections have convinced us of the durability and satisfactory service built into them. Hotels, restaurants, mines and logging camps throughout Western Canada are using these ranges with all reporting complete satisfaction. COMMERCIAL RANGES are built for very long \"trouble-free\" life.\n\nPlease Note\nWestern soft coal and wood burn hotter and are more volatile than Eastern hard fuels. Require, for efficiency, wide shallow fire boxes. Commercial installations are designed to consume your available fuel to your advantage.\n\nHere is an Advantage!\n\nThis \"exploded\" top describes the large French frying top, completely serviced with all around grease trough, large unbroken surface gives even temperature all over. The segmented hot spot top is usual location for boiling purposes. After years of service when hot spot begins to bulge, the new section can be simply dropped into place without labour or inconvenience and at very little cost. Check the weight of this top, the unusual amount of insulation, the design of the top, the removable grease trough and general smart appearance, the ease of keeping this range clean, and we know you will buy Coast COMMERCIAL RANGES.\nAlcan Heavy Duty Ranges\n\n| No   | Top    | Body   | No. of Ovens | Oven Size     | Weight | Backshelf |\n|------|--------|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| 1-24 | 32x46  | 23x42  | 1            | 23x23x14      | 650 lb.| 40 lb.    |\n| 1-27 | 32x50  | 23x46  | 1            | 27x23x14      | 696 lb.| 45 lb.    |\n\nTop thickness 1\" where needed, reducing to 1/2\" in unexposed sections.

Available without backshelf, and with coil if desired.\n\nSea Rails\n\nAs described in the picture herewith, this range is entirely suitable for marine use and loose rails, as shown, are the standard type largely installed that can be varied to the particular requirements of the galley.\n\nIn marine installations space is extremely valuable, and generally all controls must be on the front of the stove, for which purpose the \"COMMERCIAL\" range is especially designed.\n\nThe extra large flue area of these ranges assures satisfactory operation while tied up in port where draft is at a minimum, and are equally as efficient at sea, where stack draft is excessive.\n\nThe unusual amount of insulation in these ranges noticeably improves working conditions in the galley, with the least possible amount of heat radiation plus ease of maintaining standard temperatures with the least amount of firing and fuel.\nBake Oven\n\nThe COMMERCIAL oven as described in the photograph is one that was especially designed by a well known Western bread baker, that would particularly supply the advantage heretofore only available from permanent brick installations.\n\nAll ovens are entirely embraced with heat.\n\nAll ovens are entirely covered in brick.\n\nThe bricks are installed inside on the bottoms, and on the outside for tops and sides.\n\nUnder operation this oven becomes entirely heat saturated in 1\u00bd hours from original firing.\n\nTemperatures vary after heat attained at 10 deg variation, with 375 deg. in the lower, 365 deg. in the middle, and 355 deg. on the top oven.\n\nHigher or lower temperatures can be as easily maintained as desired.\n\nWithout further firing this oven has maintained constant temperatures for as long as four hours.\n\nThe stack on this oven is fitted for an 8\" collar, and is not fitted with a damper.\n\nInasmuch as dampers are very troublesome when old, and seldom efficient when burned, it is much to your advantage to replace the stack damper as often as necessary, and is therefore quick, easy, and inexpensive.\n\n3-22\" BAKE OVEN SPECIFICATIONS\n\nOutside Body\u2014\n\nOvens\u2014Width 22\" Overall Dimension: Height 67\"\nHeight 8\u00be\" Width 32\"\nDepth 29\" Depth 30\"\n\nInsulation\u20141\u00bc\" all around, asbestos on side walls, rockwool top, ovens fully bricked all around, inside on oven bottom.\n\nFlue design entirely embraces all ovens.

It has polished top plates which are of extra thickness, and the body is made of 14 gauge steel. The flue construction is such that the heat travels the full length of the range at the back of the ovens in addition to the usual travel, thus saving fuel and giving a better baking oven. Oven door frames, hinges and braces are malleable iron.\n\nThis range is made for burning Coal, Wood or Oil and can be equipped with a double iron or brass coil to give a large volume of hot water. The Malahat is made in one size only, having two ovens.\n\n| Number | MCB 22A | Width of Shelf | 13\" |\n|--------|---------|----------------|-----|\n| Top Surface | 37\" | Height of Shelf above range | 26\" |\n| Smoke Pipe Collar | 10\" | Firebox, coal or wood | 26\u00bd\"x15\u00be\"x11\" |\n| Oven Width | 21\" | Alt.

Either size can be supplied with or without water tank or at your request with either wood, shelf or High Shelf or High Closet if wanted. Equipped with non-breakable malleable iron door hinges and frame which are far much superior to the types used on ordinary camp ranges since the malleable iron is not brittle and, therefore, is not easily broken.

Any pair of Malahat ranges, one-oven, two-oven, or three-oven, can be arranged on the back-to-back island plan. In determining your plan selection, check the measurements of the space available and the convenience you require in operation.\n\nBecause of the special Malahat design with internal flues and stack, ranges fit back-to-back snugly, and the overall width of any combination of back-to-back Malahat ranges will not exceed 66 inches.\n\nEconomy of fuel (particularly when oil is used) plus convenience of operation, was the reason for its adoption where the Armed Services' requirements demanded facility for 175 to 225 men at one sitting. The above arrangement of four oven and two burners is most convenient, economical, and is highly recommended for commercial practice in hotels, camps and institutions. It is true that when oil is used a one-burner, three-oven range would ordinarily accommodate up to 150 men, but that would mean one burner in constant use with no margin of facility in the event of breakdown.\n\nOn the other hand, the above arrangement, with faithfully Kresky Pattern Oil Burners in the boxes, assures no waste of oil fuel through necessity of three ovens during long periods when only two ovens in use are all that are required. Between rush periods, one range is shut down completely, the other being in use for short orders\u2014a definite and practical economy\u2014and at the same time giving a standby in case of break-down.\n\nNote in the illustration that the interchangeable stove outlets allow standard left hand fireboxes at either side of the island and the two stacks together for a single smoke pipe (by means of a Y piece). Fireboxes can also be left and right, opposite each other if so desired.\n\nFOR COOKING SURFACE PLANS SEE PAGE 12\n\nSPECIAL INSTALLATIONS: OUR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT WILL SOLVE YOUR COOKING RANGE PROBLEMS; NO EXTRA COSTS FOR DETAILS.\nFOUR-IN-LINE\n\n4-OVEN ARRANGEMENTS WITH 2-OVEN RANGES\n\n(FOUR-IN-LINE)\n\nThe Armed Forces of Canada, all services, have adopted the above arrangement, using two, 24-inch, 2-Oven Malahat \"Mirro-Top\" Ranges: 4 Ovens, in line, with fire boxes at each end, left and right.\n\nEconomy of fuel (particularly when Oil is used) plus convenience of operation was the reason for its adoption where the Armed Services' requirements demand facility for 175 to 225 men at one sitting. The above arrangement of four ovens and two burners is most convenient, economical, and is highly recommended for commercial practice in Hotels, Camps and Institutions.\n\nONE FIREBOX, ONE 2-OVEN RANGE AND ONE FIREBOX, ONE 1-OVEN RANGE\n\n(THREE-IN-LINE)\n\nFor a correspondingly lesser number of men, a one-burner 2-oven, and a one-burner 1-oven range in line, would give similar economy of operation over a straight three-oven range.\n\nIt is true that when oil is used a one-burner, 3-Oven Range would ordinarily accommodate up to 180 men but that would mean one burner in constant use with no margin of facility in the event of break-down.\n\nOn the other hand, the above arrangement, with a light-duty Kresky Pattern Oil Burner in fire boxes, left and right, assures no waste of oil fuel through heating three ovens during long periods when two ovens in use are all that are required.\n\nBetween rush periods, one range is shut down completely, the other being in use for short orders\u2014a definite and practical economy\u2014and at the same time giving a standby in case of break-down.\n\nONEBURNER 1-OVEN RANGES, RIGHT AND LEFT FIRE BOXES, OR ANY OTHER COMBINATION IN LINE, can also be made.

The purchase of either was, of course, complicated by the lack of plans or specifications and I am pleased to note that Mr. Hargreaves, Heating Engineer of the Lands and Development Services Branch, will make the school one of his first visiting places so that he can advise immediately regarding the type of heating equipment which should be purchased.\n\nI feel that we should refrain from purchasing any building materials including cement if the funds can be used for any other purposes as such action might make it difficult to secure a Contract for the erection of the building for the heating unit.\n\nThere would appear to be nothing that this office can do to further this matter pending Mr. Hargreaves' report but it might be of some assistance to us to have a copy of the plans for the proposed Teslin Residential School forwarded here.\n\n-W.

He will not be able to make his trip as early as planned and therefore we will not be able to make purchases of boilers and other items of heating equipment out of this year's funds as we had hoped.\n\nHowever, I would like to purchase the cement at least. If you agree, would you forward a requisition at once by airmail, covering two thousand (2000) bags of cement which we can arrange to store at the school for use next year. If you can think of any other item which we might purchase at the present time, I would be glad to hear further from you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Morris to me, exposing the conditions at the School.\n\nQuite frankly, I do not know what advice to give Father Morris, and I turn to you for counsel. Perhaps, after you have read this correspondence, you would be kind enough to give me the pleasure of an interview. If you could arrange this when Mr. Arneil is with you, I would appreciate it very much because I think he could be very helpful to our discussion.\n\nTrusting to hear from you, either by letter or telephone, at your convenience, I am, dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph R.

Birch, O.M.I.,\n151 Laurier Ave., E.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nVery Rev. and dear Father:\n\nEnclosed you will find Mr. Mikkelson's contract terms for the building of the chimney here. I am sure you will be as surprised as I was when you read them.\n\nHe mentions 3 chimneys. We had spoken of two chimneys, one with two flues and one with one flue. The double flue for the kitchen and the other one for our house.\n\nWhen he was here last January he said about $600.00 now he says $967.60 plus the material at the P.G.E. station. That material is 220 ft flue lining, approximately $1.70 per ft. or $374.00, there is also some aluminum flashing, clean-outs, and thimbles, about $25.00, freight $76.00. So the total cost would seem to be $1442.60 which is more than double what he said it would cost last year.\n\nThe amount for the chimneys was understood to be included in this year's estimates, but those estimates have now been cancelled in favour of the heating plant.\n\nI spoke with the Fathers about this and they thought the price out of proportion to the good we would derive from it.\n\nAs soon as I hear further from Mr. Mikkelson I will write. I am writing to him now to the effect that decision on the contract must come from Ottawa.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours in Jesus and Mary,\n\nJ.A.

He came here yesterday and had a look at our chimneys. The one here in the Fathers house is too small for the furnace and there is a crack through it on the second floor. The chimney itself stands right next to the wood of the walls and floors so that it is a serious fire hazard. The only remedy is to build a new chimney. The other chimney which I had Mr. Mikkelsen look at is the one in the kitchen which I already spoke to you about. This chimney is broken in a number of places for about 15 feet from the base up and including the base. The base of this chimney stands in the middle of the vegetable room where a good part of the kitchen work is done. Since the chimney-sweep pointed out to me the danger of this chimney last summer I feared it might collapse and cause some serious accident. Mr. Mikkelsen says there is danger of the chimney crumbling at the bottom and damaging the roof and floors. It is also a very serious fire hazard. There is another chimney in the kitchen to which the kitchen range and a furnace in the basement are attached. Mr. Mikkelsen said that this chimney too would have to be taken down and another one built, because it was badly built and would not be accepted by a fire inspector. He said that if he worked on one chimney and left the others stand he could lose his permit, or if anything happened later on he could be held responsible for not having reported the danger to the fire inspector. About that second chimney in the kitchen there was never any complaint, but the cooks always complained about the wood, if it is not tinder dry the meals are delayed or they come out half cooked, the chimney might have something to do with this. It will cost about $600.00 to rebuild these chimneys, that is a very rough estimate. Mr. Mikkelsen thinks that it would be better if he came back with the fire inspector and on his report I could apply to the Department for some help towards this expense, and he asked me if I could give him an answer in about 3 days time.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Caribou Residential School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letters of November 23rd and June 8th, 1946, in connection with a proposal for replacement of the buildings at the above-mentioned school and in particular the construction of a heating plant in a separate unit, which would handle the present school and which would form the first part of the new residential school, Father Morris called at this office recently and the matter was discussed at some length. I gathered that the proposal was not clearly understood by Father Morris in the first instance, he having in mind that the heating unit would be designed primarily to meet the requirements of the existing school. I informed him that this was not so and the Department had in mind the replacement of the residential school unit by unit, over a period of years, which proposal, reference his letter of December 16th, attached, is apparently satisfactory to him.\n\nIt is presumed that plans and specifications for the new buildings will be completed before consideration is given to the type and size of heating unit required, to insure that the unit, when installed, will adequately meet the requirements of the new buildings. In my letter of August 17th I agreed that the heating plant should be the first unit of the new school establishment to be erected and recommended that the Lands and Development Services Branch be approached with a view to having the necessary plans and specifications prepared. It is somewhat late in the year to proceed with this now, unless the primary work has been completed by the\nEngineering Branch, but if the funds available for the Caribou School this year can be spent to advantage erecting the heating unit, I would ask that such action as may be necessary be taken immediately, or otherwise that the Department purchase the equipment referred to in my letter of October 15th this year and that an early start be made next year on the heating unit.\n\nW.S.

The equipment should include or have view to include a water softener for laundry purposes.\n\nThese purchases and construction should be in view of complete replacement of the buildings unit by unit over a period of years.

It should be noted that the quotation from Butt and Bowes Limited does not include the condensing unit but the Company has advised verbally that they can supply a suitable 3/4 H.P. air-cooled unit for $370 plus an amount not exceeding $20.00 for copper tubing and fittings.\n\nThe Rev. Principal, I may say, favours the equipment quoted on by McCormick-Deering Implements, Ltd., whose catalogue is enclosed.

This will necessitate a thorough inspection by a qualified heating engineer.\n\nThe full extent of the proposed new development must be known in order to design a heating plant having sufficient capacity. If it is intended to delay the erection of the group of buildings comprising the new residential school, it would be advantageous and economical to restrict the central heating plant to one boiler at the start. The boiler room should be made sufficiently large to provide space for a complete plant even if only part of the equipment is to be installed at the start.\n\nSince the proposed new residential school is to be comprised of several blocks, the central steam plant should be designed for high pressure. Distribution to the various buildings could be made overhead through covered passages connecting the building and power plant; with steam lines to each individual building fitted with two stages of pressure reducing valves. With two stages of pressure reduction, the plant could be operated at medium pressures at such times that the laundry service etc., were not being used, and also in the spring and fall.\n\nIt goes without saying that such a plant would require qualified operating staff for the boiler room.\n\nIt is felt that the inspection of the existing residential school by our heating engineer will have to be deferred until some of the priority jobs in the office requiring his attention, have been cleared. We will endeavour to fit this inspection in with several other calls in the west as soon as our program of work will permit.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nMr. C.B.K. Van Norman, of the Precision Housing Company Limited, is anxious to tender on pre-cut material for the four classroom blocks which we propose to erect at the Cariboo Residential School and at Alberni. Will you please forward to this office at the earliest possible date two sets of the plan of this building so that Mr. Van Norman can give us a quotation on pre-cut material.\n\nWith reference to the Alberni block, I might say that this structure should be given priority over the construction of a dormitory building for high school students.\n\n(Sgd) W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 29, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Bernard:\n\nRe: Cariboo Residential School\n\nYour personal letter of March 10th re the above has been given a great deal of thought, not only by myself and Mr. Christie, our Williams Lake Superintendent, but by the School Principal and The Reverend Father O'Grady as well.\n\nOn my return from the East, I had a meeting as to the best method of utilizing the available and non-transferable funds prior to the end of the fiscal year and when it was found that we could not secure heating equipment, inquiries were made re the purchase of dimensional lumber, gravel, cement etc.\n\nIt was our considered opinion that to store a large quantity of cement would be too hazardous and might possibly involve considerable loss with resultant criticism from outside. There still remains considerable dispute as to where we can secure quantities of suitable gravel and it appears that by a brief delay in making purchase we might avoid a long haul. The purchase of lumber also proved extremely difficult.\n\nIn view of the above we regret to have missed the opportunity of making purchases at this time, which would have utilized the available funds, rather than have them revert to Consolidated Account at the close of the fiscal year. We very much appreciate your effort to assist us in this matter and I really regret our inability to spend these funds to advantage at this end.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAPPENDIX J\n\nGARIBOO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, WILLIAMS LAKE, B.C.\n\nWhile we are reasonably well convinced that only a residential school will serve this area, the cost of an educational survey would seem to be well warranted, in view of the heavy expense required to build a new school.\n\nI would therefore recommend an educational survey committee composed of the following:\n\n(a) Major R. F. Davey, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., Federal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n(b) Mr. G. J. Frederickson, B.A., Provincial School Inspector, Court House, New Westminster, B.C.\n\n(c) Roman Catholic Missionary nominated by the Oblate Order (English speaking Provincial).\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR D.M. MACKAY\n\nRe: Cariboo Indian Residential School\n\nI presume you have previously read the memorandum on this file dated 21st March, 1949, from the Director, Lands and Development Services Branch, with reference to the above school.\n\nYou will note that it is uncertain when one of the officials of Mr. Gibson's Division will visit Cariboo.\n\nMight I suggest that you discuss personally with Mr. Gibson, the situation at the Cariboo Residential School with a view to having one of his officials visit the school at an early date, so that any action which it is decided to take can be put into effect during the coming summer.\n\nBernard F.

Christie, Sup't Indian Agency,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is an application for refund of the money spent by the Cariboo Indian School for the building of two chimneys, authorized by Mr. Arnell's telegram of Jan. 20th, 1949.\n\nThe third chimney was not built because it would necessitate too many alterations in the kitchen, which we could not afford. Unlike the two other chimneys it was not damaged. It did not meet the requirements of the code in B.C. because it was constructed of cement. I had the mason inspect it, and he said it was entirely sound.\n\nFor these reasons I thought it best to replace only the two damaged chimneys.\n\nThe application for refund is in two parts because Mr. Mikkelsen would only take on contract the actual masonry.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.A.

We arrived at Cariboo School after a motor trip up the Cariboo Trail lasting seven hours.\n\nUpon looking over the set up here today I feel impelled to submit a preliminary report as conditions are totally different from the description outlined by officials at the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe Class room block, Laundry, Kitchen, Fathers House and Boys Dormitory are separate buildings and in addition to these there are the usual farm buildings and implement sheds including a Residence for the farm staff. There is also a Church on the property.\n\nThe buildings are spaced a considerable distance apart as will be seen from a rough Plot Plan which was prepared some time ago and which I am bringing back with me.\n\nAll of the buildings were erected before 1900 and some of them date back to 1890 and 1870. Summed up in a few words it can be stated that the buildings are in a terrible state of dilapidation and while the staff are continually working to keep them clean, the task is well nigh impossible.\n\nThe buildings are all heated by decrepit and totally inefficient bricked up gravity warm air furnaces. These units are in such condition that they are useless and when the weather gets severe the staff is kept busy thawing frozen water pipes and all activity in the Class rooms is halted as the temperature drops to the thirtys inside. This is not to be doubted as the layout, such as it is, could not be worsened.\n\nNo point would be gained in building the proposed new Heating Plant before the proposed new School is erected as it would be very impractical to attempt to connect to the existing buildings. Great expense and much labour would be involved, all of which would be lost when the new School goes into operation.\n\nThe object in writing this preliminary report is to bring to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch the most urgent necessity of providing as soon as is humanly possible, heating equipment designed to give some degree of relief from the present primitive and useless junk.\n\nAfter duly considering all phases of the set up and having in mind the intention to build a new school, and not overlooking the economic angle, it is recommended that pipeless furnaces be obtained in the numbers required for the buildings to bring about improvements in the heating which are vitally needed if the health of the pupils and staff is to be safeguarded.\n\nBefore leaving here I will obtain the necessary data from which suitable furnaces may be selected, as well as data relative to the location of the heating plant and the school.\n\nI expect to leave for Lejac tomorrow.\n\nC.H.

Hargreaves.\nCariboo Indian Residential School\n\n150 MILE HOUSE\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nJune 22, 1949.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn May 30th I was very pleased to receive Mr. Hargreaves of the Dep't of Mines & Resources, who had come to inspect the buildings and especially the heating system of the school here.\n\nI do not know if Mr. Hargreaves has yet made a report on the school or if his report has reached you, but I do believe that he was somewhat disappointed in the conditions he found here. He did not expect to find the heating system so inadequate and obsolete, or the buildings so old and scattered. His report, I am sure, will give you a good picture of the situation.\n\nFor three years we have been hoping that something would be done to give us a better heating system and remove at least to some extent the terrible fire hazard we have to contend with at present. I am sure that Mr. Hargreaves' report will be the beginning of some solution to these conditions.\n\nThe ideal of a central steam heating plant does not seem practicable for these old buildings, because of the distance the buildings are apart and the lack of any previous steam system.\n\nMr. Hargreaves mentioned the possibility of pipeless furnaces as a temporary measure. I am sure that these furnaces would give us some much needed heat, and would be a big improvement over the present furnaces, some of which are very old. One at least needs immediate replacement: the furnace in the kitchen building which is completely burnt out.\n\nWhile these pipeless hot air furnaces would be an improvement, they would still not be an entirely adequate heating system. Moreover, it would require five or six separate furnaces to heat the classrooms and girls' building, and an extra furnace in each of the other buildings. That would leave the fire hazard as much a problem as ever.\n\nThe buildings are very old. The main building has been in use since 1880, and the building which houses the boys was put up in 1895. Years have deteriorated the buildings so that they are cold, not only from the lack of a proper heating system, but also because they are no longer fit for the rigors of these winters.\n\nI would say a new school is our immediate need and the answer to the many\nproblems we have been facing these past years. So I beg of you, in the interest of these children, to do everything possible that would hasten the construction of new school buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.A. Morris O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n125 Pacific Building,\nVancouver B.C.\n\nJuly 5, 1949\n\nD.N. MacKay, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Don:\n\nWhen I was in Williams Lake a few weeks ago I had a conversation with Reverend J.A. Morris O.M.I., head of the Cariboo residential school at 150 Mile House. Father Morris is very worried over conditions prevailing in the Indian School. He is positive that unless a new school building is provided, those attending the school will endure real suffering during the coming winter.\n\nI am today in receipt of a telegram from Father Morris telling me that he is going to Ottawa to confer with the Departmental Officials about the Cariboo Indian school. I shall appreciate anything that you can do to help in this situation.\n\nBest personal regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He mentioned the stoves that he considers should be supplied, and while I realize the supplying of them would be only a temporary measure, at the same time it will make the buildings more comfortable.

The Provincial, Father Birch has requested that a short meeting be arranged with you to discuss the need for a new dormitory at this school. It has been suggested that a building similar to that now under construction at the Wabasca C.E. Residential School might be considered for these children at Cariboo.\n\nMr. Hargreaves our Heating Engineer has reported on the immediate need for a new dormitory block at this school as he considers the present buildings a definite fire hazard.\n\nCould you please indicate whether it will be possible to arrange a short interview this week with Father Birch and Father Morris.\n\nActing Director.\n\nBFN/HM\n\nEncs:\nOttawa, July 11, 1949.\n\nDear Senator Turgeon:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 5th concerning the need for a new dormitory block at the Cariboo Residential School.\n\nOne of the engineers from the Lands and Development Services Branch has recently returned to Ottawa, and has reported fully on the condition of these buildings. The Director of the Indian Affairs Branch has already held a meeting with this Engineer, the Chief Architect of the Lands and Development Services Branch, the Superintendent of Education, and Reverend Father Birch, O.M.I., the Oblate Provincial.\n\nI am further advised that a meeting will be held today to further discuss plans for a dormitory block at the Cariboo Residential School. The Principal of the school, Reverend Father Morris, O.M.I., is in Ottawa and naturally, will attend this meeting. If at all possible, I will arrange to see Father Birch and Father Morris this week.\n\nBest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nHonourable James Gray Turgeon,\n125 Pacific Building,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nBFR/HHM\n\nIndian Affairs.

Morris, O.M.I., head of the Cariboo residential school, 150 Mile House, British Columbia, telling me that he is going to Ottawa to confer with the Departmental Officials about the condition of the Cariboo Indian School.\n\nWhen I was at Williams Lake a few weeks ago I had a long talk with Father Morris. He is very anxious over the situation and feels sure that a great deal of suffering will be imposed upon the Indian school children if a new school is not provided before the coming winter.\n\nI have written to Don MacKay, Director of Indian Affairs, and to Ford Pratt telling them of Father Morris' visit. I am writing to you also because I feel that you will be glad to give Father Morris every possible help.\n\nBest personal regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Gray Turgeon.\nO. H. M.

The Director of the Indian Affairs Branch has already held a meeting with this Engineer, the Chief Architect of the Lands and Development Services Branch, the Superintendent of Education, and Reverend Father Birch, O.M.I., the Oblate Provincial.\n\nI am further advised that a meeting will be held today to further discuss plans for a dormitory block at the Cariboo Residential School. The Principal of the school, Reverend Father Morris, O.M.I., is in Ottawa and naturally, will attend this meeting. If at all possible, I will arrange to see Father Birch and Father Morris this week.\n\nBest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. L. KEENLEYSIDE\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nHonourable James Gray Turgeon,\n125 Pacific Building,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nP.S. I have now seen Fathers Birch, Morris and O'Grady. We have reached a satisfactory arrangement.\n\nH.L.K.\nOttawa, July 11, 1949.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Cariboo Indian Residential School,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nFurther to our field report dated May 30th with reference to the above you are advised as follows.\n\nA meeting was held in Major MacKay's office on June 30th with Major MacKay, Col. Neary, Father Birch O.M.I., Mr. Buck and Mr. Hargreaves in attendance, for the purpose of considering the best means of dealing with the conditions at the above.\n\nFor the record, it was tentatively decided to adapt the Wabasca Dormitory Building plans for this site with the minimum of changes to the drawings.\n\nThis memorandum is intended to deal only with the drastic requirements in connection with the existing heating systems. It was pointed out at the meeting, that in the Classroom Building and Girls' Dormitory temperatures drop to about 34 and 36 degrees in extremely cold weather. The Laundry Building, Kitchen Dining Room Block, Fathers' House and Boys' Dormitory Building also were exceptionally cold and under severe weather conditions all activity in these buildings ceased.\n\nRepeating what was said in our field memorandum, the existing warm air heating plants serving these buildings are all in a hopeless state, and it is a certainty that there is no possibility of bringing about satisfactory repairs.\n\nIt was suggested at the meeting that a number of new warm air pipeless furnaces be installed in these buildings to provide means of temporary relief from the cold as well as to decrease the fire hazard. When the new Dormitory Building is erected together with a new Classroom Block, it is the intention to raze the existing buildings at which time these new pipeless furnaces may be removed and set aside for use elsewhere.\n\nWe were requested to prepare an outline specification and plan covering the temporary heating requirements and the Indian Affairs Branch agreed to request the Departmental Purchasing Agent to order the necessary equipment upon receipt of our information.\n\nWhen our officer was at this school he outlined the location of the proposed pipeless furnaces to the Principal. In addition to that a rough plot plan was obtained from which a sketch drawing has been prepared showing approximate locations of the heating units.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt is felt that if these furnaces are ordered and shipped to the job along with outlined instructions for their installation, they can be set in place under the nominal supervision of the Principal.\n\nAs soon as prints are made available, we will forward 6 copies together with 6 copies of the descriptive matter in connection with the furnace requirements for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nChas.

After the present plant was in operation for 9 months a repair job cost $431.95 most of which the Company later refunded when they were satisfied that the trouble was not due to maintenance or operation but to faulty machinery. The Listers we know of seem to give excellent service.

C.\n\nWith reference to your circular letter of May 23, 1949 regarding an amount of $12,800.00 available for alterations to the heating system and equipment for Cariboo Indian Residential School I am forwarding a requisition submitted by Rev. J. A. Morris, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nRegarding the heating system, Mr. Hargreaves, heating engineer, recently inspected the heating system in this school. From what I could gather he had been asked to investigate the possibilities of a central heating system for this school which could be adapted to supply heat for a new building, but meanwhile supplying the present buildings.\n\nMr. Hargreaves found this would be impossible, and I believe he is recommending that pipeless furnaces be installed in the old building before winter in view of the deplorable condition of the present heating arrangements.\n\nThese furnaces could be salvaged and sold if a new building is erected.\n\nThe other equipment listed is urgently required and can be utilized in the new school.\n\nRegarding an additional electric lighting plant. The school has had considerable trouble with the present one, which is an 18 K.W. Shepherd Diesel.\n\nWhile I am of the opinion that an institution of this kind should have two power units so that there is an opportunity to do an overhaul and that when a repair is required for one unit the other can be expected to carry on, it is too bad that when the present unit was purchased consideration was not given to the purchase of two 9 K.W. units, rather than one 18 K.W.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the B. C. Power Commission, which supplies light and power to the village of Williams Lake, may be persuaded to extend their lines to the 150 Mile House and the\nCariboo Residential School within the next year or two. This would eliminate one service which seems to give considerable trouble from time to time.\n\nRev. Morris left for Ottawa last Sunday, and I suggested that he should take these matters up with head office.\n\nencl.\n\nWm.

This will at least eliminate part of the danger presently existing at this school.\n\nHEATING:\n\nPlease find attached the plan prepared by Mr. Hargreaves for the installation of warm air pipeless furnaces to provide a means of temporary relief from the cold as well as to decrease the fire hazard.\n\nMr. Hargreaves has outlined the location of these proposed pipeless furnaces to the Principal. This of course was before the decision was reached to erect the new classroom (dormitory block).\n\nTherefore, would you please send these drawings at once to Mr. Christie with the request that he interview\nFather Morris at once. We wish a decision from him by night letter as to the number of Type A and Type B furnaces which will be required now, in view of the decision to erect a dormitory block. You will note that Mr. Hargreaves' design calls for eight pipeless furnaces with a capacity of sixteen to twenty thousand cubic feet and seven pipeless furnaces with a capacity of twenty thousand to thirty thousand cubic feet.\n\nIt is felt that only half this number will be now required but we would appreciate confirmation of this after Mr. Christie has consulted Father Morris.\n\nMr. Christie could also airmail his recommendations here concerning the tinsmith who could be engaged to install these units and to erect the two new chimneys shown.\n\nI am sending this letter to you in duplicate as you will probably wish to forward a copy to Mr. Christie.\n\nELECTRICITY:\n\nIt is felt that negotiations should be started with the B. C. Power Commission as any plan for the rebuilding of this school will be entirely contingent upon the provision of hydro. The erection of other new buildings at this school would naturally be most difficult to plan unless some decision is reached concerning the possibility of having electricity from the B. C.

Colin Gibson,\nSecretary of State,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nRE CARIBOO INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nMissionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate have asked me to say a good word in behalf of the Order in their fight to secure a new Indian School at Mile 150 near Williams Lake, B. C.\n\nRecords in the Department of Indian Affairs will prove that the present buildings are very ancient and quite unsuitable for present day needs.\n\nThey ask for a new dormitory to be built first and a classroom block later.\n\nWhile the school is not actually within the boundaries of the present Cariboo riding, most of its pupils come from points within that constituency. My interest is therefore aroused in the proposed improvements.\n\nIn view of the granting of the Provincial franchise to the Indians, housing at 150 Mile has become a matter of public discussion. I am sympathetic with the requests of the Fathers, Brothers and Sisters at the \"150\" for new buildings. I would urge that the fullest enquiry be made as to conditions there and that if your departmental experts find that conditions are as wretched as I believe them to be, that a program of construction be considered.\n\nMay I thank you, Mr. Gibson, for your kind telegram of congratulations following the successful issue in Cariboo and in the general elections all over Canada. Your government gave the country great leadership and the Canadian people were responsive.\nI hope I may see you at Ottawa and that any requests from time to time may be well within reason and offered by me in a spirit of goodwill in public service.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge M.

(RG 10, Volume 6438, file 878-5, part 6)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, July 27, 1949.\n\nRe: Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school has been badly neglected, and has deteriorated so badly it is now an actual fire trap. It is located near Williams Lake, B.C., an area where very low temperatures prevail in winter. The existing conditions were not completely brought to light until Mr. Har- greaves carried out his last inspection trip, by which time it was too late to initiate a major building replacement programme this year.\n\nSome relief to pupils and staff in safe dormitory accommoda- dation, that can be properly heated, is required immediately. To this end, this office has recommended the replacement of quite a number of existing worn out furnaces, by the installation of pipeless furnaces, as a temporary measure until the existing buildings can be replaced.\n\nThe intention of the Indian Affairs Branch is to proceed as soon as possible with the erection of one of our typical four class-room school buildings, which eventually will serve its academic pur- pose but which immediately upon completion will be assigned to the pupils and teaching sisters as dormitory accommodation.\n\nThe sum of $40,000.00 has been included in the 1949-50 es- timates for the building which it is felt should be increased to $50,000.00.\n\nThe adaption measures required are to design an attached fireproof annex wherein will be located the heating plant, and power producing equipment, for immediate use, and to design a heating system of the proportions required which can later be hooked up with the eventual boiler plant serving a new main building containing the usual fea- tures of a residential school.\n\nYour Chief Architect has attended meetings with the Director of Indian Affairs, his Superintendent of Education and the church au- thorities interested, and has consented to undertake the operations involved, provided that it was agreeable to Indian Affairs that such work was not to interrupt the heavy programme now under way.\n\nIt now appears that Departmental agreement to this arrange- ment has not been obtained.\n\nSince all members of our architectural staff are engaged on work already assigned top priority, it has not been possible to give the Cariboo school project any attention since receiving the memorandum of July 15th from the Acting Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nIf better results are to be achieved, it will be necessary to retain the services of an architect in private practice and instruct him on our requirements.\n\nR.A.

Present were Fathers Birch, O'Grady, (Endoos) Mulvihill (Lepic) and Morris (Cariboo).

Naturally, the main dining-room space and especially the storage room space would be smaller at Cariboo.\n1st Floors:\n\nDormitories for 60 girls (one large room will suffice)\nToilets and washrooms for 60 girls\nSupervisor's bedroom\n8 cells for Sisters\nLiving-room for Sisters\nToilets and washrooms for Sisters\nStorage-room for linen, etc.\nSmall study hall\n\n3rd Floors:\n\nDormitories for 60 boys (one large room will suffice)\nToilets and washrooms for 60 boys\nSupervisor's bedroom\n4 cells for Brothers\nPrincipal's office and bedroom\nInfirmary:\nBoys section - 4 beds\nGirls section - 4 beds\nNurse's room\nFirst Aid Room (Preferably at stair-head)\nStorage room\n\nBernard F.

This letter calls attention to the condition of\nthe buildings at the school and the necessity of replacing the\nbuildings with new accommodation.\n\nI have visited this school on several occasions\nduring the past few years and am well acquainted with the staff\nand with the condition of the buildings. From my personal know-\nledge I can therefore verify the statements made by Father Birch\nas to their condition and as to the necessity of new buildings,\nsince the present structures constitute what is nothing more nor\nless than a fire hazard, and their condition is such that in\nwinter time their occupancy is extremely uncomfortable and the\ncarrying on of a school is almost impossible.\n\nI understand that the Department has this matter\nunder consideration and is contemplating erection of new build-\nings. This letter, therefore, is to verify the conditions referred\nto above and to say that I am in whole-hearted support of the\nrequest. I would appreciate it very much indeed if you would be\nkind enough to let me know what action it is intended to take.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. D. Fulton.\nWilliams Lake, B. C.,\nJuly 28, 1949.\n\nThe Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI have received a copy of your correspondence relating to the Cariboo Indian Residential School addressed to Mr. W. S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nAfter receiving this letter I immediately visited the Cariboo School, and with the acting Principal Father Fleury, went over the buildings to see if we could obtain the number of pipeless furnaces that we could dispense with, in view of the new school block, which is to be used temporarily as a dormitory.\n\nThe following is quoted from our night letter of July 25 regarding these pipeless furnaces:\n\n\"Re Cariboo Indian Residential School and your letter of July 21 to Mr. Arneil. Father Morris has not returned but Father Fleury and I consider six Class A and six Class B pipeless furnaces still necessary in old buildings with new classroom block.\"\n\nI would like to explain why more of these pipeless furnaces cannot be eliminated, by going over each building separately:\n\n1. Convent and school:\n   The girls' dormitories are situated on the end wings on the second floor. Immediately below them on the first floor are the four classrooms.\n\n   In the centre wing downstairs is the girls' recreation and sewing room, with the chapel upstairs.\n\n   The remainder of the main building downstairs is a reception room, and upstairs the Sisters' sleeping and living quarters.\n\n   It is very doubtful if the four-room classroom block can provide dormitory space for one hundred and twenty-five boys and girls, and also the female staff or Sisters, and we still have to provide heat for the four classrooms, sewing room, and chapel. However, we have decided that one pipeless furnace, Class B, can be dispensed with in this building.\n2. Boys' Building:\n\nAccording to Father Fleury the present furnace in the boys' building is fairly satisfactory, except during occasional cold spells in the winter. The first floor of this building is used as the boys' recreation room.\n\nWith sleeping accommodation for the boys being provided in the new classroom block I would think that the present furnace would be quite satisfactory to heat the recreation room. However, Father Fleury seemed to think that it would be difficult to provide sleeping accommodation for all the children in the new building, and suggested that only one pipeless Class A furnace should be installed in this building, instead of three as proposed by Mr. Hargreaves.\n\n3, 4 & 5. Laundry, Kitchen, & Dining Room, Fathers' House:\n\nIt was decided that these buildings require the number of pipeless furnaces suggested by Mr. Hargreaves.\n\nLabour:\n\nMr. R. Kelt, local tinsmith, was contacted regarding installation of pipeless furnaces, and gave me an estimate for labour alone of $60.00 per furnace.\n\nMr. Pete Vogelaar, local contractor, submitted a price of $2.00 per foot for brick chimneys. He further advised that the standard size of flue lining for chimneys here is 12 x 12, or 8 x 12.\n\nElectricity:\n\nThe local manager of the B.C. Power Commission was contacted regarding the supply of electricity, and is making a survey of the power requirements in the territory between the end of the line and the Cariboo Indian Residential School, which he will submit to his head office.\n\nI might add that in 1946 some of our local members promised to extend the line to the 150 Mile House and the Cariboo School, and I believe that there would be sufficient power required to justify extension of the present system.\n\nencl. Wm. Christie, Supt., Williams Lake Indian Agency.\n\nc.c. Mr. Arneil\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Cariboo Indian Residential School,\nWilliams Lake Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nIn connection with Major MacKay's memorandum to you of August 5th last wherein you were advised that our Deputy Minister had approved the engagement of an architect in private practice to prepare drawings and specifications adapting our typical four classroom school to serve temporarily as dormitory accommodation for 125 pupils at the above, we may say that having completed most of our design work for Fundy Park it has become possible to assign one of our own staff to the Cariboo project sooner than Mr. Noffke could have undertaken the work, or than it would have taken to arrange an agreement with any other private architect. Consequently the re-study of the plan is now under way, and as soon as possible thereafter our specifications will be modified as required.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with the Director of Indian Affairs, who is quite satisfied with the arrangement.\n\nChas.

He further advised that there is some hold-up on account of scarcity of galvanized iron to complete the furnaces. I might add that Mr. Perry informed us that these furnaces only have a firebox which takes sixteen inch wood. It was presumed that in view of the fact that they were wood burning furnaces that they would accommodate at least two foot wood. Father Morris is rather disturbed as it will cost more money to cut sixteen inch wood and in view of the fact that he already has a supply of two foot wood.\n\nPresumably it is too late to do much about it at this date but Father Morris is contacting Mr. Arneil by telephone today.\n\nWm.

However, if the furnaces are to be of any value for the coming winter they should be installed in the near future. It has been decided to leave the matter in your hands in the hope that you can arrange for their installation at a much more reasonable cost than that contained in your letter from the two firms mentioned above.\n\nIn our opinion the quotation for the construction of a chimney is also out of proportion. Would it not be possible to provide the school with a Northern chimney (another name is the Arctic chimney)?

Morris, principal of the Cariboo Indian School, William's Lake:\n\n\"On Saturday there was a man here from the Comfort Furnace Co., the firm which will supply the furnaces purchased by the Dept. for our school here. He said that the furnaces ordered would be of two sizes: one size to burn wood 16 inches long, the other to burn wood 20 inches long, or both could burn coal. Now that's a smaller fire box than our kitchen range which is 28 inches. Coal is expensive here, about $19.50 per ton and wood cut down to 16\" and 20\" is just as bad, not only in the labour of cutting all the wood that small but also in trying to keep 12 or 15 such little fires going. Even the men from the Comfort Furnace Co. thought it was a queer idea. He said they had a somewhat similar furnace which was designed for wood and took a 46 inch stick and he thought that would be a more suitable size. We use 46 inch wood in our present furnaces and they are more than enough work as it is. I made it clear to the Dept. that we could not get coal at present. I have been trying to get the Commissioner on the phone today but could not so I'll drop him a line. But I think that little can be done at this end. This plan was to be for one season only, but since they are not going to build the school next year, it looks as though we will be stuck with these little furnaces for a long time...........\"\nOttawa, Ont.

St. Laurent,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Mother:\n\nYou will be surprised when you open this letter and find it comes from a poor little missionary Sister, but I feel confident that if I appeal to you in our need you will do something for us. Our country has been without a mother long enough and during that time too many little ones, especially \"little Indians\" have suffered. Only a mother's heart understands what it is to be at the head of a family, unable to give them the comfort she would like them to enjoy. This is really my greatest worry here at St. Joseph's Mission (Cariboo Indian School). I first came here in 1929 as a young Sister, two years later was sent to another mission, then was transferred here again in 1933 and have been stationed here ever since. All those years, the Indian Department has given us hopes of a new school, so much so that since ten years no repairs have been done to our buildings because they were condemned and not worth repairing. Imagine dear Mother, (permit me to call you by that name, it makes me feel more at ease to tell you all I wish to relate, after all, you really are our Mother) in what state they are in now, so cold and dilapidated. Our Principal is a very kind person and does all he can to improve the situation but he has not the means to buy the necessary things. We have no conveniences at all in our buildings. The only electric machines we have are a potato peeler and a churn. No bread cutter, food chopper or mixers of any kind. Not even a cooling unit for the summer months! In winter we do not need any, the house is cold enough, ha! ha! Our Principal has asked the Indian Department several times for a washing machine too, also a fridgidaire, an electric food mixer, and a dryer for the laundry but so far, we have not received anything. Very often we have \"blackouts\" not because we have war here, but the plant that was given two years ago was a second hand one and is always out of order.\nOur Mother Provincial is terribly afraid that our Convent will go up in flames some fine night and has asked my opinion about closing the school until a new one is built. But I hate to think of that idea because our Indian children are improving in every way and many of them have practically nothing at home. In spite of our miseries they are happy and have a very good spirit.\n\nNow, Mother, I have come to my big request; May I ask you please to have a good talk with Mr. St. Laurent (I am sure he does not know in what state this place is; Mr. Hargraves the engineer who came here last June would tell him the truth in regards to buildings, etc.) and ask him to plead for us, so that we could have a new school for next fall? The Sisters and children would always claim you as their greatest Benefactress and would pray daily for you, Mrs. St. Laurent.\n\nI know they are making plans and promise a new building soon, but they are so slow, and besides, Fr. Principal was called to Ottawa last July and after much debating with the Head officials, he understood that they did not intend building a very large school in fact, he thinks we will not have as much space as we have now, and our old buildings are already too small. We have to refuse admittance to some because we are crowded. There are seventy five girls and fifty three boys in all. I know it takes money for such a school, but on the other hand, I feel sorry to see so many little souls suffering. They have built such schools before. Do you think I am asking too much, Mother? I am asking the Poor Souls in Purgatory to help us to obtain this long sought for favor; and I also pray for you and your dear one, that God may bless all your undertakings,\n\nI remain,\nYours in the Sacred Heart of Jesus,\n\nSister John Baptist.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n17265\n\nVANCOUVER DECEMBER 9/49\n\nRE: SIGNALS FURNACES CARIBOU RES.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., April 15, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour herewith to submit Voucher No.5-A for $95.83 in favour of E.H.Shockley, 230 Central Street, Vancouver, B.C. for wood work material purchased by Rev.Father Rohr, Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, for use in the manual training class at that School.\n\nIt is regretted that this Voucher could not have been forwarded before the close of the fiscal year, but the delay was due to the fact that there is no mill near the Cariboo School from which these supplies could be purchased. Father Rohr came to Victoria and consulted me and I advised him to buy the supplies in Vancouver from the firm who supplied the material for the work benches. This he did, but he has only now received the same.\n\nAuthority for the above mentioned purchase is contained in a letter from the Deputy Superintendent General dated February 6, 1929, File 600224.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 15, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is making special efforts to improve the instruction in manual and vocational training for boys in the Indian schools of British Columbia. If this phase of our educational program can be made more effective, it will greatly benefit the Indians of the Province. Most residential schools lack a workshop or other space that can be used for vocational training. If steps to improve the workshop facilities should be taken at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, please cooperate with Mr. Indian Agent Taylor with a view to making a recommendation to the Department.\n\nA thorough course in carpentry is the present aim. To this end, Mr. Commissioner Duthieburn has been authorized to supply benches and tools and there has been directed to you a text on manual training, job sheets in woodworking and a publication on how to work with tools and wood. Further, you have been authorized to present to Mr. Agent Taylor reasonable accounts for materials with which to work.\n\nThe Department is desirous of having a qualified instructor for this work at all schools where this special training is being undertaken. Some schools have on the staff an officer who is well qualified for the activity and who can be released from other duties for the manual training classes. I understand there are summer courses for instructors in manual training in Vancouver and Victoria. Other Indian schools are so situated that they can secure the services of instructors from municipal schools. In this case, classes are held two or three times per week. The Department would like to know what arrangements you have made, or can make, for this important work. Do not hesitate to enlist the cooperation of Mr. Taylor, if the Department can be of any assistance.\n\nAt a later date, it is hoped to extend the vocational training to include gas engines and other machinery; and, whenever you believe this additional course should be given at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, you will please inform the Department. A copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. Taylor for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. V. Rohr, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n150 Mile House, B. C.\nOctober 31, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFather Rohr visited the Department today, and I promised him $50 per month towards the salary of the manual training instructor. They will send in vouchers every quarter.\n\nRussell T. Kerr\nOttawa, October 21st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the blackboard for the manual training shop at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, I beg to say that an order is being placed with the Government Stationery Office, and it is expected that it will reach the school in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I am in receipt of a request from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, for a blackboard 4'x 6' for use in the manual training shop.\n\nUnless such supplies are sent out from the east by the Department, I would suggest that this be purchased from E.C. Farwell of Vancouver, B.C., who supplied the last shipment of desks for the school. Mr. Farwell sent me some time ago, a sample of \"Slatoplate\" blackboard which is guaranteed for ten years and is supplied in any lengths of four foot width.\n\nI have no price for this particular board but a small piece such as requested should cost but little.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.Taylor\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6439, file 878-11, part 1)\nOttawa, September 26, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to official letter of May 15th, last, concerning manual and vocational training for boys at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. Benches, tools and texts have been directed to you and you have been authorized to present accounts for materials with which to work. I should like to learn what instruction is being given at the present time and what help the Department can now give to make this important work really worth while.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

E. Witchburn in connection with the manual training school which was to be established in every Indian Residential School. Mr. Witchburn was very kind and allowed us $500 = a year for the manual trainer. I engaged him at $60 = a month and board and he took charge of the manual training from April 1st 1929.\n\nOn May I left for a trip to the old Country and the school was left in the able hands of Rev. Mr. Patterson O.M.T. During my absence no bill was sent to the Department and on my return, Mr. Farrier promised me...\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\n\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\ninterest of $500 = a year for the manual train.\n\nOn January 1st, 1930 the whole amount for arrear wages due to the manual trainer was $450 = from April 27th January at $50 = a month.\n\nToday I have been notified by our Indian Agent, Mr. H. E. Taylor that only $200 = were to be paid of the total amount.\n\nI suppose somebody is under the wrong impression that our manual training school commenced only last September or perhaps we were promised financial assistance only since my visit to Ottawa last November. It has been promised to us last March and our manual trainer has been in charge of the training of the boys ever since last April.\n\nI leave it to you, dear Sir, to decide whether in justice we are entitled to the full amount of $450 = due or only $200 =.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nV. Rohr O.M.Y.\nPrincipal.\nFebruary 14, 1930.\n\nDear Father Rehr:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the salary of the manual training instructor at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. The funds at the disposal of the Department for this purpose are completely exhausted, and I regret that the instructor's salary for the first five months cannot be reimbursed. I feel that you will not press the claim when you understand the situation. In future, it will be possible to give $50 per month towards the instructor's salary. The funds will be taken from the special appropriation for British Columbia, a portion of which is to be used for instruction in trades. You might forward a voucher, in favour of the school, in connection with this service, once every three months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. V. Rehr, O. M.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Technical Training\n\nI beg to inform you that while in New Westminster last month I met the Rev. Father Rohr, Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, at Williams Lake, and he informed me of the necessity for constructing a new workshop in which manual training work can be carried on and asked if the Department would supply the necessary material for this building. All the labor in connection with the construction would be performed by the pupils and the Manual Training Instructor. I said I thought the Department would do this and asked him to send me a bill of material.\n\nRecently a bill of material was received through the Indian Agent at Williams Lake, but on scrutinizing the same I found this would run close on to $1,000.00 and, therefore, returned the same to Rev. Father Rohr asking him to modify his demands. I am now in receipt of an amended bill of material and I find from the local mills that the lumber itself will cost $46.00 nett f.o.b. mill Victoria, and the hardware, vitrified piping, etc., a further $200.00, making a total of $546.00. Freight, of course, to Williams Lake will be extra.\n\nAs there is a class of twelve pupils taking the manual training course at the Williams Lake School, the proposed new workshop is to be 24 x 52' overall and I would recommend that authority be given me to purchase this material, the same to be charged against the Technical Education allotment of the Special Grant out of this year's vote if possible.\n\nI would be pleased to have your concurrence in this matter at an early date.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

BARRY,\nDATED JUNE 16, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nCARIBOO INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING:\n\nBrother LaJoie is at present in charge of the manual training shop. Brother LaJoie does not hold a certificate in manual training. The manual training shop is about 50' x 24'. It is a nearly new building. There are 12 double benches. At present there are 12 boys taking the course. I do not consider the course being followed is one that could be classified as true manual training; it is a course in carpentry. The Principal hopes to get a trained teacher for manual training in the near future.\n\nThe boys have made chairs, seats, sleighs, towel racks, toilet cabinets, small stands, etc. They are now working on a model house of a fairly large size, about 5 or 6 feet by 4 feet. Only the floor and studding had been completed when I saw the work. The boys have done many repairs to farm machinery. Most of this has been done very well indeed.\n\nThe Principal reports that when he assumed the duties of that office, a number of the tools were missing.\n\nThe Principal is about to enclose part of the machine shed to make a shop where the boys can be taught the mechanics of engines and various farm machines, tractors, etc.\n\nAll the above training with the boys and girls helps them to become efficient upon graduation. The boys from this school will become for the most part either farmers, ranchers, or cowboys. I consider the training given in this school of the greatest possible help in later life. The conditions in the Cariboo and Chilcotin are very different from those in other parts of British Columbia.\n\nI should like to see a trained and certificated teacher employed as a manual training instructor.\nWILLIAMS LAKE INDIAN AGENCY\n\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nJuly 10, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Voucher No. 876, amounting to $150.00, in favour of Rev.

It is to be understood that the benches will be made by the boys in the manual training classes. Vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the lumber, the cost of which will be paid from B.C. Special.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated April 4th, instant, received from Mr. Indian Agent Taylor of the Williams Lake Agency, in which he recommends the purchase of lumber for the construction of ten work benches at a cost inclusive of freight, not to exceed the sum of $40.00 for use in the sewing classroom by the older girls of the school who now are using old and unsuitable benches while the smaller girls are compelled to sit upon the floor or stand while sewing. As this amount would have to be authorized from the Educational Vote, Mr. Taylor's request is being forwarded to the Department and I would recommend that if possible the same be given favorable consideration. I may say that in the absence of a mill in the vicinity of the school, the material may have to be shipped either from Vancouver or Kamloops.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Macdonald\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a request from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the necessary lumber to build benches for use in the girl's sewing room. At present the smaller girls are compelled to sit upon the floor, or else stand, whilst sewing. The older girls use benches which were formerly used in the chapel, and they are very old and rickety and have to be supported by blocks of wood.\n\nAs the sewing room is also the girls play room, the benches are moved about a great deal, and therefore require to be of solid construction. With this in view the Principal has submitted to me a plan of a good solid bench, which can be built by the boys in the manual training class, thus combining useful instruction with utility.\n\nThe following quantities of Dressed Fir, are sufficient to construct ten benches. This lumber cannot be obtained locally, and would have to be shipped in. I believe the approximate cost, including freight would not exceed $40.00. This would give the School ten serviceable work benches, each 8'6\" in length, for a cost of probably less than $4.00 each.\n\nWill you please inform me if you can consider this request:\n\n10 pcs. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 13\" x 8'6\"\n20 \" 1\" x 4\" x 8'\n20 \" 1\" x 3\" x 12'\n30 \" 2\" x 4\" x 10'\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) H.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commr. for B.C.\nVictoria, B.C.\nMarch 30th/31\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 19th (#1-1-11). Our mail service has prevented an earlier reply.\n\nYou will be gratified to learn that, with two exceptions, the ideas suggested in this letter have been anticipated in this School. Local circumstances have prevented us from training the girls in milking and gardening. We may, however, be able to change this.\n\nThe girls do all the washing by hand. They also, in turn, can make and bake all the bread used. They also, occasionally, make butter under the direction of a well-qualified instructor.\nThe boys do the milking and get practical instructions about the care of cows &c. They are taught to butcher and, the other day, I had them butcher three pigs while their instructor was away. A butcher comes here occasionally and gives them practical lessons\u2014They are shown how to brand, dehorn & castrate and also to do other things they will have to do on their reserves. They do the gardening, the irrigating etc., and help in setting the hay, harvesting wheat etc. Those who show an aptitude for machinery are beginning to learn to handle a tractor, an envelope-cutter etc.\u2014Our carpenter gives practical instruction in his art. Besides making chairs, tables, cabinets etc., they have, under his direction, put up a building. If the Department will supply the material, I will have them do more building (when necessary) as I consider this of more practical use than the making of chairs etc. I will take this up with the Indian Agent.\n\nI trust that these few facts will show that our ideas run and how run along the same line as those of the Department.\n\nI remain sincerely yours,\n\nG.

Father Rhor. I went over the school and there were 101 children in the school the day I visited the same. I examined some of the children in the class rooms. They appeared well up to standard in their work. The new carpenter shop for manual training was in course of erection by the boys of the school, and they were making a good job of it. As at all other schools the manual training is a great success. The Rev. Principal suggested an annual prize of a tool chest.\n\nExtension of same to other trades, such as iron work and shoe and harness repairing is desirable. There has been little sickness in the school. The food is good, and was sufficient on the day of my visit. They were having for the next meal; stew, potatoes, bread, lettuce milk. All fire extinguishers were up and the children can be got out of the building in one and a half minutes, according to Mr. Taylor. The water supply is being rectified, as you know, and by this time work on this scheme has probably started. The fire extinguishers were in place, and are shortly to be refilled.\n\nGeo. S.

(RG 10, Volume 6439, file 878-11, part 1)\nOttawa, November 29, 1934,\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Cariboo Indian Residential School on September 25th, last.\n\nMr. Barry recommends supplying, for the manual training class, cedar to the value of approximately $15 and oak and walnut to the value of approximately $40. You may arrange for the purchase of this lumber from a firm on the approved list.\n\nThe Principal also requested a supply of mahogany wood, but, as Mr. Barry does not recommend this, the Department does not consider it advisable to supply same at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nI have been asked to recommend the supply of a \n\u00bd (Half) H.P. Electric Motor working on a 32 Volt circuit to \ndrive a small wood turning lathe now in the possession of the \nschool. This would cost about $60.00. I am not much in favour \nof the use of machinery in the M.T. work. I should prefer to \nsee the boys taught the use of the tools that they will have \nwhen they are building their own homes, or which they will have \nto use daily in making necessary repairs to farm machinery. \nI regret that I do not see my way to recommend the expenditure \nof money on a lathe.\n\nThe following supplies are recommended, and will \nno doubt form part of a request made through the Indian Agent. \nPaint for boys' building to cover all inside walls and ceilings. \nThis is certainly very badly needed. The whole of the boys' \nbuilding, while not actually dirty, does not seem to me to be \nvery clean. It was used for the accommodation of Indians \nduring the harvesting season, and the school authorities had \nnot had much time to clean up previous to my inspection. I \nshould like to see the whole of the inside of this building \npainted. This paint would cost in the neighbourhood of $50.00 \nat least 25 gallons being required.\n\nLumber for Manual Training projects is also needed. \nI have been asked to recommend the following:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Dimensions |\n|---------------|----------|------------|\n| Quarter cut oak | 2 pieces | 2 in x 12 in by 10 feet |\n| Walnut        | 1 piece  | 1 in x 12 in by 12 feet |\n| Phil. Mahogany | 6 pieces | 1 in x 12 in by 12 feet |\n| Yellow Cedar  | 200 feet | B. Measure |\n\nOf the above I should recommend the supply of the \ncedar which would cost about $15.00 and the Oak and Walnut which \ntogether would cost about $40.00. This wood is required for \ncertain work which needs HARD WOOD. The mahogany mentioned \nabove would cost about $30.00 and might perhaps be left out of \nthe authorization.\nOffice of the Williams Lake Indian Agency,\n\nOctober 1st 1934\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 7583, amounting to $150.00 in favour of Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6439, file 878-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMarch 12th, 1934,\nCariboo Indian Res. School,\n145 Mile Station, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with the request you made in your letter #160-0-II, dated Feb. 28th, 1934, I beg to submit the following report.\n\nI. Vocational training for boys:\n\nA/Carpentry. The instructor is W.H. Higgins, formerly of Betchen & Higgins, Vancouver, B.C., who is 58 years old. He has had over 30 years experience as a cabinet maker and as a building contractor. He has put up several houses and other buildings, as a contractor, and has made cabinets and other fixtures for banks, stores, offices, etc.\n\nHe reports that the following work has been done: Drafting, scale drawings by elevations, plans and sections; reading of plans made to different scales; building construction; farm work; making of gates, fences, feed racks, grain troughs, flumes. Under his direction, the boys took the levels for the flumes, ditches, skating-rink, etc.\n\nShop work: The heavier work consisted in making laundry tubs, panel and other doors, door frames, windows (including the putting in of the panes), kitchen and dining-room tables, cupboards, chairs and stools. Besides this there was the general repair work such as removing the foundations of part of the buildings and re-nailing dressing, sidewalks, etc. Part of the drains and of the foundations was cement work. A fire-escape, with a porch, was also built.\n\nLighter work: Wood turning, including rungs for chairs, handles for axes, hammers, sledges, chisels, etc.; cabinet work on chests, a gramophone record cabinet with carved figures of local animals, cowboys, etc. (This was made as Christmas present for the local Indian Agent). There were also kitchen utensils (especially for the ex-pupils, girls, who got married during the year), sleighs, and small jobs to teach the beginners to make joints, mitre, lap, dovetail, lock, dovetail and glue. We used our practically home-built circular saw to make grooves, rebats, mouldings, etc.\n\nAll this work is done to scaled drawings. I think that, as the boys will later be engaged in farms, the work they do is practical.\n\nThere are about nine boys in the class with a few more or less at times. All get about fifteen hours a week as a minimum but, when a boy is on a job, he spends two hours a day at it. During the winter months those who show most aptitude, about four at a time, thus get from 10 to 12 hours a week.\n\nB/Blacksmithing. We have no regular course. However, occasionally, the manager of a neighbouring ranch, who was formerly a blacksmith, gives instruction to from four to six of the older boys. They have made gate hinges, braces and other iron parts, exclusive of the wheel, for wheelbarrows, etc., and ordinary wrenches from old files, etc. They made and put runners on about thirty dozen sleighs. Besides this, under the direction of this man's son, who has about 15 years of experience, they help out in the blacksmith shop when anything is being made or repaired, provided that this work is done during the time allotted to manual training or to work, i.e., from two to two and a half hours daily.\n\nC/Farming and ranching. This work is done under the direction of the foreman or his assistant both of whom are about 35 years old and were brought up on farms. As the boys will have to do this work when they leave school, all do some of it after they are about fourteen. If the boys request it or if a boy, after a trial, is found to have no aptitude for carpentry, he spends a good deal of his work-time at this. That would be about ten hours daily and about four on Mondays when the girls are in the laundry. If there is a rush on, for example to dip the grain or potatoes before seeding, a day is taken for this. The same is true for picking the potatoes. We do not think that these exceptions average much over a day a month.\n\nThe work done: preparing seed and potatoes for planting; irrigating (including the cleaning of the irrigation ditches once a year); the upkeep of the ditches and fences\u2014see \"carpentry\" above, etc.\nirrigating done by the boys is done for the garden and potato field. An irrigator is employed for the hay. In the afternoons he sometimes takes a boy with him during the work period. The boys, under his direction or that of the Foreman or Manual Trainer work at some of the ditches used for the hay. The hay is put up and the grain cut by the men. Any boys who stay here during the holidays help stock and thresh. It is the custom that those about to be discharged spend their last few days in the camp or the parents sometimes ask to have their children spend the holidays here. In the winter the boys saw and split the wood. Two or three times each winter the older boys are taken out and shown how to fell trees but practically all this is done by the employees. The older boys are put in charge of a team occasionally and do teamster work. As a reward for good conduct, an older boy is allowed to go out on horseback on the cattle range. Of course he is accompanied and is brought back to spend the night here. The older boys help brand, vaccinate, castrate, dehorn etc. The man who butchers always has two boys who are taught to skin the animal and cut it up. Medium sized boys, from 12-14 help butcher the pigs. Twelve boys milk the cows, feed the calves, operate, feed and care for the cows. This is done under the supervision of the dairyman who shows them how to treat sick animals. Except for the milking, all this is done during the work period. In the evening milking is done in recreation time. The milkers are paid with hockey goods during the winter.\n\nSixteen or seventeen boys, in turn, look after the pigs, sort potatoes and other vegetables during the work period. In the summer, the smaller and some of the medium sized boys are employed in the garden.\n\nI do not know whether I should mention trapping. We have a pest of groundhogs. The boys are supplied with traps and paid two cents per tail.\n\nAll like ranching work and most like farming. Some do not like carpentry but all are given a chance to learn at least the rudiments. Those who show an aptitude are given a good training. I feel that a heavy financial loss to the Manual Trainer has been a great benefit to us as it has brought him here.\n\nII. The Girls.\n\nA/ Baking. Sister Trinity, age about 35, is in charge. She received training in this subject before coming here and has had several years experience.\n\nEvery week six girls, two older, two about 13 and two about 10, are taken, in turn, from the classroom and sent three to the bakery and three to the kitchen. The bakers make all the bread, cakes, pies, etc., jellies and other desserts that are made, the butter, etc. I might point out that visitors are surprised at the bread and that one of them always takes a couple of loaves home.\n\nAfter 3\u00bd days in the bakery, the three girls exchange places with the cooks. Of these Sister Veronica, aged about 30, is in charge. She received training before coming here and has several years experience. Under her direction, the girls do the cooking. One of the severest punishments we can inflict on a girl is to deprive her of her turn in the kitchen or bakery. This is one of the incentives to have them make up for the week they spend out of the classroom.\n\nThe smaller girls help peel potatoes and prepare vegetables. Incidentally, the girls are shown what to do should they burn themselves, should anything catch fire, etc.\n\nC/Gardening. Sister Superior is in charge of the little they do. All who wish, and there are quite a few, have their individual flower beds. During the summer holidays, the girls who stay here, that is those to be discharged and any others who are kept here, do a good deal of the gardening. This year, at the request of some of the parents, I had the girls sack the potatoes. That will be part of their work after they leave school. It was a picnic for the girls. They did not do all of it.\n\nD/The girls do not milk. There are several difficulties in the way and it seems prudent to make no change at present.\n\nE/Laundry work. Sister Gonzales, with other Sisters to help, is in charge. All the work is done by hand; it is hard and not liked but the girls show an excellent spirit. As a reward, several are chosen each month.\nCariboo Indian Res. School,\nReport of Vocational Training,\n1934\n\n\"Aundry work\nto do the employees' washing and I pay them for this. I believe that the local Agent and the School Inspector urged certain improvements but the Department has not been in a financial position to grant them.\n\nI said that all the work is done by hand. This is not exact. We have one family sized electric washing machine.\n\n\"F/ewing, mending, darning, knitting, crocheting, embroidery, fancy work, etc. Sister Gonzales in charge; Sister John Baptist, assistant; Sister Superior, assistant for fancy work. These sisters are fully competent and have about 30 years experience, except for Sister J. Baptist who is about 35.\n\nThe younger girls do the darning and the easier mending.\n\nThe older girls make their dresses, aprons, summer bloomers, miniskirts, waists, etc. All the boys' clothes are bought, except those which every older girl makes in preparation for eventualities. Each girl is taught to make clothes for babies and small children, even the small girls are taught to knit stockings; the older ones knit shawls, sweaters, etc. Their fancy work is good. They do a little buckskin work.\n\n\"General housework, such as sweeping is done by both girls and boys. The girls do the dish washing.\n\nWe try to give a training that will be useful after the children leave School. There is an evidence in the houses of ex-pupils that this training has an effect. I have seen it and some of the older Indians have spoken to me about it. There are, of course, cases which could be adduced against this statement. On the whole, however, I believe that what the Department and we are doing is far from wasted money and effort.\n\nLast year (1932-1933), the children's work, in all departments, took prizes at the Kamloops Fair. Of these prizes, only one was as low as third. This year we did not exhibit, except for what we put into the William's Lake Agency booth (and this caused favorable comment). We exhibited, however, at Williams Lake, and got most of the prizes in those departments. We entered in open competition against the white population, our boys and girls took several prizes, not a few of which were firsts although the children, some of whom were 12 or younger, had to compete against grown-up white men and women. We entered a general exhibit, on which there was no prize, but which was a good advertisement. At the banquet at the close of the Fair, the speeches showed that many eyes had been opened and the Agent and School were thanked for making the Fair a success and were highly complimented. This gave me an opportunity, the Agent being away at one of the Reserves, to tell those present the aim, the efforts and the costs of the education of Indian pupils.\n\nShould further information be required, kindly notify me.\n\nI am sending in this report earlier than you requested as I shall be very busy after March 31st.\n\nTrusting that this will not inconvenience you,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nGeo.

He applied for them but when I asked him for these forms, Dec. 31st, he informed me that these forms had not arrived and he immediately telegraphed for them. I received them two days ago and consequently, my returns are late.\n\nAt the same time, I asked for the Manual trainer's salary; it has not yet come. I refer to the salary for the quarter ended Oct. 1st.\n\nI realize that there must have been a great deal of work to do in connection with the re-organization of the Department but I wish to make it clear that the delay in sending in the returns is not my fault.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa towards the end of the month and it will be a pleasure for me to call on the Department.\n\nWould you kindly give the enclosed letter to Mr. A.F.

MacArthur, Provincial Inspector of Schools,\n\ninspected the Cariboo Indian School on the 18th and was rather critical of some aspects of its operation which I am inclined to agree with. In order to stimulate more interest in vocational training I would suggest for a start, two potato clubs, one for the boys and one for the girls. The Department is being requisitioned for one ton of certified seed potatoes, which will supply 20 children with one sack of seed each.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Cariboo Indian Residential School on the 18th ultimo, Mr. H. McArthur, Inspector of Schools, writes as follows regarding vocational training:\n\n\"In this school all pupils spend the whole of every Monday and two hours of every other weekday, including Saturday, at farm and household tasks. There is no wood-working department, and no provision is made for craft work or any kind.\n\n\"Insofar as I could learn, no vocational clubs of any kind are operated; no steps are taken to coordinate outside jobs with classroom teaching; and no organized attempt is made by outside supervisors to carry out specific educational aims.\n\n\"Although this programme is doubtless far from valueless, its defects are obvious. While it gives opportunities for pupils to pick up a variety of skills, it does not insure an understanding of principles, and it seems to leave the matter of interest largely to chance.\n\n\"I hope to have an opportunity of discussing with Principal McGrath methods of improving it. (Owing to a death in his family Principal McGrath was unfortunately absent during my visit.)\"\n\nRev. J. McGrath, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n150 Mile House, B.C.\nI should appreciate receiving, as soon as possible, your comments regarding the Inspector's remarks. In reviewing our file I find that for some years past we have been allowing an amount of $50.00 a month toward the salary of the manual training instructor. The last payment we were requested to make in this regard was for the quarter ended March 31, 1942. Are we to infer that you have not employed any manual training instructor since that time?\n\nUnder separate cover you are being sent another letter with regard to other remarks of the Inspector.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nsupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1943.\n\nMr. Wm. Christie, Indian Agent, Williams Lake, B.C.\n\nI note from your February report that you have heard Mr. McArthur's criticisms of the vocational training at the Okanagan Indian Residential School. For your information I enclose a copy of a letter which is being directed to the Principal and no doubt you will have an opportunity of discussing the whole matter with him.\n\nI note your suggestion to start potato clubs, one for the boys and one for the girls. While you do not say so exactly, I infer that you mean the children in the residential school. If so, have you consulted the Principal with a view to ascertaining if land will be available? Have you also discussed with him the area which each pupil should be encouraged to cultivate? The Department feels that one sack of seed for each child is too much. Have you considered the possibility of a garden plot in which the potatoes would be planted and cared for by two or three children? In suggesting this project I presume you not only wish to encourage growing potatoes, but you desire the work to have some permanent training value for the children concerned. If you start on too large a scale the work involved will be such that the children will be inclined to feel that it is drudgery rather than something in which they are anxious to participate. If that condition arises, the training value is lost. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would discuss the whole matter with the Principal and let me hear further from you.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYours file 160-0-11\n\nIn regard to your letter of the 13th instant regarding Vocational Training at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, the question of organizing clubs in connection with vocational training has been discussed with the Principal several times and I have given him literature on the aims of these clubs as prepared by the University of Manitoba and also the schedule prepared by the British Columbia Department of Agriculture in connection with the Boys' and Girls' Clubs.\n\nI might say that I have had some experience in organizing calf clubs and potato clubs amongst the White children before becoming an Indian Agent and was rather surprised at the interest of the White children and their parents and also the beneficial results apparent therefrom in an isolated mixed farming community.\n\nAt Bella Coola as you may have noted, a potato club was started amongst the Indian children in 1941 which I considered quite a successful beginning. This club was recognized by the Dominion Council of Boys' and Girls' Clubs which was willing at that time at least to recognize similar clubs amongst Indian children on the same basis as Whites, the Provincial Government donating half of the prize money.\n\nIn order to have these clubs recognized by the Provincial Government and Dominion Council, it is necessary to adhere to certain regulations. In connection with potato clubs each boy or girl must look after 1/10 of an acre of potatoes, and they recommend one sack of certified seed for each, although this depends to a great extent on the kind of seed potato one is planting\u2014eight sacks are usually sufficient per acre of ground. The ploughing and cultivating need not be done by the children which can be understood, since these clubs are open to boys and girls of from 10 to 21 years.\n\nAnother reason for having these clubs on a similar footing to that for White children is that the Provincial Government potato Inspector will inspect the growing crop and also the crop when harvested, pointing out to the children the various diseases.\n\nIn the case of calf clubs, pig clubs and poultry clubs assistance is usually willingly given by the Provincial District Agriculturist.\n\nThe Cariboo Indian Mission School is ideally situated for the operation of such clubs as they have a large farm, with about 200 acres under cultivation with a possible 400 acres suitable for cultivation. They keep around 800 head of beef cattle, a dairy herd, pigs, chickens, and since the Indians in this Agency depend on agriculture for the most of their living, full...\nadvantage should be taken of the facilities which could so easily be provided at this school for vocational training suited to them not only in stock raising and grain growing but in the care and operation of farm machinery.\n\nNo doubt the children pick up a few things since some of the boys milk and the graduate class of girls each year stay on during the summer holidays and help can vegetables, but there is, as Inspector McArthur pointed out, no organized attempt to co-ordinate class-room work with outside activities. The clubs mentioned would not provide for all the vocational training but they would provide a competitive spirit and their subsequent operation on the Reserves would be an excellent basis of contact after these pupils leave school.\n\nRev. Fr. McGrath, Principal of this school, came last August and I am afraid he was very badly disappointed in the whole thing; buildings, some of the staff and methods. He has tried hard to get a manual training instructor and a good dairyman without any success so far. One dairyman that he got after looking at the living quarters, returned the same day by the outgoing train.\n\nIn discussing these clubs with Father McGrath, I pointed out that I would like to see them started in the Residential School first where adequate supervision could be exercised, picking out pupils from different Reserves. When these pupils returned to the Reserve I intend to use them as leaders in operating similar clubs on the Reserves, thus keeping up the interest and the contacts.\n\nFor instance, regarding calf clubs, some of the best clubs could compete at the Annual Williams Lake Cattle Sale held in the Fall and the boys and girls take part in stock judging competitions as is done in most of the fairs in this country. I am satisfied that only through an aggressive program such as this will anything worthwhile be accomplished, and that it is better to concentrate on the Indian Boys' and Girls than on their Parents who are loth to change their old ways.\n\nAlthough I am personally satisfied that a calf club and potato clubs could be successfully begun at the Cariboo School this year, the Principal's attitude is that he lacks sufficient staff; that he has no dairyman, and secondly in regard to the potato clubs, it is inadvisable to put certified seed in old potato ground and that he will have new land ploughed up this spring or summer for such a project in 1944, so that these clubs would appear to be definitely off for another year.\n\nIt is hoped that next year something may be done for the children in the Anahim and Redstone Reserves along this line where Day Schools have been authorized for next Academic year.\n\nThe promotion of such clubs in the different Reserves will of course take a lot of the Agent's time until there are competent local leaders and with all the extra work entailed due to the War and no part-time stenographic assistance obtainable it will be difficult to give these projects the time they should have.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 6, 1943.\n\nRev. J. McGrath, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n150 Mile House, B.C.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of an extremely interesting report from Indian Agent Christie with reference to the formation of calf clubs, pig clubs and poultry clubs among Indian children and particularly among the children of the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand from the Agent's letter that he has already discussed the suggested procedure with you and I may say here that his proposals are exactly along the line of training which the Department desires encouraged and increased at your school.\n\nDue to the acute shortage of food and the necessity for increasing production in every possible way, I feel that the formation of the activities suggested by Mr. Christie would not only aid in the national effort but would be a splendid training for the children.\n\nI realize that there will be some difficulties to overcome, but I feel certain that the Department can depend on your active co-operation and interest in this important matter. We will, therefore, expect that immediately on receipt of this letter you will again confer with the Agent and the Department will await with interest more definite information regarding your plans for the 1943 season.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 26, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to supplying our manual training course of study to the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nOn reviewing our file it is found that as far as we know the school has no manual training instructor. The last grant we made toward the salary of a manual training instructor at this school was for the quarter ended June, 1942. Has this school recently secured an instructor?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am informed by Mr. Indian Agent Christie\nthat the Cariboo Indian Residential School state\nthat they were never furnished with the Manual Training\nCourse of Study put out by the Department, and if such\nis the case it would be appreciated if you would kindly\nforward them this material, including the record and\nwork sheets and prints. At present this phase of the\nwork seems to be covered simply by having the boys\nassist the Manual Training Instructor in maintenance\nwork.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDec. 6, 1944.\n\nWm. Christie, Esq., Indian Agent, Williams Lake, B.C.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 1st instant enclosing a voucher for $550.00 being part of the salary of Mr. George L. Felder for his services as Manual Training Instructor at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, I would request that you inform me what proportion of his total salary is the $50.00 per month applied for. If this man's work consists mostly of maintenance with some assistance by the pupils, the procedure of charging his time to the B.C. Special Vote is incorrect. Necessary repair work on the buildings and equipment would have to be carried out in any event. There would be no objection to the boys assisting in selected work of this nature as a practical training project but it should form part of a definite training curriculum as laid down by the Department in their Manual Training Course of Study which has been supplied to all Residential Schools in this Province, no doubt including the Cariboo School. This Course of Study sets out a definite program to be followed and it is for instruction in conformity with this program that we make a grant towards the Manual Training Instructor's salary. It would appear that the Course of Study may not be in use, but if so, please advise to what extent it has been followed during the period covered by your voucher.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.,\nJanuary 17, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\nre: Your File 215-16-7671\nDecember 6/44\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 6th regarding voucher submitted for Mammal Training Instructor, Cariboo Indian Residential School, I have taken the matter up with Father McGrath who informed me that he has never seen any Mammal Training course of study in this school. He advised me, however, that during the afternoon the boys assisted the carpenter with repair and upkeep of the buildings.\n\nIt seems quite certain that there has been no definite program followed in the instruction of Mammal Training at this school for some time, and I am beginning to doubt if there ever has been any program.\n\nUnder these circumstances, will you kindly forward a program of studies for a Mammal Training Course, or advise me if same should be obtained from Ottawa.\n\nWm.

The Voucher referred to is enclosed herewith, together with a copy of my letter of December 6th to Mr. Christie and his reply of January 17th. As this expenditure will no doubt be a charge against the B.C. Special Vote, it is not seen how payment could be made for any portion of the 1943-44 fiscal year nor is it considered that the expenditure would be a legitimate charge against the B.C. Special Vote in view of the very limited training carried out. I have, therefore, prepared a new Voucher No. 51-A enclosed herewith covering the grant of $50.00 per month towards the instructor's salary during the period April 1st, 1944, to September 30th, 1944, 4 months at $50.00 per month, and would recommend payment of this amount.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would supply a Manual Training Course of Study to this School and advise if it\nwould be in order for Mr. Indian Agent Christie to submit Vouchers at the end of each quarter covering payment of the grant to the School.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\nEnc.\nOttawa, February 10, 1945.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to manual training at the Cariboo Residential School. It is our intention to communicate with the Principal immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, February 14, 1945.\n\nDear Father McGrath:\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 12th instant, I wish to give you a brief outline of our objectives in regard to vocational training and the course in wood work and metal work.\n\nYou are aware that a teacher's work is to analyse his pupils, the work to be accomplished, make a selection, teach, test and reteach. The analysis must include the pupil \"as is\" as well as \"as to be\". The objectives, therefore, may be summarized:\n\n1. Education must aim at preparing the pupil for a complete life in the sphere of influence in which he will be called to live.\n\n2. To develop manual skill.\n\n3. To provide an opportunity for the developing of creative expression.\n\nEducation should be a co-ordination between the classroom and all other training. This is a great means of obtaining the proper motivation which is essential to education.\n\nIn order to help you in outlining the work, I am sending the first three years' requirements for woodwork and metalwork. The operations indicated in this work may be carried out in the order most suitable to local conditions.\n\nI am also sending a set of reference books,\n\nRev. Rev. J. McGrath, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Residential School,\n150 Mile House, B.C.\nwhich, I believe, the pupils will find useful.\n\nAs stated in my last letter, this does not comprise the complete set-up but I believe will be sufficient to carry on without creating the difficulties referred to in my previous letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCariboo Indian Residential School\n\n150 MILE HOUSE\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nFeb. 27th, 1945\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Feb 12th as well as your letter and enclosures of Feb. 14th. Thank you very much.\n\nI certainly was very pleased to receive the cheque for $550.00 for refund of Manual Trainer's Salary. Our School funds are quite low at present. Our enrollment has been down this year and on that account we have lost about $1200.00 from the per capita for the last two quarters. I am sure that you realize that the overhead in a school like this is not materially changed by the addition or absence of twenty or thirty children but the loss of the per capita grant for these children has been quite a hardship for us. I have done what I could to bring the enrollment up to our quota and I have asked Mr. Christie to do what he could but the children have been very slow in coming in. The opening of the day school at Anaham has taken away a good number of children who would normally be in school here but even without them I believe there are enough children around in this district of school age to fill the school. I do not think Mr. Christie is in favor of bringing any pressure to bear on the parents of these children for fear they will make trouble.\n\nI was talking to Mr. Christie last night about the lighting plant that we had applied for and he told me that he had just heard from you about it. He said that you were asking if we could pay part of the price of the plant. From what I have mentioned above, I am sure that you will realize that it would be impossible for us. Would it not be possible to allot for that purpose the $1200.00 which was normally to be set aside for this school for the per capita grant? I understand from Major MacKay that this money cannot be forwarded to us as per capita but possibly it could be used to help pay for the plant.\n\nRegarding your enclosed plans for Wood-working and metal work, I was very pleased to receive these. We have started today to put into operation the plans as you have sent them and it will be a great help to the manual trainer in giving the boys a systematized course. I should be glad to receive any further information that you might have along these lines. I have not yet received the reference books you mentioned in your letter but possibly these will be in today's mail (we receive mail only twice weekly).\n\nWhen I wrote to the Indian Commissioner asking him if he would apply for the balance of our per capita grant for the last quarter, he told me that he did not think there was much chance of getting it but\nthat the Department might consider re-embursing us for the money we spent in having the laundry floor renewed. This had to be done immediately as it had all caved in and had to be rebuilt before the children returned. The floor was originally made of wood and no air vents had been provided under the floor, with the result that dry rot set in and the floor simply caved in. The new floor is cement and cost us $285.00. This with the $500.00 we paid for the laundry extractor went pretty hard with our school funds. The Commissioner did not mention in his letter if the Department was considering re-embursing us for these two items. I am sure that you will help us out in any way you can and I appreciate very much what you have already done.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, March 8, 1945.\n\nDear Father McGrath:\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of your letter of the 27th ultimo, Indian Agent Christie was written yesterday regarding two engines surplus to requirements at another Indian residential school. No doubt, he will discuss the matter with you.\n\nThe books mentioned in my previous letter have been ordered from the Government Stationery Office. It is possible that it may be some time before they reach your school.\n\nAt the present time I am not certain if we can find the funds for the expenditure of $385.00 which you made in renewing the laundry floor. However, please forward the account, giving full details and attach receipts, if necessary. This account should be forwarded to Mr. Christie's office, and if at all possible to do so, the amount will be refunded before the close of the current fiscal year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.

Agent\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING MARCH 31, 1945, ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY\n\nEDUCATION\n\nInspector McArthur visited the Cariboo Indian School during March and his report has no doubt been received by the Department by this time. Having been called out to the Chilcotin, I could not accompany Mr. McArthur on his inspection, but following his report, I paid a visit to the School some days later, and paid particular attention to the matters on which complaint was made and had the fire alarm sounded.\n\nThe children were very orderly in getting out of the buildings and were all out in under one minute. Fr. McGrath had already taken the locks off all the escape doors, the subject of a very legitimate complaint by Inspector McArthur. It is felt, however, that Mr. McArthur has exaggerated regarding the condition of the boys' dormitory, which has been painted up and is very considerably improved since last year. The improvements in this school since it opened last September have been very considerable, and are as follows:\n\nEquipment: Laundry equipment, consisting of power washer and extractor, saving much time for the girls and improving hygienic conditions.\n\nVocational: Manual Training classes have been organized. Also Calf Club and Potato Club.\n\nRecreational: The Pro-Rec program has been continued. Three Skating rinks were maintained during the past winter, two for the boys and one for the girls. Hockey games were organized and matches played with boys from the Williams Lake white school.\n\nA boys' fife and drum band has been organized by Brother MacDonald and is making good progress. Brother MacDonald, who commenced duties as disciplinarian last September, has been a great asset to the school, and there has been only one occasion of truancy since last September. The morale amongst the boys was very low during 1943-44 and a number of boys were expelled in June, so that I consider Brother\n\n(over)\nBrother MacDonald has done a wonderful job considering the bad feeling amongst the boys which had to be overcome.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter of August 25th and quotation from Smedley and Sharp, Ltd., of Williams Lake, covering manual training tools and equipment required for the Cariboo Indian Residential School at a cost of $226.61.\n\nAlthough no specific provision was made in the estimates for this expenditure, no large quantities of manual training equipment have been supplied to this school recently and it is considered that the items are necessary. If funds are available from the B.C. Special Vote, it is recommended that authority be granted for the purchase from Smedley and Sharp.\n\nD.M.

Special and regret that no estimate for this equipment was furnished for the current year. Should funds not be available in this year's appropriation it will be appreciated if an item could still be placed in the estimates for 1946-47 to cover this expenditure.\n\nTo date I have not been able to get a quotation on this equipment from other firms in Williams Lake.\n\nWm.

I should be pleased if you would inform the Department what steps you are taking to provide more milch cows in order to provide sufficient milk for the daily needs of the pupils.

In reply I beg to say it is considered that the animal mentioned in the Principal's letter is too old, and the cost involved in the purchase is more than the Department could provide.\n\nIt is considered that a suitable pedigreed animal, about two years' old, could be obtained at a cost of approximately $150, in which event the Department would be pleased to pay one-half the cost. If an animal of this type can be obtained, the Principal may arrange for the purchase of same, but he should first ascertain that the animal selected is free from tuberculosis. If the purchase is made, the cost not exceeding approximately the above amount, certified vouchers, in duplicate, may be forwarded covering one-half the purchase price, when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The best and the nearest from the school I could get, was from Mr. Auer of Carim Lake, a distance of about 70 miles from our school. He is an experienced dairyman and he is offering me 6 good Holstein cows, with calf coming in next spring at $80 each, a heifer and a bull not related to them for about $100 each. All delivered here, transportation included for about $625.00.\n\nIf this is satisfactory to the department, I will conclude the deal with Mr. Auer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department would be favourably disposed to providing these, if you will guarantee that they are given proper care and not allowed to run with the range herd. If good milch cows are supplied, they should be kept in the barn all the year round and fed properly.

F. MacKenzie Esq.,\nAct. Asst.

Twice a day we give our children every ounce of milk we get from our 15 cows. They are all range cows and very hard to milk. Still we manage to fill our large milk cans and over.\n\nMilk is not separated and the whole milk is given to the children.\nWhen I came here two years ago, the milk was separator\u2014we made our own butter. I stopped it all and whatever milk we received was given to the children. We buy our butter from Vancouver.\n\nWhat we need here is a herd of milch cows. If the Department is prepared to help us, we would be very pleased. Rev. Fr. Locicola visited me the other day and told me that he expected a few milch cows from the Department. It has been done for other schools\u2014Saskatchewan school and others have been assisted.\n\nA good many of our children are stunted when they first arrive here. Dr. Stone remarked the difference between the younger pupils and the older ones. He was pleased to see the latter healthy, strong and fat and told me that this was an excellent evidence to show that our children are well fed.\nI am very pleased that somebody drew the attention of the department to question our milk supply. It is a very serious matter on which depends the future welfare of the Cariboo Indians. They are all more or less weaklings.\n\nI cannot do more than I have done\u2014every day I supervised the milking myself and saw to it that the milk was distributed to the children.\n\nBut we have no real milk cows\u2014I wish the department would assist us and give us four or five Holstein cows\u2014and a bull not related to them. This would give us a good start and help us to build up the general condition of the Cariboo Indians.\n\nThanking you for your inquiry,\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours devotedly\n\nV. Robert O.

The account is returned herewith to be receipted by Auld after you have settled with him, and you should then forward same to the department as requested, when a cheque in payment will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. M. Patterson, O.M.I.,\nActing Principal,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n145 Mile House,\nBritish Columbia.\nA 4-Plow Tractor within reach of Every Farmer!\n\nConvenient Terms can be arranged\n\nYou need a tractor with lots of power to do more work on your farm. The old days of a single bottom plow in back of two horses are past. So are the other methods of yesterday. It is a power farming age, and a powerful tractor is one of the necessary tools you need to have your farm produce at a profit.\n\nYour tractor should have power to do all of your work, and do it when extra push is necessary\u2014when it counts most. It should do the work easily, without strain or overload. It should enable you to do several operations at one time, such as plowing and discing when necessary. It should help you to gain time on certain operations, so your efforts can be directed to other work. That means PROFIT!\n\nThe Allis-Chalmers 20-35 meets all these conditions and gives you a tractor which costs less per horsepower than any other tractor on the market. Every spoke in the wheels, every gear in the transmission and every nut, screw and bolt is designed as part of a complete tractor which gives you a full 20-35 horsepower, plus a big reserve of power.\n94 Drop Forgings\n\nDrop forgings are pieces of steel pounded under powerful steam hammers until all the impurities are driven out, the separate little units completely fused and bound together and then formed into shape. They are infinitely stronger than castings, yet they cost less.\n\nFully 94 drop-forgings go into the construction of every Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor. They are used in the axle, crankshaft gears, connecting rods, and many other parts where the service is particularly severe. No other tractor has this number of drop forgings\u2014it's costly work. Yet we haven't increased our price.\n\nImproved Valve Construction\n\nAllis-Chalmers now uses a special nitricome valve, extra hard and made of steel forged quickly. A water jacket in the cylinder head completely encircles each valve as close to the head as possible. The valves are made wide, providing maximum cooling. The cylinder head material is very hard, containing 1% nickel.\n\nThis type of valve construction has been carefully tested in Allis-Chalmers laboratories and in field work throughout the entire past year. It provides for longer lasting service under the severest service conditions, definitely proving that another achievement in tractor design can be credited to Allis-Chalmers.\n\nOil Purifier\n\nUsed as standard equipment on the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor for over a year and tested in non-operating, economic, and other accessory. Adds to the life of the motor by thoroughly cleaning all the oil 15 times every hour.\n\nNo moving parts\u2014no wear out. Filter element is easily cleaned. Worth the cost of a new tractor itself! Why be satisfied without a Purifier when there's no extra charge for one on the Allis-Chalmers 20-35?\n\nAir Cleaner\n\nAnother reason for the long life of the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor. A double-action air-cleaner that takes ALL the dirt, dust and grit before it reaches the motor.\n\nDirectly connected to the breather tank which reaches out above the dust and dirt and to the ground, over the top of the tractor. Centrifugal action and oil-filter screen with no moving parts, squeeze the air clean. Nothing to get out of order or wear out.\n\nThree Main-Bearing Crankshaft\n\nThree big, oversize main bearings support the crankshaft in the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor. Each bearing is provided with four big studs, making the strongest main-bearing construction that can be built in a tractor.\n\nA full 12\u00bd\" of main bearing surface is provided on which the drop-forged, chrome vanadium steel crankshaft rests. With this extra-duty construction there is no possibility of bending or warping under heavy load.\n\nHere where the greatest strain comes is the greatest strength in the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor.\n\nPressure-Type Lubrication\n\nIt is only necessary to put oil in the crankcase of the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor. A gear-driven pump forces the lubricant through main bearings, connecting rod bearings, piston pins and timing gears.\n\nEvery moving part in the motor is thoroughly lubricated at all times. Even the small arms are automatically lubricated through a lead from the pressure system. No worry\u2014a gauge on the dash tells you that the oil pressure is right and that wear and friction don't get a chance on the Allis-Chalmers 20-35.\n\nRun 100 Hours Without Changing Oil\n\nLast year we said you wouldn't have to change oil but once in 60 hours of operation. Now it's 100 hours before it will be necessary to change the oil in the crankcase. Remarkable? Perhaps, but we know that the oil is in fine condition, it has a good color and body, with no impurities even after this continuous operation.\n\nOwners have written this past year, sending samples of oil which was used for over 100 hours and an analysis showed it to be good for further lubrication. Figure the economy in this!\nProof of Power and Economy\n\nTo meet all possible conditions\u2014from heavy plowing in the gumbo of the plains country, to threshing, combining and building roads, the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor must pass tests harder than its toughest job ever will be.\n\nIt's not an easy matter to build the world's lowest priced 4-plow tractor and have it meet every conceivable kind of work and every possible soil condition. Allis-Chalmers has a reputation to maintain, however, and rigidly insists that every tractor must perform better, before leaving the factory, than will ever be expected in the field.\n\nThat's the reason for the three careful tests in the shop, under the supervision of 3 different experts. That's why Allis-Chalmers maintains an extensive laboratory for the testing of materials, methods and accessories.\n\nAnd that's why careful field tests are made, under worse conditions than you'll ever have. That's why we stand back of every one and know it will perform.\n\nAn actual field test, pulling 4-14\" moldboard plows in the toughest kind of soil.\n\nPulling 16' combines, loaded with grain, when the going is heavy requires power. Severe service which the A-C 20-35 handles with flying colors.\n\nBuilding roads with the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor and a heavy grader with an 8' blade gives it the hardest kind of service.\n\nAn ampere meter and a volt meter used on the electrical testing machine to test horsepower. The tractor must register 110 amperes and 230 volts or equivalent of 43 horsepower, before being approved.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6439, file 878-14, part 1)\nNow!\n\nA Standard,\nFully Equipped\n4-Plow Tractor at\na 3-Plow Price\n\nThere has long been a need for a tractor, priced within reach of every farmer, which has the power, the speed and the construction to handle the work on a farm in a big way, at a profit.\n\nThe Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor is powerful, speedy and low-priced. It can be pushed beyond the limit of most tractors for plowing, planting and harvesting \u2014 without strain and without overloading. It is built to handle easily and smoothly 4-14\" plows, a 32\" separator, a 16' combine, a 10' one-way disc plow, a 4 row lister, or smaller implements arranged in tandem and pulled at one time.\n\nAllis-Chalmers Again Holds Lead \u2014\n\nWith a 20-35 tractor at this price Allis-Chalmers steps far into the lead which we have always held in the 4-plow tractor class. Far superior to any tractor built before, made of the best materials on a production basis which brings the cost way down, the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 is practically without competition. Where else can you buy the power, the material, the construction and the work it will do at anywhere near the price?\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nAllis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor\n\nCAPACITIES\u2014Will handle 4-14\" plows; a 32\" separator, a 16' combine, with grain, a 10' one-way disc plow, a 4 row lister or smaller implements in tandem.\n\nDRAWBAR PULL\u2014In low gear this tractor is guaranteed to pull 3750 pounds and in high gear it will pull 2875 pounds.\n\nTRACTOR SPEED\u20142\u00bd to 3\u00bd miles per hour.

One barrel of oil, I may say, was used in breaking the brush. The tractor was used on a root harrow over the same land. This land was also disced with 2-10' tandem discs, at a cost of 32c per acre. A 22\" Brush Breaker was used after the brush was cut and the engine had no difficulty whatsoever in pulling this in high gear.\n\nI do not hesitate to say that I feel I have the best tractor on the market today, and if any prospective purchasers would care to write me personally, I would be glad to reply to their communications.\"\n\nCLIFF TAYLOR.\n\n---\n\nThe Home of Cockshutt Farm Implements\n\nCockshutt Implements For Power Farming\n\nIn the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 Tractor and Cockshutt Tractor Implements you have an unbeatable combination.

Owners of the Allis-Chalmers 20-35 tractor are not slow to say what they think about its outstanding qualities. The following are just a few of the many enthusiastic testimonials we have recently received. If you are thinking of buying a tractor see the Allis-Chalmers first. The experience of hundreds of successful farmers should be worth something to you.\n\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\"I bought an Allis-Chalmers tractor in 1928. I plowed 200 acres with a 4-Furrow Plow and got through quicker than ever before. I never needed a minute's service on this machine, and it has never given me a moment's trouble. Using a 28\" separator I have threshed my own crop, and using six teams they could not keep this machine going. I consider that I have got the most economical tractor made, after carefully looking over most other makes. I can recommend the Allis-Chalmers to anyone and would be glad to answer enquiries regarding it.\"\nJ. H. ERSSON.\n\nErskine, Alta.\n\"In August, 1926, I purchased through the Olive Implement Company of Stettler, one of your 20-35 Allis-Chalmers tractors for use in general farming operations. Having used this engine three seasons, and threshing approximately one hundred thousand bushels of grain, besides breaking over one hundred acres of extremely heavy brush land, using this engine to plow over 1500 acres of stubble land as well as seeding 600 acres, cutting 300 acres grain, and seeding 500 acres, and using the engine almost continuously, weather permitting, for every purpose that power could be utilized for on a farm, at the time of writing this letter, I consider the engine to be in almost perfect condition; the outlay on repairs during this time being practically nil.\n\nPulling a four bottom plow in stubble land, I consider plowing has been done at a cost of 55 cents per acre, and all other work in like proportion.\n\nI have used other makes of engines and found none to compare in either satisfaction or service with the Allis-Chalmers.\"\n\nFRANK NOURSE.\n\nBlackfalds, Alta.\n\"I have used one of your Allis-Chalmers tractors for four years, during which time it has been entirely satisfactory, being used for threshing, breaking, plowing, grinding, and sawing. In spite of constant usage and hard work which this tractor has been put to, the total repair bill covering the four years of usage, has only amounted to $3.30.\"\n\nE. R. IRONSIDE.\n\nBrant, Alta.\n\"I purchased a 20-35 Allis-Chalmers tractor last spring and I will say that the tractor has given me absolute satisfaction in every respect. It did not cost me a nickel for repairs during the entire season.\"\n\nH. GILBERT.\n\nOnward, Sask.\n\"I bought an Allis-Chalmers 20-35 engine in the fall of 1927. Have plowed 210 acres, used it for surface work all summer and threshed two falls, and have never bought any repairs and am well pleased with this engine, and would recommend it to anyone wanting an all round engine for farm work.\"\n\nJ.

Having been called out to the Chilcotin, I could not accompany Mr. McArthur on his inspection, but following his report, I paid a visit to the school some days later, and paid particular attention to the matters on which complaint was made and had the fire alarm sounded.\n\nThe children were very orderly in getting out of the buildings and were all out in under one minute. Fr. McGrath had already taken the locks off all the escape doors, the subject of a very legitimate complaint by Inspector McArthur. It is felt, however, that Mr. McArthur has exaggerated regarding the condition of the boys' dormitory, which has been painted up and is very considerably improved since last year. The improvements in this school since it opened last September have been very considerable, and are as follows:\n\nEquipment: Laundry equipment, consisting of power washer and extractor, saving much time for the girls and improving hygienic conditions.\n\nVocational: Manual Training classes have been organized. Also Calf Club and Potato Club.\n\nRecreational: The Pro-Rec. program has been continued. Three Skating rinks were maintained during the past winter, two for the boys and one for the girls. Hockey games were organized and matches played with boys from the Williams Lake white school.\n\nA boys' pipe and drum band has been organized by Brother MacDonald and is making good progress. Brother MacDonald, who commenced duties as disciplinarian last September, has been a great asset to the school, and there has been only one occasion of truancy since last September. The morale amongst the boys was very low during 1943-44 and a number of boys were expelled in June, so that I consider Brother\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR JUNE QUARTER, 1945 - WILLIAMS LAKE\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAn annex is under construction at the Cariboo Indian residential school to be used as an infirmary and for isolation purposes, which is long overdue.\n\nI attended a concert of singing, dancing, pro-rec work and short plays put on by the pupils and found much improvement over previous efforts.\n\nThe Boy's Fife and Drum band took part in the Victory day Celebrations at Williams Lake, and they also headed the Parade at Quesnel for July 1st celebrations.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.,\nSeptember 25, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nLast year, a band was organized for the boys at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, which has proved a great attraction to the school and has made a decided improvement in the morale, evident from the fact that there was less difficulty in getting the boys returned to school after the vacation this year than at any time previously.\n\nThe Cariboo School has supplied all the instruments to date, consisting of drums and fifes, but it would make the band much more balanced if they had bugles. It was suggested by Father McGrath that now that the Army is being demobilized, no doubt a large number of second-hand bugles would be available through the War Assets Corporation, and it was felt that the Department might be willing to supply or contribute to the cost of twenty bugles for the School.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWC:MM\nOttawa, October 15, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nA request has been received from the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, Williams Lake Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for 20 bugles for the Boys' Band at the school.\n\nThe school management has supplied a number of instruments consisting of drums and fifes, but it is pointed out that the Band would be much more balanced if they had bugles. It occurred to me that these might be secured through the War Assets Corporation, and I would appreciate it if you would make enquiries and advise me.\n\nDirector,\n\nPP\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter of September 25th in connection with the proposed supply of twenty bugles for the boys' band at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would be appreciated if an enquiry could be made to determine if such instruments will likely be available from the War Assets Corporation.\n\nD.M.

Vancouver, B. C.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a requisition for musical instruments for the Boy's Band at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nThis Band was started by Brother Mac Donald about 18 months ago with some old second hand fifes and a few new cheap ones purchased from Eatons. Some of the drums were purchased and some home-made. In any event this effort has been of inestimable value in building up the morale of the school which was very low.\n\nSo far the band has been strictly drum and fife but the addition of the bugles would balance it up much better especially since Brother MacDonald has also got the Boy Scouts organization going and an effort is to be made to start a Girl Guides. The old fifes are not much good now and Brother MacDonald and the Principal, Father McGrath have both approached me to see if the Department will purchase bugles and fifes, quotations for which have been received from the Vancouver Drum Company. Terry's Music Store have only quoted on Bugles as they had no Fifes in stock at the time but may have by this time.\n\nThe school has supplied all these boys in the Band with a uniform at considerable expense in addition to the instruments already purchased and I would strongly recommend that the Department authorize the purchase of all or part of this equipment.\n\nWm.

A specific amount is provided in the case of each church-owned school and we are not allowed to exceed that amount. In the current year's appropriation an amount of $500.00 is provided for the Cariboo School.

Scott.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nWith reference to that portion of Bishop Murray's letter, which is concerning the Christie Indian Residential School, I may say that the buildings are not fireproof, nor are they very suitable for the purpose of educating Indian children. The original wing has been added to from time to time. On the other hand, I understand that this school is quite habitable yet and, in addition to improvements that the church may have effected, the Department has expended $17,240.00 during the last four years in enlarging the school, providing fire protection, installing water supply, electric light and heating equipment.\n\nThe following schools in British Columbia has as much, if not more, claim for new buildings as Christie.\n\nSt Mary's Squamish\nAhousaht Cariboo.\n\nRussell Ferrier.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nBishop's House, Victoria, B.C.,\nOct. 3, 1930.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nLast year His Lordship Bishop O'Donnell wrote to the Department about a new school at Kakawis on the West Coast. It was impossible, it seems, to put the matter through at that time. After the lapse of more than a year, when the need has become even more urgent, I respectfully renew the petition. The present Christie School is in poor repair and it would be a waste of money to try and make it really habitable.\n\nThere is no doubt in the mind of anyone, who has visited the antiquated building at Kakawis and who is familiar with schools erected by the Department in the past fifteen years, that a new school building at Kakawis is a real and urgent necessity.\n\nAfter careful survey of the West Coast, no site is deemed more suitable than the present one. In connection with the school a wharf would have to be built. It is hard to realize the inconveniences to which the school is put for lack of a landing-place. A wharf is feasible at Kakawis, in the opinion of Captain Thompson of the C.P.R. Steamer Norah and of other authorities.\n\nx x x\n\nG. C. Murray, C.S.S.R.\nBishop of Vancouver Island.\nVictoria, B.C. November 7, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. [Name]:\n\nI received your letter of the 31st ultimo in which was attached correspondence from Right Reverend Gerald Murray, Roman Catholic Bishop of Vancouver Island, in which he laid before you a scheme for the centralizing of all the Roman Catholic Indians of the West Coast of Vancouver Island on Opitsat Indian Reserve No. 1 of the Clayoquot Tribe, as suggested by Reverend Victor Rassier, O.S.B., Principal of the Christie School at Kakawis; also the desirability of the establishment of a hospital, as well as the replacing of the Christie School by a new structure.\n\nApparently the Reverend Father Rassier has now changed his mind about moving the school as he wishes to have a wharf constructed in front thereof. This I fear would prove a very costly undertaking owing to the fact that the water is shallow for hundreds of yards at high tide and at low tide a long sandy beach is exposed. However, as he has asked that a wharf should be built for the school I am of the opinion that the Department of Public Works be asked to make a report on the cost thereof.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawin, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nSept. 15, 1931.\n\nMr. Russel T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nOn a recent visit to Christie School, Indian Agent Frost, referring to some communication he had received from the Department, dropped the remark that I might be instructed to limit the number of pupils in residence to the exact 100 covered by my grant.\n\nI should like to anticipate such action by the Department, if I understood Mr. Frost aright, by begging you to present my request for considerable latitude in this matter of number in actual residence for principally two reasons. In the first place, illness and death in the course of a school year, tend to reduce the number in residence appreciably, and it is but natural that I should contemplate with reluctance the corresponding loss of grant if the initial number is to be restricted to 100. Secondly, such restriction, because of existing conditions on the West Coast, would mean to not a small number of children a complete loss or a tardy enjoyment of the benefits of an education with resulting detriment to themselves and ultimately to the Department. Permit me to assure you that space, dormitory and other, is ample for a considerable number of children over and above the 100 covered by my grant.\n\nWill you, therefore, Mr. Ferrier, please interest yourself in the request expressed above? I recall with satisfaction my conversation with you on precisely this subject in which you revealed a thorough grasp and appreciation of conditions on this Coast, and I feel sure that I may count on you for this favor.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I am\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6439, file 879-1, part 2)\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFather Rassier, Principal at Christie, when in Ottawa today explained that he is arranging for additional dormitory space and wishes the Department to provide for 110 pupils as from April 1st, 1933.\nOttawa, September 29, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the pupilage at the Christie Indian Residential School. This has been fixed at 100 pupils and grant is not available for any more. So that you can readily reach an average attendance of 100, it is permissible to take into residence 4 or 5 more than this number in order that full grant will be earned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Victor Rassier, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe writer has been Principal of Christie Indian Residential School since February, 1929. In the course of these more than five years of experience in Indian affairs on the West Coast, I have frequently had occasion to wonder how it was possible that the injustice that has been perpetrated upon Catholic rights, as regards the Indians on the West Coast, was permitted to continue to exist without anything being done to correct it. It has been suggested to me that very likely this state of affairs exists because those high in authority had never had the matter brought to their attention. It is this suggestion that has prompted my addressing this letter to you, and I do so in the hopes you will interest yourself in having the facts stated investigated and the wrong righted if these facts are found to be as represented.\n\n\"Vancouver Island and Its Missions\" by the first missionary of the West Coast, Father Brabant, is a reliable chronicle of the beginnings of the missions amongst the Indians of the West Coast and of subsequent events. Unfortunately, only one copy of it is to be found at Christie School and no other seems available; but \"Reminiscences of the West Coast of Vancouver Island\" by Father Charles Moser, which is little more than a later edition of the work, is being forwarded to you, and in it you will be able to find corroboration of the facts which are mentioned as being at bottom of the injustice to Catholic rights to which this letter would respectfully call your attention.\n\nSummarized, the facts are these:\n\n(1) Catholic priests were the first missionaries on the West Coast arriving in the year 1874;\n(2) They labored faithfully under the direction of, and assisted by, their bishop, doing all that could reasonably be expected, considering the times and the circumstances, to civilize and Christianize the natives;\n(3) The Catholic Church, as represented by Her Bishop and these missionaries, never deserted the field nor interrupted her activities amongst these Indians.\n\nThe injustice to which I would call your attention consists in this: that seventeen years after having found the missions and administered to them amidst much labor and hardship, the Catholic Church should have her field invaded by the Protestant missionary, who must have realized from the fact that, with most of the children baptized Catholic and the adults either already received into the church or being prepared for such a step, he could only entertain hopes of success to the extent that he could prey upon the legitimate preserve of the Catholic Church.\nPerpetuating this injustice and its logical consequences to Catholic interests as concerns the northern section of this agency is the United Church Indian Residential School at Ahousaht, which, as Father Brabant, in his original memoirs states was established \"between two missions having a resident priest,\" and which, as these memoirs plainly show, was being, as well as had been, administered to by these priests. There are ten tribes to be found between the village of Opitsaht of the Clayoquot Indian tribe in the vicinity of Tofino at the south, and of Kyuquot, observation of the Kyuquot Indians, to the north. All of these with the exception of Ahousaht are still considered Catholic tribes and are administered to by Catholic priests. The United Church establishment at Ahousaht forms a wedge separating half of the Catholic population to be found in the seven tribes to the north from the other half of the Catholic population formed by the two tribes to the south.\n\nFurthermore, since this school should, from the nature of the circumstances, have but the one tribe of Ahousaht to draw from for its children, the result can easily be conjectured. As its numbers begin to decrease, it will be forced more and more, if numbers in attendance are to justify its existence, to prey upon the children of Catholic parents and Catholic tribes as it has so much done in the past, as witness the presence at Ahousaht School, when the writer arrived, of one third of the total attendance being children of Catholic parents; and of the presence in the school at the present time of more than ten such.\n\nIt is easy to understand, therefore, why controversies, strife, jealousies, difficulties, proselytizing, defections are continually in evidence affording little edification to the natives, retarding and, to a great extent, nullifying the efforts of both the Department and religion to promote the welfare of the Indian.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.)

McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs immediate Superior of the Rev. Victor Rassier, O.S.B., who for the past several years has been Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School of Kekewis, B.C., and as Head also of St. Benedict's Abbey, Mount Angel, Oregon, entrusted with the supplying of men for the same Indian school, I take upon myself the duty of informing you that unavoidable circumstances have forced me to make a change in the personnel of said school.\n\nDuring the last fifteen months Rev. Victor Rassier has twice reached a crisis in the matter of his health. Each time recovery in a hospital was necessary. About a month ago, his condition having become quite serious, I called him to Portland for a thorough examination at the Medical Clinic. The doctors' verdict was that both the strain of over-work and the difficult climate on the West Coast of Vancouver Island made a change absolutely necessary in order to avoid a still more alarming condition. Regardless of any reluctance I might feel in the matter, I could not but order his removal. Both the members of our own community and the local authorities at the episcopal see in Victoria, B.C., have repeatedly expressed their satisfaction with Rev. Father Victor's management of the school and I feel certain that you are of the same opinion. It is thus to be regretted that any change became necessary.\n\nAs a successor to Father Victor in this rather difficult post I have chosen the man whom I honestly adjudge most fitted for the same. He is the Reverend Bertrand McLoughlin, born in Halifax, N.S. He is a young man, enjoys perfect health, and has that stamp of vitality and determination so necessary for those dealing with Indian subjects. I have full confidence in Father Bertrand and feel certain that he will prove efficient and satisfactory in every respect. His Canadian birth will certainly prove an asset also. His present assistant, Rev. Leo Walsh, is also a Nova Scotian.\n\nThat your Department will approve this change I have no doubt. It has been made with the interests of the Christie School always in mind. The necessity for the immediate change compelled me to remove Father Victor despite his earlier desire to carry on until May. This was because of his responsibility in the matter of the refund he had been promised by your Department to cover indebtedness.\nincurred in making most necessary repairs and improvements in the School. I do not expect that the removal will interfere in any way with the contemplated refunding and assured Father Victor of the same.\n\nIf I can assist your Department in the affair of the Christie Indian Residential School at any time, I shall be delighted to do so.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRt.Rev.Thomas Meier, Abbot.\n\nRt.Rev.Thomas Meier, Abbot.\nOttawa, January 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Right Reverend Abbot, St. Benedict's Abbey, St. Benedict, Ore., informs the Department of the retirement, on account of ill health, of Rev.

The Department has approved of the appointment of Rev. Father McLaughlin, and it is hoped that he will meet with success in the work.

His services were entirely satisfactory to the Department during his incumbency as Principal of the Christie Residential School. The appointment of Reverend Bertrand McLaughlin is approved. I am sure his services will prove efficient, and I look forward to a period of continued progress in the work of the school under his management.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDue to circumstances I would like to have the vacation for the above institution begin on the 23rd. of April and terminate after the customary forty-four three days. Last year I was very well pleased with the success we had in having the vacation at this period of the year. In June the Indians go to River's Inlet and remain there for six weeks during which time the children are subject to numerous evils especially drinking and immorality. After this period the local canneries are open and the Indians continue fishing well up in November. I feel that it is best to have the children in school during that time and by having vacation so that it will terminate early in June this will be possible. As I said above, it worked out very well last year.\n\nThe expense incurred last year for transportation amounted to over one hundred and fifty dollars. The majority of children leave here with their parents by gas boats but all return on the steamer since the parents are preparing for the fishing season. Moreover, some of the children live quite far from the school hence the expense is quite high. Hoping to hear from you favourably, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nBertrand McLaughlin, Principal.\nOttawa, March 16, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the Department approves of the holidays at the Christie Indian Residential School commencing on April 13th, next. Grant is allowed the school for 43 days' holidays.\n\nAn amount not exceeding $150.00 will be allowed towards the transportation expenses of the children of this school going home for holidays. When forwarding the voucher for this amount, you should attach receipts and a full explanation regarding the manner in which the expenditure was incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L.

C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit, for the Department's consideration, request of the Reverend Principal of Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nHe requests that permission be granted to commence the annual vacation as from April 13th.\n\nThe reason for this date is to insure attendance of pupils at school during the fishing season (June to October), during which season it is customary for the Indians to take the children to the canneries, with undesirable results.\n\nThis permission was granted last year, and it is respectfully recommended that it be again granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 25, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department approves the holidays at the Christie Indian Residential School commencing on April 23rd. Grant is allowed the school for 43 days' holidays.\n\nAn amount of $150.00 will be allowed towards the transportation expenses of the children from this school going home for holidays. When forwarding a voucher for this amount, you should attach receipts and a full explanation regarding the manner in which the expenditure was incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Principal of Christie Indian Residential School, application for summer vacation to commence on April 23, 1936.\n\nThe writer would respectfully recommend vacation commencing on that date as the local conditions are as stated by the Rev. Principal and much unnecessary suffering has resulted in past years owing to the children accompanying their parents to the East Coast during the fishing season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B.

Hildebrand Melchior, O.S.B., that he and his entire staff were to be relieved by another Order early in August.\n\nGreat credit is due to these gentlemen for the zeal they have shown in the interests of the school, having just completed a fine trail 2000 feet long, from boat landing to school, and completion of reservoir with capacity of 90,000 gallons of water, in addition to the splendid condition of school and out-buildings. This work has been carried out at the expense of the Church, and with their own personal labour.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge.\nIndian Agent.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C., June 30, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular agency letter covering conditions within this agency during month ending June 30th, 1938.\n\nChristie Residential School has re-opened, and children returned from vacation.\n\nThe school was found in splendid order, clean and sanitary. The boilers, however, should be inspected at an early date. The school authorities are putting in a float landing, and building a trail, to improve facilities for landing people and supplies. While some doubt exists as to the life of the float during the winter storms, the efforts of the principal and staff are commendable, and reflect great credit on those who have assisted with the work.\n\nP.

Hidebrand, I went over the school. At the time of my visit, the children were away on holidays. The register showed that there had been 110 children just before the holidays. I noticed a most distinct improvement in this school, both inside and out since my last visit. All dormitories were nice and clean and tidy, with big improvement in the kitchen, with lots of new flooring. The new bakery, too, is an improvement, and the plumbing all round has been added to and improved, though the lavatory accommodation is still inadequate. All fire fighting apparatus was in first class order, and the new fire escapes are good and adequate. The manual training quarters are too small. The gardens and grounds are greatly improved.\n\nGeo.

Mr. Phelan is absent from the city on holidays and I have been unable to discover anything on the records here with respect to this particular pier. Mr. G.S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, British Columbia, however, in a report to the Department dated November 26, 1936, states:\n\n\"Mr. Ashbridge, Indian Agent, informs me that a road has been constructed from the Indian reserve near Tefine to the Christie school. This should solve the problem of landing goods and freight at the Christie School, which has been until now a very difficult matter.\"\n\nShould you require additional information, I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with me again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

He is a man of great experience and ability and will be very competent to act as principal of the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRt.Rev. Thomas Meier, O.S.B.\nAbbot\nDr McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr McGill:\n\nIn the name of the pupils, the Staff and in my own name, I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.\n\nI am pleased to be able to say that Mr Indian Agent Ashbridge has been very courteous and helpful and, on more than one occasion, has put himself to out in order to be of service to us.\n\nThe general health of the School is quite good. We have had to ask for the discharge of some medically unfit children and this has prevented us from having our full quota of pupils but this was done in the interests of all concerned.\n\nThere are quite a few things in which great improvement is needed but that will come in time. The children seem quite satisfied and, therefore, it will not be so difficult to make certain changes.\n\nA real source of grief is the weather during the rainy season. It has, so far, made it necessary to keep the boys from their manual training during the rainy season and to keep them in the classrooms morning and afternoon. As you are aware, the Department has granted us materials for a manual training shop. It will be divided into two large rooms (with some smaller ones) which will serve as a carpenter shop and a machine shop. I have done my best since coming here to find a man who is both a competent carpenter and a qualified mechanic but have failed. I have had to employ two men and I am going to ask the Indian Agent to request that the Department grant $40.00 per month towards the salary of each. I am aware that this is not a general practice but our case is a peculiar one. In the Cariboo School, I could have some of the boys in the carpenter shop and others working outside in the winter. Here, during the rainy season, I cannot put all the boys (the 7 to 10 year old boys are not included) in the carpenter shop as none of them would then get any training but I can put half of them at carpentry and the other half at machine work or plumbing. A little training in plumbing will be of real use to them. I cannot put any of them to work outside during the rain.\n\nWhen everything is organized, I hope to be able to let the Indians bring their motors here and have them attended to by the instructor and either themselves or the boys. That will not only save the Indians money but will teach them something about repairing and adjusting their motors.\n\nI bought a small canning machine and, now that we have a good boiler, I hope to have the girls do a little canning. They will learn how to cut up and pack fish and thus prepare for their work in the canneries. The Department suggested that the girls be taught to make fish nets. I have gone into this with the Indians and with other fishermen and have found that it is not practical. What might be practical is to have the girls and boys learn to repair nets.\n\nA rather unfortunate incident arose occurred the other day. A Catholic man and wife (we have the Catholic certificates of their baptism and marriage) asked me to admit their son who had been at the Ahousat School for six or seven years. No one here did anything to induce or to encourage them to take this perfectly right step. They said that they wanted the boy here with his brother and sisters and that they would not allow him to return to Ahousat. I did not want the boy here until his transfer had been approved and, therefore, gladly told the father that I had no objection to the boy returning with the father. The latter told me that he would be away until after Christmas.\nunfortunate part of the thing is that, without being announced, the boy arrived on November 23rd before I had been notified of his being transferred. Had I thought of it, I could have paid his fare back to Barclay Sound where his parents were and still are. I would not return him to the Ahousat School because his father and mother are opposed to this and I did not want to impose him on a family in the nearby reserve and, so, I accepted him as a guest until the matter is settled. Mr Caldwell, the Ahousat Principal, informed me over the phone that the boy's being allowed to come here while he was on the Ahousat register. It is not ridiculous but it is deeply regretted by me. What is \"ridiculous\" is that the boy was admitted to a non-Catholic School. His elder brother was brought up in that school, although he was baptized a Catholic.\n\nI have courteously explained the whole matter to the Indian Agent and to Mr Caldwell and have assured them that the mistake was made in the beginning and that time has not and cannot correct it. I have stated very plainly that I believe that the parents are the ones to blame as I do not imagine (although I have seen many strange things) that the Ahousat School would have accepted the boy had he not been declared eligible for admission on religious and other grounds by his parents. As a matter of fact, he was not eligible. What I regret is that the boy came before the transfer was made.\n\nI need not say that, as I have assured Mr Caldwell, that I have done nothing and will do nothing to get any child out of another School provided that he is rightfully there. Like the Bishop, I will, of course, stand up for our rights.\n\nProvided that both sides try to be absolutely fair, there may be differences of views but there need be no lack of justice or charity.\n\nAgain offering you our best wishes,\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\nG.

It refers to appointments at the Cariboo & Christie Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI regret most sincerely the fact that you were not notified of these changes. During the absence of Rev. Joseph Scannell in Europe I am in charge of our western affairs but I did not write to you of these changes because I thought he had done so himself prior to his departure for England. The oversight was most unintentional and I trust you will overlook it in view of the circumstances.\n\nThe following changes in the Personnel of the schools became effective July 23rd:-\n\n1. KOOTENAY Indian Residential School. Rev. M. Murphy O.M.I. was replaced by Rev. Patrick Collins O.M.I.\n\n2. CARIBOO Indian Residential School. Rev. G. Forbes O.M.I. was replaced by Rev. M. Murphy O.M.I.\n\n3. CHRISTIE Indian Residential School. This school was taken over by the Oblates from the Benedictine Fathers. I am very sorry and quite surprised that it is only rumours of the change that have reached you. I understood quite definitely that Rev. Fr. Scannell O.M.I. had conducted the negotiations with the full knowledge and consent of your Department. The Rev. Fr. Hildebrand O.S.B. has been replaced by Rev.

I will, as you suggest, write to you later about what happens to our plan to spin and card wool here. A White woman promised to come here and to give the girls a few lessons in this work but, most likely owing to the severe storms, she has not shown up yet. The mother of two of our pupils kindly spent a few days here and I had all the girls' classes called off so that she could give them lessons in making baskets. They had been doing this work as well as beadwork before she came but their work should be better now as she is an expert. My getting this woman pleased the Indians and the result is that they have sent us a fairly good supply of reeds and bark. A good deal of the beadwork has been sold; the school is reimbursed for the material used and the girl who makes the articles gets the rest of the price received.\n\nIf the Department has any instruction books in basketry or beadwork, we would greatly appreciate receiving copies.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

McGill, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have always written in plenty of time for Christmas to the various members of the Department but this time I was caught napping. The boat, which calls every ten days, was announced as being 24 hours late on Dec. 16th but came 8 hours before it was expected. As a result, nearly all my Christmas mail is going out on tonight's boat.\n\nI am pleased to say that all is running smoothly. As in the Cariboo School, I have called the older pupils in to have a chat when trouble seemed to be brewing and it has worked well. I have given only one whipping and that was to an older boy who insisted that I do so. He argued that he deserved it. He got one quarter of what he asked for.\n\nThis year, the girls have taken up beadwork and a little basketry. Within a few days, they will take the wool from the sheep and make stockings, sweaters, etc. Hitherto, we have bought the wool. Whether the new scheme will be practical or not is a question. However, they will learn to spin and card. The boys are getting regular training in carpentry and mechanics.\n\nWe had five deaths (intestinal T.B. and tubercular meningitis) but it was found that this was a coincidence and not an epidemic.\n\nWith every best wish for the New Year,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nPort Alberni, B.C., November 30, 1939\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON WEST COAST AGENCY FOR NOVEMBER.\n\nDuring the recent inspection of schools an incident in connection with fire drills came under my observation, which was worthy of note and possible correction at other schools, which may employ similar methods.\n\nDuring the daytime a false fire alarm was given by a mischievous boy and the gongs were sounded. Children in classrooms and different parts of the grounds, laundry etc., instead of proceeding quietly to their allotted places clear of the building in the event of fire, immediately rushed to their dormitories inside the building. It was very evident that they had been accustomed to taking their places in the dormitories, awaiting the alarm, when they would march out. Had there been a fire, these children would have walked into it and caused confusion and possible loss of life.\n\nAt this particular school, steps have been taken to correct this, and children and staff instructed as to procedure under any circumstances. It is respectfully suggested that school children, especially those housed in wooden buildings, be given practice in descending fire escapes by using the escapes instead of inside stairways daily, when leaving the dormitories in the mornings. Also that wooden fire escapes be well sanded during wet and frosty weather, and that alarms be sounded without previous warning, after the staff and children have been thoroughly instructed in their procedure.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nChristie Residential School was found in excellent order throughout. Children were all in apparent good health and well fed and clothed. Fire drills were being regularly given and the equipment is in good order. Kitchens and meals were inspected both being good.\n\nInstruction is being given to the older girls in cooking and baking in the kitchen, and needlework instruction was being given to the younger ones. Vocational training to boys is also being given along the lines of carpentry, boat building and repairing, also in marine engine repairs, and operation.\n\nP.B.

Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit a request of the Reverend Principal, Christie Indian Residential School, to close this school for the Summer holidays commencing April 13th, 1939.\n\nThis has been the usual practice and is desirable, owing to it being the means of preventing young girls going to work in the Canneries during summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C., Jan. 31, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF JANUARY 1939.\n\nAt Christie Residential school, the dormitories, kitchen, classrooms, outbuildings, grounds, and basement were found to be in first class order, very clean and well kept.\n\nChildren were, with one exception in splendid health, clean and attentive. Fire drills are being carried out regularly. Meals are very good, and are prepared by the older girls under the direction of a kitchen matron. More attention than formerly is being paid to vocational training, and the new machine shop is under construction.\n\nGood work is done by the girls in sewing, knitting, cookery and laundering, while the boys are engaged in carpentry, engine repairs, and various other occupations. Discipline is good, and all the pupils appear to be happy, well-fed and clothed.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 22, 1938.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nPlease accept my thanks for your letter of December 15 containing Christmas and New Year's wishes. I would ask you to kindly convey to the staff and pupils my appreciation of their good wishes.\n\nI observe with satisfaction that progress is being made in the manual training work. I have noted also your further remarks in respect to the school and pupils and have passed your letter on to the head of the Welfare and Training Division.\n\nI trust that the coming year will be a very happy and successful one for you, the staff and the pupils of the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nReverend G.

Crerar,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRight Honourable and Dear Sir:\n\nYou will appreciate brevity. After reading the radio addresses of representative Indians throughout Canada, I thought that you might be interested to know that, for the last two years, the Indian pupils of this school have given full length plays. I enclose a picture of those boys who took part in our presentation of Cardinal Wiseman's two-hour \"Hidden Gem.\" The boys' English has improved and they speak more distinctly and in a much louder tone of voice than they did before we started giving plays. They are less bashful and awkward in public and, later on, they should be able to speak creditably in their council meetings.\n\nI might add that the boys built the stage and made the scenery. The girls made the stage curtains (of jute sacks) and the costumes.\n\nThe Inspector of schools, the White and the Japanese people of Tofino and the Indians were pleasantly surprised with our venture.\n\nWith every best wish, I beg to remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Rev.) George Forbes, O.M.I.\nCopy and papers to\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n25/6/40.\n\nReverend and dear Sir,-\n\nI am directed by my Minister to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 13th instant enclosing a photograph of your Indian pupils who took part in the presentation of Cardinal Wiseman's \"Hidden Gem\". Mr. Crerar was much interested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nReverend George Forbes, O.M.I.,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nOttawa, June 19, 1940.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nMany thanks for your kindness in forwarding photograph of the children taking part in the drama, \"Hidden Gem\". You invite my observations with regard to the appearance of the children and I must say that their appearance indicates beyond any doubt that they are not suffering from malnutrition or hidden sorrow.\n\nThe difficulties of a landing stage is well known to the Department and there has been considerable correspondence built up around this subject, much of it with the Public Works Department.\n\nHeretofore we have been unable to obtain sums of money necessary for this undertaking, and I am not certain even that any well defined and practicable scheme of construction has yet been devised. I understand that in the opinion of engineers who know the coast that the heavy surf of this particular beach would make the maintenance of a wharf or landing stage a difficult matter.\n\nIn any event, no funds are provided in our estimates for this year for work of this nature and, of course, the darkness and uncertainty of the future make me hesitate to offer any opinion as to when the matter can again be given serious consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nReverend G.

Pratt, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nI have a letter from the Superintendent of the Kakawis Indian school, near Tofino. Apparently, he has heard that there is to be a cut in the grant to the Indian schools, and he wants me to point out that they are very unfavourably situated inasmuch as they have no facilities for keeping a farm as the surrounding territory is mostly rock, and they also have pretty heavy freight bills.\n\nI don't think you have any intention of cutting down grants to the Indian Boarding Schools, but please advise me as to this. It would be very unfair to do so with the increased cost of living.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. W.

Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill Encl.\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, June 27, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of June 22, with reference to the per capita allowance of the Christie (Kakawis) Indian Residential School.\n\nFor some years past the Department has only included in the annual estimates a percentage of the amount that would be required if all Indian residential schools in Canada had their full enrolment throughout the academic year. This policy was first adopted in the fiscal year 1933-34, at which time the average attendance at all Indian residential schools was only 92% of the authorized enrolment and, therefore, the amount voted was sufficient to meet per capita grant payments.\n\nHowever, in the last two or three years practically all Indian residential schools have enrolled their full authorized number of pupils and in many cases have been carrying several pupils more than their authorized pupilage. As a result the average attendance at all Indian residential schools for the past year has greatly increased. On the other hand, despite the return last year of the 5% deduction, the percentage of the actual appropriation provided by Parliament remains the same. Consequently, the amount provided for per capita grants will not permit our paying more than 92.24% of the authorized pupilage at any Indian residential school. I regret that this contingency has arisen but due to present conditions it is impossible to remedy it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nN. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nA. W.

All fire fighting appliances were in good order. The pupils were all in splendid health and were clean, well clothed, well fed, attentive and industrious. Splendid progress is being made in vocational training.\n\nGirls were being taught wool combing, carding, spinning and knitting, and are producing first class sweaters, socks, etc., through every process from sheep shearing to the finished article.

I am particularly interested in physical culture or physical development and frequently express regret that we have not been able to do more in the organization of physical culture classes at our residential schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nI read with interest your comments on the dangers associated with the transportation of children to and from the Christie School. These dangers must be very real to you and to the members of your staff. It would appear from the records here, however, that we have been particularly fortunate and that there has been no loss of life reported to the Department at any time in recent years.\n\nIt is unnecessary to state that any request you may make in due course for a grant necessary to help you provide for transportation costs will be sympathetically reviewed by the officials of this Branch. I would not be frank with you, however, if I did not state that in my judgment it is going to be exceedingly difficult for us to secure from Parliament the funds required -\n\nReverend George Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawin, B.C.\nrequired to maintain our educational institutions in the future in the sense that we have maintained them in the past. We are, as you know, fighting at this time for our survival and almost every service is subordinated to the Nation's war effort. I think you will agree with me that the Government has been very liberal until now in providing educational facilities for the Indian population. With the funds at our disposal limited, with requests for help steadily multiplying and with the Indian pupil enrolment increasing at the rate of approximately 300 pupils per annum, it is not an easy thing to pass judgment and reach decisions on the requests before us from time to time. We do feel, however, that a period as critical as this demands devotion and self-sacrifice on the part of all of us.\n\nI want to thank you very heartily on behalf of the staff here for the work you are doing at the Christie School. Summaries of the reports reaching this Branch, of your school, have been sent forward from time to time to the Minister for his information.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to wish you, the members of your staff and the pupils in attendance at your school a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nDear Mr. Haig:\n\nEnclosed, please find a picture of some of our pupils and copies of letters from the director of Amateur Drama (University of BC) and the Director of Physical Training in BC. One letter is addressed to J. Schwab, dear director of physical training. There is also an excerpt from the BC Drama Bulletin about our drama club.\n\nOn second thought, I am enclosing a picture for Mr. Philip Phelan also so as to cause no envy or jealousy.\n\nAs you are aware, our grant for transportation of children was cut in half so that we are allowed only $3750 to send them home. We are allowed only the same amount to bring them back. Before I understood the situation, I tried to have have nearly all the Indians take their children home in their boats but the money saved is not worth the risk involved\u2014there have been too many drownings (half a dozen or more) during the last couple of months.\nSo far no school children have been involved in such accidents although several nearly were on their way home from school. Harry Dick was taking his children to Nootka when his motor broke down. Fortunately, Father Sorenson came along in his boat and was able to supply a replacement for the broken part. A little later, Harry Dick's motor broke down again. His wife and children drifted helplessly until a \"fish-packer\" came by. This boat put a line on the Indians' boat and towed it upon reaching Nootka, the captain of the \"fish-packer\" found that he had only a piece of packer. He had only a piece of line as Harry Dick's boat on the end of the line. As a result, the Indians and family drifted all night. They found only in the morning. After weeks ago, a similar accident happened to Jack Tom, a woman and young girl. The boat was dashed upon the rocks after the engine had broken down, in a complete loss. The man rescued the woman and child by swimming ashore. Jan May has read of two of the best West Coast boatmen & a fish buyer had a similar accident - all were lost.\n\nShould there be an accident involving...\npupils coming to school or going home,\nyou notice what would appear in the papers.\nThe risk is not worth the money saved. Between\n$8000 $100 should be allowed to send the children\nhome on similar amount to bring them back.\nThe Opitsaht, a small vessel of the Skegness\nchildren could go some in their parent's boats\nbut not more from Bareley Sound, Nootka, Capesee,\nbut not more from Bareley Sound, Nootka, Capesee,\nbut not more from Bareley Sound, Nootka, Capesee,\nbut not more from Bareley Sound, Nootka, Capesee.\n\nNow that you have seen the enlarged pic-\ntures, you may be tempted to pay us a visit to\nsee up the situation.\nFather Seaman made a trip on an Indian\nboat and him what he thinks of it.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nG. Gordon Oriel.\nRev. Father G. Forbes, O.M.I.\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawin, B.C.\n\nDear Father Forbes,\n\nI have the pleasure of informing you that the Edmonton Challenge Cup has been awarded to your school for the best dramatic work done by an Indian group during the past twelve months.\n\nIt has been just returned to us from the Inukmeep Reserve where it was won last year, and as soon as we can the name of your school engraved on it, it will be forwarded to you to hold for the next twelve months.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nI. Bullock-Webster\n\nTHE EDMONTON CHALLENGE CUP\n\nThe handsome cup that the name of that distinguished Mohawk Chief who has taken so singular an interest in the dramatic work of the Indians of this Province, has been awarded this year to the:\n\nChristie Residential Indian School\nKakawin B.C.\n\nfor the consistently high standard of the dramatic work accomplished.\n\nTheir play \"The Hidden Gem,\" written years ago by Cardinal Wiseman, was an outstanding example of what our Indians are capable of doing under good direction.\n\nThe diction, the sincerity of emotional feeling, and the general stage technique made this memorable performance. We congratulate this club on its success, and we hope that some other club or reserve may be able to win the Cup next year. Such good work is being done by the Om-Om-sees Chap-Lee at Inukmeep, who were last year's winners and by the Christie School at Kakawin, that the others will have to work hard in order to carry the laurels to some other part of the Province.\n\nSome photos of the Kakawin Players were exhibited in Eastern Canada recently and attracted general interest.\n\nAppreciation\n\nProfessor Malyn Jones, Instructor in Speech and Drama.\nPort Alberni, B.C., Sept. 30, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON WEST COAST AGENCY FOR SEPT.\n\nChristie Residential school was thoroughly inspected and everything was found to be satisfactory. The health was excellent and no after effects of the Influenza apart from some tonsillitis, were noted. Meals were very good, being varied and well prepared. All the classes were well attended and good progress was being made in vocational training and domestic science.\n\nBuildings, outhouses and basements were all tidy and well kept. Dormitories and classrooms were in excellent order and fire appliances adequate and in good working order.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nPort Alberni, B.C., July 31, 1940.\n\nAgent's report on West Coast Agency for July.\n\nChristie Residential school was inspected and found to be in first class order. The interior has been redecorated and all dormitories, class rooms and kitchen were spotlessly clean. Basements, outbuildings and grounds also were in first class order.\n\nFire hose in hallways was not in good order and was leaking. This was due to hose being folded in layers. New hose is being supplied and instructions were given to have the vocational training class build hose reels to prevent hose cracking. Extinguishers and other equipment are all in order. Fire escape at rear of building needs alteration and repair, and this will be done by the school staff.\n\nChildren were all in good health, except one confined to bed with a slight cold.\n\nMeals were very good, well cooked and varied.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 27, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of June 28, with reference to the per capita allowance of the Christie (Kakswis) Indian Residential School.\n\nFor some years past the Department has only included in the annual estimates a percentage of the amount that would be required if all Indian residential schools in Canada had their full enrolment throughout the academic year. This policy was first adopted in the fiscal year 1933-34, at which time the average attendance at all Indian residential schools was only 95% of the authorized enrolment and, therefore, the amount voted was sufficient to meet per capita grant payments.\n\nHowever, in the last two or three years practically all Indian residential schools have enrolled their full authorized number of pupils and in many cases have been carrying several pupils more than their authorized pupilage. As a result the average attendance at all Indian residential schools for the past year has greatly increased. On the other hand, despite the return last year of the 5% deduction, the percentage of the actual appropriation provided by Parliament remains the same. Consequently, the amount provided for per capita grants will not permit our paying more than 92.24% of the authorized pupilage at any Indian residential school. I regret that this contingency has arisen but due to present conditions it is impossible to remedy it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nR. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n2 B.C. Indian Girls Win Poster Contest Awards\n\nBy MILDRED VALLEY THORNTON\n\nWinners of the various prizes in the Victory Contest for 1944 sponsored by the Nathan Foundation have recently been announced. It is the godparent to many worthwhile enterprises for cultural progress and annually offers large sums of money and scholarships for art work of high merit. This year they launched the 18th poster contest for the Promotion of Humane Education.\n\nThe animal poster contest is twofold in purpose. It aims to encourage artistic proficiency and to inculcate in children everywhere the love and proper regard for animals and wild life.\n\nThis group which is open to grades 1 to 6 drew a great many entries from all over Canada and the United States. Some 135 prizes were awarded. Four of the winners in this class were Canadians, and two out of the four were Indian children living in British Columbia.\n\nPeople who are concerned with the preservation and encouragement of native art in this province will be gratified at this evidence of existing talent among modern Indian children who are able to hold their own in open competition with white children from the whole of the continent.\n\nBoth winners are girls. Annie George is a pupil at the Indian Day School of Penticton, and Helena Titian brings honor to the Christie Indian School at Kakawis, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island.\n1944 PRIZE WINNERS\nIN THE\nVICTORY CONTEST\nOF THE LATHAM FOUNDATION\nFor the Promotion of Humane Education\n(19th Annual Poster Contest)\n\nGROUP I \u2014 GRADES 1, 2, AND 3\n\nFIRST PRIZE\nAdams, Robert, Sherwood School, Suisun, Calif.\nBaker, Margaret, St. James School, Washington, Iowa\nBargerstock, Ann, Craddock Elementary School, Portsmouth, Va.\nGonzales, Augustina, Lincoln School, Hartford, Calif.\nGraham, Robert, Mayfield School, Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nNavlin, Philip, Washington School, Corvallis, Ore.\nPearson, Joyce, Enterprise School, Plymouth, Calif.\nPurdy, Pearl, Lincoln School, Ossining, N.

Use large bold areas and rich color schemes.\n\n2. Avoid lettering that is hard to read. Use letters that are bold in character and easily read at a distance.\n\n3. While white or cream paper is good, very effective posters are obtained by using dark colors. Use black, dark blue, deep green, mahogany, dark brown, and black.\n\n4. Do not attempt to put too much in your poster, and make your design fill the space fully. If you use outlines on your designs, make these outlines quite heavy, at least one-eighth of an inch thick.\n\n5. Remember that your poster is not of much value unless it tells the story of your message effectively. A good poster counts in judging the poster contest.\n\n6. It will help considerably if you set your poster up a few yards away and see if it carries well. Good posters should be easy to read at a distance of ten feet or more.\n\nHuman Education Is the Cornerstone of Civilization\n\nCONDENSED REPORT OF THE LATHAM FOUNDATION ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST YEAR\n\nCHILDREN reached in the public and parochial schools 123,000\nADULTS contacted in churches, service clubs, etc. 15,300\nSTORIES for children published in rural press 2,612\nENTRANTS in International Poster Contest 1,310\nCOUNTRIES LISTED 48 States U.S.A., Canada, Mexico\nEXHIBITS (18 circuits) travelling throughout the year covered California towns 25\nand the following states:\n\nColorado Massachusetts Pennsylvania\nFlorida Minnesota Rhode Island\nGeorgia Montana South Dakota\nIllinois New York Utah\nKansas Ohio Washington\n\nAlso Canada, Honolulu, and Mexico.\n\nVISITORS who viewed the travelling posters estimated 105,000\nSCHOLARSHIPS donated by 15 art schools in the U.S. for winners in contest 21\nLITERATURE published and circulated for special purposes, including material for the hard-won fight against the Oakland Municipal Zoo 139,987\nAWARDS for heroes, presented at public ceremonies in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Waco, Texas\nSPECIAL NOTICE ON SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nAll high school students are particularly invited to participate in the poster contest.

Pupils all appeared to be very happy and settling down for the new term. Kitchens, dormitories, outhouses, basement and grounds were inspected and found all in good order. Meals were very good, varied and well cooked. Vocational training, both boys and girls, is excellent and suited to the needs of the Coastal Indians. At the time of my visit, the School was being inspected by Rev. J. Bradley, O.M.I., on behalf of Bishop Cody, and he expressed his great satisfaction as to the school in general and the progress of the pupils.\n\nP.B.

Pupils have just returned from summer holiday and are settling down to their studies. Good work is being done in the vocational training branch and a very good fishing troller is being built by the boys, while the girls are making very good progress in domestic science.\n\nP.B.

C.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 6 and also certain literature and a clipping from the Vancouver Sun, relating to the Latham Foundation Poster Contest, sent forward therewith.\n\nIt was, to the officials of this Division and to myself, a source of great satisfaction to learn that two of our Indian pupils had won prizes in this competition. It would be appreciated if you conveyed to the Principals of these Schools, when you have an opportunity to do so, our sense of appreciation.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nNo doubt the Department will be interested in the enclosed clipping from the Vancouver Sun of the 29th ultimo showing that two Indian children of this Province have won an award in the Latham Foundation Poster Contest. It will be observed from the enclosed prize list that other successful contestants in the same classes as the two Indian children are from high-grade urban schools in the United States and elsewhere. It will also be noted that the competition is open to professional artists as well as school children.\n\nThe Department is probably familiar with the activities of the Latham Foundation which was established to promote humane treatment of animals and until the outbreak of the present war held poster contests on this subject which were contributed to by children and artists all over the world.\n\nFormerly, only the Okanagan school children contributed posters in these competitions when Mr. Inspector Coleman was Indian Agent in that district, but during the past two years he has endeavoured to interest all the Indian schools in this Province in this very worthwhile project and the Latham Foundation are taking a very keen interest in the entries of our children.\n\nI enclose the 1942 poster contest circular which will give some idea of the scope of the competition, and a copy of the mimeographed instruction book on preparation of posters which the Foundation have kindly supplied for every Indian school in this Province.\n\nD.M.

McKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Box 70\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Schools\n\nHaving just completed a tour of inspection of schools and hospitals, I feel that I should bring to the attention of the Department a matter which will present itself within a year or so.\n\nI refer to the conditioning of Christie Residential School.\n\nThis school was built forty-five years ago, facing the sea, of wood frame construction, and while it has been very well cared for, it is fast approaching the stage where re-building is indicated, or at least extensive repair and maintenance.\n\nIt would appear that when the present site was chosen, the matter of transportation and landing of supplies was entirely overlooked; as the only facilities for landing supplies is by canoe and surf boat, which is a great hardship, and at times dangerous.\n\nMy reason for broaching this matter is that the Air Force Hospital situated at Long Beach, a few miles from Kakawin, is now closed and would make an ideal school if it could be transferred to the Department or taken over by the Church.\n\nSituated within easy reach of Tofino and Ucluelet, on a new highway, it is far better than the present site, insofar as transportation is concerned.\n\nThe building has a capacity of 125 beds, and is well finished inside, and it is thought that no time should be lost in making application for its transfer, pending further investigation.\n\nShould the Department consider the proposal, I would respectfully request that instruction be given me regarding inspection and report.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter of the 15th ultimo suggesting that we take over the Air Force Hospital situated at Long Beach, near Kakawis, the location of the Christie Indian Residential School, and transfer this school to that building as the Christie School is now very old and difficult to keep up.\n\nWhile the Indian Agent has given very little information on the matter and has not stated whether he has personally inspected the building or discussed the matter with the Reverend Principal of the Residential school in question, it would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me if this building could be secured for this purpose and if so I will have it inspected and the matter thoroughly investigated for a further report.\n\nHor D.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, suggesting that we take over the former Air Force hospital at Long Beach, near Kakawis, in order to replace the present Christie Residential School.\n\nI discussed your letter with the Director yesterday and it is felt that we should have more definite information before making any application to the Air Force or the War Assets Corporation.\n\nWe would like to know the size of the different rooms in the building and what dormitory accommodation would be available.\n\nWe would also like to know in what manner the building is heated and if there is an ample supply of water. Further, please ascertain if the sewage system is in good condition.\n\nIs there any equipment in this building or has the equipment been removed?\n\nThe Principal of the School should also be consulted and given an opportunity to inspect the building, so that he can report to his Provincial, Reverend J. Scannell, O.M.I.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 6th November, 1945.\n\nMr. P.B.

B. Ashbridge\nIndian Agent\nINSPECTION OF SCHOOLS:\n\nChristie Residential School was found in excellent order.\nAll dormitories, kitchens, outbuildings and classrooms were very clean and orderly.

Main water supply is from Air Port line, which crosses the mud flats 4000 yards from Hospital, and could be tapped at pumping station on shore of Grice Bay. (See diagram) Water supply should be surveyed by a competent engineer and water rights obtained.\n\nBUILDING Frame construction: walls outside, shingled. Building set on cement blocks. One story high, with ten foot ceilings. Rounded roof, covered with heavy roofing material. Inside walls finished with 3 ply, painted in two tone color, and has a pleasing appearance. Floors are covered with heavy \"Battle ship\" linoleum.\n\nHOSPITAL EQUIPMENT Has been removed from building, with the exception of kitchen stove, and refrigerator (10 X 10 X 7)\n\nLIGHTING Electric: supplied by Air Port. Separate generator. Could be set up at the Hospital. Electric fixtures in good order.\n\nGENERAL It is considered that the site and the buildings would be ideal for a Residential school. Located on the sea front and away from Reserves, with a good highway connecting it with Ucluelet to the East, and Tofino Hospital, etc., to the West. It would be advisable to have a building Inspector, also water Engineer, make thorough inspection, particularly in connection with water supply.\n\nP. B. Ashbyridge\nIndian Agent\nDeputy Minister, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter, file 159-0-1, dated 18th January, 1946, in which you make enquiries as to the availability of the RCAF hospital at Tofino for use as an Indian Residential School.\n\nThis hospital is situated a few miles from RCAF Station, Tofino, and was constructed as a casualty hospital during the Japanese threat of 1942. It was to be available for all Services.\n\nPlans indicate that there will be no further requirement for a hospital of this size in the area, insofar as this Department is concerned.\n\nIt is the intention of this Department, therefore, to declare the hospital surplus to requirements. Provided the Departments of National Defence (Naval Service and Army) have no requirement for the facilities and that the Wartime Committee on Hospitalization does not consider the hospital is required to continue in operation as such, the building will likely be made available to your Department through the Crown Assets Allocation Committee.\n\nI would suggest, therefore, that you file application with that Committee to acquire the hospital in question, if and when it becomes available.\n\nIf the building becomes available to your Department, being a Federal Government Department, the Crown Assets Allocation Committee would dispose of it by direct allocation without reference to the War Assets Corporation, so that the matter of costs would not enter into this transaction, except for bookkeeping purposes.\n\nH F Gordon\nDeputy Minister\nOttawa, February 20, 1946.\n\nDear Father Mulvihill:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to taking over the Air Force Hospital near Tofino.

Mr. Gibson indicates that this hospital is located on or adjacent to property held as a possible tourist resort which property was donated for this latter purpose by Mr. A.C. Lovekin. Mr. Gibson feels that an Indian Residential site here would depress adjacent property values and ruin the property as a tourist site.\n\nPlease have a draft reply prepared for the Minister's signature to Mr. Gibson.\n\nPRIVATE SECRETARY\n\nMr. Hoey -\n\nFor draft reply.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario,\n11th June, 1946.\n\nHonourable J. A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nI am advised that your Department has been considering the purchase of the RCAF hospital at Tofino, B.C. as a possible site for the Christie Indian Residential School, which is presently located at Kakawis, B.C., and it was intended, if you went ahead with this project, that the Kakawis School would be abandoned and the students transferred to the RCAF hospital at Long Beach, Tofino.\n\nYou are probably not aware that this hospital site is on the famous Long Beach which has long been held as a possible tourist resort, and that the property on which this hospital is located was donated as a patriotic gesture by Mr. A. C. Lovekin, who owns considerable adjoining property. It is felt that this property should not be sold by the War Assets Corporation to your Department for Indian Residential School purposes, as there is no doubt that such a course would prejudice the value of the adjoining property for summer resort purposes.\n\nI had already written to the Principal, Father Mulvihill, of the Christie's Indian Residential School, suggesting that he would be better advised to have his school located at Ucluelet, where the War Assets Corporation have numerous buildings suitable for his purpose, and where there is also agricultural ground which the Tofino site does not have.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would have your officials allow me to make representations before\n\n(over)\nany final decision is made in this regard, as I believe that Mr. Lovekin is entitled to every consideration.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L. Gibson\n\n(J. L. Gibson)\nMember for Comox-Alberni.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6439, file 879-1, part 2)\nJune 24, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. NEARY.\n\nRe: Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nOn this file there is considerable correspondence, of which you are aware, regarding an attempt that has been made to secure the former RCAF hospital at Tofino, B.C., to be used as a replacement for the present Christie Residential School. In letter dated June 7 we were advised by the Crown Assets Allocation Committee that this building had not yet been reported surplus to the requirements of the Department of National Defence for Air.\n\nI now desire to direct your attention to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 12, enclosing letter received from Mr. J. L. Gibson, M.P., also letter received from R. S. Stuart Yates.\n\nThe information contained in both these letters is practically the same and is to the effect that the site upon which the hospital is situated was donated to the Crown by Mr. A. G. Lovekin, who objects to an Indian residential school being erected so close to his own home.\n\nOf course, there are two courses we may follow, (1) endeavour to secure the building or (2) discontinue our efforts in that respect, in view of the protest received.\n\nI would appreciate your directions in the matter before preparing replies to these two letters.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJune 3rd, 1946.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have been informed that application has been made by the Catholic Indian Mission of Kakawis, Vancouver Island, B.C., to the Crown or War Assets Corporation for the purchase or acquisition of the hospital site at Long Beach, Vancouver Island, for use as an Indian Residential School. If such is the case, I have to draw to your attention the following matters.\n\nThe site upon which the said hospital is situated was donated to the Crown by my client, Mr. A. C. Lovekin, specifically for hospital purposes. The property forms part of Lot 162, Clayoquot District, on which Mr. Lovekin's home is situated, and if it were put to the use contemplated under the application above referred to the remaining part of Lot 162 and his home property would be greatly depreciated in value. In view of Mr. Lovekin's generosity in donating the property to the Crown, granting of the application of the Catholic Indian Mission would be a great injustice to Mr. Lovekin.\n\nOther adjacent property owners are also opposed to the granting of the application, and I have to request that under the circumstances you kindly do whatever may be necessary to see that the property is not put to such use or transfer made to the Mission.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Conditions were found to be good on all occasions.\n\nN.W. Garrard,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 4, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Yates:\n\nI have hesitated to reply to your letter of June 3rd until now in the hope that I would secure additional information with respect to the establishment of an Indian residential school on the hospital site at Long Beach, Vancouver Island.\n\nIt would appear that a well-equipped residential school building is urgently needed in this particular district. The proposal now under consideration is that the present buildings be transferred to this department and that the buildings when transferred be used for residential school purposes. If such a transfer were made, the property would of course remain the property of the Crown in the right of the Dominion, although the school itself would be operated by a religious order, probably the Oblate Order.\n\nIs it Mr. Lovekin's desire that the buildings should be dismantled and removed from the site, or is he prepared to allow the buildings to remain and be used for purposes other than the education of the Indian children of the district? In this connection, I may state that it is somewhat unusual to have an objection to the establishment of an Indian residential school in any district; in fact, petitions reach us from time to time for the establishment of such schools in or near comparatively large centres. The Mohawk Institute at Brantford, Ontario, for example, is located in the city of Brantford, and the Brandon residential school is close to the city of Brandon.\n\n.... It would be\nIt would be deeply appreciated by me if you could review the matter again with Mr. Lovekin and let me have at your earliest convenience an expression of his views. Should the buildings be transferred to the War Assets Corporation, they will probably be sold by tender to the highest bidder.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. S.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSince the Indian Department has not succeeded in acquiring the RCAF Hospital at Long Beach on the west coast of Vancouver Island for an Indian Residential School, the Indian Commissioner for B.C. suggested that I bring this to the attention of the Joint Committee of Parliament, as the Department represents a public institution, while private interests are represented by Hon. J.L. Gibson M.P., who is opposing the application of your Department.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner told me the present school is very old, and would cost about two or three hundred thousand dollars in the very near future to build a new school.\n\nThis expenditure would not be necessary were the Department able to acquire the hospital in question.\n\nWill you please exert every effort to defeat the rapacious hand of the exploiter, so that the public's funds will not be given to private benefits because as a public institution, we have a more legitimate claim.\n\nThis acquisition would place the school in Government property, whereas the present school site belongs to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nPlease advise me of your decision in this matter, and thanking you in anticipation of your usual great interest in such matters, but I must express my regrets that I did not see you, when I testified before the Joint Committee of Parliament on the Indian Act.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nAndrew Paull\nPresident\nNorth American Indian Brotherhood.\nTo the Honourable Members\nSpecial Joint Committee\nOf the Senate and the House of Commons\nOn the Indian Act.\n\nHonourable Gentlemen\u2014\n\nI have been advised, and I consider it to be imperatively necessary as a public duty to make a sincere appeal to your Honourable Committee, to take such action as may be necessary at your most early convenience, so that the former RCAF Hospital at Long Beach on the west coast of Vancouver Island in the province of B.C., may be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs to be used as an Indian Residential School.\n\nThe present Indian Residential School is not far away, in an old building a fire trap, and not accessible by road, and when the seas are rough it is impossible to land food and other supplies.\n\nThis hospital has been applied for by the Indian Department, but I am told that some citizens of the district are opposing it, with the view of acquiring the buildings for private enterprise.\n\nIf this hospital is not now acquired, public funds to the amount of at least $200,000.00 would have to be spent to build a new school, to replace the present antiquated and dilapidated school.\n\nThere is no reason in my opinion why public funds should be so spent, for the benefit of private enterprise, and I am told that the opposition by those desiring the place is so strong that I have been advised to appeal to your Committee, so that you may take the necessary action for the immediate acquisition by the Indian Department before the children return from their holidays.\n\nThe acquiring of the hospital as an Indian Residential School will be in the public interest, if only for the sake of economy, and beg for your very sympathetic action.\n\nI am told that the application by the Indian Department has so far failed because of the opposition by private interests.\n\nThanking your Honourable Committee in anticipation of your favorable action, have the honour to be,\n\nRespectfully yours\n\nAndrew Paul\nPresident\nNorth American Indian Brotherhood.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Lovekin, of Long Beach,\nVancouver Island, B.C., donated a ten-acre parcel of\nland to the Crown for the purpose of use as a hospital\nin connection with the Royal Canadian Air Force Station\nat Long Beach. This donation was consummated by a Con-\nveyance of the said ten acres, being a part of Lot 162,\non which Mr. Lovekin's own home is situated.\n\nRecently it has been brought to my attention that\nthe said ten-acre parcel of land was being considered\nthrough the Department of Indian Affairs as the site for\nan Indian Residential School. I have written to the\nMember of Parliament for the Constituency in which this\nland is situated, and to several other persons asking that\nsteps be taken to prevent the use of the said property for\nthat purpose. If your Department does not require the ten\nacres donated by Mr. Lovekin for Hospital purposes, I feel\nthat it is only fair that the land be reconveyed to him,\nand further I feel very strongly that it should not on any\naccount be used for Indian Residential School purposes, as\nsuch use would definitely depreciate the value of the\nremainder of his property to a serious degree.\n\nAs a result of my letters referred to above, I\nhave received a letter from the Director of Indian Affairs\nBranch of the Department of Mines and Resources, in which\nit was admitted that a proposal is being considered whereby\nthe buildings would be transferred to that Department, and\nwhen so transferred would be used for residential school\npurposes.\nIt is perhaps difficult for officials at Ottawa to realize the tremendous depreciation which such use would cause to the value of Mr. Lovekin's remaining property, but when I inform you that Mr. Lovekin chose this site in preference to all other property in Vancouver Island for the purpose of building his home, and when so chosen he expended a sum considerably in excess of $10,000.00 in the construction of the home, you will gain a better realization of my argument in this respect. I should also point out that there is any amount of property suitable for school purposes in the vicinity of Tofino, or Long Beach, the use of which would not depreciate valuable property to the extent that the proposal now under consideration would do if carried out.\n\nThe Director has asked me to inform him of Mr. Lovekin's desire in respect to the buildings constructed for hospital purposes on the said property, and asking if he, Mr. Lovekin, wished the buildings dismantled and moved from the site; or if he would be prepared to allow the buildings to remain and be used for purposes other than the education of the Indian children of the District. As yet I have not been able to obtain Mr. Lovekin's views in that respect but felt that I should write you immediately and request that you take some steps to see that the property would not be used as contemplated by the said proposal. In due course I will reply to the letter from the Director, but have to request in the meantime that you give this matter your favorable consideration and use your best endeavours to see that the property donated by Mr. Lovekin is not put to any use which would depreciate the value of his remaining land.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd) R.

Baird, Esq.,  \nCanadian National Railways,  \nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing copies of two letters received by Mrs. James Denholm, Long Beach, from J. L. Gibson, M.P., from which you will see that rumours recently drawn to my attention apparently are well founded.\n\nYou will recall that Mr. A.G. Lovskin donated a ten acre portion of Lot 162, Clayoquot District, to the Crown specifically as a hospital site in connection with the R.C.A.F. Station at Long Beach. If, as it now appears, the said site is no longer required by the Crown for that purpose, I contend that it should be reconveyed to Mr. Lovskin. To put that property to the use referred to in the enclosed letters would greatly depreciate the value of the remainder of Lot 162 on which Mr. Lovskin's home is situated, and it would be a great injustice to Mr. Lovskin if the Crown permitted the property to be used for anything but a hospital site.\n\nI am also writing to War Assets Corporation informing them of these matters, but I would be pleased if you would also use whatever influence you can to prevent the property being used for purposes other than hospital site. I also would like you to let me have your comments on this subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) R. S. Stuart Yates.\n\nP.S. Would you kindly return the enclosed copies of letters when replying to this letter.\nDepartment of National Defence for Air\nOffice of the Deputy Minister\n\nOttawa, July 2nd, 1946.\n\nAttention: Mr. E. E. Thompson\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: R.C.A.F. Hospital, Tofino, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter dated June 15th, your file 225-262-600, it is advised that upon receiving the telephone call from Mr. Thompson, the surplus declaration which had already been prepared declaring the Hospital at Tofino surplus was held up temporarily until the circumstances could be reviewed.\n\nIt now appears that the property upon which this Hospital was constructed was obtained from Mr. Lovskin for a nominal sum and that the Crown erected thereon a Hospital and other facilities at a cost of approximately $250,000.00. Mr. Lovskin's generosity is acknowledged and his concern over the future use of the property is appreciated; but since another Federal Government Department appears to have a use for this surplus Air Force property and the value of the structures in place is vastly greater than their salvage value, I suggest that the future disposal of this property is a matter for the consideration of your Committee, and I am therefore arranging for the declaration to be sent forward to you.\n\nIncidentally, mention seems to be made of the effect of Order-in-Council P.C. 5024 dated 28th August, 1945. This Order-in-Council does not appear to bear directly on the present case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"P. B. Conroy\"\nfor H. F. Gordon,\nDeputy Minister\n\nCrown Assets Allocation Committee,\n375 Wellington Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJune 3rd, 1946\n\nWar Assets Corporation,\n4095 St. Catherine St. W.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIt has been drawn to my attention that the property at Long Beach, Vancouver Island, B.C., which my client, Mr. A.C. Lovekin, donated to the Crown specifically as a site for the hospital to be operated in conjunction with the R.C.A.F. Station at Long Beach, is no longer used for this purpose and that your Corporation has been approached or applied to by Christie's Indian Residential School of Kakawin, Vancouver Island, for permission to acquire or occupy the same.\n\nThe ten-acre parcel of land so donated by Mr. Lovekin forms part of Lot 152, Clayoquot District, upon which Mr. Lovekin's home is situated. If the hospital site were transferred to the Catholic Indian Mission for school purposes, or allowed to be used for such purposes, it would greatly depreciate the value of the remainder of the said Lot 152, and it would be a great injustice to Mr. Lovekin. In my opinion if the Crown has no further use for the ten-acre parcel of land for hospital purposes it should be reconveyed to him.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you kindly give this matter your serious consideration and that no application for the transfer of the said property from the Crown be approved or accepted except to reconvey the property to Mr. Lovekin should it no longer be required for hospital purposes. I would be pleased to hear from you in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Stuart Yates\nOttawa, July 26, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nProposed School Site at Tofino.\n\nHerewith is the correspondence received today from Crown Assets Allocation Committee dealing with the above property. I understand that you are waiting for an answer to your letter of July 4th to Mr. Yates before making any further considerations about this situation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 4th, 1946, enquiring as to whether it was Mr. Lovekin's desire that the building should be dismantled and removed from the site, I have to say that Mr. Lovekin has no desire to see this done at this time, but if that were the only alternative to a mission school then decidedly his wish would be to have the buildings removed.\n\nHowever, as I pointed out in my former letter, it is contended that inasmuch as the property was donated by Mr. Lovekin to the Crown for hospital purposes, and in the belief that it would be permanently used for that purpose, the Crown should reconvey the property to him now that it is no longer required for that purpose. Any other use or disposition of the land would be most unjust.\n\nI can quite understand that petitions reach your Department for the establishment of mission schools comparatively near large centres. The two situations however are entirely different. In Mr. Lovekin's case, out of loyalty he donated a ten acre parcel of waterfront property out of the same lot on which he had built his home, which is situated on one of the most desirable locations on Long Beach.\n\nAny school established on this property would most decidedly deteriorate the value of his remaining home property. Residents of the area agree on this subject and some of them have also written to the Member of Parliament representing Alberni District voicing strong protest. The Member himself, knowing the situation at Long Beach agrees with them on this subject as he has stated by letter to me.\nIn your letter you state that if the buildings should be transferred to the War Assets Corporation they would probably be sold by tender to the highest bidder. I understand that the matter is already in the hands of the Crown Assets Allocation Committee according to a letter received from the Deputy Minister of National Defence for Air. In the event that the War Assets Corporation takes over the buildings and can dispose of them only under bids received, Mr. Lovekin might consider making a bid. Mr. Lovekin's son is making a journey to Long Beach and will report on his inspection of the buildings on his return to Victoria. It is expected that the son will make his inspection during the next thirty days and I will be writing the Crown Assets Allocation Commission on his return.\n\nIn closing I wish to make it clear that Mr. Lovekin is primarily concerned with the use of the land and that if the Crown abandons its use as a hospital site, it should not put the land to any other use but should reconvey it. If the Crown should, however, wish to dispose of the buildings by public tender, that is satisfactory to Mr. Lovekin so long as the title to the land is reconveyed to him. Any bid to be submitted by Mr. Lovekin will be dependent upon the report made as to the value of the buildings from Mr. Lovekin's viewpoint.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRSSY/AJM\nOttawa, August 29, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter 223-280-528 (4) of August 20.

I understand from Father Plourde that Father Scannell will be returning to Ottawa tonight.\n\nAs it would seem evident that Mr. Yates is prepared to carry this matter to the Courts, I would appreciate your decision as to whether you wish,\n\n(a) to discuss this matter tomorrow with Father Plourde, Father Scannell and myself,\n\nor\n\n(b) to withdraw our application for use of this base.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOctober 31, 1946.\n\nC. W. Jackson, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nFurther to your letter of August 29, 1946, concerning the proposal to establish an Indian Residential School in the R.C.A.F. Tofino Hospital, I shall be glad to know if any decision has been arrived at by your Department, as the disposal of this property is now very urgent.\n\nIn this connection, I find that I neglected to send you a copy of my letter of September 4 to Mr. Bernard Neary. I am correcting my omission herewith with apologies.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. H. Berry,\nPresident.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Improvements to Kakawis School, B.C.\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAs you know, this school through possibly no fault of the Department, was poorly situated, as far as sea approach to it is concerned. It appears that the surf and the waves, during storms and the Winter season, are so strong that it has been found inadvisable to build a wharf or any kind of protection for boats having freight to unload.\n\nAt the present time, all freight is loaded at Tofino in the large mission boat, then unloaded in a barge or smaller row-boat and carried by the school help to shore. This method of freighting applied to all visitors as well. I am informed that, due to the hardship of reaching Kakawis, your Commissioner has never visited the school.\n\nYou will admit that this condition create hardships which it is hardly fair to ask a Principal and school staff to bear indefinitely.\n\nOne method, and possibly the only one to improve these conditions, would be the building of a road from the school to the Indian village where wharfage could easily be secured and boats tied in safety. I believe that such a road might be build for at most $10,000. The distance is not more than two miles and $5,000 per mile would be a very fair price. I would therefore ask the Department to include this amount in next year's estimates.\n\nThe pupilage is inferior to the capacity of the school and should be increased. The number of pupils in the neighborhood who are asking for admission is quite large and an increase of 20 pupils would partially answer their demand. I would therefore ask the Department to also include a sufficient amount for this purpose in next year's estimates.\nIt has been found impossible in this school to keep cows or horses, due to the fact that all feed for them had to be brought from long distances and at prices quite prohibitive in relation to the service they could render. As a result it has been found impossible even to grow potatoes or cultivate a garden. If the Department could supply a small tractor and plow, quite a quantity of fresh vegetables could be given to the children and I hope that you will also provide for the purchase of the above in your next year's estimates.\n\nThere are smaller items which your Commissioner might be asked to supply, such as books for the library and a few new sewing machines.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd) J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 159-0-1 W T\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of August 29th, regarding the Christie Indian Residential School, and the suggestion of Mr. J. L. Gibson, M.P. for an expenditure up to $10,000.00 for the construction of a road thereto, I would advise that the replacement of this School plant is very much overdue but, according to Acting Indian Agent Garrard's report of August 26th forwarded to you recently, the Air Force buildings at Ucluelet are not suitable for school purposes; consequently consideration will have to be given to acquisition of those at Long Beach.\n\nUnder the circumstances it would appear difficult to recommend any large expenditure for road construction purposes for the existing school buildings.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, August 29, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter 223-28D-52B (4) of August 20. I would refer you to Indian Affairs Branch letter of August 17, a copy of which I attach.\n\nFurther enquiries have also been made by air mail to the Reverend Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School to ascertain if he is still desirous of moving to the RCAF Tofino Hospital, in view of the evident opposition to this change in location. I will write you immediately an answer from him is received.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nG. E. Jackson,\nActing Deputy Minister.\n\nJ. H. Berry, Esq.,\nPresident,\nCrown Assets Allocation Committee,\n375 Wellington Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 12, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr. J. H. Berry, President of the War Assets Corporation. In view of the statements contained in this letter and your recent visit to this school, the Department would appreciate knowing whether you wish to proceed with your plans to establish a school in this R.C.A.F. base at Tofino.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Henry M.B.E.\nDept. of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI am submitting a request for an increase in the quota of pupils for this school. The present quota is 110 children. We have 115 children attending at present and of this number 102 should return to school in September. This means that we could only accept eight children to bring our population up to quota requirements. During the past year I have had to refuse many parents the right to send their children to school. There are more than thirty-five children of school age, Catholic parents, who wish to come to school. I mention only those who have asked to send their children to school - eight children from the\nKyugust tribe, seven from Clayquot, eight from Hesquiat, eight from Uootka Sound, and five from the Keltsewat tribe. I have their names and ages on file, some are nine or ten years old, and have not had the opportunity of attending school. This school has enjoyed a very good reputation among the Indians for some years now but nothing can ruin the reputation of a school on this coast as quickly as disgruntled parents who have been refused a request to send their children to school\u2014they take it as a personal insult.\n\nThis school, as you know, has no farm or garden and all supplies have to be shipped in by boat. It is quite expensive to run and we cannot afford to accept very many free boarders over our quota. If the quota could be raised to 125 it would take care of the older children wishing to come to school. I do not ask for any permanent increase, only as a temporary measure until the question of Indian education has...\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nI am making this request now because some alterations would have to be made and room found for another classroom. This would entail expenses which we could not afford unless we were certain of an increase in per capita expenditures. The cost of living at this school has increased in the past five years to the amount of $250 without any increase in grant. These figures are only for basic foods, there has been a similar increase in wages, fuel, and house equipment. We are no longer able to carry children above the quota.\n\nThe increase in grant brought by fifteen pupils would pay for the extra teacher we would need. With a few alterations we could accommodate fifteen more children who otherwise would be without schooling.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable answer to this request - I remain\n\nYours truly,\nJ.P. Mulvihill, M.A.\nOttawa, April 21, 1947.\n\nReverend J.F. Mulvihill, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, British Columbia.\n\nDear Father Mulvihill:\n\nI have your letter of April 14th. The new per capita grants will be paid as from January 1, 1947. We have just written today to the Reverend Father Plourde informing him of the increase in the per capita grants to the various schools maintained by the Oblate Order. I can give you advance information that your school will receive an emergency grant of $40.00 per pupil which will bring your total per capita grant to $235.00.\n\nI presume that this will give you the additional funds which you require. The question of increasing the pupilage of a school is a very difficult one. It would be necessary for Inspector of Schools, Mr. Davey to submit a report upon the dormitory accommodation available at your school before such an increase would be considered. If you still wish to press for such a change, would you please write to him so that the problem can be discussed when he visits your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE CLAYOQUOT INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFARMING.\u2014There are 175 acres of land connected with the institution. Of this about 7 acres are cleared. It is a difficult task to clear this land. However an effort should be made to add at least one acre, each year.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\u2014There is a good field here for an industrial school. There are plenty of children in the surrounding reserves.\n\nBoth parents and pupils are inclined to take advantage of the Principal. He is a mild peace loving man. He may develop.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Christie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: Port Alberni, BC\n\nthis 6th April, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ____________________________ School for the Quarter ended _______ Mar. 31 _______ 19 ____\n\nPrincipal ____________________________\n\nDated _______ Apr. 1 _______ 19 ____\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ____________________________\n\nDated at ____________________________\n\nthis _______ 1st April _______ 19 ____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 1, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ____________________________ School for the Quarter ended ____________________________ 19____.\n\nPrincipal ____________________________\n\nDated ____________________________ 19____\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ____________________________\n\nDated at ____________________________ this ____________________________ 19____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ____________________________ School for the Quarter ended ____________________________ 19____.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________ 19____\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated at ____________________________ 19____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Christie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 30th September 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 5TH OCTOBER 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Christie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN 2 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni BC this 2 January 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Christie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended DEC 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN 7, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni, BC this 7th January 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I A 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, may payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return, and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended SEP 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nAlberni, B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Christie Indian Residential School School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1946 19\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN 1 1947 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this January 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance at the Christie Indian Residential School and tuition at the Kakawis, B.C., School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated JUL 1 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Christine Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 1 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Christian Indian Residential School...School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MAR 31 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Christie Indian School**\n\n**School at Kakawis**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended March 31st, 1948**\n\n| BRIGHTEN NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 6246            | Anthony Charleson | 14  | x   |      | Hesquiat       |                    | Carpentry & Mechanics   | June 16, 57                 | 91 -

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ____________________________ School for the Quarter ended ____________________________ 19____.\n\nPrincipal ____________________________\n\nDated ____________________________ 19____\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ____________________________\n\nDated at ____________________________ this ____________________________ 19____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The grant per capita or grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...Chetlic Indian Residential School...School for the Quarter ended...Kakawis, B.C.\n\nPrincipal...P.J.

The school returns will be duly made at the end of present quarter.\n\nI beg also to inform the Dept. of us having spent about three thousand dollars for extras such as waterworks etc. Hoping you will favor me by kindly laying this statement before the Dept. at Ottawa and recommend our cause.\n\nI am your humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Before releasing the cheque you should obtain vouchers for expenditure in the direction indicated up to or exceeding the amount of the same.\n\nAs the grant is made from the Appropriation for 1899-1900 the accounts should be dated previous to the 1st July, and they should be forwarded at an early date.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nAUG 7 1900\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.W.

Mr Superintendent Yovell reports on the 16th ultimo that the school was opened on the 20th May last and that about $3000.00 had been expended on a waterworks system for use in the school. You will see by a marginal note on Mr McKenna's memorandum that this question is to be submitted to the Minister, and as the unexpended balance will lapse on the 30th instant, I should like to be advised as to what reply to make to the application above referred to.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

P. Maurus Principal of the Bishop Christie Roman Catholic Boarding School, Clayoquot with reference to the insufficiency of the water supply for that institution I have the honour to report that the present water supply is brought from a creek adjacent by means of a dam across the stream and a small hydraulic ram; the present water system including piping, tank &c cost the management some $1600. The dam is faulty and leaks and though every effort has been made to remedy this it has been without success also in the summer months the water in the dam becomes stagnant and charged with more or less vegetable matter and also fails in quantity to keep the ram working so that during the dry season water has to be fetched in buckets up the hill to the School buildings, to remedy this and improve the\npresent system would require a new dam some 1000 yards further back (this stream running through comparatively level ground) and would entail 3000 feet more piping which would be an expensive undertaking and not satisfactory; The Rev Principal therefore proposes to bring water by iron piping from another stream, a never failing spring of pure water situated on the side of the hill behind the Mission, as there is little or no surface water draining into this stream, even in the rainy season, the water is always pure and varies little in volume summer and winter, on the side of the hill where the connection would be made the stream is 1/2 to 2 feet wide and 4 to 6 inches deep, so that a dam would not be required, only a box to guide the water into the pipe; the claimed distance from the Mission buildings is 3500 feet with about 85 feet fall so that the water would flow into the tank above the buildings with the pressure produced by at least 40 feet fall, or into the lower floor of the school with a pressure from 80 feet fall, and would give a continued and plentiful supply of water for fire fighting or any emergency.\n\nThe piping required, and cost delivered at the School would be\n3500 feet 2 inch galvanized iron piping f.o.b. Victoria at $19 per ft. 691.25\nT joint 1.50\nWharfage Victoria on 6 tons 3.25\nFreight Victoria to Clayquot 26.00\n$722.00\n\nThe Principal applies to the Department to grant the cost of this piping; he would undertake the work, the pipes would merely require screwing together and could be laid along the ground at little expense with the aid of the bigger lads in the School and they would have a plentiful and lasting supply of good fresh water.\n\nIn view of the undoubted efficiency of the School, that at the present time there are 55 pupils inmates of the institution, 5 more than the capita grant allows for, and others have been refused admission owing to want of accommodation and that the management hope to make an addition to the building to provide for more scholars I would strongly urge that the Department receive the application favorably.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHarry Guillod\nAgent\n\nA.

Upon inquiring closely into the matter of the cost of the proposed system of heating Mr. Green, it will be noticed, states that the entire work can be done for\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthe sum of $2500.00. He, therefore, recommends that assistance to the extent of $1500.00 be extended to the management of the school in having the work undertaken, the present arrangement of heating by stoves being declared to be expensive and unsafe on account of the danger of fire. It will be noticed that Mr. Agent Neill reports favorably of the project and recommends that a grant for the purpose be made. This matter is also touched upon in the estimates (page 7) of the superintendency for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1906, forwarded to the Department on the 25th of last November under cover of letter No. P. 4., 2.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

Father Maurice, Principal of the Clayoquot Industrial school for a grant of $2,000.00 towards the expense of equipping that institution with a hot water heating system.\n\nHe estimates the total cost at $340.80 & proposes to pay the balance out of their own resources.\n\nThe Church has this summer made two large additions to the school entirely at their own expense & the accommodation is much extended & improved in consequence.\n\nThis is at the present time, the largest, best conducted, & most successful school in the Agency. They are doing a good work & doing it well & without friction & having regard to the efficiency & success of the school I have pleasure in recommending the present application to the most favourable consideration of the Dept. At the same time I must point out that last year this institution received a grant of about $700.00 towards installing a proper water system & it has not long since been raised from the status of a boarding school to that of an Industrial school which of course materially increases the annual grant.\n\nI would suggest that if the present request is granted that it be coupled with a condition that the management shall at once insure the building & contents for an amount to be approved by the Dept. so that in case of fire the Dept. will not lose the amount of its various contributions towards its erection & equipments & further that the school will not be left without funds with which to rebuild, in which case they would no doubt be applying to the Dept. for a large grant to aid them. I may say that the proposed system will heat the whole building & not only the latest additions as might be thought from the Principal's letter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You are fully aware of the work having been done this summer. The biggest item of expenditure still remains to be incurred, that of heating.\n\nFor cogent reasons I decided in favor of a heating system by hot water as being the most healthful to skin constitution and the most satisfactory and economical for an institution of this character. The cost however is far more than the management is able to stand after exhausting all available funds on the buildings erected this summer.\n\nEnclosed is Mr. Collett's estimate of the cost of the plant in view. This amounts to $3410.00. Of this amount the management will not be able\nto pay more than about fifteen hundred dollars by dint of the most strenuous efforts. Will the Department grant an allowance of two thousand dollars of the cost in consideration that the management incurred a huge expenditure for the erection of the buildings? I respectfully and most earnestly make application for assistance to the amount mentioned of $2,000 to enable me to provide for the institution under my charge a suitable heating plant.\n\nAssuming you can be so generous as to consider this most respectful application and to recommend the same to the favorable consideration of the Department, I have the honour to remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Father [signature] of the Clayoquot Industrial School for a grant of $2000 towards the expense of equipping that institution with a hot water heating system.\n\nThe Church has this summer made two large additions to the School entirely at their own expense & the accommodation is much extended and improved in consequence.\n\nThis is at the present time the largest, best conducted & most successful School in the Agency. They are doing a good work and doing it well & without friction & having regard to the efficiency & success of the school. I have much pleasure in recommending the present application to the most favorable consideration of the Dept., at the same time I must point out that last year this institution received a grant of about $700 towards installing a proper water system and it has not long since been raised from the status of a Boarding School to that of an Industrial School which of course materially increases the Annual Grant.\n\nI would suggest that if the present request is granted that it be coupled with a condition that the management shall at once insure the building and contents for an amount to be approved by the Department, so that in case of fire the Department will not lose the amount of its various contributions towards its erection & equipment & further that the School will not be left without funds with which to rebuild, in which case they would no doubt be applying to the Department for a large grant to aid them.\n\nI may say that the proposed system will heat the whole building & not only the latest addition which might be thought from the Principal's letter. I have the honor etc.,\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq., (sgd) A.W. Neill, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Supt., Victoria.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUE CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nThe management of this institution has gone this year to the very great expense of nearly five thousand dollars to provide the institution the accommodation and conveniences needed, but wanting ever since the opening of the school. You are fully aware of the amount of work having been done this summer. The largest item of expenditure, however, still remains to be met, that of heating.\n\nFor cogent reasons I decided in favor of a heating system by hot water as being the most healthful to the Indian constitution and the most satisfactory and economical for an institution like the one under my charge. The cost however, is far more than the management is able to stand after exhausting the available funds on the buildings.\n\nI enclose Mr Colbert's estimate of the cost of the plant in view. This amounts to $3410.80. Of this amount the management will not be able to pay more than about ($1500) fifteen hundred dollars by dint of the most strenuous efforts. Will the Department grant an allowance of two thousand dollars of the cost in consideration that the management bore all the expenditure for the erection of the additions?\n\nI respectfully and most earnestly make application for the assistance to the amount of two thousand dollars, because only with the help of the Department the management will be able to provide the necessary heating of a suitable and proper character to this Institution.\n\nRequesting you to favorably consider my application and to recommend the same to the favorable consideration of the Department; I have the honor to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would ask the Department when the re-vote is being put through to increase the amount to the sum mentioned viz; $782.48, although the mistake leading to the granting of the lesser sum was entirely that of Principal Maurus who, when making out his requisition, forgot to estimate for the two 2 inch brass gate valves mentioned in his letter of the 30th ultimo.\n\nTo explain the situation more fully I inclose copy of my letter to the Indian Agent, Mr. Neill, dated 30th instant.\n\nThe material, I am given to understand, has been supplied to the school by Walter S.

Neill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nTouching the fact of not having been duly notified that the vote would lapse on the 30th of June, following the date on which he was apprized of the money being available, there is no particular regulation making it obligatory that such information should be afforded him.\n\nAll the Agents, however, are quite familiar enough, or should be, with such matters, and I feel certain that were not the late Agent so ill most decidedly he would have called the principal's attention to the necessity of having the money expended within the time specified and even if the principal had given the matter a thought he might have known that supplies voted for a certain year would, if not utilized, necessarily lapse at the expiration of said year.\n\nI think it well that you should apprize the principal of these particulars and tell him that as far as I can see no actual blame can be attached to anyone for the present condition of things, and further remind him that when application was made by him for the grant it was based upon the urgent and vital necessity existing for having the work done at the earliest possible moment under these circumstances the natural inference was that the Principal would use all diligence in prosecuting the work which apparently has not been the case since he let the six months elapse before any material advancement was made.\n\nIn regard to his remark to the effect that this office should have notified him, etc., I let it pass for the reason that he must have been wrongly informed when he came to that conclusion.\n\nBefore\nBefore closing I will ask you to look up my letter of 18th December, 64, wherein you will see my marginal note which, to the initiated, is tantamount to telling him that the money should be utilized within the fiscal year.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(sgd) A.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 579-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that all the material necessary for the completion of the new water supply system is on the place now. I herewith forward the vouchers amounting altogether to $730.48. You will notice there is a slight difference between the amount of the vouchers and the expenditure allowed by the Department under date of Dec. 13th 1903 and limited to seven-hundred-and-twenty-two dollars ($722.00). This difference is accounted for by the addition to the original estimate of two 3-inch brass gate valves which cost nine dollars and which had not been considered in the estimate submitted to the Department. Should the Department object to paying for any excess over and above the allowance of $722.00, I wish the cost of these two valves to be dropped from the amount of the vouchers.\n\nThese vouchers, I beg leave to explain, could have been furnished to the Department in May last when the bulk of the necessary material had been bargained for, just as late as now after the delivery on the place of the material. I certainly should not have failed to forward them before the end of the fiscal year, had I had the faintest idea or the least intimation from the agent or the superintendent that\ngrants for special purposes like this allowance for a new water supply, by rulings of the Department, lapse on June 30. Upon your inquiry of Aug. 5th as to the progress of the work I wrote to you in detail what steps had been taken, what expenses had been incurred and I also stated that the order for the material was in the hands of the dealer in Victoria. I explained in the same communication the good reasons why the work preparatory to laying the pipe could not be carried on more expeditiously before the end of June. But even so, I could have had the material on the place before the end of June, had I not unfortunately been misled by my utter ignorance of the Department's rulings re. special grants, to wait for better and drier weather, when the work could be done with less labor, expense, and risk to the health of the pupils who were to do the work.\n\nWhen you informed me under date of Sep. 7th that the Department did not allow the extension of time, I could no longer in justice and without loss cancel the contracts for the furnishing of the pipe and other material. Moreover I could and would not take the responsibility upon myself to allow the school to pass another year without a sufficient supply of good water. That I not exaggerate the urgency of the case you will see from the fact that at date of writing the school\nBISHOP CHRISTIE\nINDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL,\nVancouver Island.\n\nClayoquot, B.C.\n\nis without water owing to a breach in the dam caused by the recent heavy rainfall, and were it not for the occasional showers, we should be obliged to carry every drop of water needed in buckets from the creek. The new water supply should be in working order now, were the weather a little better; on account of its unsettled state I can not tell the date of the completion of the work. But a reliable supply of water we must have at all hazards and as soon as possible.\n\nAs the case now stands the material, pipe and fittings, was bought before I thought and knew that grant lapsed on June 30, on the strength and the credit of the Department's allowance. After the purchase of the material, after doing a lot of work and incurring divers expense, I am blamed for not pushing the work effectively enough against odds of which I have no control, the Department's allowance of Dec. 13th last is declared to have lapsed on June 30th, and no money is said to be available from the Department for carrying on the work. As I do not know how to meet the large expenditure for the pipe and fittings without the aid of the Department, I respectfully make application again for an allowance towards the expenditure for pipe and fittings.

Murray, Principal of the Clayoquot Indian Boarding School, West Coast Agency, a letter dated the 10th instant of which the enclosed is a copy. From its contents it appears that the sum of $732.00 authorized to be expended by your letter of the 4th of December last for providing a better water supply for the institution cannot be drawn upon by voucher for the reason that as yet very little of the work has been performed, the fiscal year for which the appropriation was made having lapsed on the 30th June last. I regret that greater exertions were not made by the school management to accomplish the work for which the Department so kindly authorized the expenditure. However, as matters now stand nothing remains to be done but to refer the request of the principal to the Department for its consideration. I have informed the principal of the school that all monies voted by Parliament which remain unexpended on the 30th of June of each year lapse on that date and authority must again be sought for expenditure as in the present instance.\n\nFrank Peiley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Were I not sure that the oversight of not informing me of this condition was due to Mr. Guillod's illness, I should feel very much aggrieved over it.\n\nIn point of fact I had an expert from Victoria out here in May looking over the grounds; another party I had engaged to locate the tank, I myself leveled, surveyed and measured the pipe line. To save expense I did not want to begin operations before the rainy season came to a close, unfortunately very late this year. As I had agreed to do the work with some of the pupils, I did not consider it advisable or practicable to send the boys out in the rain into the wet woods and into the then existing swamps. Since July the pupils have slashed a good distance of the trail through the woods where the pipe line goes through. In about a week the trail will be finished and we shall then be ready to lay the pipe in case the pipe will arrive in time. I have the order for pipe & other material placed in the hands of my representative in Victoria a month ago, but have not heard from the party if he actually awarded the order to any of the bidders or not. Of course, had I been forewarned & been reminded of the Department's rule regarding such allowances, I should not at all have delayed placing the order for the required material before the expiration of the fiscal year. If you know what remains for me to be done under the circumstances I shall be very grateful for your kind advice. I have the honor to be, kind Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\n(sgd) P. Maurus.\nOttawa, 6th December, 1903.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your No. 436 of the 26th November I have to inform you that the proposed alteration in the equipment for supplying water to the Clayoquot Boarding School may be made. The work should not exceed the estimate made by Mr. Agent Guillod, viz., $738.00.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the work will be carried out satisfactorily, and that it will result in a permanent supply of water for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Fuller\n\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFor the DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nThe Clayoquot Boarding School authorities ask for a grant of $722.00 to enable them to alter and improve the water supply for the school. The work would appear to be necessary and the change is strongly recommended by the Agent and the Indian Superintendent. Although there is no special vote for the purpose we have this year ample funds in the appropriation for Day and Boarding Schools, British Columbia, and the grant desired might properly be made from these funds.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 5th December, 1903.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, November 26th 1902.\n\nFile No.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith for the consideration of the Department copy of a letter dated Sept. 9th last, from Revd. P. Maurus, Principal of the Clayoquot Boarding School; and also a letter dated the 21st instant from Mr Agent Guillod, reporting on the matter of the water supply for the said school, and giving the cost of the changes considered necessary.\n\nI recommend this matter to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\nA.W. Vowce\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nClayoquet, B.C.\nSept. 9th, 1902.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe experience of the past two years proves that the water supply for all the wants of the school is not all sufficient; moreover, the water being stagnant, the greatest part of the year is not of such purity as to be beneficial, securely so, to the health of the Dominion's wards at our school. The Management recognizes the necessity of providing the school a more reliable and more plentiful supply of wholesome water. Such may be obtained from the mountain side in the near distance but at a cost of about eight hundred dollars.\n\nShould you, Mr. Superintendent have it in your power to allow the school an appropriation for the purpose from the contingency fund placed at your disposal, I would hereby respectfully apply for the allowance in whole or in part, however possible. If however you think it advisable or necessary to submit the matter to the Department, I should thank you for your valued suggestions how to proceed in the matter.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

P. Maurus, Principal of the Clayoquot Industrial school for the sum of $1500.00 being the amount authorized to be paid in aid of the installation of a hot water heating system at that school by your letter of August 18th No 355.T.4.\n\nThe vouchers show the total expenditure on this work to have been $2656.00. I have just returned from inspecting the premises & was shown the system by one of the mechanics employed to install it.\n\nWhile I am not versed in prices of this class of plant enough to pronounce an opinion as to the value of the work at the price stated, yet it must be assumed that as so large a part of the price had to be borne by the Church, that the Principal no doubt got the work done as economically as possible consistent with efficient work. I can, however, certify that the work appeared to have been carried out faithfully according to the contract & that the result is a complete & very efficient system of heating the whole building. The 48 radiators are suitable for the purpose & properly distributed throughout the building with the usual appliances for cutting off the heat from any individual radiator. The system had been in operation several days before my visit & had been, and was, working quite satisfactorily.\n\nI have therefore pleasure in recommending payment of the vouchers for the sum of $1500.00 as stated.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.W.

P. Maurus, principal of that school, a statement of the proposed improvements & application for a grant of $1500.00 from the Dept. towards the expense thereof and beg to recommend the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nVictoria,\nB.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you and the Department that our institution very badly needs better accommodations for laundry purposes. The necessity of a larger laundry makes itself felt not only at present, but has been apparent from the very date the school was opened seven years ago. Just like the main (first) building it had been designed too small. In a space of 13 x 22 feet eighteen to twenty pupils have to do the washing with part of this space being occupied by the laundry stove. The remaining portion of the present laundry is taken up by a drying closet and stove, which drying system though, I may be permitted to mention right here, is an utter failure.\n\nWhile painfully aware of these insufficient and imperfect conditions for the whole time of my incumbency, I had contemplated to better them as soon as the necessary additions for the proper housing of the pupils and the employees should be completed. Though the latter object is accomplished, still I am not in a position, owing to a considerable indebtedness for buildings and equipment, to provide sufficient laundering facilities for at least two years to come. For this, I appeal to the Department for aid to enable me to do this and I most urgently ask for an appropriation of fifteen hundred dollars for the purpose.\n\nThe building of the proposed laundry of 25 x 56 feet will cost at least $957.48 for material alone without extra labor.\n\nThe equipment of necessary labor saving appliances will cost from four hundred fifty dollars to five hundred dollars.\n\nThe total cost of material alone without allowing anything for extra labor will be in the neighborhood of fifteen hundred dollars.\n\nA detailed estimate of material and appliances I hereby enclose.\nI beg to explain however that I do not consider myself infallible in the preparation of this estimate as I had to make it myself without assistance of competent partners and it may want correction for all I know, although I made it to the best of my knowledge and according to information I was able to obtain with no mean difficulty. This difficulty of obtaining information is responsible for the delay of submitting the estimate at an earlier date.\n\nOf course it is my intention to have the work done by the instructor and his apprentices, but for brick work it will be necessary to hire extra help.\n\nWhen I ask for an equipment of some laundrying appliances I do not want you or the Department to infer that hand washing is to be replaced by machine work. By no means, but I think that the boys, especially the large ones on whom falls the burden of washing, might be more profitably employed at trades or clearing land the two or three half days whenever the heavier washing is to be done.\n\nWith the present facilities, once a month from a hundred to a hundred and twenty bed sheets are to be washed, they should be washed however twice a month. Every two weeks some sixty night gowns, forty girls' (over-all) aprons, thirty boys' jumpers, and every week in addition to the regular week's washing some twenty overalls require washing.\n\nThe appliances asked for are intended only to save time and labor, and with the use of them for the heavier washing the pupils will not be dispensed with from the usual week's washing.\n\nDuring the wet season it is practically impossible to dry the clothes in the open air, and a drying closet is an imperative necessity for this country. I installed a dryer, made in Montreal, six years ago at a cost of two hundred dollars but the system\nhas never given the least satisfaction. The draws however can be used for the new dryer and save that portion of the expense. The draws are not included in the estimate for new dryer.\n\nRegarding the Hand Power Extractor, this is not an absolute necessity, but it is a most useful and economical machine saving labor and clothes, and drying clothes to a degree not attained by any kind of common wringer. Because it wrings out the clothes almost dry, I consider it a desideratum for our wet climate. The estimate is for the heaviest hand power machines, there are cheaper and inferior ones in the market.\n\nI beg to state that the estimate of laundry appliances is not absolutely correct, but it is as nearly so as I could make it from catalogues of Chicago firms. Unfortunately I have not been able to secure catalogues and prices from Canadian (Toronto) houses. Again the allowances for freight may vary slightly.\n\nCommending this my respectful application for grant for a new laundry and its equipment to your serious and favorable consideration, I have the honor to remain, dear Mr. Agent,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nA.

M. Ogilvie, Architect of the Indian Department, has been here on a visit, and he advised a low pressure steam system for operating the dryer and providing hot water and boiling of clothes.\n\nIf low pressure steam does not come under the law requiring a licensed engineer or fireman, of course this system is far superior to a heating system by stove of the dryer as well as to boiling clothes in the old fashioned wash boiler and much quicker in operation.\n\nThe steam generator would then supersede the drying and hot water heating stove and also the clothes boiler with necessary brick work. The location of the steam generator or boiler in consequence entails an alteration in the division of the space of the building.\n\nIn any case I would respectfully request that plan of the laundry building, interior arrangement, etc., be submitted to Mr. Ogilvie, of whose absolute competency I am fully convinced.\n\nI have the honor to be, dear Mr. Agent,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith for payment voucher in duplicate No.205 for the sum of $58.25 in favor of Walter S.

Maurus, Principal of the Clayoquot Industrial School for expenditure incurred in building the laundry at the Institution, I have to remind you that the Department has not yet received the receipts therein asked for in support of the items charged for in the vouchers. The receipts should be sent in without further delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to transmit herewith cheque No 1849 for $1165.34 in payment of Voucher No 1410 in favour of the Revd P. Maurus, Principal of the Clayoquot Industrial School for expenditure incurred in connection with building the laundry at the school. It will be necessary for the Department to be furnished with receipts in support of the items charged for in the vouchers. Payment is made from the 1908-1909 Appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\n\nSupt. Vowell forwards accounts amounting to $1165.34 for expenditure incurred in connection with the building and equipment of a laundry at Cayoquot Industrial school, for which purpose the sum of $1500 was voted. The accounts submitted added to the amount of $769.80 already paid make a total of $1935.04, which is $435.04 in excess of the grant.\n\nThe Department is asked to assume the full cost for the reasons given by Father Maurus, the Principal, and Mr. Agent Neill in correspondence sent in by the Superintendent when submitting the accounts.\n\nThe grant was based on an estimate made over two years ago and since that time the cost of machinery has advanced and a better equipment has been purchased than was then contemplated. Mr. Agent Neill explains this matter of additional cost satisfactorily and, if funds can be spared to meet it, the Department would, I think, be justified in paying the full amount, which will give the school a thoroughly up-to-date laundry.\n\nAs the time for making payments out of last year's appropriation is limited, the principal asks that the amount be placed to his credit, so that he can settle the bills. He is thoroughly reliable and the vouchers are on file to show the correctness of the amount.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also enclose a letter dated the 30th of March, No. 246/12, with its enclosure from Mr. Agent Neill and a further letter under same date, No. 249/12, the latter enclosing a communication from the Principal referring to the fact that to complete the work it has been necessary to expend $455.04 in excess of the Department's grant of $1500.00 and he asks that this additional assistance be given him, which I recommend be complied with, providing funds can be found for that purpose.\n\nThe voucher submitted by Mr. Neill is not in the exact form that I consider it should be. I think it would have been better to have sent separate vouchers payable to the different tradesmen who supplied the material, etc. However, if the Department can see its way clear to issue a cheque in favour of the Principal for the full amount requested, I have no doubt but that it will be faithfully disposed of and receipted bills be sent the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nClayoquot, B.C., Dec 21/08\n\nChristie Industrial School\n\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nIn account with Sutton Lumber & Trading Co.,\nLIMITED\n\n20 M Perfection Shingles $2.50\n\nCertified correct\nO.

March 30th, 1908.\n\nLETTER NO. 246-12.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith voucher in favor of Rev. P. Maurus, principal of the Clayoquot Industrial school for the sum of $1165.24 for grant towards the erection and equipment of a laundry at the Clayoquot Industrial school.\n\nThe original grant (Authority File No. 181,717/5 dated Aug. 10th, 08) was for $1500.00 but the Dept. have already paid out on this account the sum of $759.80, but the principal under cover of my letter of this day No. 249-12 is making application for a further grant to complete the building which if granted would allow the payment of the voucher attached hereto, to Rev. P. Maurus.\n\nIt will be noted that of the items, only the first six amounting to $69.90 have actually been yet paid by the principal but he makes a special request as per his attached letter that the amount may be placed to his credit in the bank in Victoria when he will pay the various parties and forward receipts to the Dept. He states (to me personally) that he has not the funds on hand to make these comparatively large payments beforehand and wait for a refund from the Dept.\n\nThe request is somewhat unusual one but in the special circumstances I think it might be allowed. The machinery is by this time probably all installed in its place in the laundry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA W. Vowell Esq.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nClayoquot, \"Christie\", Industrial School\n\nKakawis, West Coast, B.C., 22d March 1909.\n\n340690\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn connection with the payment by the Department of the vouchers for material and equipment of new laundry, I beg leave to request that the Department deposit the amount due (and, of course, allowed) in the Bank of Montreal, Victoria, B.C., to the credit of my account.\n\nAs some vouchers have already been paid by myself and others are to be paid, and in different countries, too, the Department would be saved all this trouble of remitting to so many different parties, by simply making the deposit of a lump sum in the Bank.\n\nIn case the Department refuses to pay or assume the responsibility for the excess of expenditure, I request the returning of such unpaid vouchers.\n\nI have the honor to remain, dear Mr. Agent,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq.,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nPrincipal.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\n\nALBERNI, B. C. March 30th, 1909.\n\nLETTER NO. 249-12.\n\nSIR,\n\nWith reference to the grant under authority File No. 181,717/5 dated August 10th, 1908 or $1500.00 to purchase material for the erection of a laundry at the Clayoquot Industrial school, I have the honor to forward herewith application from the Rev. P. Maurus, principal of the school for a further grant to complete the actual cost of the plant.\n\nThe principal's figures are correct as per his letter with the exception that he has omitted in the payment made by the Dept. to Woods Bros (otherwise the Barclay Sound Cedar Co.) the freight paid by them on their shipment of lumber. This would make their account $330.35, a difference of $62.95. Consequently the figures subsequent to that entry are wrong to that extent and the correct figures are those marked by me in red ink.\n\nConsequently the total expenditure incurred is $1935.04, and the excess over the grant is $435.04.\n\nIt is to cover this excess that the Rev. Principal now asks a grant.\n\nWith most of the arguments advanced by the principal I can heartily agree. I recently visited the school where he has already completed the erection of the building, a fine spacious one and he showed me the difference in some of the washing machinery between that supplied in the Eastern States of Canada and that manufactured in the U.S.A., and the comparison for strength and\n\nK.W. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Supt. for B.C.\n\nVictoria,\nB.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 1)\ndurability was unquestionably in favour of the latter.\n\nAs to his remark about the higher cost of boilers in this province, that is due to the operation of a local statute known as \"The Boiler Inspection Act.\" When this was first introduced (I was a member of the legislature at the time) the intention was simply to check accidents and ensure safety to those in charge but it has been amended so many times since and now it has almost become a measure of protection to B.C. boiler makers who possibly not so intended. A certain standard is required and this has been extended until a boiler has practically to be made in a certain prescribed way to pass. The local boiler makers who of course sell their whole output in B.C. know what the prescribed pattern is and build accordingly. The Eastern maker who manufactures for the whole of Canada produces a boiler in every respect as good but not in the prescribed pattern approved by the B.C. Act and after the boiler gets here to make the necessary changes would prove too costly. Consequently B.C. makers have a monopoly and prices are high.\n\nI can heartily recommend Father Maurus' application to the favourable consideration of the Dept. The institution is a splendid testimonial to the ability of those in charge. From its first inception when funds were scarce indeed, its affairs have been managed by a far sighted and business like policy. Instead of a small building requiring to be eked out every now and then by a niggardly addition until an incoherent mass of petty buildings, as can be seen in some places, the Rev. Father decided on a broad comprehensive plan which he has gradually worked out as opportunity afforded until now he has a large institution admirably adapted in every way for its purpose and in which every modern convenience and economical arrangement can be made use of. The water supply for instance. Instead of having a small service to begin with which would be useless in a few years, he installed, at a considerably expense as it seemed at the time, a plant which will be sufficient for all time and for all enlargements of the school and which it is now easy\nto see, was a most profitable investment in the first place.\n\nSo with the laundry I am satisfied that he is in the right in getting the best of machinery which will do the work satisfactorily and last long even though the initial cost be somewhat greater.\n\nIt must also be remembered that it is difficult to make estimates of what certain works will cost, two years before it is to be done as the cost of material is liable to vary a good deal within that period.\n\nI may mention that with the exception of the two accounts already paid by the Dept., all the vouchers showing that the total sum named has been already expended or contracted for, are attached to a voucher in favor of the Rev. P. Maurus which I am forwarding by even mail under cover of my letter of 30th inst. No. 946-12, and which explains itself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe principal makes no reference to the freight bills (which will be quite an item) on the machinery from Victoria to Clayoquot, no doubt he intends to pay that himself if the Dept. will grant the further assistance asked for above.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to submit for favorable consideration and payment by the Department from the grant kindly allowed for the erection and the equipment of a new laundry for the Clayoquot Industrial School, the following vouchers for material, machinery, and freight charges; viz.,\n\nFreight Bills $28.65\nT.S. Fraser & Co., for Nails $25.75\nR.T. Rithet & Co., Cement $15.80\n\nAmount paid by and due to me $69.90\n\nWestern Supply Co., Seattle Wash., Extractor $190.19\nPuget Sound Machinery Depot, Engine $213.65\nA.R. Williams Machinery Co., Vancouver, B.C., for Washer & Range $292.50\nVictoria Machinery Depot, for Boiler etc. $350.00\nSutton Lumber Co., for Shingles $52.00\n\nAmount of Vouchers Payable $1095.34\n\nThe following vouchers have been paid to date by the Department:\n\nWoods Bros., Alberni, B.C., for Lumber $267.45\nJas. Leigh & Sons, Victoria, etc. $439.45\n\nAmount paid by Department to date $706.90\n\nTotal Expenditure $1095.34\n\nAmount of Grant Allowed $1000.00\n\nExcess over $95.34\n\nAs shown by the above statement the expenditure exceeds the sum of the grant kindly allowed by the Department for the purpose by $95.34. This excess, I beg leave to explain, is by no means the result of a miscalculation in the estimate, but is due to material changes in the equipment and also greatly to the increase of cost of machinery since the time of making up the estimate two years ago.\n\nI most earnestly ask the Department to grant us an additional allowance of $95.34 to cover the excess as stated.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 1)\nSince making the application two years ago for an allowance towards the erection and the equipment of a new laundry, most urgently needed, I sought occasions and availed myself of opportunities, to confer with experienced laundry men as well as to study the different kinds of laundry appliances and the method of their operation. From the observations and new knowledge gained I arrived at the conclusion that some of the appliances which I contemplated in the estimate, that would rather prove unpractical and little time and labor saving. Men experienced in the business strongly advised the use of steam and larger and stronger machinery. Hence I allowed myself to be guided by the experience and sound judgement of well-meaning friends and decided in favor of a steam laundry on a small scale.\n\nThere is another condition which affects an increase in the cost and of which I was utterly ignorant two years ago, and this is that some of the laundry appliances manufactured by Canadian concerns are much inferior to U.S. machinery, which however on account of duty come higher in price.\n\nAs to steam boiler this could be bought perhaps a hundred or more dollars cheaper in the East, but the B.C. laws will not allow eastern or U.S. makes in the province without almost impossible requirements, and B.C. boilers in consequence cost nearly twice as much outside makes.\n\nI pray the Department most earnestly to allow our institution the additional grant to cover the excess of expenditure stated above.\n\nI have the honor to remain, dear Mr. Agent,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

March 18, letter No. 186-18, recommending a grant of $300.00 for the erection of a barn at the Christie Industrial School, Clayoquot. I would like to hear from the Dept. on this matter at an early date, as the Principal, Rev. F. Epper, has been making enquiries to me regarding same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have long felt the need of a new barn. It was only because there was other still more urgent work to be done in previous years that this has not already been built.\n\nThe present barn, if we may call it so, is a place of patchwork, additions having been made to the original plan when land called for new buildings in years, cramped and the space is all together inadequate. We are very desirous to improve these conditions and intend to erect a new barn.\n\nIn the course of this matter, according to plans it will be 40 x 15 feet. It will give space for eight stalls and ample room for feedboxes, etc., and will serve the Indians as a model of a barn.\n\nThe lumber and other materials for this barn will cost $300.00 approximately. I most respectfully and also most earnestly ask the Department to meet this outlay as our needs are severely taxed otherwise, and I beg you to use your kind influence that this petition may be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal of the Clayoquot Industrial School, in which he asks for a grant to enable him to erect a barn in connection with the institution.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you may be aware, this school is the property of the church and it will be necessary for the church authorities to make arrangements for the erection of further buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I beg to recommend that his request be granted.\n\nI also enclose the invoice showing detailed prices of the paint used.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nReferring to the suggestion made by Mr. Inspector Cairns re. clearing land in connection with the Clayoquot Industrial School as quoted in your letter of Aug. 3, 1918, in which you also quote: \"The Department considers that it would be in the best interests of the school if the Inspector's suggestions are carried out and you will be good enough to take the matter up with the principal as soon as possible.\" Therefore, I would request you now to arrange with the Department to assist us to put these suggestions into practical form.\n\nI am planning how to have more land cleared and to improve the soil of the land already cleared but this requires hard work and a good deal of money - of the latter we have not sufficient and expect to be assisted by the Department. The soil in our gardens has never been tilled deep enough and has not been sufficiently drained. It is almost impossible to do this properly without a horse or tractor and we have neither. A small tractor like the illustration enclosed would be the cheaper and most satisfactory for us. Feed for a horse would be very expensive here but a tractor would require very little attention when not in use.

Jos. Schindler, principal of the Christie Industrial School, with reference to the clearing of more land and also enclosing out of a tractor-plow. Even should the Department favor the Principal's scheme of purchasing the tractor mentioned, owing to the roughness of the ground, I doubt very much if it would be serviceable, and also the fact that there is very little land cleared.\n\nIt would seem to me more in keeping with the situation as I see it, that the Rev.

I may also say that as the said School is the property of the Church authorities, they will have to bear the expense in the event of purchase of a plough being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.A.

I made two trips to Kyugust \u2014 the first time I brought 3 children down with me; and the second time I procured 6. I also made a trip to Kesquialt, and got some children there. These trips are expensive, esp. when I have got to pay the children's fare, their meals and berths.\n\nThe trip to Kesquialt Oct. 1st cost $4.75\nThe first trip to Kyugust Oct. 12th including $5.00 for launch hire $19.65\nThe second trip to Kyugust Nov. 22nd as per enc. receipt from C.P.R. Co. 33.25\nLaunch hire at Kyugust 5.00\n\n$62.65\n\nAlthough I have no receipts to show for the first two trips, neither for the $5.00 launch hire, I herewith certify that the amount is correct as paid by me, and I kindly request you to have the Department defray these traveling expenses.\n\nDuncan C.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in further reference to your request for the payment of the travelling expenses in bringing children to the Christie Industrial School and also in returning them to their homes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as previously informed, expenses of this nature are, in the cases of all residential schools, paid from the per capita grant. It is only in exceptional cases that the Department assumes responsibility for the payment of travelling expenses in bringing pupils to the schools, or in returning them to their homes. It might be well, in cases where pupils have to travel long distances and where the expenses are, therefore, correspondingly large, for such pupils to remain at the school during the summer holidays, in order to save unnecessary expense to the school in the payment of their transportation. The Department cannot assume any responsibility for the payment of the travelling expenses of bringing new pupils to your school, or of allowing them home for summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Many of our children come from afar, some about 100 miles from here, others from about 50 miles, whereas 36 miles. Traveling here is very expensive and the parents simply refuse to pay the traveling for their children\u2014they in their own way of thinking hold that they sacrifice enough by letting their children go to school.\n\nFood prices have lately again advanced to such a degree that it is hard to keep afloat. In a few months the children will go home on their vacations, I would be glad indeed, if the Department could assure me that it would pay the children's traveling.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Master, C.F.S.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 16, 1919.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you ask to be recouped for the expenditure incurred by you for travelling expenses in recruiting children for the Christie Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not pay accounts of this nature, and all such expenditure should be paid from the per capita grant paid the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This material was used in giving one coat of paint to our school building on three sides. Both Mr. Cox, the Indian Agent and Mr. Clarns, the school inspector are aware of how necessary it was to give the building a coat of paint this summer. It was simply a case of necessity; our boys with the help of an able instructor mixed the paint on the spot and did the painting between Aug. 23 and Sept. 6, just before the rainy season commenced.\n\nAs the present per capita grant is not sufficient to pay for improvements of this nature, I trust the Dept. will pay for it.\n\n\"Chas.

It will be necessary to state whether the Principal obtained competitive prices before making the purchases and, if so, the quotations received by him for the paint and oils should also be sent. The names of the firms he asked for prices and the prices received should be stated.\n\nI would point out that, if the Principal intended to ask that the cost of the painting material be paid by the Department, he should have first obtained consent for its purchase and received instructions regarding the same, as, under the requirements of the Purchasing Commission, it is now necessary that competitive prices be obtained in the making of all purchases before accounts can be considered for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sears, both at Victoria. The Melrose Co.'s terms were accepted, and I enclose their figures.\n\nAs Jno.

Even if the title to the buildings were in the Department, it would be difficult to obtain the requisite monies for their improvement. I shall keep your necessities in view, and have given careful attention to your letter, and I regret that my present answer must needs be unfavourable.\n\nRev. Chas. Moser, O.S.B., Yours very truly,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Industrial School,\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nChristie Industrial School\nKAKAWIS,\nB.C., Dec. 3rd 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTo understand this letter better, I am enclosing a photograph of our school building. The centre building was put up in 1879 and the two additions in 1904. Extensive repairs are now needed, and will be needed for the next few years. A new roof is badly needed\u2014new. New floors, new baths, new (1500 gal.) water reservoir will be necessary in the near future. Painting and varnishing should be done over. The per capita grant does not cover anything for such like repairs.\n\nMoreover we should have something of a gymnasium. This we cannot erect ourselves, but the material must come from somewhere else.\n\nBoth ground and buildings are owned by the Church; at the same time they are used only for the benefit and education of the Indians' children. It is true that in former years the Dept. has helped us by granting a special allowance for special purposes viz.\nThe building of the steam laundry and the water supply system.\n\nI therefore earnestly request you that the Dept. again grant the moneys needed to keep our school in good repair and sanitary conditions, either by a special allowance for the separate repairs or by paying a yearly rent for the use of our buildings for the benefit and education of the Indian children.\n\nI have spoken this matter over with Mr. Ditchburn last month, and he advised me to write to you personally.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter due consideration,\n\nYours obedient servant,\nClark Moore, A.B.,\nPrincipal.\n\nDuncan C.

The roof now leaks in several places. It needs attention at once so that it may be in good shape before Autumn comes. It would be good economy to tar the roof or to paint it. The church owns the property, but the principal told me the church authorities are willing to turn the whole plant over to the Indian Department free of cost in order to have the buildings kept in repair. The school is doing a good work among these West Coast Indians.

These materials were purchased by the Principal on his personal account, it not being his intention to ask the Department to reimburse him for the outlay. He has found it necessary, however, owing to the difficulty he has in financing the school under present conditions, to ask the Department to pay the account. He obtained competitive prices from the Melrose Co., Limited, Victoria, and Joseph Sears, Victoria. The former having submitted the lower price, he bought the paint required from them. He states that he is not in a position to produce the price he received from Joseph Sears, as his letter was not kept on file.

This school is the property of the Church authorities and the Department has never made any expenditure towards repairs, etc., except in 1909, when the sum of $1165.00 was paid towards the erection of a new laundry building and laundry machinery.\n\nThe Principal states that he obtained competitive prices before making the purchase of the paint, and I would recommend that, in view of the necessity of having the work done and the difficulty experienced by the Principal in financing the school under the conditions which exist as regards prices, the Department make an exception in this case and pay this account.

We think the present is a very good time for you to have your work done, as we are pleased to say that there has been considerable reduction in the prices of materials, as you will note from the prices quoted below, we should judge also that to put the work off any longer would result in it costing you more, as we do not anticipate any further reductions; in fact we think the present tendency is upward.\n\nIn answer to your question\u2014we beg to quote for the very best and purest materials the following prices\u2014\n\n| Item          | Price |\n|---------------|-------|\n| White lead    | 2\u00bd\u00a2 per lb. |\n| Raw linseed oil | 2.45 gal. |\n| Turpentine    | 2.75 \"   |\n| Indian red paint | 5.35 \"   |\n\nWith reference to wages\u2014would say that we are still operating on the same wage scale as was in effect when you had your work done last year. This is an item, which may be subject to some reduction in the not very distant future, but as the advance in wages which was made to the painters, was not as great as in many lines of labour, we do not think it all likely that there will be a reduction until next spring.\n\nWe should be pleased to receive your orders.\n\nThe melrose co. Ltd.\nOttawa, October 17, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with which you forwarded an account of $29.99 from the Imperial Oil, Limited, Vancouver, and in reply I re-inclose the said account herewith, and I have to request that you will see that it is made out in duplicate on the voucher forms herewith inclosed, to which you should attach the original account. Kindly quote on the face of the voucher the authority for the purchase.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 1)\n\nPublic Archives of Canada\n\nPoor Copy\nSir,\n\nI am sending you again the travelling accounts for the children's travelling for their annual holidays, together with a letter from Mr. Pitchburn, which you will kindly return to me again. I am honest in saying that since I got the Kyuquot children in Nov. 1919 I had to pay their fares. You and Mr. Bartlet came down the same boat from the Whaling Station and Mr. Ellis of Kyuquot knows how the people the evening before the boat came came to the store and told me they were not going to put their children on board unless I pay $2 for their fares. The same was the case last vacation, the children had no money, and I had to pay for them. Your contention \"that the parents are willing to pay these charges\" is not correct. Even in Father Morris's time the parents did not pay. On the way home Father Morris simply put them aboard and the purser collected from them whatever quarters or half dollars they had stamping Indian tickets Clayoquot Anousant for whatever money he could collect. For this kind of business the present purser won't stand. Therefore I send the vouchers again to you with the request to endorse them and forward this honest account.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Chas. Moser\"\n\nC. A. Cox,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI herewith return vouchers for twelve fares for children to their respective homes, also three staterooms and tea, a total of $53.90.\n\nI cannot certify to these vouchers as I do not consider the Department should pay these fares. In and around this locality, the parents are always willing and glad to pay the fares of their children. In all the cases on the voucher enclosed the children have parents. I understand the parents have paid the fares in the past and there is no good reason why they should not do so now, the same amount will be asked for the return fares and very likely the additional expense of Constable Bartlett having to go and get some of them.\n\nIn the Department's letter to me, copy of which I sent you in my letter of May 18th., I said, \"Kindly adhere to these instructions as close as possible and only pay the fare of those children who are orphans or insipient cases.\" This is in my opinion a very bad precedent.

He is busy from morning until night - administrating, teaching and supervising the boys' activities, even in the barns. Sister Caroline, the Superior, is a splendid type. She says Father Calmus is doing better than any of the late Principals.\n\nThe boys are not worked half enough, and the Principal is erecting a gymnasium to work off their surplus energy.\n\nI advised the re-shingling of the roof and promised two sewing machines. We should pay part of the account for shingling.\n\nThe girls' dormitory was especially fine. There is a chair beside each bed - a splendid arrangement.\n\nThe water supply is adequate.\n\nThe property belongs to the O.S.B. Order, but if they withdrew it would revert to the Diocese. The land is all stumps and rocks, and there is no possible chance to farm, or to have a good garden. The Department should go slow taking over this property, as the land is so bad.\n\nThere is a very bright boy at this school by the name of Moses Smith, and the Department might do well to offer him tuition in a few years, upon graduation.\n\nMr. Agent Cox has not been at Christie for two years, and the Principal claims that Constable Bartlett has not been any help to them of late.\n\nI understand Father Moser is going back to this vicinity as missionary.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Oct. 12, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge your No. 36-25 of the 3rd instant, enclosing voucher in favour of J.

We found the old roof in a very very bad shape.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIldefonse Calmus, O.S.B.\n\nAt the Christie School they were suffering so much with dripping rain that I strongly advised reshingling and I suggested that they send the Bill to Ottawa.

Frost,\nIndian Agent, Alberni,\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRegarding the request for water color pads, I wish to say that we have drawing tablets, white paper, which are used for drawing with water colors.\n\nAs to the desks, I should have asked for 36 desks because 24 will not provide sitting room for 36 girls present. I had stated that we have only 27 desks on hand. Where they were manufactured I don't know. Under Waterloo is the only name I can find on them. I suppose they were received about 20 years ago when this school was started, we have no record concerning them. If the desks are adjustable then they can be fitted to the size of the child. We want them for the new school-room, 15 for large girls from 15 to 18 years old, No. 1; 6 desks No. 2 from 12 to 16 years, and 12 desks from 9 to 12 years old No. 3. The old desks...\nwill be needed for the boys.\n\nThe desks, as all the other school material is to be shipped with the steamer Princess Macquinn, C. P. R. line, directly to Christie Industrial School, Kakawis, B.C., as this is the Post Office and Freight office.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M.

There are added one new recreation hall for boys also a recreation hall for girls which gives accommodation for ten additional beds over the hall - three excellent bath tubs - a good classroom, with plenty of light. An Indian house has also been built at a cost of $300.00. This is for the use of Indian people who come to see their children and often remain overnight. The exterior of the schoolhouse was also painted at a cost of $525.00.\n\nThe laundry work is done by machine and a new stove for heating the irons was installed recently.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nDEPARTMENT OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE\n\nOTTAWA, 4th April, 1924\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 1st instant, your file 159-0-5, advising that the Christie Indian Industrial School, Kakawis, B.C., is church owned, and therefore, not under the control of your Department.\n\nSales to the Indian Industrial School referred to are held to be subject to payment of sales tax.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nfor Commissioner.\n\nL/EMS.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Voucher No. 101A, in favor of the Gutta Percha & Rubber Company, Limited, Victoria, B.C., for $3.03, for one 2 X 1/2\" plain brass nozzle and one 1/2\" Gem garden hose nozzle recently supplied to the Christie School.\n\nWhen the Reverend Principal requested garden and fire hose for the school he made no mention of nozzles and it was anticipated that he could make use of the old ones. Since delivery of these goods he wrote to me stating that he would need an extra nozzle and also one for the garden hose which they had not possessed before.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 1)\nOttawa, December 3, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a communication from the principal of the Christie Indian Residential School, in which he applies for a number of sets of carpenter's tools for use in the training of pupils in carpenter work.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that such a large number of sets of carpenter's tools is not required, as the boys in training would not necessarily all be using the same kind of tool at the same time. The Department will approve of the supplying of the enclosed modified list of tools. Competitive prices should be obtained for the furnishing of the tools mentioned on this list and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost, which should not exceed your estimate of approximately $61.00. The tools mentioned on the enclosed list are all that can be authorized for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEdward B. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nAt...Rant...Albarni.R.C.\n\nNovember 12th...1924...\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith for the consideration of the Department, a request from the Rev Principal of the Christie Residential School, an application for the supply of six sets of carpenters tools for use in that school for the training of pupils in carpenter work, and respectfully beg to make the following remarks regarding that application.\n\nI fail to see the necessity for six sets of carpenters tools for an institution of that size, for should six boys be in training at the same time, they would not necessarily all be using the same kind of tool at one and the same time, and some of the tools, although necessary in a kit, are very seldom used.\n\nTherefore, should the Department favourably consider the supply of carpenters tools to Christie Residential School for the training of pupils, I think a modified list of tools as attached hereto would suffice. The price of a full kit of carpenters tools as specified on the attached list, at current prices is $45.80, but is subject to slight alteration.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward E. Horb\nIndian Agent.\nCopy of Principal's letter.\n\nChristie Industrial School,\nKakawis, B.C., October 7th 1924\n\nMr Agent, Edward E. Frost,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have just finished our outdoor Hand Ball Court, the room in the Gymnasium, and the hand-ball room I will now change into a Carpenters Shop for the boys if the Department will kindly get me six sets of carpenters tools.\n\nHickman Tye of Victoria will put up the six sets for about $200.00.\n\nI have this year repainted all the buildings at a cost of $550.00, playground and other improvements at a cost of several hundred more. I did not ask for any help from the Department. The school is church property and the upkeep of buildings should I think, if possible, be looked after by the owner, but the schoolrooms, sickroom, workshop, and playground and equipment is the work of the Department. I hope so, and therefore I now request the Department of get the carpenter tools as soon as possible.\n\nNext spring I will put in a request for playground equipment. Thanking you Mr Agent for any help you will kindly give me in this matter, I beg to remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Ildefonse Calmus.\n### CARPENTERS TOOLS\n\n| Articles                  | Price Each | Total |\n|---------------------------|------------|-------|\n| Handsaws                  | 2.50       | 7.50  |\n| 2 Ripsaws                 | 2.50       | 5.00  |\n| 2 Panelsaws               | 2.40       | 4.80  |\n| 2 Compass Saws            | .70        | 1.40  |\n| 1 SawSet                  | 1.10       | 1.10  |\n| 3 Steel Squares #14       | 2.05       | 6.15  |\n| 3 Try Squares             | .70        | 2.10  |\n| 1 Ratchet Brace           | 1.90       | 1.90  |\n| 1 Set of 9 Bits, \u00bc to 1\"  |            | 4.40  |\n| 4 Gimlet Bits             | .15        | .60   |\n| 1 Set of 8 Chisels, \u00bc to 1\u00bd\", S,F,B,E | | 6.90  |\n| 4 Claw Hammers            | 1.35       | 5.40  |\n| 2 Nail Sets               | .15        | .30   |\n| 1 Oil Stone               | .90        | .90   |\n| 3 Wood Smooth Planes      | 1.70       | 5.10  |\n| 3 Jack Planes             | 2.20       | 6.60  |\n| 3 Fore Planes             | 3.20       | 9.60  |\n| 3 Bevels                  | .80        | 2.40  |\n| 4 Rules                   | .27        | 1.08  |\n| 3 Marking Guages          | .26        | .60   |\n| 2 Spoke Shaves            | .60        | 1.20  |\n| 6 Screw Drivers (assorted)| 4\"-5\"-6\" blade | 1.68 x 3.36 |\n|                           | 25-28 -31 each |     |\n| 3 Scratch Awls            | .10        | .30   |\n| 2 Countersinks            | .55        | 1.10  |\n\nAbove prices quoted at wholesale store on November 22nd, 1924.\n\nEdward E.

Frost\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhat This Trade-Mark Means!\n\nIt means the largest playground equipment manufacturers in these United States. It means you may benefit by our quarter-of-a-century experience in the manufacture of playground equipment. It means more agents and distributing points than all other playground equipment manufacturers combined. It means a money-back guarantee backed by a firm whose financial resources are ample. It means the safety of children and healthy recreation for them. It means playground equipment from Maine to California and from Washington to Florida. It means the winner of gold medals at the 1922 and 1923 Brazilian Centennial Exposition.\n\nThe popularity of bathing, which is now one of the leading outdoor sports, has caused us to give special attention to water slides. We manufacture a standard outfit, but we would earnestly recommend a consultation with our agent before ordering. Each beach, pool and summer resort has a different situation to meet, and a slide built to meet your particular need gives far better results at no greater cost.\n\nBear in mind OUR bedways are non-rusting, galvanized Armco Iron.\n\nWe Work for Play!\nTORONTO SPECIALTY MFG.

A 30-foot Double Coaster that has a capacity of 100 \"slides\" per minute. This slide is another illustration of the thought employed by Fun-Ful engineers in safeguarding playground equipment. The double stairway with three handrails prevent careless crowding. Our catalogue gives all details.\n\nNumber 201. This apparatus is especially fitting for a grade school or park playground. Recent improvements by our engineers have made the \"Ocean Wave\" practically accident-proof. It is supported by a 5-inch steel tube, 16 feet high, imbedded in 4 feet of concrete. We shall be glad to furnish further details.\n\nNumber 227. Fun-Ful engineers score again! Another new irresistible device dedicated to the health building of youngsters. Operating on an inclined axis it gives the kiddies a flying-machine sensation. Its ball-bearing hub requires only one oiling a season. Would you care for further information on this thoroughly-tested and guaranteed-satisfactory apparatus?\n\nNumber 490. Remember when you \"slid down the old cellar door\" out at grandma's? It was great sport! This apparatus is still another product of our engineers which has just been added to our line. Although \"brand new\" it has been tested thoroughly and found to conform with the high standard of Fun-Ful equipment. Let us tell you more about it.\nNumber 380. A complete gymnasium for the outdoors. It is 14 feet high and 45 feet long. The great variety of gymnastic devices on this apparatus have made it a health builder for the old as well as the young. Our beautifully-illustrated catalogue gives complete specifications and will be sent to you upon request.\n\nNumber 367. Where space must be conserved this combination is extremely popular, as its length is only 25 feet. Although light in weight, the 2-inch steel pipes imbedded in concrete give Fun-Ful satisfaction and insure years of service. Our catalogue will assist you in selecting playground equipment.\n\nNumber 250. No apparatus affords the abundant opportunity for developing the muscles as the Horizontal Ladder. Its height is 7\u00bd feet and its length 16 feet. Anchored in 2\u00bd feet of concrete, this ladder will support the combined weight of as many children as can find \"standing room.\" Learn more of its simple and solid construction from our new catalogue.\n\nNumber 230. The See-Saw is probably the oldest form of outdoor amusement and leads the field in popularity. Our outfit is substantially built and is easily and quickly adjusted. It is adaptable to both public and private playgrounds, as the space required is only 15 feet by 14 feet. Our beautiful new catalogue describes all details.

I wish to inform you, in reply, that to my knowledge no Indian residential school has seen fit to purchase and install such expensive equipment of this type, and I know that the Department has never assisted. It is doubtful if the benefits would be commensurate with the expense. The same amount of money, expended in other equipment over a term of years, would to my mind give far better service and satisfaction. Unless you repeat your request that the Department purchase for you and deduct from the per capita grant, no action to this end will be taken.\n\nThe Department wishes to assist you in your laudable efforts to provide suitable playground equipment for the children enrolled at the school.

The tables have been received and pronounced satisfactory by the Rev Principal of the Christie School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward E. Host\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 25, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, I communicated with the Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior. I learned that their engineers in British Columbia have been so busy this year, that it has been impossible to report on the new water supply system at the Christie Indian Residential School. They have promised, however, that the investigation will be carried out during the winter months. In the meantime, Mr. Ferrier has made a note for next year's estimates, so that funds will be available for the proposed improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. I. Calmus, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Res. School,\nKakawis, B. C.\nOttawa, October 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2543-\"A\" of the 20th instant, with reference to a report on the water supply system for the Christie Indian Residential School, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. I am pleased to note that this report will be available some time during the next few months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 159-0-5.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 6th instant regarding the report on a new water supply system for the Christie Indian residential school on the west coast of Vancouver Island, the following letter has been received from our District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, under date October 15 -\n\n\"In reply to your enquiry of the 8th inst. regarding a report on a new water supply system for the Christie Indian residential school, I have to inform you that due to pressure of urgent work in the interior on behalf of the department of Indian Affairs, it has not been possible, up to the present time, for me to send an engineer to Vancouver Island to make this investigation. As soon as my engineers return from field work in the Williams Lake Agency, arrangements will be made to have this investigation carried out and report submitted.\n\nIt had been originally planned to have this investigation made during the summer months but so much work was assigned to us by the Department of Indian Affairs on irrigation projects during that period, it has not been possible to carry out the different investigations on the east as planned. These investigations may be carried out during the winter months when it is not possible to proceed with work in the interior.\"\n\nI trust that this explanation will prove satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The types of extinguishers we supply are those manufactured by the Pyrene Mfg. Company in the 5 gallon pump tank and 1/2 quart sizes. I enclose herewith a pamphlet giving particulars regarding these types. Please consult the Principal as to the number of new extinguishers required. There should be sufficient on hand throughout the building, easy of access, in case of fire. When we have full information, an order will be placed here. Please also state the number of firemen's axes you would recommend be supplied.\n\nPlease also furnish full particulars regarding the fire protection at this school, and state if fire drill is carried out by the pupils and staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. B. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nI am of the opinion that more chemical fire extinguishers are needed for safety precautions, also some firemen's axes.\nREPORT\n\non\n\nA WATER AND POWER SYSTEM\n\nfor\n\nCHRISTIE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY\n\nVANCOUVER ISLAND\n\nBy\n\nW.

C. Warren\n\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 5, 1928.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUE CANADA POOR COPY\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMarch 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Christie Industrial School,\nWater Supply System and\nPower Plant.\n\nAccording to your instructions I made an inspection of the water system at the above mentioned school and investigated the possibilities of replacing the present system with one of larger capacity, to provide fire protection and power. I submit as follows:\n\nCHRISTIE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe school is situated on Meares Island in Clayoquot Sound on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. Clayoquot village, the nearest community, is several miles distant by water. The accompanying plan shows the layout of the school property. The buildings are all of frame construction and I am informed that the school population numbers about eighty.\n\nPRESENT WATER SYSTEM\n\nThe source of the present water supply is Brother creek at a distance of about three-fourths of a mile from the school. A tank of about 10,000 gallons capacity forms a small reserve from which the school is supplied by a 2 inch iron pipe. The present supply is quite adequate for domestic purposes but affords practically no fire protection. The pipe is laid on the surface as I presume the cost of burying it at the time it was laid was considered too great. As a result it has suffered to some extent from corrosion but with some repairs would supply domestic requirements for some years.\nyet. The present licence, C.L. 3453, held in the name of Christie school, is for 5000 gallons per day for domestic use.\n\nSUPPLY OF WATER\n\nBrother creek rises on the side of the mountain to the north of the school. It consists of a number of small springs which join together at a point immediately above the present intake. The flow, according to my information, has been fairly regular for the past ten years, although during an occasional dry year the supply becomes low. During the greater part of the year, however, the flow varies between 0.5 and 1.5 cubic feet per second.\n\nThe quality of the water is very good and no doubt it will remain unpolluted for many years as from the nature of the country it may be assumed that the watershed will remain uninhabited.\n\nThe supply of water is adequate for domestic use and for fire protection purposes.\n\nWATER REQUIREMENTS\n\nWater requirements for domestic use amount to approximately 5000 gallons per day and for fire protection purposes a supply of not less than 400 gallons per minute should be available to supply two fire streams. Application has been made to the provincial Water Rights Branch for the use of 350,000 gallons per day from Brother creek to supplement the present licence.\n\nPROPOSED WATER SYSTEM\n\nTo replace the present system with one of sufficient capacity to provide adequate fire protection would cost $7875.00.\n\nThe accompanying plan shows the layout of\nthe scheme suggested.\n\nThe system proposed would have the same source of supply with a storage reserve of sufficient capacity to provide for two fire streams at low stage.\n\n**FIRE PROTECTION**\n\nFor fire protection purposes a supply of 400 G.P.M. would be available at 53 lbs. pressure to outside hydrants and at slightly less pressure to those located inside the buildings.\n\nThe three outside hydrants are to be provided with small shelter houses and each equipped with 100 feet of 2\u00bd inch hose and nozzle. The inside hydrants are placed two each on the lower two floors and a fifth on the third floor. To these are attached 50' lengths of 2 inch hose and nozzle, hung on hose racks.\n\n**AUXILIARY POWER PLANT**\n\nThe new pipeline installation will provide 3.5 K.W. at very small additional cost. With an extension of the pipeline for 165 feet, a total effective head of 160 feet may be realized.\n\nThe present electric lighting plant, a 52 volt Delco, has outlived its usefulness, and has been replaced by a 5 K.W. Lister Standard lighting system, consisting of generator and battery set. This set, however, is expensive to operate and it is considered that a saving of $250.00 per year could be effected by the installation of a Pelton driven generator capable of using the surplus water for about 9 months in the year when the lighting load is heaviest. The gasoline plant under such conditions\nmight be used merely as a standby for battery charging purposes when the water reached very low stages. The cost of this extra electric plant would be $1400.00.\n\nDETAILS OF PLANS\n\nThe storage works are to consist of a concrete reservoir 7'x16'x30', of 25,000 gallons capacity, built on the side hill to which it is proposed to divert the creek through a small screened settling basin adjoining the tank.\n\nFrom the reservoir an 8 inch wood stave pipeline 3710' long is to be constructed to the school. The distribution pipes to hydrants are reduced to 6 inch wood stave and the domestic supply is provided for by three service pipes, one of 1\u00bd inch and two of one inch. The inside hydrants are connected to the main line by 2\u00bd\" iron pipe equipped with shut off valves. Provision is made for the extension of the pipe line to a powerhouse a short distance from the school.\n\nExcavation for the pipe line will be expensive as there are numerous rock ridges to be crossed. The intermediate ground is mostly muskeg. In this it is proposed to lay the pipe on corduroy and provide the cover from borrow.\n\nThe cost of transportation of material will be high as large boats must stand off about one-fourth mile and lighter freight ashore. Shipment of material must be made in several consignments as facilities for handling are very limited.\n\nThe material will all have to be packed onto the job as there is no means of transportation available on the island.\nThe most suitable time for undertaking this work would be in midsummer as there is no accommodation at the school for the labor required. Transportation and working conditions will also be better at this season.\n\nHerewith are attached plans and estimate of cost of the proposed works.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. C.

The estimated cost of enlarging the system for domestic and fire purposes amounts to $7,875, and for the electric lighting plant, $1,400 - or a total of $9,275. The report mentions that if a Pelton driven generator was installed for the purpose of using the surplus water about 9 months of the year, there would be a saving of approximately $250 per annum.\n\nThe amount that was provided in our Estimates for this purpose is $4,000. The Department had no means of making a close estimate, as the report recently received is the first that we have had on the subject. As we will have available approximately one-half of the cost of the proposed improvement, I shall be glad to know if you are prepared to meet the balance of the costs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The activity, as indicated in my letter of the 17th ultimo, will cost approximately $9,275, and the expenditure over and above the $4,000 which is available in the Vote for Indian Education will be deducted in instalments from the per capita earnings of the school. I should be glad to know if this is satisfactory to you.\n\nI am today writing to the Dominion Water Power Branch, asking them to proceed with the work immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. J. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. I. Calmus, O. S. B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Res. School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nMay 19, 1926.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nThere is an item of $4,000 in the Main Estimates for a much needed water supply system for the Christie Indian Residential School. The Dominion Water Power Branch recently reported on a scheme which would give adequate domestic and fire protection supply and would light the buildings electrically. The proposed improvements are greater than originally contemplated and the estimate is $9,275.\n\nAs you directed, I wrote to the Rev. Principal, recapitulating the recommendation of the Dominion Water Power Branch and asking if the school management would be prepared to meet the expenditure over and above the amount appropriated. The Department is now in receipt of a telegram from Father Calmus, agreeing to the scheme and urging that work begin as soon as possible, as the old piping from the hill is in bad condition. If fire should break out, the results would likely be serious if the water supply failed.\n\nI wish to recommend that the Dominion Water Power Branch be requested to proceed with the work immediately and that the funds necessary over and above the $4,000 be deducted from the per capita grant, in instalments. I am satisfied that the Rev. Principal will agree to this method of payment.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nRA12 38 NL VIA VICTORIA\n\nKAKAWIS BC 16\n\nA MACKENZIE\n\nACTING DEPUTY DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nPROPOSITION ON WATER SYSTEM ACCEPTED WITH DOMINION WATER POWER AT ONCE WORK TO BEGIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE URGENT NEED OLD PIPE IN BAD SHAPE VERY DANGEROUS IN CASE OF FIRE LETTER FOLLOWS\n\nILDEFONSE CALMUS.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He stated in his report that, if a Pelton driven generator were installed for the purpose of using the surplus water, it would effect a saving of about $250.00 a year, and might effect a saving during the life-time of the plant of $5,000.00, which might reasonably be set against the first cost of installation. Apparently the estimate of cost covered the Pelton generator.\n\nThe amount provided in the Estimates was $4,000.00, and a cheque for that amount was sent forward on the 1st August. It was agreed that the cost over and above that amount would be deducted in instalments from the per capita earnings of the school. Upon the request of the Director, a further advance of $5,000.00 was made on the 8th August.\n\nNo accounts in support of expenditure on the water system, etc., have as yet been received at the Department.\n\nThe per capita grant to the school for September quarter has not as yet been paid.\n\nChief Accountant.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 29, 1926.\n\nMr. Paget,\n\nWould you kindly give me the following information with reference to the work done recently on the waterworks of the Kakawis Indian school, West Coast Agency, B.C.:\n\nThe total cost and how divided between material and labour, who supplied the labour, who paid for it and of whom did it consist?\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, August 8, 1926.\n\nRev.

I regret that there are no funds available to assist in this matter, with the exception of $4,000 which Parliament appropriated towards the cost of the water supply and lighting plant. The receipts you forwarded are returned herewith. It was unfortunate that you incurred a large expenditure at the beginning of the year for a lighting plant, as the installation now being undertaken by the Dominion Water Power Branch will provide electric power.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Neill, M.P., as to the cost of works recently carried out at the Christie Indian school, Mr. Webb has asked me to supply you with copies of the correspondence which passed between him and Mr. Neill, and these are accordingly enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 15, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th inst. with reference to project at Christie School, I beg to inform you that the engineer who has had charge of this work is at present in the field and hence it is impossible for me to immediately give you the detailed information required. However, upon his return to Vancouver I will endeavour to obtain the desired information.\n\nAs stated in my letter of November 7th the labour on this project is being carried out under contract by A. Thomason. The work was not advertised. The element of time was a governing factor as it was most desirable that the work should be undertaken and completed before the wet season set in. Thomason had just completed a similar job satisfactorily for us and as he agreed to immediately undertake this work at what we considered a reasonable figure, he was immediately instructed to proceed.\n\nI now realize your position in the matter and regret very much that the job was not advertised in your locality, even though considerable delay might have been occasioned in the commencement of the work. I can assure you however, that we have endeavoured to act, in this and every other project, in the best interests of the Government.\n\nThere is a possibility that this service may have charge of the installation of water and sewer systems for the new Indian school at Alert Bay and I would appreciate hearing from you as to your opinion where best to advertise the labour for this work in that locality. You will realize, however, in work of this kind the skilled labour is required for a great deal of the work which includes laying of pipes and fittings and construction of reinforced concrete reservoirs, manholes, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nA.W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni, B.C.\nNovember 16, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your enquiry regarding the letting of the labour contract for the water and light systems installed at Christie school, Kakawis, I wish to inform you that contrary to the usual procedure bids were not advertised for. I believe, however, the course followed was in the best interests of the work and of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nEarlier in the season tenders had been submitted for material for this work in anticipation of commencing about the 15th of July, with the idea of carrying it out either by day labour or contract labour, whichever appeared at the time most suitable. However, owing to the pressure of other work on which the Department of Indian Affairs were pressing for immediate action the commencement of the work was delayed until the 1st of September. At this time I found myself with at least half of my season's programme of work unfinished. In consequence of which no further delay could be considered if the Christie school work was to be completed before the wet weather made it impossible to secure a satisfactory job. I was fortunate in securing the services of Mr. Thomason, who had given such satisfactory service on the Mission School project, to undertake the work at the estimated cost for labour.\n\nI may say that Mr. Thomason could not complete the work within the contract period of thirty days owing to the weather conditions and the impossibility of securing sufficient labour locally. Before Mr. Thomason commenced the work he spent several days in Alberni looking for men but none were available either there or at Nanaimo.\n\nThe following information has been furnished me by the contractor from his payroll in regard to men employed by him:\n\n| Name                  | Days |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| Peter Bremen, Tofino  | 54   |\n| Col. Nelson, Tofino   | 6    |\n| Fritz Bonette, Long Beach | 29 |\n| Fred David, Tofino    | 7    |\n| 6 Indians at various times, Tofino | 42 |\n\nTotal 120 man-days.\n\nThe total man days on the work was 365. You will note that about 40% of the labour was employed locally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n(Sgd.) W.C. Warren,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\nNovember 17, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Christie Indian School.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 15th inst., I beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. W.C. Warren, of this staff, who had charge of the installation of the water and lighting systems at Christie School, Kakawis. Mr. Warren's letter will, I believe, give you the balance of the information requested in your letter of the 9th inst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nPer G.H. Whyte.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni, B.C.\nAlberni, Nov. 9th, 1928.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\n739 Hastings Street, West,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of 7th inst. No. 33615-5. I note the labor was contracted at a cost of $2300.00 to a Vancouver firm. May I ask whether this contract was put up to competition and if so how and where was it advertised in this district?\n\nThere are plenty of men and firms able to tender on such jobs in this district. I have never found any people resident in this district being given an opportunity of tendering for work in Vancouver nor do we expect it but the converse is surely no more than fair?\n\nI see it is stated that the contractor employed labour hired locally. I would like to be told how many men he so employed, where he got them and for how long they were employed.\n\nYou know how touchy people are at outsiders being brought in to do work when they are unemployed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) A. W. Neill.\nNovember 7, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Christie School.\n\nA letter has been received from Duncan C. Scott, Esq., Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs, requesting me to furnish you with certain information concerning works being done at Christie School, Kekawis, under the supervision of the Service for the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe works, which include Water Supply System and Electric Lighting Plant, have not yet been completed and I am, therefore, unable to furnish you with exact final costs. It is expected, however, that the job will be completed for approximately the amount estimated, namely $9275.00 of which $6657.00 is estimated for material. The labour is being carried out by A. Thomassen, Vancouver, under contract at a cost of $2300.00 plus $4.00 per cubic yard for any rock that the supervising engineer may require excavated. I understand that Mr. Thomassen is carrying out the work partly with his own men and partly with labour hired locally.\n\nWe are informed that the cost of the above works is to be borne jointly by the Department of Indian Affairs and the authorities of Christie School, the Indian Department providing $4000.00 and the Christie School authorities, the balance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni, B. C.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of the 16th instant calling for report on the non submission of the Pyrene Manufacturing Co.'s account for pyrene supplies shipped to Christie School in May 1928, and in reply beg to advise the Department that the account in question was received at this office on May 1st 1928, but owing to the error in the steam ship routing the shipment on the coast, and the delay in delivery caused thereby, the account was filed, further to the fact that the receipt of the shipment, complete and in good order, was made by the Rev. Principal verbally on my visit to the school, caused the overlooking of this account, the delay in which is regretted.\n\nVoucher No. 264 for the above account is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

Co. of Canada Limited, Toronto, for fire extinguishers for the use of the Christie Indian Residential School. This firm were requested to forward their account, in duplicate, to you and, if you have same on hand, please certify and forward it to the Department in order that payment can be made. In a communication from this firm dated April 24th, last, they stated that shipment had been made, and that invoices, in duplicate, were sent forward to you. We requested the Union Steamship Company to hand over these extinguishers to the Canadian Pacific Coast Service, to be forwarded from Vancouver to Kakawis, and it is hoped that they have arrived. The above firm are pressing for payment of their account for these extinguishers, and if the account was received by you, you should have certified and forwarded it before this date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPost Alberni, B.C.\nSir: Re - Christie School.\n\nYour letter of 2nd November has been received and, as requested, the information desired has been forwarded to A. W. Neill, Esq., M.P., Alberni, B.C. A copy of my letter to him is enclosed for your information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNovember 7, 1928.\n\nSir: Re - Christie School.\n\nA letter has been received from Duncan C. Scott, Esq., Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs, requesting me to furnish you with certain information concerning works being done at Christie School, Kakawin, under the supervision of the Service for the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe works, which include Water Supply System and Electric Lighting Plant, have not yet been completed and I am, therefore, unable to furnish you with exact final costs. It is expected, however, that the job will be completed for approximately the amount estimated, namely $275.00, of which $657.00 is estimated for material. The labour is being carried out by A. Thomassen, Vancouver, under contract at a cost of $2500.00 plus $4.00 per cubic yard for all work. The supervising engineer may require exacata. I understand that Mr. Thomassen is carrying out the work partly with his own men and partly with labour hired locally.\n\nWe are informed that the cost of the above works is to be borne jointly by the Department of Indian Affairs and the authorities of Christie School, the Indian Department providing $4000.00 and the Christie School authorities, the balance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nA. W.

The new Principal, Rev. Victor Rassier, O.S.B., writes that the fire escape leading from the boys' dormitory window is a ladder and that if the stairways are cut off it might be unsafe for the small boys. I should be pleased if you would let me have a report and recommendation in this connection.\n\nThe Principal also states that certain improvements are necessary to the heating plant.

This was altered to a wooden tank in order to maintain the cost of work within the estimate. The life of the wood tank will be in excess of that of the pipe line and a considerably saving was effected.\n\nThe system was tested out and worked satisfactorily. The hydrants supplied sufficient water at a good pressure to completely cover the school buildings.\n\nThe electric lighting plant developed 3.2 k.w. and was of sufficient capacity to operate all the lights in the school. It will be operated in conjunction with a battery plant already installed, additional equipment being provided for this purpose.\n\nThe cost of the completed system was $9075.46 against an estimated cost of $9275.00. Final accounts were submitted with my letter of the 19th ult.\n\nCC: Mr. Ditchburn\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nApril 17, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPermit me to thank you for your valued favor No. 159-0-11, under date of the 3d instant. I am very grateful to the Department for the sewing machines and for the cooperation and assistance it promises me in the matter of manual training. In accordance with the recommendations contained in your letter I will, as soon as I have given more thought and study to the matter, submit to Mr. Frost a detailed list and estimated cost of what is required to carry out our program of instruction in carpentry and internal combustion and marine engines. If it will be possible, I am quite certain, to have the same instructor handle both classes.\n\nMay I respectfully request the Department to reconsider the number of sewing machines it has seen fit to send the Christie School? It seems to me, there must be some misunderstanding. The matter was gone over very carefully by the Indian Agent, Mr. Frost, and myself with the Sister in charge of our sewing department, and we cut down our needs to the very limit of what was deemed necessary to carry on the class efficiently and without disorganizing seriously the girls' department\u2014so easily done because of the unsatisfactory conditions here and over which we have no control.\n\nFurthermore, in taking over this position, I am most desirous to train our boys and girls well in the work they will be called upon to do after leaving school; and I can't conceive, after the encouraging tone of your letter as regards training of boys in their subjects, the Department handicapping me in my efforts for the girls for the sake of two sewing machines, unless there be some misunderstanding.\n\nAnd it is only because I feel certain that there is a misunderstanding that I am making bold to trouble the Department to rehear the situation. I am sure after this explanation it will reconsider the matter and oblige the school as per my original request.\n\nMr. Frost visited the school recently in company with a plumbing expert. His report will, no doubt, reach you shortly. I am sure that if Mr. Frost presents the situation as he found it, which I have no reason to believe he will not, it will be evident to the Department what real suffering and hardship were undergone by the children during the months of February and March when the heating system in the school ceased to function and was pronounced beyond repair by those called in to make repairs.\n\nI do not hesitate to say that to compel these children to endure another winter of such misery would be nothing short of criminal. And that is precisely what will happen unless the Department takes action. The school itself is simply unable to remedy the situation because of the financial embarrassment created...\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nMr. J. D. McLean #2\n\nWhen the previous authorities installed a new water supply system and lighting plant. To be frank with the Department, the institution is in arrears to exactly that extent, over $8,000.00, and I leave you to judge the difficulties I must contend with what with creditors sight-drafting me for their money, salaries unpaid, and the Department reducing my grant by a thousand dollars each quarter.\n\nLest this be taken as an airing of a grievance, let me add that I fully appreciate that the Department is in no way responsible for this unfortunate condition, but at the same time I do think that in justice to myself I should inform the Department of the handicap under which I am compelled to struggle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nVictor Rassier,\nO.S.B.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 1, 1929.\n\nDear Bishop O'Donnell:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to conditions at the Christie Indian Residential School. There are no funds available for the purpose of erecting a new school on a new site, and it is quite uncertain when the necessary appropriation could be provided. The Department realizes that the existing school buildings are not fireproof; but every reasonable assistance has been given in the matter of fire extinguishers and fire escapes. Further, domestic water supply, which will give some protection from fire, has lately been installed at considerable cost. Your Lordship may inform the Reverend Principal that, if there are any other precautions necessary to minimize the hazard in connection with the loss of life by fire, he should make a recommendation to the Department without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. Thomas O'Donnell, D.D.,\nBishop's House,\nVictoria,\nB.C.\nBISHOP'S HOUSE.\nVICTORIA, B.C.\nApril 26th, 1929.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nAfter careful consideration of the conditions existing at Christie School, Nakawis, B.C., I have with the Principal, Father Hassler, reached the conclusion that the Government must come to our aid.\n\n1.-The present school is a fire-trap and has not even the necessary fireplaces.\n\n2.-The school is out of date and entirely unsuited for the purpose of a first-class school with proper classes, and especially for manual training.\n\n3.-A new site is required and a new school to carry on the necessary work of education.\n\nThe enclosed letter from Father Hassler will I hope meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n+ Thomas Connell\nBishop of Victoria.\nChristie Indian Residential School\n\nKakawin, B.C.\n\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nApril 19, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI feel it my duty as the new Principal of Christie Indian Residential School to place before the Department for its consideration the following facts:\n\nAt this writing the school is in arrears to the amount of over $8,000.00. Half of this indebtedness embraces grocery, feed, repair bills unpaid; the other half, salary obligations unfulfilled.\n\nMy predecessor in office installed a water system with the consent of the Department costing $6,275.00\u2014the institution paying $5,275.00, the Department $4,000.00 of the cost.\n\nHe also installed a lighting system at a cost of $5,000.00, which, there is sufficient evidence on hand to prove, was an absolute necessity.\n\nThis is precisely the extent of the school's indebtedness. The correspondence with the Department on file in this office seems to indicate that the Department would have conducted and paid the cost of both installations, had it been approached in the proper manner.\n\nIt requires no argument from me to demonstrate that the institution, being saddled with this indebtedness, is working a discouraging hardship on the staff, is interfering with the work of the school, and, to the extent that it is depriving them of the attention and care they have a right to from the school to which the Department directs them, it is inflicting an injustice upon the Catholic Indian children of this agency.\n\nWhat I would ask of the Department is, will it not take steps at once to refund the amount involved? To refuse to do so, it appears to me, is to punish the staff and the children for the error in procedure which my predecessor apparently committed, since, in its last analysis, that would seem to be all that stands between the school being in debt and out of debt.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nVictor Rassiar, O.S.B.\nPrincipal\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTender for Christie's School Fire Escape\n\nReference No. 15.18.149\n\nMy tender for above school fire escape please read as under\n\nFire ESCAPE COMPLETE\n\nTWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. $200.00\n\nYours very truly\n\nCarl Wilson\n\nThis is to certify that I have examined the Fire Escape erected by Carl Nelson, for the boy's dormitory, at the Christie Indian Residential School, and find the same complete according to contract, substantial, and of good material and finished workmanship, and accordance with fire protection regulations.\n\nEd.

He states that the ladder that has been in use as a fire escape for the boys is now in such a condition that it is unsafe. I have to request that you will arrange as soon as possible for the installation of adequate fire escape facilities at this school. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to see that adequate facilities are provided for escape from the building in case of fire. Mr. Agent Frost, in his report, only mentioned the fire escape for the boys, but it may be that other escapes are required for the use of the girls. You will, no doubt, be able to arrange for the installation of fire escapes that will meet the requirements in all respects, at a reasonable cost. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward a certified account, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nI may say that the department has no funds available this year for any other improvements at this school.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Frost that this matter has been placed in your hands to have the fire escapes provided and the work completed at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666, Victoria, B.C.\nOttawa, May 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the improvements required at the Christie Indian Residential School, and enclosing copy of a report from Mr. A. S. Hanna, Plumbing and Heating Mechanic, on his survey of conditions at this school. Relative to the detailed report of Mr. Hanna as to the improvements required in the heating system and the various other changes mentioned, I have to say that there are no funds available this year to carry out this work, and the school authorities, themselves, should arrange to place the heating arrangements in a satisfactory condition for next winter's use.\n\nThe Department is requesting Mr. Commissioner Bitchburn to arrange for the providing of adequate fire escape equipment, and this matter will, no doubt, be attended to by him at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that I accompanied Mr. A.S. Hanna, Plumbing and Heating mechanic on his survey of the Christie Indian Residential School on April 5th and 6th.\n\nHis detailed estimates of the improvements necessary for that school are enclosed herewith, for the Department's information.\n\nIn view of the fact that this school is owned by the Missionary Society, I would respectfully suggest for the Department's consideration that one of the Government Architect's be requested to survey the school and examine the improvements suggested and the estimated cost of same, as the expenditure is considerable.\n\nRe the question of improvement in fire escape facilities, I beg to state that the ladder that has been in use as a fire escape for the boys at this school is now in such a condition that it is unsafe. It is a ladder leading from the upper floor direct to the ground a distance of about 45 feet; when this ladder was sound it was a means of escape that could be used by boys in the daytime with comparative safety, but the material of which the ladder is constructed has deteriorated by weather to the point at which it is unsafe at any time, and when this is replaced, an apparatus that complies with the Provincial Regulations governing same should be installed. On my last visit to the school I tried the ladder and one of the rungs broke under my weight and the ladder itself showed signs of collapse, and with a number of boys on it at one and the same time it would be decidedly unsafe as their weight would be far greater than mine.\n\nEncs\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Scott\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nMr. E.E. Frost,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReport on Christie School Kakawis, B.C. The heating boiler is worn out past repair and will have to be replaced by sectional boiler. The new addition to the school is not properly heated. The ground floor has a fireplace with coils in it; by this means the water for the radiator on the first floor is heated, this is very unsatisfactory. Flow and return mains should be run from the heating boiler to the new addition. Radiators put in on the ground floor and coupled up with the radiators on the first floor.\n\nThe shower baths in the basketball hall should be removed to the boys basement.\n\nThe boys closets should be re-arranged so that they do not open on the hall way between the kitchen and boys dining room.\n\nThe present plumbing is badly in need of a general overhaul. Two broken closet bowls and tanks also several seats should be replaced by new ones and several new basin taps.\n\nThere is no septic tank to take care of the discharge from the drains, all empties into a small stream close by the school and is causing a nuisance. A septic tank should be built large enough to take care of the school, with a 200 foot discharge drain. This tank and drain could be built by the larger boys.\n\nThe laundry machine is past repairing, it is full of rotten holes and will have to be replaced by a new one. A Simplex Ironer should be installed at the same time, hand ironing is too slow for a school of this size, especially where the irons have to be heated on a stove.\n\nTwo large hot water tanks should be installed in the main building, for the baths and basins, and one in the laundry. There is a 30 gallon boiler in the laundry now, it does not hold enough water to half fill the washing machine.\n\nThe new boiler, radiators, fittings, and flange unions to connect the new boiler to present system, valves on the flow and return mains to control different sections of the plant, the installing of the new boiler, cutting up of the old boiler to get it out of the basement, changing the shower baths and the boys closets, two hot water tanks, new washing machine and ironer, overhauling the plumbing and radiation in the new addition will cost approximately three thousand nine hundred twenty-five dollars, $3925.00. Material F.O.B., C.P.R. steamer at Kakawis.\n\nYours truly, (sd) A.S. Hanna,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, May 1, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo which is relative to the heating plant at the Christie Indian Residential School. I have not yet received any special report from Mr. Frost in this connection, but I may say that there are no funds available this year for major improvements at your school. This is the first information that the Department has received that the heating plant was not functioning in an adequate manner.\n\nI have also your letter of the 19th ultimo, which was forwarded by His Lordship the Bishop of Victoria. I note that the school has a deficit of approximately $8,000.00, which has been caused partly by the installation of an electric lighting system and the Church share in the cost of the new water supply. I note your remark that the Department might have paid for these improvements if it had been approached in the proper manner. May I correct any misunderstanding at the outset by stating that your predecessor kept in close touch with the Department and its officers and was given as much assistance in connection with capital expenditure as could be granted in the circumstances. I regret that there are no funds for the purpose of paying the debt at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Victor Rassier, O. S.

E.

Mr. Frost was instructed to get a contractor from Alberni to go to the School and make a sketch of what was necessary and to give an estimate of the cost. Mr. L.A. Hanna, the Alberni contractor, then suggested that it would be better to have the work done by a local man, and Mr. Carl Nelson, of Tofino, submitted a tender for $200.00 and the contract was accordingly let to this carpenter.\n\nThe work has now been completed and I am herewith submitting voucher No. 136 received today from Mr. Indian Agent Frost in favour of Carl Nelson, of Tofino, B.C. I, therefore, would recommend that the account be paid as the Agent has given his certificate that he has examined the fire escape and finds same completed according to the contract, being substantial and of good material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 2)\nAugust 30, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Frost:\n\nI wish to refer to your 69/29 of May 4th, enclosing copy of a report on the heating and plumbing repairs required at the Christie Indian Residential School. It has been decided to have the necessary repairs undertaken, and you may engage Mr. A. S. Hanna, plumbing contractor, of Alberni. The recommendations in Mr. Hanna's report of April 25th should be a guide to him; but he will first discuss the improvements with the Reverend Father Victor. A septic tank, if necessary, should be built by the larger boys at the school. In any case, the stream into which the sewage is discharged should be fenced off from the playground.\n\nThe recommendations in the first four paragraphs of Mr. Hanna's letter are approved. The washer in the laundry may be replaced; but I cannot authorize a Simplex ironer. I understand that a new stove for heating irons is necessary in the laundry. Two large hot water tanks should be installed in the main building and one in the laundry.\n\nYou may authorize Mr. Hanna to undertake an expenditure of $3,500 for these purposes. It is understood that he will consult with the Reverend Principal and meet his wishes, as long as the appropriation is not exceeded. I am enclosing a copy of this letter, which you may hand to Mr. Hanna, for his guidance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPORT ALBERNI, B. C.\nAugust 30, 1929.\n\nDear Father Victor:\n\nPursuant to our recent conversation, I am pleased to inform you that the Department has decided to relieve the Christie Indian Residential School of the obligation to repay the $5,078.46, which was the school's share of last year's improvement to mechanical plant. I have asked Mr. Ferrier to make the adjustment. As you were informed when in Ottawa, Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn is enquiring about a suitable boat.\n\nI am also pleased to state that approximately $2,500 will be expended in the necessary improvements to the heating and plumbing, etc. Mr. Indian Agent Frost is being authorized today to engage Mr. A. S. Hanna, of Alberni, who has already forwarded an estimate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Father Victor, O. S. B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Residential School,\nKakawis, B. C.\nAugust 26, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE CHARLES STEWART.\n\nOn the west coast of Vancouver Island, near Clayoquot Sound, there is situated the Christie Indian Residential School, conducted by the Benedictine Fathers. The school was established by the Church over 50 years ago, and it has continuously served the Indians of the west coast.\n\nIt is only lately that the Department has given any assistance, other than per capita grant. A year ago, there was an item of $4,000 in the Indian Education Appropriation, to provide water supply, fire protection and electric light plant. Approximately $1,000 towards this improvement was to be provided by the Church - the first estimate being $5,000. The Department asked the Dominion Water Power Branch to make a report, and they found that $9,300 was required. The Reverend Principal was asked to provide $5,000 for the purpose, which was the amount necessary over and above the vote. The final arrangement was that the Department was to pay for the improvement and that $5,075.46 was to be deducted, by instalments, from the per capita grant.\n\nIn February, last, Reverend Father Victor, O.S.B., was appointed Principal, and he has made a real effort to grapple with the problems of the school and to serve our Roman Catholic wards on the west coast. He finds that the deductions from the per capita grant have crippled the school financially, and further, that some improvements now must be made to the heating plant. I have been very favourably impressed by Father Victor, and, as funds are available in the current Appropriation to assist, I wish to recommend that he be relieved from this obligation to repay the $5,075.46 and that approximately $2,500 be expended in the necessary improvements to mechanical plant. The last mentioned work could be undertaken by Mr. A. S. Hanna, plumbing contractor of Alberni, who has been suggested by Mr. A. W. Neill, M.P.\n\nThis recommendation is in harmony with the policy of the past few years. When a modern school cannot be erected for some time, the old building has been made as safe and comfortable as funds will permit. The Christie School is educating 100 children in residence and is an important factor in our programme for the advancement of British Columbia Indians.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 26, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE CHARLES STEWART,\n\nOn the west coast of Vancouver Island, near Clayoquot Sound, there is situated the Christie Indian Residential School, conducted by the Benedictine Fathers.
