Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Idle Wells School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 3, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Idle Wells, October 11, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita and days in quarter is calculated by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the File Hills School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 6th, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated April 16th, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**FILE HILLS - QU'APPELLE Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the FILE HILLS School at BALCARRES on March 31, 1949**\n\n### REGISTER NUMBER\n\n| NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| CARRIED FORWARD | 2754 |     |      |                |                   |                        |                           |            |\n\n#### 267 James Stonechild\n- Age: 9\n- Boy: I\n- Class: Peepeeksis\n- Standing: /\n- Trade: /\n- Date: 1-9-46\n- Attendance: 90/64\n\n#### 268 Glen Stonechild\n- Age: 9\n- Boy: I\n- Class: /\n- Standing: /\n- Trade: /\n- Date: 1-9-46\n- Attendance: 90/64\n\n#### 269 Ivan Keswatin\n- Age: 10\n- Boy: I\n- Class: Okanase\n- Standing: /\n- Trade: /\n- Date: 1-9-46\n- Attendance: 90/64\n\n#### 270 Lionel Stonechild\n- Age: 10\n- Boy: I\n- Class: /\n- Standing: /\n- Trade: /\n- Date: 1-9-46\n- Attendance: 90/64\n\n#### 271 Robert Akapew\n- Age: 9\n- Boy: I\n- Class: L.

However, you failed to show when she left the school. Our Treasury and Audit Branch insist that the dates the pupils leave and return to residence be shown.\n\nWould you kindly supply the information for this case, and make it a point to show all necessary dates and reasons on future returns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nMr. L. McLean,\nPrincipal,\nFile Hills Indian Res., School,\nBalcarres, Sask.,\n\nMPP/RM\nMiss E. Maen was not notified as to opening of school, the principal took charge of both rooms the first week.

Supervision of junior room during her absence was in charge of the principal.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Deacon, in trust, Balcarres, Saskatchewan, representing the hauling of the lumber and material for the Classroom extension to the School at File Hills, under Department authority dated April 9, 1925.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that there is no regular fire alarm system in connection with the File Hills Boarding School, and this matter should be attended to without delay. I would respectfully request that I be authorized to spend $200.00 in installing two gongs together with the necessary wiring and work in connection therewith.\n\nAn extra fire escape pole is also required, to be erected at a low cost. I have not the figures at hand just now, but it would probably come to somewhere in the neighborhood of $200.00 to do this work.\n\nI would also ask for your authority to purchase a couple of iron gates costing about $100.00.\n\nThere is a little extra work in connection with the setting up of a bell that was on the roof. This might be done for less than $25.00.\n\nWe have a carpenter at work now erecting the addition to the outside classroom, and if money is available I would have this work done by these men.\n\nI would also ask for authority to purchase sufficient awning to fit over the screens on the new verandah that has been erected. I cannot say what this would cost, but $100.00 would be ample to cover this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

If you will refer to official letter of this file number of the 9th ultimo, you will note that you already have authority to supply and install two fire alarm gongs. You are authorized to erect an extra fire escape pole, to purchase two iron gates, to set up the bell on the roof and to purchase awnings for the new verandah. Your estimates in this connection should not be exceeded. Please keep in mind the regulations governing purchases when you are awarding the business. Your estimate of $100 for two iron gates seems high and I should be grateful if you would incur only the necessary expenditure in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

At the present time the Principal is using the old Principal's residence for storing his surplus clothing and other goods. This building is situated in the centre of what should be the children's play ground, and is anything but an ornament on the premises. It is my intention to give this building to an Indian and to build a small frame store house to take its place for storage purposes, if this meets with your approval. I may inform you that we will save a sufficient amount from the authority already granted to do this work, and it will not be necessary to ask for any additional funds.\n\nI shall be glad to receive the Department's sanction to go on with this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

The henhouse and implement shed were authorized in addition to the classroom; but I note that you will be able to provide an ice house and a store room with the funds that were authorized for this school.\n\nI wish to draw to your attention several expenditures which have been incurred at the File Hills Institution this fiscal year, in addition to the building programme, viz.: the gas engine, plumbing, boring well, fire escape, awning, screens and smaller items. In view of these expenditures, which were not voted, it is extremely desirable that no expense that is not absolutely necessary be incurred. You may proceed with the ice house and the store room, but the cost should be kept to a minimum consistent with efficiency.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Ross\n\nIndian Agent\n\nFile Hills\n\nFeb 19\nExtract from Report of Inspector Murison on the File Hills Residential School - dated May 5th, 1926.\n\nThe main building, since the new addition was erected, has accommodation for 90 pupils. The building is well equipped for its purpose and a great improvement was noted since my last inspection. I found the building well kept and clean. The interior of the older portion requires repainting and decorating throughout. As it is some years since this was done, the paint has worn off in many places. I would suggest that the walls in the Girls' Playroom which is situated in the new addition should be wainscoted to protect the plaster. In a room used for this purpose, the walls are subject to hard knocks and unless wainscoted, it is a difficult matter to keep them clean for a height of four or five feet. The dining room has been extended and the extension should be wainscoted to make the appearance uniform. This work would not entail very much outlay.\n\nI noted that two chairs for the Teachers are required.\n\nAn ice house, implement shed, store house and poultry house were built last year and require painting, as the work was done too late in the season to permit of this work being done.\n\nWATER SUPPLY\n\nThe water supply is obtained from a well 128 ft. deep. This well has a capacity of about 25 barrels a day which is pumped into a 750 gallon pressure tank. Owing to the limited supply, it is necessary to pump almost continuously during about 15 hours of the day. This supply is not sufficient as it does not provide for any surplus in case of an emergency, such as fire.\n\nIn forwarding the above report Commissioner Graham in his letter No.306-9 of May 10th, 1926, states as follows:\n\nYou will note that this school has an accommodation for 90 pupils. The Inspector refers to certain interior decorating and re-painting. This should be done. I also think that the wainscoting referred to should be attended to.\n\nThis school is giving good satisfaction. They very seldom have any friction, and no complaints, for the simple reason that we have a practical man at the head of the institution. After Portage la Prairie, this, in my opinion, is the best boarding school we have.\nOttawa, May 17th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the report of Mr. Inspector Murison regarding the interior decorating and repairing required, also wainscoting in the girls' playroom and the dining room, at the File Hills Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you that, as the funds at our disposal this fiscal year are limited, this work will have to stand over for the present season.\n\nRelative to the two chairs which the Inspector states are required for the teachers' use, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of same, obtaining chairs of a good serviceable type. Please forward vouchers in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDuncan Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have representations from the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada to the effect that the interior of the Principal's Residence at the File Hills School needs decorating. The walls, I am told, are finished in white plaster, and have never been decorated during the two years since the residence has been built. The estimated cost of material is $100.00 and the labour about $50.00.\n\nA request is also made for the painting of the outbuildings. The material will cost about $150.00 and the labour $80.00. These outbuildings were erected in the fall of 1925, and have not yet been painted. The lumber is checking badly and the buildings are consequently deteriorating.\n\nApplication is also made for a grant for painting and decorating the interior of the main building. The paint and varnish in the interior of this main building needs renewal and has not been decorated for the past twelve years. Some work, we are told, has been done by the school authorities, but lack of funds prevents the decorating of the whole building. The estimated cost of material is $1,200.00, and labour $400.00.\n\nThere is also a strong desire on the part of the management of this School that more land should be cleared.

This condition renders liable the overheating of the generator and may result in serious damage to it and new batteries should be installed.\n\nI shall be glad to receive authority to incur the necessary expenditure which will amount to $225.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

We note that you state this lighting system is in use in the Hospital Boarding School.\n\nConsiderable building activity took place at the File Hills Residential School and hospital building some two years ago, and our files are not clear as to whether the same plant provides light for both the school and hospital building. I shall be pleased to have a report from you as to what buildings are being lighted by the system for which you now request that new batteries be supplied. This information is required in order that we can decide as to what appropriation the funds necessary for the supplying of the new batteries are chargeable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 111-1-5, dated the 7th instant, I beg to state that the insertion of the word 'Hospital' between the words File Hills and Boarding School, was inadvertent, and that the requisition for new batteries was to replace those that are badly sulphated and buckled at the File Hills Boarding School.\n\nThe lighting plant at this school provides light for the school only, and the report of the Agent of Bruce Robinson Supplies, Ltd., indicated that unless a new set is installed at an early date, the generator will be damaged and the plant thrown out of commission. I had the agent in my office this morning and discussed the situation with him. While two batteries were originally installed with the plant at the school, one new set will be sufficient to put the plant in proper operating order, as some of the cells in the two old batteries can be utilized and with one new set will provide for what is required. In view of the expert's report and that batteries for the agency have been authorised, I have ordered a set for the school in order that the two may be sent together. The company will set up the batteries and see that the plant is properly operating.\n\nI trust my action will be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

The cost of material and labour will be approximately $600.00 and I shall be glad if this amount can be provided to have the necessary work done. I regret that I overlooked placing an item in the estimates to cover this expenditure. The Principal, in writing on the subject, states that some of the buildings are drying out and checking very badly. It is possible that a part of the appropriation, if it can be found, can be saved by having the labour performed by the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

The Church authorities requested that the following work be carried out:\n\n1. Redecorating interior Principal's residence.\n2. Painting of outbuildings.\n3. Painting and decorating interior of main building.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will have an accurate estimate made of the cost of the material and labour required in having all the above work carried out, taking into account the utilizing as far as possible of the labour of the staff at the school. When we have definite information as to the cost involved, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work carried out this coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

This should be done. There is also some wainscoting necessary in the girls' playroom. However, I think that if the $1000.00 asked for is allowed it will cover this work as well as the painting.\n\nThere is no object in doing the interior work until the school is closed for the summer vacation, but the exterior work could be gone on with any time. The proper procedure would be to buy the paint from a wholesale paint house here in Regina. This paint cannot be bought locally to satisfaction, and I doubt whether it would not be well to put an expert painter on to do the job. Painters are scarce and we will have difficulty in finding one. This work, however, cannot be carried on by amateurs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, with regard to the matter of painting at the File Hills Indian Residential School, and reply to say that the Estimates for 1927-28 contain an amount of $500.00 for interior painting of the school proper, $100.00 for decorating interior of Principal's residence, and $150.00 for re-decorating the interior of the detached classroom - a total of $750.00 for interior decorating. I think perhaps this amount will meet the requirements so far as the inside painting is concerned, and may provide a small amount for outside work, but not sufficient, by any means, to do all the outside painting that is necessary.\n\nThe dormitories at this school will require kalsomining, and the wainscoting almost throughout the whole building will have to be re-painted, also the inside window casings, baseboards, etc., in fact a general re-painting of the interior of the school is necessary.\n\nSeveral small outbuildings were put up at this institution a year ago, viz:- an ice house, storehouse, implement shed, garage, poultry house, and two granaries. These will all have to be painted.\n\nYou will note in the Estimates an item of $1000.00 for unforeseen repairs. If this amount were available it would be quite sufficient, with what I have mentioned, to complete the painting at the File Hills School. Besides the painting there are some repairs to be done, viz:- reflooring part of the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFARM & GARDEN.\n\nThere is 75 acres under cultivation; last year their crop included 25 acres of Barley, 35 acres of Oats, 8 acres of Potatoes and 15 acres of summerfallow, the balance being used for garden. The potatoes were a short crop last year and they will have to buy about 150 bushels to meet their requirements. The garden provided ample vegetables for their use. The total acreage set aside for this school is 413. The portion not under cultivation is largely covered with scrub and is broken up with small hay sloughs. It was planned to have this land cleared and brought under cultivation last year, but owing to certain conditions this could not be done.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that conditions at this school continue to be very satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWater Supply (Cont'd)\n\nUpon examining the pump in operation that it was only pumping a percentage of its capacity. The pressure tank is, in my opinion, too small to provide a surplus of water for an emergency. An item of $1,000.00 was placed in last year's estimates to provide a supply of water for washing and flushing purposes. It is proposed to dig a seepage reservoir at the edge of the lake, which is a short distance in front of the school, and pipe the water to the school for this purpose. If this was done, it would be necessary to have a separate pressure tank and connections so that there would be no danger of getting this water mixed with that used from the well for drinking purposes.\n\nPupilage.\n\nThere are 89 pupils enrolled, 36 boys and 53 girls, all of whom were in residence, with the exception of 2 girls who are in High School and 2 boys and 2 girls absent on account of sickness. The children were well dressed, looked clean and well nourished.\n\nThe staff at this school appear to be quite competent in their different departments. I noted some changes since my last visit. A new Farming Instructor has been appointed and from what I hear, he is reputed to be the best they have had at this school.\n\nStock.\n\nTheir stock includes 15 Holstein cows, 2 bulls, 4 heifers, 7 calves, 9 head of horses and also 35 head of poultry. The cattle are a good type of Holstein. They had already 7 cows freshened this Spring. The herd provides ample milk for the use of the children.\n\nFarm & Garden\nthe girls' playroom should be wainscoted. I find now that\nthe plaster has been knocked off in places and the walls\nscratched and soiled, and it is very necessary that\nwainscoting should be provided in a room used for this\npurpose. The metal ceilings in the new addition have not\nbeen painted. In the boys' playroom the wainscoting should\nbe painted and 15 more feet of wainscoting should be placed\non the inner wall. The plaster on the walls in this room\nis in bad shape and the metal sheeting is rotted in places.\n\nWith regard to the exterior painting required,\nit was noted that the storm sash on the new part had not\nbeen painted and the old sash should be re-painted. The\nout-buildings requiring painting include - the pump house,\nstore house, garage, ice house, implement shed, poultry\nhouse, 2 granaries and the engine house. The class room,\nwhich is a separate building, is in good shape, but I would\nrecommend that wire screen should be provided on the outside\nof the windows for protection. This class room adjoins the\nplayground.\n\nPRINCIPAL'S RESIDENCE.\n\nThe walls in the downstairs and upstairs\nhalls are soiled and the plaster cracked in places. In the\ndining room, sitting room and kitchen the walls have not a\ngood appearance owing to brush marks being left by the\nplasterers. Although this building has only been up two\nyears, it requires re-decorating.\n\nWATER SUPPLY.\n\nThe water supply is obtained from a well\n120 ft. deep; its capacity is reported at about 25 gals.\nper day. The water is pumped into a 750 gal. pressure\ntank. Owing to the limited supply, it is necessary to pump\nalmost continuously for about 16 hours a day and I noted\n\nupon examining\nInspector Murison's report on File Hills Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the File Hills Residential School, which I visited on the 12th instant.\n\nI examined the buildings carefully and noted their condition; they are practically in the same condition as I found them one year ago. The interior of the older portion requires re-painting and decorating throughout. It is some years since this work was done; the building was last kalsomined in 1924. The walls in the boys' dormitories are dirty and there is some plaster repairing to be done. The wood work should also be painted; it was last painted in 1923 and the paint is rubbed off in places. The new cupboards in the hospital wing bathroom have not been painted. The hall walls to the dispensary and the walls in the dispensary room itself are soiled.\n\nAbout 40 ft. of wainscoting is required in the dining room extension. The staff dining room requires kalsomining and painting. The kitchen and pantry walls are badly soiled. The walls in the bake room are also soiled. I noted that the new balcony screen base has not been painted inside and no awnings have been provided for this balcony. Some of the awnings on the old balconies are badly faded and torn. The stairs leading up to the girls' dormitory are badly worn and have only been provided with 7 metal treads; 9 more are required. I mentioned in my last report that\n\nW. M.

The proposal to dig a seepage reservoir at the edge of the lake and connect it up with the pressure system to be used for washing and flushing purposes might be followed. This would leave the limited supply of water in the well for drinking purposes. The cost of this would be about $1000.00, or perhaps a little more, and I should be glad to have your authority to proceed with the work.\n\nThe pupilage at this school is good, although we could take in eleven more if they could be had. I understand from the Principal that he is going to start out on a recruiting trip shortly.\n\nNothing has yet been done to clear land at the school. It is most difficult to get men who will undertake this sort of work. I am hoping, however, to get something done this year. The funds, I suppose will be available, as they were not used last year, and a re-vote was asked for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

You may arrange to have the interior decorating and exterior painting as proposed in your letter undertaken when timely. The outbuildings also may be painted.

The expenditure should be kept as low as possible, and your estimate of approximately $1,000 should not be exceeded. If you consider it necessary, you should get the advice of an expert before undertaking the activity.\n\nThere is also an appropriation of $1,000 for clearing at the File Hills institution.

In this connection I beg to say that Mr. Commissioner Graham states that there is an old house which was formerly used by the interpreter at the File Hills Agency which could be fitted up for this purpose, as the Agency is only a few hundred yards from the School. Please report as to what work is required in fitting up this house to make it suitable for overnight accommodation for the Indian parents who visit the above School, and the approximate cost of same. Your early attention to this matter will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. L. Deacon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nBalcarres, Sask.,\nFeb. 29, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter lll-1-5, dated the 21st instant, in connection with your enquiry with regard to fitting up the old interpreter's house at the Agency for the use of Indians visiting File Hills School.\n\nThe house referred to is an old log house that was sheeted outside with siding and has a shingle roof. It has not been used for at least ten years, consequently it is in a bad state for repairs. The windows and doors would all have to be re-newed and it would also have to have new floors, the roof repaired, new stairs and something done to the walls as all the plaster has fallen off. I estimate that it would cost about $350.00 to do the above mentioned work.\n\nThere is at the Agency a small house that was built a few years ago for the destitute Indians who needed extra care. It did not prove a success as the old people would not stay there. It is not a great distance from the School, less than a half a mile, but if this is considered too far, it could easily be moved. It is in good shape, but there was only two ply of boards put on when it was built. I think this building would be far more suitable for the purpose mentioned. If it is, I recommend that it be sheeted inside the studding, the cost of which would be about $100.00. There are some furnishings in the place but it should have some more, such as pots and pans, blankets, bedding, etc. These should not cost more than $40.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 6th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the fitting up of a house for Indian parents while staying overnight during their visits to the File Hills Indian Residential School. The house the Department had in mind was the small house at the Agency, situated less than half a mile from the school. Mr. Commissioner Graham, who is at present in the Department, states that this house would be satisfactory for the purpose, and that it should remain on its present location, as it is not too far from the school.\n\nYou may incur an expenditure of approximately $100 in having the inside of this building sheeted, as recommended by you. You should arrange for the purchase of the material required and for the labour in having the work done, and this should be carried out at an early date. Please keep all expense down as low as possible, and forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply the furnishings mentioned by you, such as pots, pans, blankets, bedding, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It seems to me that the school authorities should arrange for this service.\n\nPrincipals of residential schools are constantly calling upon the Department to bear expenditures which I think should be borne by them. The correspondence entailed in attending to these matters involves a great deal of work, which might be obviated if the school authorities were given to understand that the cost of the upkeep of the plants installed at residential schools should be borne by themselves and not by the Department, as that I understand is the policy of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nIn 1923 you very kindly donated to the School a Moving Picture Machine which has been a means of giving the Students many happy hours of entertainment, as well as imparting to them many interesting and educational subjects, enabling them to grasp the essential points much more quickly than if given orally.\n\nThe makers of this Machine have discontinued manufacture of this particular model, in fact it has been obsolete for the past 5 years, and we find it is impossible to obtain repairs or spare parts to keep the machine in good running order, and I was wondering if the Department would give us a little financial assistance in procuring another Machine. We could purchase a \"Zenith\" Model E for the sum of $290.00 F.O.B. Regina, this machine is an excellent one for the purpose and will give many years of satisfactory service. This Projector is distributed by Cameron Brothers Limited, 11th Avenue, Regina, who will be pleased to give you any information you may require on the subject.\n\nIf the Department would be willing to pay half the cost of this Machine we would be very grateful. The Students and friends from the various reserves are looking forward to the performance commencing with great eagerness and I would not like to disappoint them if I can help it.\n\nWe will appreciate any assistance you can give to us in this matter.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd.) F. Rhodes\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. Nov. 8th, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter that I received from Mr. F. Rhodes, Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School. You will note that Mr. Rhodes is making a request that the Department pay half the cost of a Moving Picture Machine which he would like to buy. I know that the machine which I gave Mr. Rhodes has been a source of great pleasure to the children of the school, and many of the older Indians have been in the habit of going there once a week and having a regular picture show in the outside classroom, so that if you could see your way clear to meet his request it would be greatly appreciated, not only by the pupils, but also by the people on the reserve. This school has always given good satisfaction and the cost of operation has been small compared with most schools. I doubt whether anything has been given to them in the way of equipment for games, so that this request, in my opinion, is a reasonable one, and I am sure if it is possible to do so you will authorize the expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nV. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 306-11A of the 8th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School in which he requests that the Department pay half the cost of the purchase of a moving picture machine for the use of the school.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that it is not the policy of the Department to provide equipment of this nature for Indian schools. However, in view of the report of the Principal and yourself as to the service which this machine will give to the pupils and Indians, the Department will make an exception in this case and will provide half the cost of same. The Principal should arrange for the payment of the entire cost of the picture machine, obtaining a receipt, in duplicate.

It is noted that you estimate the cost of the work to be from $50 to $75, and in this connection I have to request that you will keep the expense for the purpose as low as possible.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward a certified account in the usual manner covering the expense incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThere is an outside closet provided for boys at the north east end of the boys' playground, and a similar convenience for the girls situated to the south of the school and close to the lake. In neither case is there any protection against the entrance of flies, and the contents of the closets were one mass of flies, and in a most insanitary and dangerous condition. (Considering the number of pupils using these closets it is impossible to prevent the entrance of flies) The location of the girls' outside closet is particularly bad inasmuch as it is only a few yards away from and above the lake in front of the school, and the pit is full and draining over the ground towards the water. With water and sewerage facilities available for the school building I would recommend that these outside closets be done away with and proper water carriage conveniences provided. This would remove practically the only fly hazard present around the school, and make it sanitary.\nSir:\n\nIn perusing Dr. A.B. Simes reports for the month of June, I note his comments concerning the outside closets used for the pupils at the File Hills Residential School. To abandon them and use interior ones entirely, would necessitate a complete change in the plumbing arrangements which are not adequate or suitable. Outside closets are used in all our Residential Schools and there is no obstacle to their being kept clean and sanitary.\n\nI instructed the Indian Agent to board them at the bottom where they apparently are open, and provide and utilize Chloride of Lime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 19, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 314-12D of the 15th instant, relative to the report of Dr. Simes, Medical Superintendent, Qu'Appelle Indian Health Unit, concerning the outside closets at the File Hills Indian Residential School. It is noted you do not recommend that these toilets be abandoned and interior ones used entirely, as it would necessitate a complete change in the plumbing arrangements, which are not adequate or suitable.\n\nThe Medical Superintendent stated that the outside closets were in a most unsanitary condition and that the location of the girls' closet was particularly bad, inasmuch as it is only a few yards away from and above the lake in front of the school, and that the pit was full and draining over the ground towards the water.\n\nIt is noted that you have instructed the Indian Agent to have these closets boarded at the bottom and have the school authorities utilize chloride of lime. You should also instruct the Agent to have the school authorities thoroughly clean out these toilets and see that they are placed in as sanitary a condition as possible. Would it be possible to move the girls' closet to another site, filling in the present location? The school authorities should see that chloride of lime is used freely in order to prevent the entrance of flies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. B. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nis only used for flushing, and for laundry purposes.\n\nI think that Dr. Simsa's report in this connection was rather uncalled for, in fact I know it was.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant No. 111-1-5, relative to the report of Dr. Simes concerning the outside closets at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information I beg to say that I instructed Mr. Dodds to make a report on these closets, and his report is just what I expected it would be, as I could not understand Mr. Rhodes, who is an outstanding man, having anything unsanitary around the place.\n\nMr. Dodds states that the girls' closets are situated about thirty yards from the lake, and that they were not draining over into the lake, and looked as though they never had been. He goes on to say that the closets are scrubbed every week, and chloride of lime is used. The boys' closets are situated north of the school, and the Agent states that they appear to him to be in as sanitary a condition as it is possible for outside closets to be. He goes on to say that the girls' closets cannot be removed any further from the lake on account of the location of the Principal's house.\n\nI may point out to you that the lake referred to is never used to supply water for domestic purposes, and a pit dug 90 feet from a lake is not going to contaminate the water even if it were used for cooking.

Boarding\n\nCattle Barn 18 x 80\n\nThere is not sufficient room to house the cattle at the School and it is proposed to build a lean-to to the barn 18 x 80. This will supply ample accommodation. There will be ten double cow stalls with feed alley. The floor is to be of cement. It is intended to cut a door to enable the cattle to be fed from the main barn. The studding of the outside will be nine feet and inside 14 feet. It is estimated the lumber, cement, hardware, etc., will cost $950, and the labour $350. I have charged the item from a lean-to to a separate barn which is far more advisable.\n\nFencing\n\nThe fencing around the School is worn out. It is estimated the material that is wire, posts and stables will cost $100. I did not estimate for labour as I considered the staff and boys should be able to do that themselves.\n\nNew cement floor for kitchen\n\nThe floor in the kitchen is badly worn out and it is thought that a cement floor would be the most serviceable for that room. The material would cost $25.00 and the labour $15.00. The gravel would be obtained by the School.\n\nNew hardwood floor for hall in basement\n\nThe floor is worn out and needs replacing. The material, that is hardwood and nails would cost $250 and the labour $50.00 $75.00.\n\nPainting garage, store house and pump house\n\nThese three buildings need painting. The paint and labour will cost $100.\n\nAddition to chicken house 16 x 30\n\nThe chicken house they have at present will only accommodate 50 chickens and it is desired to increase the flock to 150, which I do not consider will be too many.\n\nWainscoting in Hospital wing.\n\nThe plaster in the hospital wing around the bottom of the walls is getting badly broken and cracked. It is thought that putting on wainscoting instead of replastering it will be more serviceable. A separate building should be built to accommodate the cattle. A lean-to will cut off ventilation if built on the existing barn. The additional cost will be small. All items asked for in this sheet have been gone into thoroughly and should be approved.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has pointed out that the lake is now so shallow that it will, in all probability freeze solid as soon as we get very cold weather.\n\nHe suggested that I write to you and request the Department to drill another deep well. As you know the Department has already spent a great deal of money in trying to obtain a better supply of water from a deep well for the school and we were not successful.\n\nI suggested to Mr. Rhodes that it might be possible to keep the school supplied for the few months of cold weather, from the lake that is close to where Flag lives. This is about a half a mile from the school but he considered this idea impracticable as they would not haul the quantity of water the school requires that distance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. G. A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. G. A. Dodds, Agent at the File Hills Agency, with reference to the water supply at the File Hills Residential School. I concur in the Agent's suggestion to Mr. Rhodes as to how their water supply can be maintained. I am strongly averse to digging any more wells. We have tried this experiment a number of times without success. Mr. Rhodes should find no difficulty in following out Mr. Dodds suggestion to use the emergent water supply he suggests, as he could draw water by utilizing threshing tanks and thereby maintain his supply. I shall be glad to have the Department's views in regard to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 306-11A of the 6th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. Agent Dodds with reference to the water supply at the File Hills Indian Residential School. It is noted that, owing to the present low level of the lake from which the school obtains water, it is liable to freeze during the cold weather, and that it will be necessary to make other arrangements to obtain the water required.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department agrees with you that the Principal should arrange to use the emergent water supply suggested by the Agent during the few months of cold weather and draw water by utilizing threshing tanks. I may say that the Department is not prepared to authorize the drilling of another well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

The supply at the present time is mostly taken from the lake, and we certainly were very much surprised to find that this lake had receded approximately ten feet, during the past year, thus leaving only about four feet of water at the deepest point. During the cold winter months this lake will now freeze to the bottom, which means the water supply will be cut off.\n\nWe then made a further investigation, and find that you have a well near the School which supplies a very limited amount of water, and could not take care of any reasonable portion of your daily supply. We therefore recommended to your Mr. Dodds, and Mr. Rhodes, that the only solution of overcoming the difficulty, would be to drill a well, and in accordance with your request, that we give special quotations on account of economic conditions, we wish to submit the following, which is very much below any other figures we have ever quoted on a guaranteed proposition.\n\nWe would be willing to drill a well at the File Hill School, using 5\" Screw and Socket Well Casing, and Drive Shoe, and would be prepared to drill this well to a depth of at least 450 feet, if necessary. We would guarantee to supply 3000 gallons of water per twenty-four hours, for the sum of Eleven hundred dollars ($1,100.00).\n\nOn account of the guaranteed price being reduced, we would ask, that in the event of us not getting water, and finding it necessary to abandon the hole, that we would be reimbursed for the amount of Two hundred and seventy-five dollars ($275.00) which would only pay a portion of our cash outlay.\nre freights on the outfit, cartage on casing, driller and helper expense, etc.\n\nAs we understand the board and room could be supplied, we have not taken this into consideration in our figures.\n\nWe could arrange to ship our outfit immediately, and we should know inside of two weeks or a little better, just what could be procured in the way of a water supply for your School, and therefore await your further instructions.\n\nIf we can be of any further service to you, in connection with water supplies, at any of your institutions, or on farm lands, we hope you will feel at liberty to call upon us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcPHerson & Thom (Sales Agents)\nONTARIO WIND ENGINE & PUMP CO.\n(Western Branch) Limited.\n\nPer: \"D. C. Thom\"\nManager.\n\nDCT..M\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., November 21st, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nThe question of a water supply for the File Hills Residential School has been further investigated, and from what I can gather there is a great danger of all the lakes around File Hills freezing to the bottom this year. The lake near the school, where the water supply is obtained at the present time, will certainly freeze to the bottom. I suggested to the Department, failing the securing of a well, that the only alternative would be to haul water. The Principal of the school is very much opposed to this scheme, and I believe the Agent has come around to the feeling that it would be impracticable, especially in view of the fact that the lake from which it was proposed to haul the water will, in all likelihood, freeze to the bottom, and then there would be no other alternative but to close the school.\n\nHaving had all phases of the situation placed before me, I decided to send Mr. Thom, of McPherson and Thom, Regina, who are agents for the Ontario Wind Engine & Pump Co., also well drillers, out to the File Hills Agency to investigate matters, and was surprised to receive from him a most excellent offer. I enclose herewith a copy of Mr. Thom's letter. There is a possibility, if they go down 450 ft., of securing a good supply of water. We have, in the past, never gone down anything like this depth, and we are only called upon to pay $275.00, part of the actual expenses, if water is not obtained, and $1,100.00 if we secure a supply of water amounting to 3,000 gals. every twenty-four hours, which, of course, if obtained, will be a great thing for this school. The present water supply arrangements at this school, at the best, are very unsatisfactory, and the water is not fit for domestic consumption; the only supply for this purpose is obtained from a shallow source.\n\nDuncan C.

McPherson & Thom proceed with the work, I am pleased to inform you that we have at last struck a well which appears to be capable of providing an adequate supply of water for this institution. The company drilled 324 ft. and the water has come within 80 ft. of the top, and from reports I have received it cannot be reduced with steady pumping. However, I am not issuing a voucher until the well is further tested.\n\nIn the meantime, I wish to point out that this well is 100 ft. from the school, and it will be necessary to connect it with the system. In order to do this a trench will have to be dug, piped, and a deep well electric pump supplied. I have received figures, and the cost will be approximately $580.00.

That is an iron pole runs from the balcony which adjoins the dormitory to the verandah, down which the children slide. This is fairly efficient but there are several features that I thought it would be better to bring to your attention.\n\nThere are a number of young children in the school around seven and though they slide down the pole fairly well in practice they might let go of the pole and suffer a serious fall under excitement.\n\nThe bottom of the pole comes on the verandah. If a fire occurred in the room close to the pole it is possible that flames might come through the window and make it impossible to use the escape.\n\nThere is a trap door on the balcony covering up the hole down which the children slide. This trap door opens upwards and it is conceivable that in a panic the children might crowd on the door and make it impossible for anyone to open it. I made enquiries regarding this and found it used to open downwards but one of the staff in trying to open it fell through and was seriously injured.\n\nIn case you consider the escape in use should be changed I would recommend those spiral escapes similar to those used in the public schools in the cities. I understand they are rather expensive and I am only suggesting this in case you think a new system is necessary.\n\nThere are chemical fire extinguishers and also a water system for use in a fire at this school. The staff have been told how to operate the fire extinguishers and how to operate the water system. They however do not have any actual practice with the water system. I would recommend that the water system be actually tried out about once a month so that we could be sure everything is in working order and that the staff can do what they are supposed to do without delay. I would also like the Principal instructed to inform me when this practice is to take place so that I could be present and report on it.\n\nFile Hills School is of frame construction with a brick veneer. They have no night watchman.\nThey have a gardener at the school who can do very little at his job during the winter. I think he could do the night watchman's duties during winter and I think the school should be able to pay for a man during the summer months out of the government grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to fire protection at the File Hills Indian Residential School. The Department will supply a time clock for the night watchman. Please make a recommendation as to what type should be supplied and let me have an estimate of the cost.\n\nWith reference to fire escapes, it is possible that an additional steel stair escape is needed at the back of the building. Please discuss this with Mr. Indian Agent Dodds, and, if you agree that this will meet the needs, please inform the Department.\n\nIt has been suggested that the fire hose be tested periodically and that the staff and older pupils be given experience in this part of the protection. Please see that this is done from time to time and inform Mr. Indian Agent Dodds when the practice will be carried out so that he can be present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Rhodes, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nFile Hills Residential School,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, February 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to fire protection at the File Hills Indian Residential School. The Department considers that the present pole escapes should be supplemented by a steel stair escape at the back of the building. I am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Rhodes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, February 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 306-11A of the 3rd instant, and, in reply, I have to authorize you to connect up the domestic water system at the File Hills Indian Residential School with the new well. The cost should be kept as low as possible and the work should not be proceeded with until the frost is out of the ground, unless earlier action is really necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI shall be glad to receive a reply to my letter of the 3rd instant, in which I requested authority to purchase a deep well electric pump and proceed with certain work in connection with the well at the File Hills Residential School. I might state that the well cannot be used until the pump is installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a request to have additional outside closets built for the boys at the File Hills Residential School. It is pointed out that when the closets in existence were built, they were intended for the accommodation of 25 boys, and there are now 42 in residence. The cost is estimated at approximately $60.00.\n\nI am of the opinion that unless money is available, this matter can be deferred - we now have a good water supply at this school, and this ought to help matters out. However, I thought it well to bring the matter to your attention.\n\nIf you agree with me regarding this matter I will communicate with the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 306-11A of the 26th ultimo, relative to the request for the building of additional outside closets for the boys at the File Hills Indian Residential School.

Ont.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ult having reference to the Fire protection facilities at this School.\n\nRegarding the Time clock; I regret I cannot give you much information about this, I did however pay a visit to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School at Lebret who have a time clock which would be suitable for our needs, they were not able to give me any idea of the cost of same but this could be obtained from the firm handling them, the name of the clock is the \"NANZ IMPERIAL WATCHMANS TIME DETECTOR\" sold by Munderloh & Co., Ltd., 943 Victoria Square, Montreal, Que, the number of stations required for a time clock at this School will be 15.\n\nWith reference to additional Fire escapes, I have discussed this with Mr Dodds and we are of the opinion that Stair escapes are too dangerous for Children, as well as being unsuitable for Indian Schools, providing as they do easy access for unlawful entry, the safer method would be to install spiral chutes of the same type as those used in Public Schools in the Cities, these are safe and at the same time can be secured against anyone desiring to enter the building through them for unlawful purposes, while in case of Fire the doors are very easily opened from the inside.\n\nThe Fire hoses were tested yesterday in the presence of Mr Dodds and were found to be operating satisfactorily. I would point out to the Department that constant use of the Fire hoses will shorten their life considerably, necessitating replacement at more frequent intervals.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nBalcarres, Sask.,\nMarch 5, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your 111-1-5, dated the 22nd ultimo, I beg to advise that I visited File Hills School on the 29th February as Mr. Rhodes had informed they were going to have a fire drill and practice with the fire fighting system.\n\nThe children were marched upstairs to the dormitory and three and a half minutes after the alarm was sounded the school had been emptied.\n\nThey then had a practice with the water system and every hose was tried out and found to be in working order. I noticed however that the water when it first came out of the hose was very much discoloured due no doubt to the corrosion of the pipes. This cleaned out immediately and then the water came in a clear strong stream. I think it wise to have these practices regularly so that everyone will be thoroughly conversant with their duties in case of an actual fire.\n\nWith regard to your suggestion that a steel stair escapes should be erected at the back. This would give an additional avenue of escape in case of fire and I think myself that it would be as well if one were provided. Mr. Rhodes however is not in favour of it as he is of the opinion that the pupils would use it for getting away from the dormitory and other undesirable purposes, at night. This is true but the same objection can be advanced with regard to any fire escape.\n\nTo prevent the improper use of the fire escapes by the pupils is a problem which confronts every school principal but I do not think it is a good way to solve this by limiting the means of escape or blocking the fire escapes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 2, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st instant, relative to the supplying of a time clock for the use of the night watchman at the File Hills Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that an order is today being placed with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co.

The price charged for supplying the clock from your nearest branch to the School should not exceed approximately this amount, and they should forward their account, in triplicate, together with a receipt covering the cost of shipping charges, to Mr. Rhodes, who is being informed of the order placed with you.

I am requesting this information as the Salary and Board of this man will have to be provided from School funds and if he is employed on a yearly basis it will be quite a strain on the finances especially since the 10% reduction in maintenance grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, informing the Department that the watchman's clock for use at the File Hills Indian Residential School has arrived, and that as soon as the account covering the cost has been received you will certify and forward same to the Department for payment.\n\nRegarding the services of a night watchman for this School, I have to say that the Department desires that a watchman be on duty each night during the entire year. The Department will allow a grant at the rate of $30 per month towards payment of his services; the school authorities to provide the balance of salary from per capita allowances or other receipts. You should arrange to pay the salary of the watchman each month, obtaining a receipt, in duplicate, covering the amount of the Department's grant, viz., $30. You should then prepare a voucher in your own favour for the Department's share of salary at the end of each quarter, certify same, attach receipts covering the payments made by you, and forward to the Department, when a cheque to reimburse you will be sent.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give the Department full particulars regarding the name, qualifications, etc., of the man engaged to perform the night watchman's duties at this School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Our funds this year are extremely limited, and it is necessary to curtail all expenses for repairs, alterations, etc., to the lowest possible point. If the school can perform the labour, please state the material required and the approximate cost of same. When we have this information, further consideration will be given as to whether funds to rebuild the roof can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

He was further advised that the Department would allow a grant at the rate of $30 per month towards payment of the watchman's services.\n\nMr. Rhodes now advises that he has had a night watchman since the first of June and payment is being made for the four months' period to the end of September.\n\nAt the end of each quarter, you should forward a voucher for the amount due for this service. It should be made out in a similar manner to the one enclosed. It is understood, of course, that you will satisfy yourself that the watchman is regularly employed at the school and is performing his duties satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Graham, then Indian Commissioner, in August 1931, Mr Graham communicated with the Department regarding this matter and suggested that we could manage with the present toilets, this we have done to the present time but we have now come to the point when something must be done to bring our outside toilet facilities up to date, we now have 85 pupils on the register or a 30% increase over the pupilage in 1923, I would suggest that buildings be erected of the moveable box or Pail type, a rough estimate of the cost of these would be about $175.00 for material and labour.\n\nWith reference to the Barn;\u2014 We have accommodation in the Cow barn for 16 Head of cattle, this number was sufficient to supply the requirements for 65 pupils, since the increase in pupilage however we find that more milk is required hence a larger herd must be maintained, we now have 32 head including Cows and calves and to accommodate this number we have utilized every inch of space in both the Cow barn and the Horse stable even to the harness rooms and feed stalls and then the cattle were considerably overcrowded, I feel that if the Department could provide us with an addition to the barn we could house the herd in the Winter very comfortably and get better results from them.\n\nI realise that funds are very scarce but I would greatly appreciate any consideration given to these suggestions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 3, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department received a communication from the Principal of the Pile Hills Indian Residential School, regarding the condition of the outside toilets which he states, are in a dilapidated condition and very difficult to keep sanitary. They are of the pit type and have been moved so many times that the ground has become polluted. He recommends that new toilets be erected, of the moveable box or pail type, and gives a rough estimate of the cost, including material and labour, at approximately $175. The Principal has also requested that an addition be made to the barn, to provide accommodation for the number of cows on hand.\n\nFor your information, I may say that there is an item of $1,000 provided in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year for this school. From this amount, the sum of $100 is being authorized for the purpose of buying the material required for a new roof for the root-house. If new toilets are erected, at a cost of $175, it would leave only the sum of $725 for other repairs and improvements. I would request that you inform the Department definitely concerning the new toilets, giving particulars as to size and type, the materials required and the approximate cost of any labour other than that which can be performed by the staff of the school. You should also give detailed information with reference to the addition to the barn, stating dimensions, cost of materials and any labour necessary. It is doubtful if there will be sufficient funds to carry out this work. It may be that the Principal has other more pressing requirements than the addition to the barn. Please discuss the matter with him and report regarding any requirements, giving full particulars as to materials, labour, and the cost involved.\n\nThe Department will authorize Mr. Inspector Hurison to incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $100 in the purchase of materials for the new roof on the root-house. It is understood that any labour will be performed by the staff of the school, without expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nGeo. A.

The present winter has been an unusually severe one, with the result that the frost penetrated the temporary roof and destroyed a quantity of their roots and vegetables. It has been necessary to put a stove in the root house and keep a fire on to save the vegetables left. The cost of the materials for a new roof was estimated at $98.19. It is hoped the Department will see their way clear to appropriate the necessary funds to purchase this material so that it can be hauled out in readiness to commence work shortly after the spring opens up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I enclose herewith Encumbrance Certificate, authorizing the expenditure in the purchase of materials, which must not exceed the sum of $100. It is to be understood that the labour will be carried out by the school authorities, without expense to the Department.\n\nEither you or the local agent should arrange for the purchase of the materials required, from firms on the list to receive consideration. Itemized accounts, in triplicate, should be obtained, covering the cost. These should be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment. It should be stated on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R.

I have gone into this matter with the principal of the school, as directed.\n\nHe requires a lean-to addition made to the barn for the purpose of housing his cattle for which he has not sufficient room. The building would be 45 feet long, 18 feet wide, 9 feet high at the low end and 12 feet high on the side nearest the barn. It would contain 6 double stalls, or enough room for 12 animals. It would be double boarded, the first being of shiplap and the other of siding. The floor would be of concrete. It is estimated that the bill of material enclosed herewith would be sufficient to do the job.\n\nHe also required two outside toilets, one for the boys and one for the girls. He proposes to build a toilet with accommodation for six people in each and with movable boxes. It is estimated the bill of material enclosed herewith will be sufficient for one toilet.\n\nMr. Rhodes has also asked for sufficient wire and posts to fence around the playground and school. The wire and post would cost $28.00 and the labour would be provided by the school.\n\nThe material for the root house is being purchased at a cost of $100.00\n\nThe main halls both on the first floor and basement need kalsomining. The labour and material for this would cost $35.00\n\nThey will require new batteries for their electric light plant which will cost $200.00.\n\nI would therefore request incumbrance requisitions for the following:\n\nAddition to barn at File Hills Residential School. Material and labour $310.00\nOutside toilets 2, labour and material $140.00\nPosts and pipe fencing for playground $28.00\nKalsomining basement hall, main hall and dining room. Material and labour $35.00\nNew batteries for lighting plant $200.00\n\nIt is understood that incumbrance requisition for new root house for the school has already been sent to Mr. W. Hurison.\n\nI would ask you to return the bills of material for the addition to the barn and the toilets after you have examined them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJune 12, 1933.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Bushard,\n\nIt is proposed to proceed with some repairs to the buildings at the Pine Hills Indian Residential School. They consist in an addition to the barn and two outside toilets, at a cost of approximately $650.00. New batteries are also required for the lighting plant.\n\nWill you kindly give me the name of one or two competent carpenters who may be employed for the addition to the barn and the toilets, and also the name of a firm from whom the storage batteries required may be purchased.\n\nThe nearest town to the School is Balcarres, where the Indian Agent resides.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBalcarres, Sask.,\nJune 7, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I please be supplied with a flag for the use of this Agency and also one for the use of File Hills Residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: J.

He wants $100.00 for building the addition to the barn and $50.00 for building the toilets. This is considerably more than I estimated it would cost, consequently I have not sufficient money allowed in Encumbrance Requisition 635 to purchase the necessary material and pay for the labour.\n\nI can get the labour done by Mr. F. Mann of Balcarres, for $75.00 and this would enable me to get the buildings completed below the amount authorized in E.R. 635. Mr. Mann is highly recommended by Mr. H.E.

In consequence the water backed up from the tank into the furnace. The Agent tried to get the material for a new coil in Balscarres, but was not successful. As the repairs were urgent, the Principal drove to Regina for them. It was Saturday afternoon and the wholesale warehouses were closed and it was necessary for Mr. Rhodes to have the coil made up by Messrs. Potts and Miller.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that the Poultry House at the File Hills Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire on the morning of the 4th, instant.\n\nThe cause of the fire was seemingly from an overheated stove pipe or a spark from the stove, as the building was being used for a breeding pen and the use of a stove was necessary to prevent the eggs chilling.\n\nI beg to recommend the replacement of this building, size 16' x 32' x 8', the cost of material and labour I estimate at $300.00, as a new building could be erected on the old foundation.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, reporting the destruction, by fire, of the poultry house at the File Hills Indian Residential School. The Department would like to be informed if there was any carelessness in the operation of the stove. It is thought that, if it had been properly attended to, there would not have been any danger of the pipe becoming over-heated or a spark escaping from the stove.\n\nRegarding your recommendation that the building be replaced, at a cost of $300 for material and labour, I have to say that the Department has no funds available to rebuild the poultry house. There is an item in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year for miscellaneous repairs, etc., to the amount of $300. If the Principal believes that the rebuilding of the poultry house is more urgent than the minor repairs, painting, etc., the Department might favourably consider utilizing the money towards the erection of a poultry house. After consulting the Principal, you might advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. A. Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, March 19, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nSince June, 1932, the Department has been allowing $30.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nAs our appropriation for this purpose is limited and as we have recently received requests for allowances towards night watchmen's salaries at several other Indian residential schools that had not previously received same, it has been found necessary to place all residential schools on the same basis and only allow a grant towards the night watchman's salary for a period not exceeding seven months. Consequently, the allowance for the services of the night watchman at the File Hills Indian Residential School will be discontinued from April 30th, 1935.\n\nPayment of this allowance will be resumed from October 1st, 1935, and will be continued until April 30th, 1936, a period of seven months, during which time the amount of $40.00 will be allowed. If the Principal so desires, you may forward a voucher at the end of each month for the period during which the allowance is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. A. Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nFile Hills Agency\nBalcarres\nSask.\nMarch 27th. 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter No. 111-1-5 of the 15th instant, regarding the rebuilding of the poultry house at the File Hills I.R. School.\n\nI beg to say that I have taken this matter up with Mr. Rhodes, the Principal, and I quote part of his reply to me as follows:\n\n\"In this connection I would draw your attention to the Estimates for 1935, in which appears an item for Painting the outbuildings amounting to $400.00. I would suggest that part of this sum be used to rebuild the Poultry House and the remainder used to paint the Outbuildings as far as possible, my reason for this suggestion is that the Main building is looking very shabby indeed and is not a very good advertisement either for the Department, the Agency or the School, the main building has not been painted since 1929, 6 years ago, and I would stress the need for this work to be done this year without fail, the outbuildings with one or two exceptions could go for another year, the balance of $100.00 or any amount left over after the Poultry house has been erected could be used to paint the buildings requiring it the most.\"\n\nThere is no question about the buildings requiring painting and the need for a Poultry House for this School, and I would recommend the Department to reconsider this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 761-11 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the poultry house at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Rhodes refers in his letter to you to an amount of $400 for painting at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nHowever, I would refer you to official letter of March 15th, in which you were informed that the sum of $300 is provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for miscellaneous repairs, etc., at the File Hills Residential School. The Department is prepared to authorize the use of this money in the erection of a poultry house. Please let me know whether or not the school staff will be able to handle any of the labour. If not, you should state the approximate amount that will be required for labour and also the approximate amount that will be required for materials, detailing the quantity of lumber, nails, etc., that will be needed.\n\nConsideration to repainting the buildings will have to remain in abeyance until later in the year, when it will be possible to decide if funds for the purpose can be spared. You might communicate with the Department about the painting at the end of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. A.

R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nGeo. A. Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, April 17, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nAs you may be aware, the poultry house at the Pile Hills Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire on the 4th ultimo. Mr. Agent Dodds and the Principal of the School estimate that the cost of rebuilding will be, approximately, $300.00 - material, $225.00 and labour, $75.00.\n\nAs this expenditure was entirely unforeseen, no provision was made in our Estimates for the current fiscal year. There is, however, an item provided for miscellaneous repairs, etc., to the amount of $300.00, and the Principal was asked to state whether he considered the rebuilding of the poultry house more urgent than the carrying out of minor repairs, painting, etc. He wishes the poultry house rebuilt, and I would request that you take this matter up with Mr. Agent Dodds. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials, from firms on the approved list and also for the labour required.\n\nThe Department is informing Mr. Agent Dodds that this matter has been placed in your hands, and you will therefore be good enough, in conjunction with Mr. Dodds, to make all necessary arrangements for the purchase of the materials and for the labour in the erection of the new poultry house.\n\nThe entire cost of the poultry house should not exceed the amount mentioned above, viz.: $300.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

No doubt, Mr. Hurisen will consult you in connection with this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. A.

Rhodes, Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School, and have received reply from Mr. Rhodes in which he quotes:\n\n\"In this connection I would advise that it is considered that the services of a night watchman are very necessary the year round, but our finances will not permit of his salary being paid in full from School funds, as you are probably aware we are operating on the lowest per-capita grant paid to any Residential School in the Dominion, further, the reductions which came into force in 1932 and 1933 reduced our earnings by about $2000.00 per annum, also at the present time the cost of Food, Clothing etc., has greatly increased the costs two years ago, this increase has to be met from School funds, therefore taking into account the low per-capita grant, the reductions in grant earnings and increased costs of operation I cannot see how we are financially able to take care of the full salary of the night watchman for the period March 1st to September 30th.\n\nIn view of the foregoing it will be necessary to dispense with the services of the night watchman as at April 30th and re-appoint another watchman to commence duties October 1st, I will be glad if you will take this matter up further with the Department and ascertain if they approve of this decision\".\n\nI beg to say this school building is purely frame and I consider a night watchman should be employed the year round for there are a number of lives which cannot be endangered.\n\nTrusting to hear further from you on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 36-11 of the 18th instant, with further reference to the night watchman at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 19th ultimo, it has been found that the Department can only allow a grant towards the salary of night watchmen at Indian residential schools for a seven months' period. Our funds will not permit any exception being made in the case of the File Hills School.\n\nIf proper care is exercised, it is considered that the danger from fire during the summer months is very small.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nGeo. A. Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nFile Hills Agency\nBalcarres\nSask.\nApril 10th. 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter No. 111-1-5 of the 5th instant, regarding the poultry house of the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to advise that I have talked this matter over with Mr. F. Rhodes, the school Principal, who informs me that the school cannot supply any labour as the staff is being reduced. Mr. Rhodes also stated $225.00 is the approximate figure for all the materials and $75.00 an approximate figure for the labour.\n\nI will bring up the matter of repainting the buildings in June as requested.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

The plant is too small to supply the energy required at this school and it will only be a question of a short time until it should be replaced.\n\nI have been informed that the lighting plant which was operated at the MacKay Indian Residential School at the Pas is in good condition. If it is not intended to replace that school, I would recommend that the plant in question be transferred to the File Hills School. The plant at present in use at the File Hills School might be utilized for lighting purposes at one of our Indian Agencies. There is still some service left in the plant, but it is not in condition to carry the heavy load required at the Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 17, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a request that the electric light plant which was operated at the MacKay Indian Residential School be transferred for use at the File Hills Indian Residential School, Balcarres, Sask.\n\nIn July, 1933, Mr. Inspector Hamilton was requested to arrange with you for the packing of the batteries, switch board and small gasoline engine used in operating the plant and to ship same to the Guy Indian Residential School. We are, therefore, not aware what part, if any, of the electric light plant is on hand at The Pas. I would request that you inform the Department, as soon as possible, if any part of this electric light plant is stored at The Pas and its present condition. Would you consider that the equipment on hand would be serviceable for use at the school mentioned above? Any information you can give regarding this equipment will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, December 17, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 306-11A of the 10th instant, regarding the condition of the electric lighting plant at the File Hills Residential School and suggesting that the lighting plant which was operated at the Mackay Indian Residential School, The Pas, be forwarded for use at the File Hills School.\n\nIn this connection I would say that the batteries, switch board and small engine, which operated the plant at the Mackay School, were sent to the Guy Indian Residential School in the summer of 1933. The Department is not aware of what further part of the electric light equipment used at the Mackay Residential School remains on hand at The Pas. However, we are writing Mr. Agent Levell and requesting him to state what part of the plant is on hand and its present condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 28, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your 306-11A, of the 10th instant, regarding the condition of the electric lighting plant at the File Hills Indian Residential School, and suggesting that the plant which was operated at the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, be forwarded for use at the File Hills School, I have to say that Mr. Agent Lovell, The Pas, states the only part of the electric light plant of the MacKay School on hand is a generator. It is considered, however, that it would not be of any use at the File Hills School, as it is a 125 volt generator, while the plant at the File Hills School is 32 volts. The Department is therefore taking no action to have this generator shipped to the File Hills School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. E. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

Ltd., Balcarres Sask.\n\nfor Supplies to repair steps of File Hills Indian Resid. School which were in a dangerous state.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated Blanket.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to attach herewith our Vouchers #24 and 25 for Security Lumber Co. $18.45 and to the File Hills Indian Residential School for $15.90 respectively.\n\nBag to say this expenditure was incurred in repairs to the front steps of the File Hills Indian Resid. School. It was found that the posts supporting the baluster had rotted and broken off. This made the baluster very loose, and I considered these repairs should be done right away as there was a great possibility of some of the pupils being injured should the baluster have broken down altogether.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to advise the Department that I visited the File Hills Residential School on the 13th instant and made an examination of the buildings. The school building has not been repainted for a number of years and is very badly in need of repainting. If it is left much longer the building will deteriorate.\n\nI found the balconies in urgent need of repairs. I do not consider them in their present condition safe, as dry rot has set in along the sills. I asked Mr. Rhodes to get a carpenter to examine the balconies and prepare an estimate of the cost. I am today in receipt of this estimate which is as follows;\u2014 lumber and material $69.35, labour and hardware $65.00, 75 yards of 12 oz. canvas duck $27.00, making a total of $161.35.\n\nI may inform you that these balconies are used as sleeping balconies and the outer walls, in addition to screen net, are enclosed with canvas. This gives a free circulation of air. The canvas is badly torn and should be renewed. I would recommend that, if possible, this expenditure be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbe carried out. Could not you or the local Agent arrange for the purchase of the paint and other materials, from firms on the approved list, and have any work, over and above what can be performed by the staff of the school, carried out by day labour? If so, would it be necessary to engage the services of a competent foreman-painter and, also, could any Indian labour be employed?\n\nRegarding the set of 32-volt batteries, I would request that you will state if these are urgently required. If so, full particulars should be given as to the size and type of batteries at present in use, in order that similar equipment can be supplied.\n\nWith reference to the mattresses, please state the dimensions - length and width - of the beds and the number of each size.\n\nThe Department will approve of the repairs as mentioned in your letter being carried out to the balconies. The Agent or yourself should arrange for the purchase of the lumber, hardware and canvas duck material, from firms on the approved list, and you may engage the services of a carpenter to carry out the work. It is noted that the cost of the repairs to the balconies will not exceed, approximately, the sum of $162. This amount should be taken out of the sum provided for general repairs to buildings. Itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the cost of the materials and labour. Regarding the labour, the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated on the accounts.\n\nWhen the Department has full particulars, as requested, regarding the work mentioned above, you, or if you so request, the local Indian Agent will be advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 306-11A of the 28th ultimo, relative to the painting required to the exterior of the buildings and repairs to the balconies at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that the following amounts have been provided in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year, for painting, repairs and equipment at this school - these being amounts included in Mr. Agent Dodds' estimates, submitted through your office last fall:\n\n1. Painting outside of main building - window frames - sash - doors - roof - verandah, etc. $400.\n2. Painting outside buildings - classroom - barn - warehouse - ice house - granaries - implement shed - garage, etc. 500.\n3. Painting exterior of principal's residence 100.\n4. General repairs to buildings, including repairs to verandah and balconies of main building 200.\n5. 1 set 32 volt batteries for light plant 250.\n6. 50 mattresses for pupils' beds 250.\n\nRegarding the painting, I would request that you take up this matter with the local Agent and the Principal and inform the Department how you would advise this work be carried out.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nREGINA, Sask.\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 111-1-5, dated the last instant, advising me regarding the amounts provided in the Appropriation for the current fiscal year for painting, repairs, and equipment at the File Hills Residential School. I beg to advise you that immediately upon receipt of your letter I got in touch with Mr. Dodds, the Indian Agent, and the Principal of the school and later on we had a conference together regarding the work.\n\n1. Regarding the painting of the main and outside buildings we are of the opinion that it would be advisable to employ a competent house-painter and have the work done by day labour. We can employ some Indian labour, particularly on the outbuildings and I would be glad if the Department could authorize me at once to proceed with the work along these lines. I may advise you that I received information that the price of paint was going to advance after the 1st of July, so I took it upon myself to obtain competitive prices from firms on the approved list hereunder and purchased the paint and had it forwarded on to the school. I trust this will meet with your approval. I obtained a very reasonable price on the paint.\n\n2. With reference to the repairs to the verandah and balconies of the main building, I may say that this work is being proceeded with. We have engaged the services of a local carpenter, Mr. Haste who has done most of our carpentry work at the File Hills Agency for some years now. He is a very reliable man and we may find it advisable to engage him to supervise the general repair work at the school, including the painting.\n\n3. With reference to the 32 volt batteries for the lighting plant, I may advise you that the plant in use now is a Delco Ironclad 160 Ampere hour battery. This battery is sulphating badly. There is no immediate hurry for replacing this battery until about the 1st of November when the load will increase to practically the maximum capacity of the battery. It would not be safe to depend on this battery after that time. During the winter months they have from 65 to 70 ampere hour loads and as the capacity of this battery is only 72 amperes, you will readily understand that the battery would require to be in good shape in order to stand up and the present battery could not be relied upon.\n\n4. With reference to the fifty mattresses for the pupils' beds for which the sum of $250.00 is allowed, I may advise you\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthat the size of the mattresses required is 3 ft. x 6 ft.\n\nMr. Rhodes asks for a standard layer felt mattress with heavy brown duck covering. I have obtained quotations from the Parkhill Bedding Company and Simmons Limited, both of whom are on the approved list here. The Parkhill Bedding quote $5.75 F.O.B. Balcarres and Simmons Limited quote $4.92 each, plus the Sales Tax, which would amount to 38\u00a2, bringing the cost to $5.31 each. If the Department do not have to pay the Sales Tax their price would come within the appropriation, otherwise it will be exceeded by $16.80. I would recommend that the Simmons mattress be purchased.\n\nI would be glad to receive authority to proceed with the work at File Hills as above outlined. It is important that the work should be proceeded with with the least possible delay, as it is desirable that it should be done while the children are absent on their vacation during the month of July.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, July 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 306-11A of the 30th ultimo, regarding the painting, repairs and equipment for which funds are available at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the painting of the main and outside buildings, I have to say that, when we are advised of the name of the foreman-painter to be employed on this work, you will be informed. It is noted that some Indian labour can be utilized and that you obtained competitive prices and have purchased the paint and had it forwarded to the school.\n\nIt is noted that the repairs to the verandah and balconies of the main building are being proceeded with, the services of a local carpenter being engaged.\n\nWith reference to the 50 mattresses for the pupils, I have to say that it will be satisfactory for you to place the order with Simmons Limited, who quote a price of $8.31 each, including sales tax, which the Department has to pay, the same as in the case of any other purchaser of similar supplies. When the mattresses have been delivered, please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which should be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment. Accounts for labour and any materials for repair to the verandah and balconies are also to be forwarded, in triplicate, properly certified. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid and also the names of the persons employed should be definitely stated.\n\nRegarding the supplying of new batteries, it is noted there is no immediate hurry for replacing the batteries until about the first of November. You should instruct the local Indian Agent to forward a request for these batteries when considered timely. Full particulars should be given regarding type, etc., of the batteries required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise you that the Delco lighting plant at the File Hills Indian Residential School is out of commission.\n\nWhen the plant was taken down and examined, it was found that a bolt holding the connecting rod cap had broken thus permitting the connecting rod to lash about freely in the cylinder and the crankcase.\n\nThe crankcase, cylinder, connecting rod, piston with piston pin and rings and crankshaft were found to be damaged and will require replacing. Regina is the nearest place to have this work carried out.\n\nThese repairs and replacements will cost approximately $250.00.\n\nThe school meanwhile are running on an auxiliary lighting system but this plant is not adequate to take care of their requirements.\n\nShould this meet with your approval, I should appreciate your wiring me so that this plant can be put into working operation again with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Owing to the damage enumerated by you, it is thought there might not have been proper supervision.\n\nIt is noted the cost of the repairs and replacements will be approximately $250. As our funds are so limited, it is difficult to provide for these unforeseen expenditures. When the repairs have been completed, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. Full particulars should be given on the account, regarding the time employed and the rate paid for the labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. A.

A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nFederal Building,\nRegina, Sask.\nFile Hills Agency,\nBalcarres, Sask\nOctober 7th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe piping water from school to barn\nFile Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter 306-11 A.U.\nof the 30th ultimo, with regard to the above.\n\nDec to state I have also received a letter from the\nPrincipal, Mr. F. Rhodes, referring to the above.\n\nMr. Rhodes' letter states that the distance from the\nschool to the barn is 280 feet, that a trench would have to be\ndug 2 ft. wide and 8 ft. deep, that 1\" piping would cost $55.14\nF.O.B Regina, and he estimated the labour at $70.00 to $75.00.\n\nIn the past the school have winter watered their\nstock from a slough in front of the school, but this is now\nabsolutely dry, as is other sloughs in the near vicinity. Mr.\nRhodes is quite certain that their deep well would give them\na sufficient supply of water if it were piped to the barn,\nand they have the machinery to take care of this. Other than\nthis they would have to fill their water tank at the school\nhaul it to the barn, with the danger that it might freeze\nand ruin the tank.\n\nThe Department have authorized me to purchase 200\nsacks of flour, 70 of this is for the warehouse ration use,\nand 25 is for our winter firewood purchase, leaving 105 sacks\nfor relief. It was my idea that if relief in flour was issued\nto have the Indians bring wood, which later could be sold and\na refund make to the Department.\n\nI do not think the 280' trench can be dug for $75.00\nmy Estimate would be nearer $140.00, however possibly we could\nput a value of $3.50 on the flour and pay the Indians at a\nrate of $1.75 a day for digging, which would mean two days work\nper Indian for one sack of flour. If this work were started\non this scheme, as some of the Indians would come from quite a\ndistance, we would pretty nearly have to give them something\nfor a noon-day meal, possibly some bacon and tea and I am doubt-\nful if we have enough in our warehouse for this.\n\nSee Page 2\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to submit attached letter from Mr. Dodds, Agent File Hills.\n\nIn explanation I might say that Mr. Rhodes discussed this matter with me some time ago and I wrote Mr. Dodds for a report suggesting that if relief had to be given it might be undertaken as a relief measure.\n\nI have circulated all our agents asking that they require all able bodied Indians to whom rations or clothing are issued to require that they either supply wood or do other work, which would be of value to the Department in return, as I am convinced we must impress upon them that they must work for what they receive.\n\nThis work would cost $55.14 and freight for piping and Mr. Rhodes estimates $75 for digging trench. The digging could be taken care of by flour and clothing.\n\nIf the funds are available I would suggest the piping and $75 for trench be authorized with the understanding that if it cost more Mr. Rhodes would finance it, also any meals required for the Indians.\n\nIn considering this the question of what effect this additional drain will have upon the present well must be considered. There is sufficient water for both purposes at present and no doubt should they have to haul the water they will get it from the well. Should the well not furnish enough they will look for another source for the stock. Would they do this should the connections be made or would they demand that the Department go to the expense of deepening the present well or boring a new one in order that the supply would be sufficient without hauling it, I am afraid of this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources.\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit attached letter from Mr. Dodds, Agent File Hills.\n\nIn explanation I might say that Mr. Rhodes discussed this matter with me some time ago and I wrote Mr. Dodds for a report suggesting that if relief had to be given it might be undertaken as a relief measure.\n\nI have circulated all our agents asking that they require all able bodied Indians to whom rations or clothing are issued to require that they either supply wood or do other work, which would be of value to the Department in return, as I am convinced we must impress upon them that they must work for what they receive.\n\nThis work would cost $55.14 and freight for piping and Mr. Rhodes estimates $75 for digging trench. The digging could be taken care of by flour and clothing.\n\nIf the funds are available I would suggest the piping and $75 for trench be authorized with the understanding that if it cost more Mr. Rhodes would finance it, also any meals required for the Indians.\n\nIn considering this the question of what effect this additional drain will have upon the present well must be considered. There is sufficient water for both purposes at present and no doubt should they have to haul the water they will get it from the well. Should the well not furnish enough they will look for another source for the stock. Would they do this should the connections be made or would they demand that the Department go to the expense of deepening the present well or boring a new one in order that the supply would be sufficient without hauling it, I am afraid of this.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources.\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 12, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant addressed to Inspector Robertson with reference to piping water from the Pile Hills Residential School to the barn conducted in connection with that institution.\n\nIt is noted that it is your intention to have the work done by Indians in return for relief.\n\nThis Department is prepared to pay an amount not exceeding $55.00 for the piping and $75.00 for the labour. Any expenditure over and above these amounts will have to be paid by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG.A.

Mr. Rhodes is very anxious to find out what was allowed in the Estimates for the File Hills School this coming season. He is anxious to lay out his work.\n\nCould I be given this information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

(RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-5, part 5)\nOttawa, March 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, provision was made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 for an amount of $300.00 to replace the batteries at the File Hills School and also an amount of $500.00 for painting and repairs. This makes a total of $800.00 for new equipment, repairs and improvements at the File Hills School. It is not necessary to expend the money in the exact manner in which it was mentioned in the estimates.\n\nPlease let me know for what purposes the Principal considers the amount available should be expended, and if requesting any material or equipment full particulars should be supplied in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have discussed the matter of manual and vocational training with Mr. Dodds, Agent, File Hills, and Mr. Rhodes, Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nAfter discussing the matter, they advise that they would require, for the purpose of carrying on this work, a building 18 x 32, 12 ft. wall, with cement foundation and floor, and they estimate that it would cost about $50.00 for lumber, hardware, painting and labour, to erect the building. The building would be divided into two shops, one for carpentry, the other for implement repairs and paint shop, with a loft above for storage of working and finished materials. Some plain ordinary tools would be required, such as what the Indian would use on the Reserve\u2014hammers, rules, pliers, screwdrivers, etc., and while the school have about two complete sets of such tools on hand, Mr. Rhodes stated about another two sets would be required, costing around $50.00 for the two sets.\n\nTheir idea would be to train the boys in carpentry, painting, implement repairs, gas engines, electrical engineering, and animal husbandry. No extra staff would be required.\n\nMr. Dodds goes on to say that he presumes, if this work was started, the Department would supply a certain amount of working material which would be required, such as lumber, paint, paint brushes, hardware, etc., and that once the work was in actual operation, material could mostly be supplied from the sale of the completed work, consisting of tables, benches, stools, chairs, cupboards, etc., which could easily be sold on the Reserve at cost or a little above it.\n\nSubmitted for your consideration.\n\nThos.

You may authorize the Indian Agent to purchase the following material locally at an estimated cost not exceeding $20.00:\n\n- 10 Sks. cement\n- 3 Pcs. 1 x 12 x 16\n- 2 \" 2 x 12 x 12\n\nThe total estimated cost of the labour is shown on the requisition to be $215.00. Please let me know if it is your intention to employ Indians to do this work or will white labour be required? In that event you should let me know the tradesmen that will be necessary and if you have any person in mind for the work you should let me know their name and address. As soon as this information is received the matter will have our immediate consideration and you will then be advised regarding who is to be employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos.

Mr. Dodds has discussed this matter with Mr. Rhodes, the Principal, who states that he wants the repairing and painting work done this year; but he states that if an additional $400.00 can be allowed, he would agree to have all the repairs and painting done and a vocational training building erected and operated for the next year at no further cost to the Department.\n\nIf funds can be made available, I would strongly recommend that this be granted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMc\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in connection with the erection of a vocational training building at the File Hills Indian residential school.\n\nThe cost of the material and labour to do the work recommended in your letter of March 31 amounts to $494.50. Only $500.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at this school and this amount is practically exhausted. In addition, of course, we are purchasing the batteries at an approximate cost of $300.00.\n\nHowever, in view of your recommendation it has been decided to take $400.00 from a small unallotted item in our appropriation. It should be distinctly understood, however, that no further amount can be allowed for repairs, improvements or purchase of new equipment at the File Hills residential school during the current fiscal year.\n\nPlease let me have detailed information regarding the manner in which the $400.00 is to be expended. If any material is required the necessary information should be supplied in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos.

Lane of Abernethy and Mr. R. Hastie of Balcarres, as men capable of undertaking the repairs at the above noted school.\n\nMay I refer to our letter to you, dated May 4, 1939, which read in part as follows:\n\n\"It is noted that the school management is prepared to pay the cost of all labour. Under these circumstances it will not be necessary for this Branch to take any further action regarding the labour\".\n\nIf the costs are borne by the school management, the Principal is authorized to employ the men whose names have been submitted or any other men who may be capable of undertaking the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's memorandum of the 26th instant, File III-1-5, in connection with Purchase Order #14195 calling for one set of 18 cells, 13 plate, 32 volt Globelite batteries for the File Hills Residential School, Balcarres, Sask., I may say that in accordance with Departmental policy, electrical firms on the approved list were given an opportunity of quoting on Ironclad and other standard types of batteries, and the order was placed with the lowest tenderer.\n\nI might add that your requisition did not indicate the capacity of the battery in ampere hours, or the number of plates. The battery ordered has a rating of 168 A.H. intermittent. If this is not sufficient, I would be pleased to have Dr. Robertson's definite advice as to the A.H. Rating and number of plates in the battery required. Otherwise, since a seven year guarantee is furnished with the Globelite battery ordered, I would suggest that there is nothing to be lost by accepting this battery and giving it a fair trial.\n\nW.M. Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1939.\n\nRe: Batteries for File Hills Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of May 16 relating to the above-noted subject.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a memorandum received by this Branch from the Purchasing Agent. The subject matter of this memorandum, you will note, is self-explanatory. In view of the guarantee to which the Purchasing Agent refers it might be well for the school to accept the batteries and give them a fair trial.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your #114-1-5 of June 5th, Repairs and Alterations, File Hills Residential School.\n\nThere is apparently a misunderstanding with regard to the payment of the labour.\n\nIn your letter #114-1-5 of April 19th, you advised that there was only $500.00 provided for repairs and improvements at this school, but that in view of my recommendations, it had been decided to take $400.00 from a small unallotted item for the building of the vocational training building, making a total of $900.00.\n\nOur understanding of this was that the Department would pay the cost of the material and labour for the repairs and re-decorating of the school to an amount not in excess of $500.00, and that an additional amount of $400.00 would be granted for the construction of the vocational building, the school to pay all other costs and labour necessary for the erection of that building.\n\nUnder my #306-11A of April 26th I forwarded a requisition covering the material required for the erection of the vocational building, amounting to $464.50, and advised that if the Department would pay $400.00 of this bill, the school would pay the balance of $64.50, purchase the necessary hardware, and pay for the labour and operating costs until the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nIt was not my understanding, nor the understanding of the school authorities, that they would pay the labour costs of the repairs and improvements, and I am very sorry if anything in my letter gave you a different understanding.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nTR/FMc\n\nIndian Affairs.

Material has already been secured through the Purchasing Branch.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, recommends the employment of Mr. S. Lane of Abernathy for the paint work and Mr. R. Hastie of Balcarres for the cement work. I should appreciate having your approval for the employment of the above-mentioned men.\n\nActing Director.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to letter No.306-11A of the 12th instant, regarding the batteries for the lighting plant of the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nHaving talked the matter over with Mr. Rhodes, I beg to advise that the plant at this school is a Delco 5 K.W. with a 72 ampere capacity (charging rate). The maximum load on this plant in winter time is 65 ampere. From past experience a light battery only lasts one year at this school whereas the Ironclad (heavy duty) batteries last from 2 to 2\u00bd years. For the past six years Ironclad batteries have been supplied this school, and before that two sets of a lighter battery were hooked-up together but this was found too costly. The school lighting plant operates 7 to 8 hours in the winter time and 4 hours in the summer daily. In Mr. Rhodes opinion if the Globelite people were to see his plant the guarantee would be voided immediately.\n\nA 15 plate battery is required, and I enclose herewith sheet from the Globelite Batteries Limited and have marked in blue pencil the battery to give service to this school.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThomas Robertson, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nFederal Building,\nRegina,\nSask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your #111-1-5 of June 8, Batteries,\nFile Hills Indian Residential School\n\nI have taken this matter up with Mr. Dodds and Mr. Rhodes, and am attaching copy of the letter received from Mr. Dodds. You will note that it is Mr. Rhodes' opinion that if the Globelite people were to see his plant, the guarantee would be void.\n\nOn Wednesday of this week, Mr. Lazorka, of the Engineering Department, Prince Albert National Park, called at my office on his way to the Qu'Appelle Agency, having received instructions from his Department to visit that Agency and report on the electric light plant there. I took advantage of Mr. Lazorka's visit to take him to File Hills and get his advice. Mr. Lazorka is apparently of the same opinion as Mr. Rhodes\u2014that the load is too heavy for the batteries supplied, and under those conditions the seven-year guarantee would be practically valueless.\n\nMr. Dodds attached to his letter a Globelite pamphlet showing the different types of batteries. The type considered by him and Mr. Rhodes to be the most suitable for the school is marked in blue pencil. I have shown this to Mr. Lazorka and he confirms Mr. Dodds' advice.\n\nWith regard to the guarantee given by this company, I might point out that this guarantee is given with the understanding that the batteries are the proper size and capacity for the duty they are required to perform. In view of all the information I have been able to secure, I am satisfied that the batteries supplied do not meet those requirements and that the guarantee would be practically valueless. In view of this, and of the fact that we are building a workshop at this school, where additional light will be required, I would recommend that the batteries asked for, as marked on the attached pamphlet, be supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Lane of Abernethy for the paint work and Mr. R. Hastie of Balcarres for the cement work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n30th June, 1939\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nOn the 8th of June I endorsed on Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 25th May that Mr. S. Lane of Abernethy might be engaged in connection with painting required at the File Hills Agency. Apparently some painting is needed in the school and the Principal is anxious to have it put under way as quickly as possible when the holidays begin. It is possible that the Agent has already received his instructions because he has been in touch with Mr. Lane although he has not issued any instructions to him. Mr. Lane is anxious to look after all of the work at the one time.\n\nWould you kindly ask the Director of Indian Affairs to look into the matter with a view to expediting action.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor action as indicated.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCOPY OF REPORT ON DEEP WELL AT THE FILE HILLS INDIAN RESID.\nSCHOOL. BALCARRS. SASK.\n\nDepth of Well when drilled. 325 feet. 1929.\nHeight of water from base of Well. 240 feet.\nSize of Casing 5 inch.\nSize of Pump used up to Sept.1940. 2 inch Pipe with 1 - 13/16th. Cylinder, Wood rod. Length of Pump 140 feet.\n\nIn September 1940 the Pump pipe stripped at the first joint from the top permitting about 120 feet of Pipe to fall to the bottom of the well, a distance of approximately 180 feet and it is considered that the pipe falling this extreme distance has penetrated the mud and sand at the bottom of the well to a considerable distance probably splitting or buckling the pipe. I engaged the services of Mr. J. McCashin of Lipton to assist us in pulling the pipe out of the well. Mr. McCashin is an experienced well-driller, a taper tap was procured and the necessary pipe to connect with the pipe in the well. Several times they were able to get a good hold of the pipe but when pressure was applied in pulling the pipe the taper-tap would slip off. Pressure was applied by means of a clamp and two screw jacks. By this means they were enabled to exert an even pressure of considerable force, in spite of this we were forced to abandon the attempt to pull the pipe.\n\nA smaller pump of 1 inch diameter with a 1 - 13/16th. cylinder was then installed being put down to a depth of 200 feet. This was satisfactory for a short time when it was found necessary to increase the depth of the pump to 260 feet. This was necessary due to the fact that the old pump pipe had shut off part of the stream in the bottom of the well and the well would not give us sufficient quantity of water for our requirements. At this depth the well gave us just sufficient supply for the needs of the School (N.B. we have not been able to supply the stock since last Fall).\n\nOn February 27th, of this year it was noted that a high wind was prevailing and the water in the well became badly discoloured having a reddish colour. On February 28th, the amount of supply dwindled to such an extent that it was found necessary to pull the pump. On examination of the Cylinder it was found that the leathers had become badly worn. New leathers were installed and the pump replaced in the well. After operating for about 8 hours it was noted that the pump was not delivering water, and the pump was pulled again the following day when it was noted that the pipe from the cylinder for a distance of approximately 24 feet had become filled with sand. It was then decided to take off about 40 feet of pipe and re-install the pump. This was done on March 4th, to-date the pump has been operating satisfactorily, giving us a sufficient supply to take care of the requirements of the School (other than the stock tanks) however with the amount of sand which has come into the well it is not possible to state that the supply of water will be available for any indefinite period. If it were possible to remove the old pump pipe from the well and the well thoroughly cleaned out I am of the opinion that the supply would be adequate for our requirements.\nOne feature is noted, before the water became discoloured on February 27th, the water obtained from the well would be quite clear for a few hours, but would then become discoloured, having a red colour and would stain any utensil in which it was placed. Since the above date the water has been quite clear and does not discolour so readily on coming in contact with the air.\n\nI am of the opinion that a new stream or vein has broken through. This would account for the excessive quantity of sand in the bottom of the well and the resultant stoppage of the pump when it was installed on March 3rd.\n\nSigned by.....F. Rhodes.\nPrincipal.\nE. S. Jones, Esq.\nActg. Indian Agent.\nFile Hills Agency.\n\nMarch 13th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Deep well at this School.\n\nIn view of the facts contained in this report it will be necessary to attempt to remove the old Pump pipe in order to restore the well to its former efficiency. If this is found to be impossible it will be necessary to drill a new well as the well at the present time is not supplying a sufficient quantity of water to give us a reserve against emergencies.\n\nI will appreciate it therefore if you will be good enough to take this matter up with the Department with a view to obtaining special appropriations for the following, the work will have to be done during the Summer holidays, viz; July & August, as we are not in a position to hold up the pumping of water while the School is full of students.\n\n(a) A sum of $250.00 for labour and equipment to pull the old pipe and clean out the existing well.\n\n(b) A sum of $1000.00 in the event it is found necessary to drill a new well.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned by.... F. Rhodes.\nPrincipal.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nMarch 25th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that for some time the File Hills Indian Residential School, Balcarres, have been having some difficulty with the deep well from which the School obtains its water supply.\n\nI now have a report on this well, which speaks for itself, and you will note that Mr. Rhodes, the Principal, states that it will require either $250.00 to clean out the well and pull the old pipe, or if that cannot be done, $1000.00 to put down a new well. Mr. Rhodes also states in his letter that July or August would be the proper time to have this work done.\n\nI would suggest that this be handed over to the Surveys and Engineering Branch with the request that some engineer who has had experience with matters of this kind be sent over to the School, as it is going to be a difficult proposition to pull the pipe, and I am sure will require a very strong derrick and equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 1, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the well at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42 provision has been made for an amount of $450.00 for repairs and improvements at this school. You may, therefore, authorize the Principal of the File Hills School to incur an expenditure not exceeding $250.00 in cleaning out the well and pulling out the old pipe. To be successful in doing this I believe that the Principal should give consideration to placing a screen on the pipe before it is put into the well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Christiansen, General Sup't. of Indian Agencies, reporting the fire at the File Hills Indian Residential School. This fire, which was discovered at 7.45 P.M. April 8th, 1942, totally destroyed the two class rooms and contents.\n\nThe class rooms, situated 35 feet from the main building were of lumber structure, 100 feet by 28 feet, with full sized basement. One half of the basement was of cement structure, the other half stone.\n\nThis building was heated by a pipeless furnace. The chimney was of brick construction built from the basement.\n\nThe class rooms were built at different periods. The actual date of the first structure is not available, the addition was built in 1924.\n\nThe contents of the building comprised:\n\n90 Pupils Desks\n2 Teachers Desks,\nand the necessary text books, scribblers, maps etc.\n\nIn conjunction with Corp. McCarro of the R.C.M.P. Police, Balcarres Detachment, an investigation is under way.\n\nI shall submit a full report as soon as the investigation is completed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nE.B. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nAIR MAIL\n\nURGENT\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my wire of the 9th instant advising you that the classrooms and contents at the File Hills Indian Residential School, Balcarres, had been destroyed by fire, I wish to inform you that Mr. Jones, the Agent, and the Reverend Mr. Huston, are in my office this morning.\n\nWe have decided upon the following. If the Branch will authorize $100.00 for the purpose of buying lumber, nails, etc. and hiring a carpenter, Mr. Jones has undertaken to build benches and tables to be placed in the two playrooms so that school can be carried on at the present time. We even may not require quite the $100.00 and Mr. Jones thinks he will be able to fix up the two playrooms so that they are suitable.\n\nMr. Jones and Mr. Huston brought in a list of school materials required but in discussing this with me we came to the conclusion that since there was some school material on hand we could manage for the present. As I pointed out to them, nothing should be ordered at present, only sufficient to carry on school until the end of the school term. This will give the Branch breathing space to decide what to do before school re-opens in the Fall.\n\nThe Agent is taking the lists for the school material back to Balcarres and Mr. Huston is going up to the School on Tuesday. He will remain there for two or three days and the material on hand will be thoroughly checked. Only materials actually required will be asked for.\n\nI am sending this letter by Air Mail and you will receive it on Monday morning. Will you please wire me the necessary authority to proceed with this work. If I do not hear from you by noon on Monday I will take it for granted that I have authority for Mr. Jones to take the necessary steps to purchase the material and get the work underway.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

The Department will await with interest your further report regarding the fire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nLoss $10,000\nIn Indian School Fire\n\nFire destroyed the building in which classes were held for about 250 children of File Hills Indian residential school, Thursday morning, according to information for agent E. S. Jones to M. Christianson, inspector of Indian agencies in Alberta. The loss is approximately $10,000. This building, a frame structure on cement foundations, with two large classrooms, and a hall between, was erected about three years ago.\n\nThere will be a problem for the present to find land where classes may be held, pending the announcement from the government as to whether a new building will be constructed or not.\n\nBy prompt action on part of volunteers, the main building housing a large number of Indian children was saved.\nAIR MAIL\n\nRegina, Saskatchewan\nApril 17th, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding the burning of the classrooms at the File Hills Indian Residential School, which happened on the 8th instant, when Mr. Jones, the Indian Agent, was in the office here last week he was of the opinion that the fire had been started by faulty electric wiring. However, he now informs me that a few days after some of the children started to discuss the fire at different times and there were a lot of rumours floating around. Therefore Mr. Jones got in touch with Cpl. McCarro, of the R.C.M.Police, Balcarres, who carried out an investigation at the school, during which three boys admitted setting fire to the school.\n\nThe boy who actually lit the match and started the fire is only 12 years old and is from the Carlton Agency, Mistawasis Reserve. Benny Pasqua and Jimmy Keepiness, aged 15, of the Qu'Appelle Agency, helped the little fellow and more or less forced him to start the fire.\n\nAgent Jones was in the office today and we went to see Superintendent Darling, of the R.C.M. Police here in the city. While we were there he got in touch with Commissioner Ring, of the Bureau of Child Protection and it was decided to take the three boys into custody. Mr. Jones is to lay the charges tonight when he returns to Balcarres. These boys will be brought in to Regina very likely tomorrow and placed in the Industrial School here until such time as their case comes up.\n\nHave you any instructions to give in the matter? You will receive this letter on Monday morning, as I am sending it by Air Mail, and if you write back immediately I should receive your reply on Tuesday. The Police Report will not be forwarded by Cpl. McCarro until about Monday.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\nApril 20, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you advise that three of the boys of the File Hills Residential School have been taken into custody charged with setting fire to the classroom building.\n\nThe Department has no special instructions to give in this matter and, if they are found guilty, I feel that they should be committed to whatever Provincial institution in Saskatchewan the authorities consider they should be sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSearth & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nApril 18th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my letter of even date regarding the fire at the File Hills School, the Indian Agent informs me that the staff there have all more or less become panic stricken since it was learnt that the boys started the fire. Mr. Jones also further informs me that although the three boys I mentioned in my letter have admitted their guilt I think that the bigger boys are all more or less implicated.\n\nPersonally I think it was a mistake to leave Miss Pugh in charge. She may be a \"fine old girl\" but certainly not capable of handling a lot of big boys and girls. However, this is not the purpose of this letter. The Agent claims there are three boys there who are 16 years of age and they should be discharged immediately before they do something that they shouldn't, as there is no one there to handle them. The boys are Arnold Peshawisis from the Mistawasis Reserve, Wilfred Haywanhi from the Carry the Kettle Reserve, and Stanley Pasqua, of the Pasqua Reserve, Qu'Appelle Agency, and as the term has only approximately two months more to run I think probably it would be a good idea to act on Mr. Jones' recommendation.\n\nMr. Jones wishes to have the fireman, whose term at the school expires at the end of April, kept on for another month and I agreed to this. However, if you think otherwise let me know.\n\nIn conclusion I am of the opinion the Branch should get after the United Church and insist on another Principal being appointed. A man living at Round Lake cannot look after that school as well as someone living at File Hills. At present the male staff at the File Hills School are \"weak sisters\" and Mr. Jones feels that the boys fully intended to burn down the main building as well as the classrooms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nApril 23, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, the Department approves the firesman's remaining at the File Hills Residential School for the month of May. However it should be distinctly understood that this permission is being granted due to the special circumstances now existing at the school and it is not to be considered a precedent for future years.\n\nUnder separate cover you are being written regarding the discharge of the boys to whom you refer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Are the batteries supplied in 1939 worn out? If so, it will be necessary to give specific information regarding the reasons why they lasted such a short time. This is necessary before we can submit a requisition to the Purchasing Branch for a new set.\n\nI may add that when supplying the batteries in 1939 a heavy duty set was ordered on the specific request of the Principal and the Agent and it was stated that the set supplied at that time was sufficiently strong to handle the load.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M.

Paulin and Swayze give us an estimate on the price of putting the plumbing in good shape and I am attaching herewith their statement on this, from which you will note the estimated cost is $394.00. I was talking to Mr. Jones yesterday and he informs me he can verify this statement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

An amount of $450.00 was included in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school and we have already expended $310.00. In addition there is the probability that a new set of batteries will have to be purchased. Under these circumstances you will realize that it is extremely difficult for us to expend any large amount on additional repairs.\n\nWould it be possible to reduce the amount of repairs required to the plumbing system? I note that Messrs. Paulin and Swayze tender at an amount of $394.00 for both material and labour. I should appreciate knowing the approximate cost of the material, as it is possible that we might be able to purchase this elsewhere at a lower figure than quoted by Paulin and Swayze.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSearth & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nHowever, if these repairs cannot be brought about I am not going to cry over it. They can close off the water works and use outside toilets for all I care and I am leaving the matter entirely in your hands.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, August 19, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 111-1-5 of the 11th instant regarding repairs to the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I am herewith forwarding a list of the material as submitted by Messrs. Paulin and Swayze amounting to $200.00, and the cost of labour which totals $194.00. This, I understand, is all required if the toilets at the school are to be used this Winter.\n\nAgent Jones called me up on the telephone this morning and stated the boiler in the heating plant at the school is leaking and has been leaking for the past year. He thought the boiler should be inspected before the school term starts in the Fall. I therefore got in touch with Mr. Mayhew, who is in charge of that work for the Provincial Government here, and he promised to have an inspector there shortly as there was going to be one in that district.\n\nAgent Jones further stated that the pipes at the school all need replacement as they are in very bad shape. He understood that in the past these pipes had been cleaned out from time to time with acid, therefore you can imagine what the results are when acid is used in steam pipes.\n\nIn purchasing the material Messrs. Paulin and Swayze have submitted on their statement I think we would be wise to leave it to them to supply what is required. The cost of the material only totals $200.00 and if we obtained it a little cheaper by putting it through the Purchasing Agent you can readily understand that the difference would not be\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\ngreat...................\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF File Hills Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 10-891\n\nSHIP TO: Mr. L.L.

Mr. Jones, the Agent, however, went over these batteries himself and I am attaching herewith his letter, which speaks for itself. You will note that in the third paragraph of Mr. Jones' letter he states the cells can be disconnected, cleaned out and new acid put in at an approximate cost of $4.00 per cell, and you will also note in the sixth paragraph Mr. Jones says it would also help considerably if a little discretion were used in the number of lights turned on at one time. In the next paragraph he states: \"I have recommended to the Principal that Mr. Andres, who is at present Farming Instructor at the School, be given the duties of engineer.\"\n\nI wish to point out that Mr. Jones is a practical man and I think his instructions should be carried out by the Department, as he is of the opinion that the batteries should last another year.\n\nWill you please advise me what you want done, and at the same time return this letter.

On the small boiler a general overhaul is recommended especially the replacing of the nipples next to the steam header.\n\nAs a rule there is very little deterioration in the cast iron sections of these boilers; but, the connecting wrought iron nipples are subject to erosive action, and have occasionally to be replaced.\n\nFrom our inspector's report I would judge this boiler is not fit for use until the repairs are made.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) W.

Mayhew, Chief Inspector of Steam Boilers, Department of Public Works, Regina.\n\nThe sum of $450.00 was provided for repairs at the File Hills School in the estimates of this year. At this date the sum of approximately $550.00 has been spent. In this connection I may state that similar over-expenditures have been made at the majority of our schools this year. I am anxious, therefore, that the cost of repairing the boilers should be kept down to a reasonable figure.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the matter, you are authorized to make the best local arrangements for the repair of this boiler. It is unnecessary to add that the work should be undertaken at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen.

He has not a plumber, either, and would have to come to Regina to hire one, so as things are now it doesn't look as if anything will be done.\n\nI might just say here Mr. Chaplin put a furnace in the farming instructor's house a year ago last Summer and it has never worked properly but we have never been able to get Mr. Chaplin to do anything about it. In view of this as far as I am concerned our dealings with this man have not been very satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSeptember 30, 1942.\n\nRe: Plumbing repairs,\nFile Hills Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour comments on the above-noted subject were referred to the Chief Executive Assistant of the Department and to the officials of the Purchasing Division. Mr. Jackson suggests that immediately following the completion of this work a report should be sent forward by you or by the Agent, in which an opinion should be expressed on the workmanship and the extent to which the repairs are satisfactory to the Principal in charge of the school.\n\nYour comment that a furnace installed in the farming instructor's house by Mr. Chaplin is not giving satisfaction has been carefully noted by the officials at the Minister's office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Jones,\nIndian Agent,\nFile Hills Agency.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that both the 1942 and 1943 Estimates included a set of batteries for the Delco lighting plant of our School. This, however, was not granted, but instead, a sum was authorized for the purchase of one cell to replace one which exploded and also for the overhaul of four other cells which had become clogged with sediment. As a result of these repairs we were able to carry on through the winter months. Gradually during the past two months the service has become poorer and poorer until it is necessary to keep the motor running continually in order to obtain satisfactory service. The batteries will not store up sufficient energy to operate the radio; immediately the motor is shut off the radio goes dead and the lights in the building become dim. Several mornings there was not enough \"juice\" in the batteries to start the motor, and it became necessary to start the laundry engine and run the auxiliary generator before the motor could be started. It is quite evident that this set of batteries is exhausted and should be replaced immediately.\n\nWould you kindly bring this matter to the attention of the Department, urging that immediate action be taken in the purchase of a complete new set of heavy duty batteries.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nL.

E. CHAPLIN\n\nPaints - Household Furnishings - Glass\nBALCARRES, Sask.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nOur heating engineer Mr. P. Hill, of Fort Qu'Appelle has made an examination of the Gurney boiler at The File Hills Residential School and found that the boiler was in very poor condition.\n\nHe found that the tubes were completely plugged with an alkali or an iron deposit that is almost impossible to remove. This would make it necessary to renew all the tubes in the boiler and possibly retap the openings. The feasibility of this can only be ascertained after the boiler is dismantled. If this could be done the cost would be upwards of $300.00.\n\nHe recommends that it would be far better to install a new boiler, a water softener, and a smaller jacket heater. The cost of the boiler is not known at the present time, nor is that of a water softener. A suitable jacket heater could possibly be installed for about $75.00 to $100.00. This installation would eliminate the using of the larger boilers during the warm period of the year when steam pressure is not necessary for heating purposes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. J. E. Chaplin\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nMr. Jones, the Indian Agent, File Hills Agency, has forwarded to me a letter from Mr. J.S. Chaplin, Hardware Merchant of Balcarres, copy of which is herewith attached.\n\nThe Mr. Hill to whom Mr. Chaplin refers was asked to examine the boiler at the File Hills Residential School by the Principal, Mr. Dobbin, and the result of his examination is mentioned in Mr. Chaplin's letter.\n\nI have been informed that the water softener would not make any difference to the water used at File Hills because this water has a lot of iron in it. Therefore the water softener would not have the necessary effect but it is evident something will have to be done to the heating plant at this institution.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen.

You might let me know if there is anyone in the vicinity of the school who is able to install them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 111-1-5 of the 20th instant regarding the Gurney boiler at the File Hills Residential School.\n\nFor your information I might say Mr. P. Hill, of Fort Qu'Appelle, does the work for Mr. Chaplin, the dealer in Balcarres, and I am told they cannot give us the length of the tubes that are required until the boiler is torn down. This work takes an experienced man; therefore the only thing we can do is to get in touch with the man that is going to do the work and if it is going to be given to Mr. Chaplin he is the one to contact.\n\nM.

It is therefore necessary, in this particular case, to supply the movable chair desks.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Chaplin, of Balcarres, was given the work as you instructed and I had a telephone call from him yesterday wherein he stated it was impossible to repair the present boiler and in his opinion the only thing that could be done is to furnish the school with a new boiler. I also received a letter from Mr. Chaplin today which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Under separate cover I am sending in the portion of the boiler that I spoke to you about this morning. You will notice that this tube is filled in solid with the alkali deposit and it is impossible to remove this. The other tubes in this boiler are in a similar condition and it is our opinion that this boiler is not fit to be repaired.\"\n\nThe portion of the boiler tube Mr. Chaplin spoke about in his letter is 3\u00bd\" in diameter and is filled solid with deposits from hard water. I believe this is another case where we will have to furnish a new boiler. As far as I know the present one has been in the school for over twenty years.\n\nIn the letter I have from our Branch dated the 7th instant, your file No. 108-1-5, in connection with the boiler at the Round Lake School, Crooked Lake Agency, it is stated that the Surveys and Engineering Branch have been asked to make a report on the boiler there. Probably they could also see the boiler at File Hills School and I am sending this by Air Mail just in case they are at Round Lake School now.\n\nM.

Booth,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIn connection with the heating plant for the File Hills Indian Residential School Mr. Mills, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, wrote to me asking for the name of a consulting heating engineer who has no connection with a supply house or firm of contractors in this city and not connected with any firm.\n\nI made all of the enquiries that were necessary and found out there was no such person in this city, because naturally Regina is too small for a man who does work of this sort to be able to support himself without being connected with some firm. I, however, got in touch with the boiler inspector who inspects several of our schools and he advised me what they were doing in connection with several of the apartments here in town. They have been installing tractor boilers instead of the regular heating plants and this is working out very satisfactorily, therefore I passed this information along to Mr. Mills and also gave him the name of the man who is doing this work around Regina. I further gave him this man's quotation which was $450.00 for the Round Lake School and $650.00 for the File Hills School. However, evidently Mr. Mills did not think very much of this because I have now received the Purchase Order in connection with a quotation he received from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Company. This is regarding a boiler for the Round Lake School.\n\nI have written to our Branch regarding the heating plant for the File Hills School but have not as yet received a reply. Do you realize that there is no furnace in the File Hills School and if it suddenly turns cold we are going to be in a bad way and this may happen at any time because I have seen the freeze-up on the 2nd of October.\n\nM.

Immediately on receipt of your letter this morning, I phoned the Surveys & Engineering Branch and apparently the information that you forwarded to them is not sufficient for their purposes. Accordingly they are sending an air mail letter to the Boiler Inspector mentioned in your letter, requesting him to proceed to the File Hills School immediately and report direct to the Surveys & Engineering Branch.

Auckland, the boiler inspector who has inspected the heating plant at File Hills School several times, and I asked him if he had received word from the Surveys and Engineering Branch but he informed me he had heard nothing. As Mr. Mayhew is the Chief Boiler Inspector for the Provincial Government, and I had mentioned him in my letter, I then telephoned him but he gave me the same answer, that is he had received no word from the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nDo these people realize that there are over one hundred people at this school who will be without a fire when the cold weather sets in, and it is liable to come at any time? Today I wired you as follows: \"RE HEATING PLANT FILE HILLS NO WORD RECEIVED BY BOILER INSPECTOR\".\n\nI wrote the Surveys and Engineering Branch three letters and sent them all by Air Mail on September 11th last but in spite of this no action has been taken as yet.\n\nChief Boiler Inspector Mayhew telephoned yesterday that he had received the letter from the Surveys and Engineering Branch and he came up to the office on his way to File Hills.\n\nM.

From the last paragraph of this letter you will note that the Chief Boiler Inspector has now received your authority to inspect the boiler at the File Hills School. I should appreciate any action you can take to expedite the matter as soon as you receive the Boiler Inspector's report.\n\nDirector.\nRegina, October 6, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAs per the postscript I put on my letter yesterday regarding the heating system at the File Hills School to the effect that Mr. Mayhew was on his way to File Hills, I wish to inform you he has just returned and was good enough to call on me and give me a copy of his letter to Mr. T.S. Mills, Chief Engineer, Engineering and Construction Service, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMr. Mayhew is the Chief Inspector of Steam Boilers for the Provincial Government. He is man practically my age and he has had years of experience with boilers. When the Surveys and Engineering Branch get in touch with our Department I hope Mr. Mayhew's recommendations will be accepted. In this way we can get action immediately. The estimated cost is between $300.00 and $400.00.\n\nI am just writing this to let you know just what I think of the matter.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nFile 13511\n\nDepartment of Public Works\nSteam Boilers Branch\n\nREGINA, Sask.\nOct 6, 1943.\n\nRe: File Hills Residential School - Balcarres, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by your letter of October 1st, I have made an inspection of the heating system at the above school. The information required is as follows:\n\n1. Square feet in radiator's - 2331\n   Plus 25% for piping & extreme conditions 583\n   Total radiation 2914 Sq. Feet.\n\n2. Existing boilers: Two Gurney Cast Iron Section, listed as 25 and 17 Horse Power. Age uncertain - estimated 30 years. The smaller boiler is a complete wreck and must be replaced.\n\n3. There is no high pressure boiler in the building. Water is heated for laundry purposes by steam from low pressure boilers.\n\n4. See number three.\n\n5. Room in the boiler room is very limited and the season is very late to order a new boiler at this time. There is a Safford C.I.S. boiler for sale at the Balcarres Hotel, Dominion Radiator Co. Number S-36-6. This boiler appears in good condition and is free from scale. This is slightly larger than the wrecked boiler, and would be very suitable! The price asked, I understand, is $125.00. A new boiler of this type would cost approximately $1000.00 and time of delivery very likely months ahead.\n\n(Over)\n6. If the above mentioned boiler was procurred no structural changes of boiler room would be necessary.\n\n7. Estimate of cost completed $300.00 - $400.00\n\nAs the small boiler was badly filled with scale, it is to be considered that the other boiler will be in a similar condition, and there is the possibility that it too will also have to be replaced in the near future.\n\nOwing to the lateness of the season I would urge immediate action.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) W. H. Mayhew\nChief Inspector of Steam Boilers\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt will be noted that Mr. Mayhew's estimate for the total installed cost is between $300 and $400. This corresponds approximately with an estimate of $450 for a rebuilt tractor boiler furnished our Engineering and Construction Office by Mr. Christianson after he had discussed the matter on September 11th with Mr. J. G. Bolton a Regina Heating Contractor. It is considered that the boiler upon which Mr. Mayhew's comments, is a more satisfactory replacement than the type of reconditioned equipment described by Mr. Christianson.\n\nIn view of the necessity of reconditioning the heating system at the school immediately, and the uncertainty of obtaining necessary materials and equipment when required, we consider Indian Affairs should authorize Mr. Christianson to arrange for the purchase of the boiler recommended by Mr. Mayhew, and to obtain the services of a reliable contractor for its installation.\n\nIf Indian Affairs concur, we consider supervision of the work might be obtained from the Saskatchewan Department of Public Works upon the payment of a fee and travelling expenses, which service, in addition to those already rendered, must be provided for in the cost of the undertaking.\n\nIt is estimated that to purchase and install the boiler, and to provide for contingencies, as well as to cover services which have been and may yet be incurred in connection with inspection and supervision, a total amount of $600.00 should be made available.\n\n(Sgd) John A. Pounder,\nfor Director.\nOttawa, October 12th, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Heating system, File Hills Residential School,\nBalcarres, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your memoranda of August 20th and October 7th, relative to the above, this matter was referred immediately on receipt of your first memorandum to our Engineering and Construction Service who at that time had the heating system at the Round Lake Indian Residential School under consideration. As it had not proved possible to arrange for an inspection at the Round Lake School satisfactory from all points of view, the inspection at the File Hills School was left in abeyance as your memorandum of August 26th did not lead us to consider the situation at the latter school particularly urgent and we were not prepared to make a recommendation on information which Mr. Christianson was able to secure and which he furnished on September 11th.\n\nIn this connection there would seem to be some confusion as to dates in Mr. Christianson's letter of October 4th, of which you sent us a copy.\n\nAlso in this connection we would suggest that Indian Agents be advised, particularly in view both of our shortness of staff for all projects that have to be taken care of, the general labour situation and the most inevitable lack delay before new equipment of any kind can be secured, that where they suspect any heating equipment not to be in good order that they ask for its inspection in April or May rather than in August.\n\nOur Engineering and Construction Service has been in communication with the Deputy Minister of Public Works for Saskatchewan asking his co-operation in obtaining a report on the existing installation at the File Hills School. A report has just been received prepared by Mr. H. W. Mayhew, Chief Inspector of Steam Boilers for the Saskatchewan Department of Public Works, of which a copy is attached for your information.\n\nYou will observe that the school is now being supplied with steam for heating and laundering, from two low pressure boilers of uncertain age, and that the smaller of these is described as a complete wreck. Mr. Mayhew further states that it is possible the larger boiler may have to be replaced in the near future, but in the absence of any criticism of this unit, it is assumed that satisfactory service can be provided at least for the present by replacing the smaller boiler.\n\nIn this connection Mr. Mayhew has ascertained that a Sufford cast iron sectional boiler, #536-6, manufactured by the Dominion Radiator Company Ltd., in good condition and having a larger capacity than the boiler it would replace is available at the Balcarres Hotel for a cost of $125.00. How this boiler became available is not stated, but on checking by our Engineering and Construction Service it would appear to be a six-section unit, manufactured in 1935 or 1936, and, as reported by Mr. Mayhew, would cost approximately $1000.00 if new. The boiler is capable of assuming approximately 45% of the school load, whereas the boiler it replaces carries just over 40%.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nReports received from Mr. Christianson indicated that the heating plant at the File Hills Residential School required replacement. When we first heard from Mr. Christianson it did not appear as if the matter was urgent. However, recent letters indicate that unless the new installation is made this school will be without heat.\n\nWe brought the matter to the attention of the Surveys & Engineering Branch some time ago and again recently when Mr. Christianson urged immediate action. I enclose, for your information, their memorandum of October 12, together with a copy of the report of the Provincial Boiler Inspector whom the Surveys & Engineering Branch directed to inspect the heating system. You will note that the Surveys and Engineering Branch recommend the boiler suggested by Mr. Mayhew and they estimate the total cost of purchasing the boiler, the installation etc. at $600.00. Funds are available and your immediate approval would be appreciated, in order that we may arrange for the installation at the earliest possible date.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson\n\nIndian Affairs Branch recommend the purchase of a used Safford Cast Iron, sectional boiler 7S-36-d, to replace the present boiler at the File Hills Indian Residential School at Balcarres, Sask. The boiler is obtainable from the Balcarres Hotel at a cost of $125.00. A new boiler of the same type would cost approximately $1000.00.\n\nThe boiler at the Balcarres Hotel has been inspected by a provincial boiler inspector, who reports that it is suitable, in good condition, and free from scale. Engineering and Surveys Branch consider that Mr. Christianson should be authorized to make the purchase and to engage to obtain the services of a reliable contractor to install it. They estimate that the total cost involved, including the boiler at $125.00, installation, services in connection with inspection and supervision, will be approximately $600.00.\n\nI concur in this recommendation and request that authority be granted to permit Mr. Christianson to arrange for the purchase and installation of the boiler on the basis of attached memoranda of Mr. Hoey and Mr. Founder at an estimated total cost of $600.00.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HG\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 15, 1943.\n\nMr. M.

A copy of your memorandum was forwarded to the Departmental Purchasing Agent and on October 15 Mr. Christianson was instructed to purchase the boiler from the Balsarres Hotel. He was also given authority to arrange for its installation on the basis of your memorandum.\n\nDirector.\nRegina, November 18, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the Department's letter No. 111-1-5 of October 15th together with a letter from Mr. C.W. Jackson, the Chief Executive Assistant, in connection with the furnace at the File Hills School.\n\nUpon receipt of the above mentioned letter I took immediate steps to get this going and I am now forwarding two vouchers, one in favour of the Plaza Hotel, Balcarres, in the amount of $135.00 being payment for the furnace, and another in favour of Mr. J.E. Chaplin of Balcarres, in the amount of $198.36 for the installation.\n\nI was down at the File Hills Agency yesterday and the day before, and I visited the school. Everything in connection with the furnace appeared to be in first class shape and it was giving fine heat. The engineer who looks after the furnace informed me it was in first class shape and Mr. Hill, who installed it for Mr. Chaplin, certainly seems to have made a good job of it. The whole thing amounted to $333.36 and I would recommend the two vouchers for payment.\n\nI just want to say here that the other furnace probably will go out of commission in a very short time because it probably is all corroded but it is to be hoped that it will last throughout the Winter. If the weather is not too cold the furnace we shipped in will probably heat the school. However, if it gets real cold it would not do it. Therefore if we have an opportunity to buy another furnace the way we did this one I think we should take advantage of it and I can get the Provincial boiler inspectors to help me in this matter if you wish.\n\nM.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received from Mr. L.L. Dobbin, of File Hills Residential School, a letter stating that he can build a classroom building, with two classrooms - 26' x 40' - that is a building 52' x 40' - with full basement, including a furnace, for $6,500.00. This includes excavation. In order to be on the safe side, I think we should say $7,000.00. If you can get this amount put in the Estimates, I think we should be prepared to go ahead and build it for this amount in a way that would be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI enclose rough sketches of the building, showing what is proposed. Of course, if the building has to go through the Architect, then it might be condemned and a more elaborate plan prepared, which would cost more money.\n\nMr. Dobbin assures me that the materials are available and that the work can be proceeded with immediately it is authorized.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncls.\nMemorandum to: Dr. McGill\n\nRe File Hills Residential School\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Dorey has forwarded to me a copy of his letter to your Branch dated June 22nd in reference to constructing a new classroom building.\n\nI have discussed the matter with the Minister and he approves of Dr. Dorey's suggestion, provided you are satisfied with the rough sketches of the building which have been forwarded to you and on the understanding that the total cost should not exceed $7,000. He also approves of an item being included in the Supplementary Estimates this year for the expenditure.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, June 24, 1944\nOttawa, June 26, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: File Hills Residential School\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of June 24th authorizing the inclusion of an amount of $7,000 in the Supplementary Estimates in order to construct a new classroom building at the above mentioned residential school. The necessary instructions in this regard are being given to the Representative of the Treasury.\n\nIn order that authority may be given for immediate construction of this building, it would be appreciated if the Minister would approve our using, for the present, the amount of $5,000 provided in the current year's Main Appropriation for the Cross Lake United Church School. This amount cannot be spent during the current fiscal year.\n\nIf this were done, the amount of $7,000 provided in the Supplementary Estimates would be available before the building was completed, which would enable us to pay the extra $2,000 and leave the Main Appropriation as it is today.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Mr. Hoey.\n\nI wish to inform you that I was down at the File Hills School yesterday and while there Mr. Dobbin, the Principal, informed me he had been asked by the United Church to supply plans for two new classrooms and he was getting the cost of building because he understands that the Church is going to submit this to the Department.\n\nI had a little talk with him about this because I know just how matters are at the school at the present time, and here in a nutshell is what is going on there. As you know, the teaching has been carried on in the two playrooms and it is necessary every morning and night to move some of the furnishings in these rooms. Mr. Dobbin had two good teachers there but both have resigned and have no intention of coming back. Mr. Dobbin pointed out he does not know where he is going to get teachers and I quite realize that nobody who knew what the conditions for teaching are like there would accept a position of teacher there. I was there last Winter and I felt sorry for the two lady teachers who were teaching under such a terrible handicap. Personally I think Mr. Dobbin is getting along fairly well and both he and his wife are very fine people. I think they have the confidence of the Indians because they have instilled kindness into the school amongst the children and military tactics have been done away with. Still at the same time I know Mr. Dobbin can be firm with the children. While conditions remain as they are at present the children cannot possibly get the education they should receive. For example under one of the playrooms an engine is continually running and you can understand that this is distracting to whatever teacher they might have. The teachers resigning this year is just a sample of what will happen in the future because, as I have already stated, no teacher will remain long so long as existing circumstances remain. I know there is a war on and our Branch find it hard to get money but I sincerely hope that when the United Church present their request it will receive every consideration.\n\nMy reason for writing.....\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 6)\nMy reason for writing you this letter is to acquaint you with conditions at the school as they are at the present time.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 26, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant regarding the erection of a classroom building, with two classrooms and full basement, including furnace, at the File Hills Residential School, I am today advised that the Minister has approved an expenditure not exceeding $7,000, and we have been instructed to include this amount in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nI am not certain when the Supplementary Estimates will be passed but, in the meantime, we have $5,000 available if this amount is required before the Supplementary Estimate is secured.\n\nIn view of the above, this letter authorizes you to proceed immediately with the erection of the building, and I trust that you will find it possible to complete it by early Fall, at the latest.\n\nThe rough sketch of the building which you forwarded is satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This is all required and some of the work to be done there can only be done by skilled labour. However, anything that can be handled by the staff will be performed by them and Mr. Dobbin stated he would have all of the work he could done by the staff, therefore $22.00 can be taken off this amount, leaving the total at $128.84.\n\nI am also enclosing a requisition in duplicate signed by Mr. Simpson for the material for the pig pen and this is required. We could make the building a little smaller if it is absolutely necessary but I think for future use at the school they require the building as outlined and this will cost $695.78. The price is from the North American Supply Company with head office in Winnipeg. I was down to see the manager of the Yards in Balcarres and he informed me the price he had quoted was the one he gave to everyone but the Purchasing Agent may be able to do better.\n\nThe school also need a jacket heater which the hardware man in Balcarres quoted at $100.00. This is required to heat water. If you can get lower prices on the lumber the total cost might be brought down to the amount mentioned in your letter, namely $750.00 but in any event the things I have mentioned should be supplied because they are necessary and I am sure Mr. Dobbin will do his best to keep the amount within what will be allowed.\n\nI further explained to Mr. Dobbin...\nI further explained to Mr. Dobbin that the seeder would not be supplied, also the washer in the amount of $575.00. This was requested because the washer now in use at the school is really too small but I told Mr. Dobbin he would have to try to get along as best he could for the present.\n\nI think he can do without the 8 spools of wire for fencing and the posts totalling $66.00 for the present time. Also, there has been lots of rain around File Hills at the present time and I do not believe the dug-out is absolutely necessary just now. However, as I have said before, I trust that the amounts which are necessary will be supplied.\n\nM.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of June 26th, intimating that the Minister has approved of an expenditure not exceeding $7,000. May I ask whether you want the bills for this to be submitted, or whether you will get a bill from The Woman's Missionary Society? I have advised Mrs. Loveys of this, as well as Mr. Dobbin, and I think that the money might very well be made available to the Treasurer of The Woman's Missionary Society rather than to us. However, it is entirely for you to decide -- we can adjust matters here.\n\nI should like to express our appreciation of the action of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 30th,\n1944.\nMINISTER OF AGRICULTURE\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA,\nJune 26th, 1944.\n\nPersonal\n\nHonourable T.A. Crerar, P.C., M.P.,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMy dear Colleague:\n\nAttached is copy of a letter which I have received from Dr. George Dorey, Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada.\n\nI may say that there has been a very important mission of the United Church on the File Hills Indian Reserve for many years. I think it is one of the Reserves that the United Church has taken a great deal of interest in and has been very proud of. Mrs. Motherwell for many years was closely associated with it, and still takes a great interest in the work which is being done there. I think it would be most unfortunate if the school was not continued at its past high standard, and am very anxious to see the building proceeded with at an early date as possible.\n\nYou will recall that the Indian school at Lebret was burned some years ago. It was during the period that the Bennett Government were in office. They almost immediately proceeded with the reconstruction of a new building of a very much better type and at a much higher cost than the old one. As these two schools are close enough together to be known by all the people in the community there are some comparisons being made which are not helpful.\n\nI am sure it will be the intention of the Department to rebuild this school, and I hope they can have it completed before the coming winter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nsgd) James G. Gardiner.\n\nJames G. Gardiner.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nJuly 3, 1944\n\nFile Hills Indian Res.

In fact it may become completely dry this Fall. The other source of water supply for the school is a well but it does not meet with the requirements. Mr. Dobbin is therefore requesting that a dug-out be constructed 165 ft. long; 60 ft. wide; and 12 ft. deep to cost $125.00.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 111-1-5, Sept., 29th., pertaining to the new classroom building now under construction at the File Hills Residential School, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe cement basement is completed, excepting half of the cement floor.\n\nAll outside work of the building is completed, excepting the siding on one end and both sides, and painting of the walls and roof.\n\nInside work; The first flooring has been laid. The walls are sheated and insulated, and the ceiling is half sheated, and insulated. The walls and ceiling have also to be plastered.\n\nThe chimney is now under construction.\n\nProcuring of building materials has been the chief cause of delay in this work. Procuring of labour has also been more or less a problem.\n\nMr. Dobbin, Principal of the school has informed me that he was able to procure the balance of the siding required, and the flooring, yesterday, and expects to be able to procure the balance of the sheathing for the ceiling, also that he does not anticipate any further delay in this work through being unable to procure the necessary building materials.\n\nMr. Hasty, building contractor advised me that providing there was no holdup in procuring labour, or materials, he expected to have this work completed within the next month.\n\nS.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nRegina, October 13th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inform you that some time ago the Indian Agent at File Hills, Mr. S.H. Simpson, discussed with me the matter of getting some fire fighting apparatus for the Agency to protect the school, Agency buildings, and other buildings in the Agency. This, of course, was a while ago when we thought that a lot of equipment was going to be turned over to us after the war.\n\nHowever, I asked Mr. Simpson to make up a requisition for what was necessary and he has just forwarded this to me. I am now attaching this in duplicate. If any equipment of this nature is available I thought probably it would be well to supply this to the File Hills Agency. However, there are probably men employed with our Branch in Ottawa who know more about fire fighting equipment than I do because I must admit I know very little.\n\nIn any event I am forwarding the requisition for your attention, as previously stated.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nOctober 17, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI am sending forward herewith a requisition for certain supplies that appear to be needed for fire protection at the File Hills School and File Hills Agency buildings. I am sending forward also copy of the letter from Mr. Christianson that accompanied this requisition. It is my understanding that this requisition is based, in part at least, on the assumption that a certain amount of this equipment will be available from military sources.\n\nIn view of our desire to do everything humanly possible to protect our buildings from fire, we would be prepared to purchase this equipment new if the total cost is at all reasonable. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you would let us know by phone what the approximate cost might be.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nReport on File Hills Indian Residential School\n\nI might say while at the Agency I visited the File Hills Indian Residential School and everything there seemed to be going along fairly satisfactory.\n\nThe staff there were glad to know that the classrooms are being rebuilt. I was in the new classrooms talking to the man in charge, Mr. Dick Hasty, whom I have known for the past thirty years. He is getting up in years but he is a first class carpenter and we can depend on anything Mr. Hasty does therefore I know he will make a good job of rebuilding these classrooms. Mr. Hasty told me that they probably would be finished at the end of this month but on account of the shortage of labour he thought it might take him a couple of weeks longer so in all probability it will be on in November some time before the building is completed. However, it is closed in and there should be no trouble in finishing even if the weather does get cold.\n\nThe Principal again brought to my attention the boiler at the school. When Mr. Mayhow, Provincial Boiler Inspector, was down there last he reported to me when the new boiler was being installed that we should make arrangements to purchase another new boiler to replace the other one, and I brought this to the attention of our Branch. I again brought this to the attention of our Branch on July 17th last since no action had been taken stating that the boiler was not satisfactory but again no attention was paid to this by our Branch. To quote Mr. Dobbin's remarks it does not matter how much you fire this boiler it is so badly caked that very little results are obtained from the fuel burned in this heating plant therefore they are depending mostly on the boiler that was installed a year ago last Fall at the school and in real cold weather this is not sufficient. The matter of having a new boiler installed should be given consideration.\n\nThe staff at the school, of course, is new as several of the ladies there are beginning their first year but there were one or two ladies who were there before I certainly was not sorry to see leave this institution. Mr. Dobbin, the Principal, seems to be carrying on very satisfactorily.\n\nMr. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 19, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the\n13th instant, with reference to the File Hills\nIndian Residential School.\n\nRegarding your remarks about the boiler,\nI inclose a copy of my letter to you dated July\n24th to which no reply has been received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 7, 1944.\n\nMr. L.L.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Return of Labor performed on the new classroom being erected at our school. I also enclose cancelled cheques issued in payment of same, together with receipts and cancelled cheques in connection with material and the hauling of same. I trust you will find these in order and if so I would be pleased to receive the balance of $2000.00, which is still due from Ottawa.\n\nThe building is practically complete with the exception of the concrete floor in the basement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.L.

The statements covering the labour amount to $1017.35. The total of the cancelled cheques is $965.45. Cancelled cheque No. 35, issued in favour of T. Franklin for an amount of $40, and cheque No. 48, issued to K. Stonechild for $11.90, were not included. The total of these two cheques would be $51.90 and this amount added to the total of the cancelled cheques received, namely, $965.45, would make a total of $1017.35 and would balance the statement you forwarded for labour. The two missing cheques should be sent. You should also forward a detailed account from the North American Lumber Supply Company showing the various items purchased at a cost of $2000.\n\nWe have already forwarded to the General Treasurer of the United Church of Canada an accountable cheque for $5000 and we are prepared to pay an additional $2000, provided there is a total of $7000 expended. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of July 24.\n\nThe following is a brief statement showing the present standing of this matter:\n\n| Advance | $5000.00 |\n|---------|-----------|\n| Expenditures | |\n| Labour | $1017.35 |\n| Material | $2368.00 |\n| Amount unaccounted for | $1614.65 |\n\nMr. L.L.

In order to enable us to pay you an amount over and above this, receipts either for material or labour in connection with the construction of the building must be forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip

However, I am attaching hereto an extra copy of the lists of parts in order that it could be handed to an electric equipment firm in Regina who could give an accurate cost of the items listed thereon.\n\nThe approximate cost of labour is as follows:\n\nFile Hills Residential School Buildings, 100 hrs. at $1.00 per hour.\nAgency Headquarters Buildings........... 70 hrs. at $1.00 per hour.\n\nAttached hereto are the Provincial Inspector's reports enclosed in your letter of December 9th. to this office.\n\nSgd.

We do not have a price on the parts required and I did not see very much use in getting this as no doubt the Purchasing Agent will be asked to make the purchases and therefore that can be left to him.\n\nI am also attaching copy of Agent Simpson's letter to me.\n\nM.

He advises that providing the boiler has a 60000 cu.ft. of steam capacity, and is in excellent shape, as reported, it will meet requirements. He also advises that part of the stone basement wall of the school will have to be removed to install the boiler. It is estimated that the cost of installing it will be about $75.00.\n\nT.G.

I have followed the directions in your letter of Feb. 15 as closely as possible and I trust you will now find everything in order, and will have the balance of $2000 forwarded at an early date.\n\nI also enclose a statement showing how the money already sent ($5000) has been expended, also the amount outstanding.\n\nYou will note that the accounts yet to be paid exceed $2000 by the sum of $473.48.\n\nI am quite aware that the maximum to be expended was not to exceed $7000 and have endeavoured to keep it within this figure. Two items, namely, the furnace installation, and electric wiring, cost a great deal more than anticipated and I was not aware of this until the work had been completed. When wartime conditions are taken into consideration, it must be admitted that the extent to which the grant was overspent was not excessive, and an additional sum to cover this overexpenditure should be granted by the Department.\n\nI might add too that the exterior of the building is still unpainted and this will have to be done when weather is suitable in the Spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.

G. Bright (Western) Limited I wish to advise the Regina Cartage and Storage Company are storing it for a period of about two months. This was necessary as there is no storage available at File Hills. Mr. Simpson was communicated with by telephone and he advised that the boiler could not be installed at the present because to do so would interrupt the school work as the heat would have to be turned off. To install this boiler in the school a section of the cement wall will have to be knocked out. It is therefore considered advisable to store the boiler here and when weather conditions are such that the boilers can be turned off in the school then when everything is ready the new boiler can be trucked to Balcarres by the Maier Transport Company who have the equipment to place it in its permanent position.\n\nThe Regina Cartage and Storage Company moved the boiler to their storage facilities and there will be a cost in connection with this work. We are endeavouring to obtain their invoice so that payment may be made out of this year's Appropriation. I am given to understand that their storage charges will be $2.00 a month. There will also be a charge for pulling down the stack and this work was done by the Maier Transport Company. We will endeavour to obtain their invoices and forward same to your office for payment out of this year's Appropriation.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nT.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nWith reference to Department telegram from Mr. Phelan of even date asking for a description of the new class room building, File Hills Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith the following plans under which this building was constructed.\n\n1. Blueprint of basement plan.\n2. \" \" \" front elevation.\n3. \" \" \" half section and side view.\n\nAlso enclosed is a rough sketch showing the main floor divided into two rooms. There is a beaver board partition 7' 8\" high by 24' long, divided into three panels 8' wide which can be removed, thereby making the two classrooms into one. This beaver board panel is not sound proof.\n\nThe basement walls are constructed of cement and gravel in accordance with the attached plan. Two fuel bins have been constructed on the west side of the basement against the walls thereof, by constructing one end wall 6\" thick by 8' 6\" high by 14' long, and one side wall 6\" thick by 8' 6\" high by 24' long, divided in two by an 8\" cement wall. A standard door way leads from the basement floor into each bin.\n\nThe classroom floor is constructed of 1 layer of shiplap, 1 ply of building paper and 1 layer of edge grain flooring. The outside walls have one layer of shiplap and 2 ply of building paper covered with cedar lap siding. The inside of walls have one layer of shiplap, covered with wall board and plaster finish. The walls and ceilings are insulated with shavings. The roof is constructed of one layer of shiplap, one ply tar paper and cedar shingles.\n\nThis building has electric lights installed and is heated by a hot air coal furnace.\n\nThe following work has yet to be completed:\nTwo thirds of basement cement floor to be constructed,\none quarter of the roof on the east side, four walls and both gable ends to be painted outside. Materials for this work are on hand at the school.\n\nPlease kindly return the three blue prints which were loaned to me by the North American Lumber Co. at Balcarres.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nBalcarres, Sask., April 21st,\n1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B.Ostrander,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you kindly draw the attention of the Department to the following urgent matters pertaining to our School, with a view to having action taken in regard to them.\n\nFor a considerable number of years past, the water for laundry and other purposes has been heated in a tank placed in a horizontal position above and to one side of the boilers. Inside this tank is a copper coil through live steam from the boiler is forced, thus heating the water in the tank. This was quite satisfactory in winter, but during the summer months it was necessary to keep a fire in one of the boilers continually in order to have sufficient hot water available. More fuel was consumed than necessary, and the building was kept too warm. At the present time the tank is leaking in several places and will have to be replaced very soon. We would suggest that it be replaced with a jacket heater of sufficient capacity for our needs. We believe that it would be more economical and efficient than the present arrangement.\n\nThe other matter for consideration is the painting of the new classroom building. The funds provided by the Department for its construction were not sufficient to cover exterior painting, and in order to prevent deterioration of the siding this should be done at once. The dimensions of the building are 40'x52' with a 12' side wall.\n\nYour early attention to these matters will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nRegina, April 26th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWhen visiting at the File Hills Residential School last week my attention was directed to the condition of the tank used for heating the water for washing purposes. This tank was leaking in two places and temporarily patched. I expect that at a very early date it will go to pieces entirely. I asked Mr. Dobbin, the Principal, to write me regarding this and I am enclosing his letter.\n\nYou will note that he requests a jacket heater instead of replacing the hot water tank. It is very uneconomical to make a large fire in one of the boilers in order to heat water for washing purposes in the summer, and that is what is required with the present arrangement. The wisdom in substituting a jacket heater is obvious.\n\nMention is made in Mr. Dobbin's letter of the need for painting the new classroom building. I understand that the funds allowed for the erection of the building did not allow sufficient for painting. In Mr. Dobbin's letter he does not mention the cost of this but he informed me in conversation that he had received an estimate of $75.00 for material and labour for a two-coat job. I doubt that this is sufficient and I find that most of the estimates given Mr. Dobbin by local experts have been far too low. I instructed Mr. Dobbin to make provision in his next Estimates for these two matters but I am bringing them to your attention now because I am afraid that at any time a replacement of the water heating plant will be urgently needed.\n\nMr. Dobbin showed me some accounts which he had just received for a rather large expenditure in connection with repairs to the water works and sewage at the school, and showed me where the repairs had been made. No authority for the expenditure had been received from the Department and I believe no request was made for authority by the school but the work was done when urgently needed.\n\nI explained to Mr. Dobbin the need for anticipating repair expenditure. For instance it is very obvious that in view of the fact that many of the pipes are now so badly corroded that......\nare now so badly corroded that they are nearly completely filled, and others are so badly rusted that they are starting to leak, a rather large expenditure in this connection will be necessary very soon, and I instructed him to place all these matters in the next Estimates, after having had quotations giving an estimate of the probable cost. From my own observations I feel that a great deal of trouble is coming at a not far distant date in connection with the sewage system at this school and it may be necessary to do considerable replacement of pipes.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 5, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the File Hills Residential School, please let me have more definite information regarding the type of jacket heater which you consider is required at the File Hills School. The catalogue number of some reputable firm should be given, if possible.\n\nI note, in the third paragraph of your letter, that you are not satisfied with the quotation received by Mr. Dobbin for painting the new classroom building. Please make further enquiries, with a view to securing a definite quotation for the material and labour.\n\nI note from the last paragraph of your letter that you anticipate it will be necessary to expend a considerable amount in repairing the sewage system at this school. It is noted that a request for this expenditure will be included in the estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nFor your further information and as a follow-up to our letter of April 26th, File No. 306-11A, concerning the hot water tank at the File Hills Residential School, I wish to inform you that we have a letter from Mr. Dobbin, the Principal.\n\nMr. Dobbin notes that the engineer has been finding it particularly difficult to keep the water hot enough in spite of the fact that continual stoking of the furnace was necessary, in other words he says that the system is losing its efficiency at such a rate that something will have to be done very soon. This has been particularly developing in the last few days.\n\nJ.F.B.

Ostreander Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter #306-11A of May 9th, pertaining to a jacket heater for the File Hills Residential School, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe hot water tank at the school is leaking badly. It is also badly corroded and cannot be repaired to make it serviceable for the purpose for which it is required. The hot water supply for the school is provided through the furnace heating coils placed within this tank. These coils are also badly corroded. Apart from that this system of heating water is not suitable or satisfactory, as when a supply of hot water is required a furnace fire has to be put on. This results in heating the whole of the school building. It is also an expensive of procuring hot water during the months that the building does not require to be heated.\n\nForm 37 in triplicate is attached hereto listing the equipment essential to provide sufficient hot water for the requirements of the school. Prices stated were quoted by J.E. Chaplin, Hardware Merchant, Balsamroot, Sask. Cost of labour installing equipment is to be taken care of by the school.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, May 22nd, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, No. 111-1-5, and in particular to the first paragraph thereof, I now enclose detailed requisition for a hot water storage tank and a jacket heater for the File Hills Indian Residential School, also a covering letter from Mr. Simpson relative thereto.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMr. S.H.Simpson,\nIndian Agent,\nFile Hills Agency,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Simpson:\n\nI enclose herewith 4 invoices (in triplicate) as follows:\n\n1. Dated Jan. 29th 1945 - J.E.Chaplin - $28.55\n2. Dated Feb. 2nd 1945 - J.E.Chaplin - $104.84\n3. Dated Mar. 22nd 1945 - J.H.Ashdown Hardware Co. - $55.55\n4. Dated Mar. 26th 1945 - J.E.Chaplin - $55.25\n\nEach of the above are for emergency material or labor for repairs to the Sewage Disposal and Water System at the School.\n\nInvoice No. 1 - This expenditure was incurred after the drain from the kitchen sink refused to function. Every effort was made to clear the drain, without any success, and it was decided to abandon the old drain, which ran underneath the cement floor, and install another above the floor. It was necessary to do this at once.\n\nInvoice No. 2 - This expenditure was for replacement and installation of a new pressure tank for drinking water, the old one having sprung a leak in a number of places through rusting. The walls and bottom of the tank had become so thin that it was useless to try to repair it. A new one had to be purchased at once in order to provide drinking water for the pupils.\n\nInvoice No. 3 - This was for the purchase of a new rotary pump. The main sewer which leads to the disposal tank became clogged, resisting all efforts to dislodge the obstruction. The trouble occurred between the second and third manholes and caused the sewage to back up into the basement of the School. The only possible way to relieve this condition was to pump the sewage from the second manhole and convey it through a pipe above ground and allow it to empty into the third manhole. This necessitated the purchase of a new pump, and like the previous situations, had to be remedied immediately.\n\nInvoice No. 4 - This was for the purchase of new pipes and rods for the deep well from which we obtain practically our entire water supply for the School during the winter months. It became necessary to make some repairs to the cylinder of the pump and to do this the pipes and rods had to be raised to the surface. On close examination it was discovered that many of the pipes were perforated with holes due to rust. The rods were also in a very bad state due to the same cause and it would have been very unwise to continue to use them. It therefore became imperative that we purchase new pipes and rods throughout.\n\nWould you kindly bring these matters to the attention of the Department, with a view to having the expenditures met from...\nemergency funds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. L. Dobbin\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Voucher No. 23 for $183.64 in favour of J.E. Chaplin of Balcarres, and Voucher No. 24 for $33.55 in favour of the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company Limited, Regina, for necessary repairs at the File Hills Indian Residential School. Also enclosed is a letter from Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the school, which outlines the need for the repairs in question.\n\nWhen I visited this school on the 19th ultimo I inspected the repairs referred to and have no hesitation in saying that they were badly needed.\n\nSome reference was made to this matter in my letter of the 26th ultimo reporting on my visit to that school, and while I realize that large expenditures of this kind should be anticipated wherever possible, and so instructed Mr. Dobbin, I would recommend that the vouchers enclosed be paid.\n\nJ.P.B.

The Principal supplies the following information with reference to these expenditures:\n\n\"Each of the above are for emergency material or labour for repairs to the sewage disposal and water system at the school.\n\n\"Invoice No. 1 - This expenditure was incurred after the drain from the kitchen sink refused to function. Every effort was made to clear the drain, without any success, and it was decided to abandon the old drain, which ran underneath the cement floor, and install another above the floor. It was necessary to do this at once.\n\n\"Invoice No. 2 - This expenditure was for replacement and installation of a new pressure tank for drinking water, the old one having sprung a leak in a number of places through rusting. The walls and bottom of the tank had become so thin that it was useless to try to repair it. A new one had to be purchased at once, in order to provide drinking water for the pupils.\n\n\"Invoice No. 3 - This was for the purchase of a new rotary pump. The main sewer which leads to the disposal tank became clogged, resisting all efforts to dislodge the obstruction. The trouble occurred...\"\nbetween the second and third manholes and caused the sewage to back up into the basement of the school. The only possible way to relieve this condition was to pump the sewage from the second manhole and convey it through a pipe above ground and allow it to empty into the third manhole. This necessitated the purchase of a new pump and, like the previous situation, had to be remedied immediately.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nThe coding is as follows: 76 - 653 - 10-691.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\n*June 14, 1945*\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\n*Pile Hills Indian Residential School.*\n\n**VOTE:** 76 **Allotment:** 18-691\n\n**SHIP TO:** L.L.

I am advised by Mr. Dobbin that he has actually expended $7,475.49. I wonder whether it would be possible for the Department to increase the grant to that extent. My personal opinion is that an increase of $470.00 over the estimate, in view of the fact that prices have been very unstable, is not a bad record. The largest amount of the increase is in the furnace. Mr. Dobbin was not able to purchase the type of furnace he had hoped to get. Because of wartime restrictions, he had to purchase what he could get. That made it more expensive.\n\nWe shall be glad if you will give the matter consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRe: File Hills School\n\nJune 22nd,\n1945.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nFile Hills Agency, Balcarres, Sask.

No. 119, July 13, 1945 $3.00\nNational Cartage & Storage Co.\nPaid July 30, 1945 Cheque No. 35407\n\nYou will note that the invoices attached to each of these vouchers are in favor of The Regina Cartage and Storage Company, Limited. The National Cartage and Storage (Regina) Limited under date of Aug. 3, 1945 returned the last two cheques, stating that they have no boiler in storage. The first noted cheque for $6.00 was negotiated; the paid cheque bears a rubber stamp endorsement - for deposit only, to the credit of National Cartage,--Bank of Montreal, Victoria and Albert Branch, Regina, June 28, 1945.\n\nI should be pleased if you would take this matter up with Inspector of Indian Agencies, Mr. Ostrander. In the meantime we are holding the two cheques which were returned by the National Cartage and Storage Limited. It is possible that all three payments were due the Regina Cartage and Storage Co. Ltd.. If so, a refund of the $6.00 payment made to the National Cartage and Storage Co. will be necessary.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nHMG/McN\nOttawa, August 8, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

Under date of August 3, 1945, the last named company returned cheques Nos. 99527 and 35407, stating that they have no boiler in storage.\n\nThe first-noted cheque, namely, No. 60267, was negotiated and bears the following rubber stamp endorsement: \"For deposit only, to the credit of National Cartage, Bank of Montreal, Victoria and Albert Branch, Regina, June 28, 1945.\"\n\nWe are holding the two cheques which have\n\nP.t.o.\nbeen returned by the National Cartage and Storage, Limited, until we receive an explanation from you regarding the matter. It is possible that all three payments were due the Regina Cartage and Storage Company, Limited. If so, it will be necessary to secure a refund of the $6.00 payment covered by cheque 60367 and made to the National Cartage and Storage Company.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Item Description                                                                 | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| only black iron water storage tank 30\" x72\" shell 8/16\", heads 1/4\" Capacity 180 gals. weight 530 lbs. | 1        | 150.00     |       |\n| No. 121 Gurney Cast Iron Heater Capacity 220 gals, Weight 510 lbs.               | 1        | 92.50      |       |\n| 1 1/2\" galv. lip unions                                                          | 2        | 1.80       |       |\n| 8 1 1/2\" elbows                                                                  |          | 3.20       |       |\n| 40 ft. 1 1/2\" pipe                                                               |          | 12.00      |       |\n| 12 asst. \" Nipples                                                               |          | 2.04       |       |\n\nTotal: 261.54\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506A**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: J.E.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter #306-11A enclosing the original and duplicate copy of unnumbered voucher for $282.41 in favour of J.E. Chaplin pertaining to the installation of a boiler and jacket heater at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Chaplin advises that the reason the cost in installing the boiler appears to be high is due to having to dismantle and remove the old boiler, breaking up and removing the cement foundation thereunder, and constructing a new cement foundation for the new boiler which had to be replastered and insulated, as the old plaster and insulation had been broken off, probably in transit from Regina by truck. This work had to be done in addition to connecting the new boiler to the pipe system already installed. He claims that the hours employed in installing the heater and connecting the tank are normal.\n\nFurther detail has been given on the two receipts, amounting to $84.00 and $15.00 respectively. Mr. Dobbin, Principal of the School, has certified as to the receipt of goods, and labour listed on the invoices submitted by Mr. Chaplin.\n\nThe voucher made out by this office is not numbered as it is not entered in our office voucher record, due to authority of the purchase of the new boiler and jacket heater, and the labour in connection being arranged by Ottawa through your office, which would want to voucher and record the accounts pertaining thereto.\n\nEnclosed herewith are the documents referred to herein.\n\nSgd.

The price stated on the requisition form is an estimate of the cost of the venetian type. At the time the requisition was submitted Mr. Chaplin, local hardware merchant, was absent in Winnipeg, and his price on venetian blinds could not be procured.\n\nIt is recommended that the screens and blinds be procured in Regina or some large centre, as delivery from local source is uncertain at present, and the local cost would undoubtedly be much higher.\n\nSgd.

Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of June 28th, 1944, No. 111-1-5, advising that a requisition was being forwarded to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for material for a pig pen at the File Hills Indian Residential School, amounting to $473.85, the Principal of the School is now asking for authority to submit a voucher in connection with the cost of the labour in constructing this building, no authority for the labour having been given him at the time.\n\nThe Principal, Mr. Dobbin, states that the cost of the labour was $233.25 and because of lack of funds he has been unable to pay the whole of this and still owes $178.50 thereon. He states further that when he received authority for the expenditure of $7,000.00 last year for the construction of the new classroom building he had to use $538.94 of the funds of the school, being the difference between the amount allowed and the total cost.\n\nIn view of the heavy expenditure from school funds in order to complete these buildings Mr. Dobbin is now asking for authority to submit a voucher for $178.50 to pay the amount still owing in connection with the labour of constructing the pig pen. I would be glad to have authority granted for this and would ask that Mr. Simpson, the Indian Agent, be so advised at an early date.\n\nJ.F.B.

Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith voucher No. 198 in favour of the Rural Municipality of Tullymet, No. 216, Balcarres, in the amount of $125.00, for the construction of a dug-out at the File Hills Indian Residential School. Also enclosed is copy of a letter received from Mr. S.H. Simpson, the Indian Agent, explaining the reason for proceeding with this work before authority had been actually received.\n\nI may say in this connection that my letter of April 21st, 1945, to which Mr. Simpson refers, was to advise Mr. Simpson of the contents of Department letter of April 16th, 1945, No. 21-111, by which I was given authority to proceed with the construction of the dug-out at the Agency, and advising him that he should expect authority for the dug-out at the school in another letter.\n\nI received no further instructions from the Department with regard to the school dug-out and Mr. Simpson did not again bring the matter to my attention.\n\nThe dug-out at the school is badly needed and its cost was considerably reduced by the fact that the machinery was close to the school making the Indian Agency dug-out. I would therefore recommend that the voucher be paid.\n\nJ.P.B.

It is impossible to procure flooring. The walls of the Hog house were painted last year by the school.\n\nAll these buildings are very badly in need of outside painting. It is recommended that this work be done this year if at all possible in order to save them from further deterioration and additional expense in repair work.\n\nThe price of materials and cost of labour has been quoted by J.E.Chaplin, Hardware Merchant, Balcarres, Sask.,\n\nS.H.Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nBalcarres, Sask., June 27, 1946.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nVOTE... 76 Allotment 10-691\n\nSHIP TO...

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 15th instant, No. 111-1-5 W T 1, in connection with painting of the buildings of the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the third paragraph of your letter the building is very high and we would have to purchase special equipment for the painting.\n\nWhile I am certainly in favour of having the larger boys perform duties which would mean something to them in their training I do not know that I would recommend work of this kind. The scaffolding will be high and even if it is well constructed it would not be constructed entirely safe against the possibility of the boys doing some thoughtless act which might result in a serious fall or injury in some other manner. There is so much criticism by the Indians whenever their boys are asked to perform useful work about the school that I think it is wise to confine their work to work which is at least quite safe.\n\nWe have always avoided having the Indian boys perform any work which might be dangerous and I would recommend that this policy be continued at least during the period in the immediate future and while the question of the management of Indian residential schools is being considered by the Parliamentary Committee.\n\nI would be in favour of having the boys perform some of the labour of painting where they can stand on the ground or not very high on scaffolding but there are many buildings at the File Hills Residential School which are quite high, requiring a considerable amount of scaffolding.\n\nPlease instruct me further in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 7)\nFile Hills Agency,\nBalgonie, Sask.\nJuly 29th, 1946\n\nJ.P.B.Ostrander Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nAttached hereto is Form 37 listing materials and labour required to install wash basins for use of the pupils at the File Hills Residential School.\n\nAll wash basins for use of the pupils are located in the sleeping dormitories on the top floor of the building. Before meals and at other times during the day when use has to be made of these basins, the children have to climb one or two flights of stairs accompanied by their supervisor. It is not always possible for the supervisor to accompany them and at such times the children make play rooms of the dormitories, with consequent damage to furniture, bedding etc. In order that the dormitories may be kept closed during the day, and to avoid unnecessary tramping of dirt along corridors, up two flights of stairs and throughout the dormitories it is recommended that seven of the fourteen basins now in each of the dormitories be removed and installed downstairs.\n\nForm 27 is enclosed herewith pertaining to the following necessary items.\n\n1. The main stringers which support the large main entrance steps to the main school building have rotted and at present are supported by being propped up with pieces of 2\" x 6\" plank, which is considered very unsafe. The flooring of the veranda of the main building is badly worn and is not safe in places.\n\n2. The room occupied by the boy's supervisor is located in a dark corner of the dormitory where the ventilation and lighting is extremely poor. The staff members of the school object strongly to this condition and at times have refused to occupy the room. It is essential that a staff member sleep in a room off the boy's dormitory. A suitable room could be arranged by moving the partition of the present room to an outside wall where the ventilation and lighting is good.\n\n3. When the new class room building was constructed the plans thereof did not provide for a porch over the main entrance door. This door opens outward and it is not possible to make use of a storm door. During cold weather the door becomes badly frosted over, and the consequent swelling of the wood, due to moisture from the frost, prevents proper closing of the door. On windy days it is blown open and has been blown off its hinges twice. It is essential that a porch be constructed.\n\n4. The outside toilet pans are rusted through and require repair. The local Hardware Merchant claims he is unable to procure the galvanized iron required for this purpose. It is thought that possibly this could be done through the priority rights of the Department to materials of this type. If so, it is requested that the material listed on the enclosed Form 37 be shipped as directed thereon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith covering letter from Indian Agent S.H. Simpson and requisitions in connection with needed changes at the File Hills Indian Residential for the purpose of changing the location of the wash basins, repairing the front steps, repairing the verandah floor, moving the Boys' Supervisor's room, and material for toilet cans for outside toilets, also the construction of a porch entrance for the new classroom.\n\nIndian Agent Simpson's letter explains the need of these changes and I would recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe- Your letter #1345-306-11A of Aug. 17/46\nMy letter 176-S.1.A of June 26/46,\nOutside painting File Hills School Buildings.\n\nYour letter advises the acceptance of the tender for material and labour for painting the main school building, namely materials $327.50 and labour $256.00, total $583.50. Also a further expenditure of $250.00 for materials and labour to paint the other school buildings listed on Form 37 attached to my letter of June 26th.\n\nMr. J.R. Chaplin, Hardware Merchant at Balcarres, who submitted the cost of materials and labour now advises that due to the increase in price of paint and oil he is unable to procure these materials at the prices quoted by him last June. Also that he has only now been able to locate a source from which the paint and oil can be procured in the quantities required at the prices listed hereunder which includes the cost of delivery to the building site.\n\n| Item          | Price per gallon |\n|---------------|------------------|\n| Roof Paint    | $2.25            |\n| Red Wall      | $3.10            |\n| White Trim    | $4.20            |\n| Green         | $4.20            |\n| Raw Linseed Oil| $1.80           |\n\nTo paint the main school building it will mean an additional expenditure of $71.25 over and above the $583.50 quoted last June. Also an additional expenditure of $27.65 to purchase the paint and oil for the other buildings.\n\nTotal amount required to purchase materials now, and cost of labour to paint the main building is - $654.75\n\nCost of materials only for the other buildings is - $190.95\n\nTotal amount authorized to expend - $845.68\n\n$835.50\n\n$12.18\n\nMr. Chaplin advises that the company from which he can procure the paint and oil can now make immediate delivery within the next 8 days. Also that his order is subject to cancellation if delivery is not taken within that time.\n\nAs it is getting late in the season to do this type of work satisfactorily, authority is requested to purchase all the materials required and have the work of painting the main building done as soon as the materials arrive.\n\nAuthority is also requested to expend an additional sum of $75.00 in the purchasing of paint brushes and paying for suitable supervision over the older Indian boys who will assist in painting the other six school buildings, providing weather conditions are favourable for them to do this type of work.\n\nS.H. Simpson\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, September 28th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter received from Indian Agent S.H. Simpson in connection with quotations submitted for painting at the File Hills Indian Residential School referred to in Department letters of July 15th and August 1st, 1946, File No. 111-1-5 (W T L).\n\nMr. Simpson's letter explains the situation but I should add that Mr. Chaplin had to wait some time to secure the paint needed for this work and before the paint was received the Wartime Prices and Trade Board had authorized an increase of approximately 10% with the result that Mr. Chaplin now states that he is unable to supply the paint at the quotation given.\n\nUnfortunately the delay resulting will mean that unless authority is granted to proceed at once with the painting, and the paint supplied at the higher rate by Mr. Chaplin, it will probably be too late to get the work done this fall or to get it in the current year's Estimates. I would therefore recommend that Indian Agent Simpson be advised by wire as to the decision of the Department on the matters outlined in his letter.\n\nJ.P.B.

Nov. 6th 1946.\n\nMr. S.H.Simpson,\nIndian Agent,\nFile Hills Agency,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached you will find an account of Mr. S.Lecours, Lebret, Sask. dated Aug. 31st 1944 for $16.00, which is still unpaid. The original bill was wrongly made out, stating that the labour consisted of painting, and was mailed to me for payment. As Mr. Lecours had been engaged in painting at the School on about the same dates I concluded that the account was intended to cover this labour and issued a cheque on the school for payment. Later I received a letter from Mr. Lecours demanding payment for the painting he had done at the School stating that the previous cheque covered the labour he had performed for the Department in repairing and installing eave-troughs. As his bill for painting amounted to only $12.60 and our cheque was for $16.00 I have asked him to refund me the difference, ($3.40) and present the proper bill for eavetroughing to the Department for payment.\n\nAs a result of this misunderstanding over two years have elapsed, but I trust that the Department will see fit to make an adjustment.\n\nI would appreciate very much your attention to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. L. Dobbin\nPrincipal.\nFile Hills,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nNov. 8/46.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq., Regina, Sask.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nRe: Your office letter No. 306-11A, July 6/44,\nMaterials and labour, File Hills Residential School\n\nAttached hereto is a letter dated Nov. 6/46 from Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the File Hills School, pertaining to the attached voucher No. 146 for $16.00 payable to S. Lecours for labour installing eavestroughing.\n\nMy letter No. 129 dated July 8th, 1944, to Mr. Dobbin advised that an expenditure of $29.50 was authorized for labour in this connection. On Nov. 22/44 Voucher No. 134 - $30.00 in favour of D. Bouret of Lebret in payment of labour repairing eavestroughing was submitted and it is presumed was paid.\n\nWhen Mr. Dobbin brought the matter of Mr. Lecour's $16.00 account to my attention on Nov. 6th, I advised him that he had expended the amount authorized in 1934, and I felt that at this late date the Department would not consider payment of labour engaged by him in excess of the authorized amount.\n\nSgd. S.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, November 14th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Voucher No. 146, of the File Hills Agency, in favour of Mr. S. Lecours, of Lebret, Saskatchewan, presumably for work done on the eavestroughing at the File Hills Residential School in June, 1944.\n\nAlso enclosed is copy of a letter from Mr. L.L. Dobbin, the Principal, addressed to Mr. Simpson, the Indian Agent, and a copy of Mr. Simpson's letter addressed to me on the subject.\n\nIt would appear to me that the Department is being asked to pay this account, which is two years old, because of the mistake of Mr. Lecours in the account he originally submitted, and Mr. Dobbin's failure to note the mistake at the time. I would therefore recommend that the matter of the payment of the balance of $16.00 be left to Mr. Lecours and Mr. Dobbin to settle between them as it would appear to me that there was a certain amount of carelessness by both Mr. Lecours, in submitting the account improperly in the first place, and Mr. Dobbin in not making the correction at the time.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nJPBO/ed\nEncl.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, 19 November 1946.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, it is considered that payment of the balance of $16.00 should be left to Mr. Lecours and Mr. Dobbin to settle between them. The Department does not consider that we should pay the account.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNovember 19th, 1946.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn checking through our files we find we have not yet received the signed green Acknowledgment copy of the undermentioned Sales Order(s):\n\nREG NO. 62394 - $60.00 - covering Beds, D.T. P.O. #14339\n\nKindly return this copy to us, signed, as soon as possible as we cannot release the goods listed thereon, until this copy is received.\n\nPER WAR ASSETS CORPORATION\n\nIT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO CANCEL THE ABOVE SALES ORDER IF THE ABOVE ARE NOT RECEIVED BY DECEMBER 5TH, 1946.\nOttawa, 26 November 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn official letter of Nov. 14th, we forwarded to you certain forms received from War Assets Corporation.\n\nWe are now informed that the items mentioned on these forms were ordered by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nPlease let us know what action you have taken with reference to the green copy of this form. Have you forwarded it to War Assets Corporation, Hamilton Building, Regina, and if so, on what date? An immediate reply by airmail would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nMr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal,\nFile Hills Indian Residential School,\nBALCARES, Sask.\nRegina, November 23rd, 1946.\n\nS.H. Simpson, Esq., Indian Agent, BALGARRES, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am returning herewith your voucher No. 141 for the amount of $89.67 for painting at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nOn referring to correspondence in this connection it appears that there was a total of $735.50 originally authorized for this work, subsequently I believe you received authority by telegram from the Department authorizing an increase of approximately 10% in the cost of material. I have not a copy of this telegram but Department letter gives the date as September 30th last.\n\nThe Department assumed from the letter and requisitions originally submitted that Mr. J.E. Chaplin quoted on material and labour. Subsequently authority was given to spend up to $86.00 to pay for supervision of the boys of the school while they were performing such painting as they were able to perform. This complicates matters a little but it would be satisfactory to the Department for the voucher in favour of Mr. Chaplin to be for material and labour, keeping within the amount authorized, in which case it would not be necessary to outline in detail the quantity of paint used. The voucher should merely state the nature of the work performed, namely two coats or one coat of paint, (as the case may be), on certain specified buildings, and the size of the buildings which were painted.\n\nPlease amend this voucher in the manner set out and forward it direct to the Department.\n\nJ.P.B.

Chaplin.\nFile Hills Indian Residential School,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nFeb. 19th. 1947\n\nS.H.Simpson,\nIndian Agent, File Hills Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Simpson;\n\nYou will recall that about a year and a half ago a jacket heater and tank was installed in the furnace room of the school. This was to replace an overhead horizontal tank which was leaking badly from a number of holes eaten out by rust all along the bottom of the tank. After consultation with a plumber who made an examination of the tank it was decided that it was unfit for further use and that a jacket heater would serve our purpose better than the overhead tank which was heated from the furnace and necessitated the keeping on of fires during warm weather, thus keeping the building too warm at this time.\n\nToward the end of the first year of use it was noticed that the tank heater was losing its efficiency and since early last fall it has become increasing difficult to heat sufficient water for the laundry, kitchen and washrooms. For some months it has been necessary to keep all drafts open continually in order to heat the quantity of water required. This condition results in the consumption of approximately a ton of coal per week, and with the coal shortage what it is at present it means that something must be done immediately.\n\nThe solution of the problem as I see it is to remove the old overhead tank and replace it with a new one of the same capacity and connect it up to the furnace as before. During spring, summer and fall when the furnace is not being used, water could then be heated by a jacket heater. Before doing this however, it would be necessary to remove the accumulated encrustation of scale on the inside of the jacket and pipes, if this is possible. Otherwise it would be necessary to procure a new jacket.\n\nThis matter is very urgent and I would greatly appreciate your bringing it to the attention of the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.L. Dobbin,\nPrincipal\n\nAttached you will find a letter from Mr. J.E. Chaplin, Balcarres, giving a quotation on the type of tank we require.\n\nL.L.D.\nJ.P.B. Ostrander Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a letter from Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the File Hills Residential School, also a copy of Mr. J.E. Chaplin's letter to Mr. Dobbin, all pertaining to the hot water system at the school.\n\nAt this time it is not possible to give more information as to the make and type of the water storage tank listed on the attached form 37A, as Mr. Chaplin is absent and will not be returning to Balcarres until about March 6th.\n\nThe present hot water system appears inadequate and very expensive to operate. It will be noticed that if this hot water system ceases to function the school will be without a hot water supply during the time required to make it refuncton.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, February 27th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of letters from Indian Agent Mr. S.H. Simpson, of the File Hills Agency, Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School, and Mr. J.E. Chaplin, Hardware Merchant of Balcarres, together with a requisition for one standard black horizontal hot water storage tank fully equipped, at a cost of $238.10, this price subject to change if Wartime Prices and Trade Board regulations are lifted.\n\nAs the equipment mentioned is badly needed I would recommend that authority be granted and that Mr. S.H.

Simpson, of the File Hills Agency, together with requisitions for repairs to the verandah steps, moving the Boy's Supervisor's room, and repairs to the porch at the main entrance of the new class-room building. All of these matters are necessary and I would recommend that authority be granted as soon as possible.\n\nJ.P.B.

Verandah floor #210.70\n\nAttached hereto is Form 37a listing materials and labour for this purpose which was authorized last year but could not be done due to being unable to procure building materials. The steps are now in very poor repair and should be repaired without delay. It is questionable that flooring will be available for repair to verandah floors.\n\nItem No.2 Moving Boy's Supervisor's Room. $113.60\n\nFunds were not available for this essential requirement last year. It is recommended that if at all possible this work be done during the school holidays, in order that proper supervision of the boys can be given, which is not always possible owing to the poor accommodation for the Supervisor.\n\nItem No.3. Porch for Main Entrance of New Classrooms' Building $194.15\n\nFunds also were not available for this work last year. As explained in my letter of July 1946, no porch was provided for this building when it was constructed in 1945. One is required to protect the present entrance door which during winter weather becomes frosted over, and the moisture from the frost causes it to swell, preventing it from closing properly. On windy days it blows open and has been torn from its hinges twice.\n\nAuthority is requested to purchase the lumber required locally, and the work to be done by Mr. H. Hastie, Contractor, Balcarres. An advance cheque will be required to pay cost of labour.\n\nSubmission of the attached requisitions has been delayed due to being unable to procure the price of lumber until today from the North American Lumber Company, Balcarres, Sask.\n\nMany attempts to procure a price on outside painting of the school buildings has to date been unsuccessful. Requisition will be submitted for this work as soon as possible.\n\nS.H.

You should, however, have an account from the firm in duplicate, reading:\n\n\"To wiring the File Hills Residential School as per instructions received from the Saskatchewan Power Commission and in accordance with our tender of July 3rd, 1947 - - - - - $452.18\".\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe- Agency letter #254-S.l.A., of Aug.13/47\nDelco Light Plant Batteries,\nFile Hills Indian Residential School\n\nThe Principal of the File Hills School informed me today that considerable trouble is being experienced in lighting of buildings at the school due to the condition of the light plant batteries. He has requested that the matter of supplying new batteries be rushed if possible.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nBY AIR MAIL\nFollowing instructions contained in your letter dated August 13th the File Hills Indian Residential School at Balcarres was visited on September 2nd, and the Indian Agent, Mr. Simpson; the Principal, Mr. L. McLean; and the Kitchen Matron were contacted.\n\nIt was discovered during the visit that the only complaints about the water were expressed by the kitchen matron. It was her contention that the water had a disagreeable taste, which made it unfit for drinking, and excessive hardness, which made laundering and washing difficult.\n\nThe water did have a definite taste which was probably due to a high mineral content and the presence of iron compounds. However, to the writer this taste did not appear to make the water unpalatable.\n\nTwo or three commercial chemicals have been tried in an effort to soften the water on a small scale for washing and laundering. In the opinion of the kitchen matron these have not been satisfactory as they are very hard on the hands.\n\nI explained to her that it would be difficult and relatively expensive to remove the taste and the hardness from all of the water. As a substitute I recommended that she try the different commercial products on the market that are sold as softeners so that she could discover the one most suitable for her needs. In this connection I promised to forward a list of the commercial products that are known to me.\n\nDuring the visit the water system was examined and a number of water samples were collected. There appears to be little chance of this water being contaminated, but if the bacteriological reports are unfavourable the school will be revisited and an effort will be made to locate the source of the contamination.\n\nN.J.

Ostrander, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes - File Hills Residential School\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a letter from Messrs. Westeel Products Ltd., Regina, dated Nov. 17th, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIt will be noted that this firm are asking the sum of $128.00 plus board and meals for workmen while installing each fire escape. Evidently this amount includes transportation to and from File Hills School by truck at the going rate of 15\u00a2 per mile. Undoubtedly it would also include pay for time travelling.\n\nIt is felt that this work could be done at much less cost by employing skilled workmen from Balcarres or Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nIn order to install the fire escapes part of the brick walls in the dormitories of the boys and girls will have to be cut out. While this and the work of installing the fire escapes is being done, the rooms will be exposed to the winter weather. The water works in these rooms will also be exposed. It is therefore considered that this work should not be undertaken until spring.\n\nThis type of fire escape is costly. However there is no other type that could be considered safe or suitable in this particular case.\n\nIn the event that it is decided to install Tubular Fire escapes, and funds can be made available for the purchase thereof during the current fiscal year I am attaching hereto Form 37a in triplicate in this connection.\n\n(Sgd) S. H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from Indian Agent, Mr. S. H. Simpson of the File Hills Agency, together with tender and requisition for the installation of 2 fire escapes for the second floor of the main building of the File Hills Indian Residential school.\n\nThis old building would burn very quickly if it caught fire and I am not at all satisfied that the present fire escapes would be sufficient if a fire started at night. I discussed the matter with the Principal and with Mr. Simpson about two months ago, when I visited the school, and asked Mr. Simpson to make enquiries as to a suitable type of fire escape and the cost thereof. The enclosed tender and requisition is the result of Mr. Simpson's efforts in that direction.\n\nMr. Simpson's remarks about the difficulty in installing the new fire escapes in the winter will be noted; I now feel inclined to recommend that installation of the fire escapes be delayed until Spring, in view of the cost and the difficulty of installation at this time.\n\nI discussed with the Principal the need for a very careful and thorough fire drill and he has taken the necessary steps to train the children and the staff towards a speedy exit, with the present escapes, until better escapes can be provided.\n\nJ.

Ostrander Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nI am in receipt of advice from the Principal of the File Hills Residential School that the engine used for pumping water from the dug out to the school buildings is over twenty years old and worn out, and a new one is needed.\n\nThe engine used for crushing grain is also worn out, obsolete, and cannot be used for this work. The engine used for sawing wood is also worn out, and the engine used for pumping the fresh water supply from the well to the school buildings is worn out to such an extent that it barely operates the pump.\n\nIn going into this matter it was decided that the type of engine listed on the attached form 37a mounted on axles could perform all the above mentioned work efficiently, and more economically than to have each of the old engines replaced.\n\nGreat difficulty is being experienced in supplying water to the cisterns in the main building, which has to be pumped thereinto.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Department Letter No. 111-1-13 (W.T.) Dec. 9, 1947,\nto Reverend George Dorey, D.D., File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith duplicate report of Indian Agent Mr. S.H. Simpson, commenting on report of inspection of food services, etc. at the File Hills Indian Residential School. Mr. Simpson's report is quite thorough and his comments in accordance with the facts.\n\nMuch of the additional equipment, particularly that which is power driven, cannot be operated with the present electric power, and, I believe, should not be purchased until the school can be served from the power line which, it is hoped, may be possible within the next year or two. As we have been hoping for this service, I have not recommended that any large expenditure be made for a new power plant at the school.\n\nRegarding the food supplies, Mr. McLean, the Principal, is purchasing carefully and endeavouring to provide a balanced diet for the children. This has been the subject of two discussions with Mr. McLean, and he is certainly making an honest effort to carry out the wishes of the Department and, as near as possible, provide the needs of the children in that direction.\n\nRegarding over-crowding of the school and insufficient dormitory and recreation space, there are actually more children in the school and a larger staff than the size of the school warrants. However, I think it would be a mistake to consider building an addition to the school. An addition to the present building at this time would be a waste of money. It would constitute a dangerous building from the point of view of its fire hazard, further additions resulting in more corridors and more danger in evacuating the children in case of fire. If it is decided that a residential school is to continue to operate to accommodate the children of the File Hills Agency, a new building should be erected near the power line at a site where there is a good permanent supply of suitable water, and the building should be as near fire-proof as possible, with proper facilities for evacuation of the children.\n\nIn the last paragraph of Mr. Simpson's report he makes a recommendation that a Department engineer examine the building for advice before any considerable expenditure is made in the way of plumbing, interior painting, etc. I concur with this recommendation. It should be remembered that the water supply, sewage facilities, and power facilities are all very inadequate, and that the building is dangerous from the point of view of fire.\n\nIn less than a year two residential school buildings in this province have burned. Both were fire traps and in both cases we were fortunate that there was no loss of life. This was because every possible precaution had been taken for evacuation of the children. The File Hills School, the Round Lake School, and the St. Alban's school are all dangerous in this respect, and those responsible for their operation have to be continually on the alert day and night to avoid a great disaster.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe- copy of Departmental Letter 111-1-13(W.F) Dec. 8/47 to Rev. George Dorsey D.D., pertaining to File Hills Indian Residential School, and received by this office.\n\nAs requested I have discussed with Mr. Lean, Principal of the school the \"Report on Inspection of Food Services\" which was attached to the marginally noted copy of the Departmental letter.\n\nSupervision and Training Pupils in Cookery\n\nThe Cook, Mrs. Drake, appears to be an excellent cook, is interested in her work and has the confidence and cooperation of the girls receiving training in the work. She has a staff member assisting her during the hours the various groups of girls are receiving their training which are from 10 A.M. to 12 noon, and from 4:30 P.M. to 7:30 P.M.\n\nFacilities\n\n1. Covering of flooring in dining room. This matter is being referred to later on in the report.\n\n2. Replacement and additions of cooking utensils. Items recommended are on order but are not available at present.\n\n3. Proper dishwashing unit. It appears that an electric operated unit was recommended. The power plant at this building is not strong enough to use electric equipment. There appears to be some doubt as to the advisability of using an electric washer. Apparently stains are left on some of the dishes, and these have to be sorted out and washed by hand. The girls received no training in the method of dishwashing in the home. I examined the dishes in use, and in the cupboards, and found them spotlessly clean.\n\n4. Walk-in refrigerator. The only place to install a refrigeration unit is located the whole length of the building from the kitchen. Due to lack of electric power a gas motor unit would have to be installed. At present ice is used for this purpose.\n\n5. Potato Peeler. It is considered that one is not required under present conditions. In order to procure as much nourishment as possible potatoes are more often than not cooked in their jackets. When not the girls receive instruction how to properly peel and clean them.\n\n6. Bread Slicer. One has been on order for some time, but has not yet been supplied. (Hand operated type)\n\n7. Electric Mixer. Cannot be operated by the present electric power system.\n\n8. Bread Mixer. A hand operated mixer is considered too heavy to do satisfactory work. There is no power to operate an electric one.\n\n9. Rack for drying dish towels. Is on order and will be put into use as soon as received.\n\nSanitation and Hygiene Conditions. Floors and drab appearance of rooms throughout the school. Cost of materials and labour to improve this condition is listed in 1945-49 Estimates and will be requisitioned for in due course.\n\nDishwashing method though awkward appears to be sanitary. To improve the present method, also to improve working conditions, the kitchen would have to be remodelled.\nSanitation and Hygienic Conditions (cont.)\n\nThe matter of procuring a suitable cart for transporting dishes to and from the dining room is being looked into by the Principal of the School.\n\nWater Supply. It is inadequate and not satisfactory. The water from the deep well is very hard. A fair quantity of rain water is procured from the roof of the main building. Eavestroughing should be installed on the new class room building to conserve the rain water therefrom, and another dug out installed adjacent to the school.\n\nUntidy appearance of girls. This condition has been improved.\n\nFood Supplies. Beef, pork, eggs, chickens, butter and milk are supplied in adequate quantities from the school farm. The garden in 1947 was a failure.\n\nMenu Planning. A weekly menu is now being used, whereby adequate and wholesome meals are served.\n\nNutritional Aspects. Use of the following has been increased: liver, cheese, tomato juice and lemons.\n\nFood Preparation, Cookery and Service. The basic 100 quantity receipts supplied to the cooks which had been removed from the school has not yet been replaced.\n\nIt is found that due to the cramped space in the staff and children's dining rooms, it is not possible to serve hot meals without some dishes getting cool. It is expected that when the extra cart for transporting dishes is brought into use, it will eliminate to some extent this condition.\n\nGeneral. The main school building though old appears to be very well constructed, and could be made serve its purpose for many years more by making a number of alterations.\n\nIt is badly in need of interior and exterior painting and repairs to floors, two small ceilings, verandah and steps.\n\nThe 32 volt power plant is heavily loaded. Lighting is very poor throughout all buildings including class rooms.\n\nNo electrical, portable appliances or machinery can be operated. Gas engines have to be employed within the building.\n\nThe whole water works system appears to be worn out, and has rusted through in places. It should be replaced and enlarged. There is only one bath tub for use of about 50 girls, and one for about 50 boys.\n\nThe sleeping dormitories for the pupils are both overcrowded, no space therein is provided to hang or store their wearing apparel, or bedding. Wash basins are installed against the inside wall of each dormitory and in full view.\n\nStaff sleeping quarters are poorly arranged and inadequate. There are not sufficient rooms to employ the extra staff that is required to carry out the programme planned.\n\nThere is no recreational space for pupils or staff. The children are forced to use the stairways and main hall way for this purpose. The staff members have to crowd into the only sitting room in the building or retire to their respective rooms when off duty, with the exception of the Principal and Farming Instructor who are provided with a residence.\n\nThese conditions make it most difficult to procure and retain for any reasonable length of time, the type of employees most suited for this work.\n\nMr. L. McLean, Principal, appears to be a conscientious capable worker, and most anxious to see that this school renders the service for which it is intended.\n\nIt is felt that the present building could be altered and added to, to give the accommodation badly needed, and the necessary equipment installed therein at a cost that would be justified.\n\nI recommend that if possible a Department engineer be obtained to look over this building with this view, and submit a report before any further expenditures of any great extent are made in the way of plumbing, interior painting, repairing floors, ceiling and verandah, or installing a refrigeration plant.\n\nS.J.

Chaplin, Balcarres, for amount of $568.57, which covers paint and oil delivered to the File Hills Indian Residential School for painting of the buildings at the school, according to Mr. Chaplin's contract, a copy of which is also enclosed.\n\nMr. Chaplin's agreement was to supply the paint and oil for the main school building, the hog house, ice house, implement shed, 3 granaries, hen house and brooder house, and to perform the labour necessary for the painting of the main school building. As we contemplate having the other buildings painted by boys of the school, under supervision, in the coming summer, we are not considering Mr. Chaplin's quotation on that part of the labour.\n\nAfter the paint was delivered it was found impossible to have the labour performed on the main building under Mr. Chaplin's contract, because the weather became too severe and he had difficulty in getting the services of men to perform the work. This cannot be completed before the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nAll paint and oil having been delivered at the school in preparation for painting this year, Mr. Chaplin assures Indian Agent, Mr. S. H. Simpson, that he will carry out his part of the agreement to perform the labour in connection with the painting of the main school building at the price quoted, $256.00 for labour.\n\nAs I doubt that the enclosed voucher can be submitted to Treasury and paid in its present form, I am also enclosing a substitute voucher, shown as interim payment on an uncompleted contract, totaling the same amount and leaving a balance of $256.00 to be paid to Mr. Chaplin when his contract is completed by performing the labour of the painting of the main school building.\n\nI trust that payment can now be made of the amount of $568.57 to Mr. Chaplin from the 1946-47 appropriation by using either one of the two vouchers enclosed. If, and when, this is accomplished please advise Mr. Simpson in order that he may destroy his copy of the voucher which is not used.\n\nJ.F.B.

This school is operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada and the buildings have not been painted for several years.\n\nThrough a misunderstanding of correspondence, Mr. Ostrander understood that he had been allowed authority for local purchase in view of the fact that the school management was supplying all the labour without cost to the Department.\n\nThe amount paid for the paint appears reasonable and we would appreciate it if you would issue a purchase order so that the account may be paid.

(RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Departmental telegram dated April 14th from Mr. B.F. Neary advising that account of J.E. Chaplin had been passed to the Treasury, and requesting advice when cheque in payment thereof had been received, Mr. Chaplin advised me by telephone today that he was in receipt of cheque in settlement of his account.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nJ.P.B. Ostrander Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, REGINA, Sask.\n\nRe: Sheet No.3, 503-185, Estimates 1948-49\nLight Plant Engine #545.00 Batteries $800.00\n\nThe Principal of the File Hills Residential School has advised that the old Delco Light Plant Engine at the School is worn out, and that considerable trouble is being experienced in keeping it in operation. Also that it is in constant need of repair, new parts are becoming most difficult to procure, and there is a danger of the plant failing to operate.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a letter from Messrs Greenfield Motors, Balcarres, to which is attached their tender to supply, and install the type of engine and batteries needed to give the required service.\n\nEnclosed is Form 37 listing the requirements in this connection.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Indian Agent Mr. S.H. Simpson, of the File Hills Agency; copy of a letter from Greenfield Motors, of Balcarres; tender of Greenfield Motors; and requisition, Form 37, in connection with the installation of a new lighting plant for the File Hills Indian Residential School, at a cost of $1277.93, less salvage value of the old batteries. Mr. Greenfield does not give a quotation on this. He says he will make an allowance, depending on the unused portion of the batteries at the time the installation of the new ones takes place. I presume it will be only a small amount.\n\nThe lighting plant at the File Hills School has been giving a great deal of trouble for some time. I had delayed recommending a new plant because there seemed to be some hope that we would be able to connect the school with a Hydro at a not far distant date. However, this does not now seem very hopeful, and I would therefore recommend the acceptance of the tender of Greenfield Motors and that instructions be issued for the installation at an early date.\n\nJ.P.B.

It will be noted that Greenfield Motors are offering an allowance of .75\u00a2 per cell for the 16 old batteries and that their prices are subject to change should there be an increase in the cost before the tender is accepted.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. C.A.F. Clarke the matter of the new lighting plant for this school and he concurs with my recommendation that there should be a 110 volt plant as a 32 volt plant is not sufficient for what is expected of the plant at the File Hills Residential School.

We have made a complete check of all buildings, inside and out. The paint needed has been estimated by two leading paint companies, and the labor has been estimated by two leading commercial painters.\n\nWe find all buildings to be very badly in need of paint, in fact we will have to replace many face and siding boards, will also have to do considerable repainting to siding and shingles. The outside of all these buildings with the exception of the classroom, are badly in need checked, and should have been painted some years ago. Most of these buildings will have to be wire brushed before they can be painted. The inside of these buildings, particularly the main buildings, are in bad condition with regard to paint, and also the colors are very drab and dismal for a school.\n\nOur prices are net figures, and the only reason we can quote these prices being we are obtaining special discounts from the paint firms for this contract. Our labor price being the lowest we received from the two leading contractors for this estimate. You will note that we have estimated $80.00 for repairs to the entrance of the main building, and whatever new face boards etc. we have to replace.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe Estimates 1948-49. File Hills Agency. Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a tender for the painting of all buildings at the File Hills Residential School, received from the Greenfield Motors of Balcarres. This work was estimated for in the estimates 1948-49 the total cost being $6484.90, the price submitted by Greenfield Motors is $6945.07, which is a fair price considering that the price that was inserted in the estimates was made practically a year ago.\n\nI would recommend that authority be given as soon as possible so that the work could be started as quickly as possible.\n\nGreenfield Motors agree to use the best paint and labor procurable.\n\nFrank Booth,\nSuperintendent.\nSteam Boiler:\nBoilers O.K. but piping and installation faulty.

(RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWhen Mr. C.A.F. Clarke visited the File Hills Indian Residential School recently the matter of the plumbing was brought to his attention by the Principal of the School, and as a result of their discussion the Principal called in a plumber who works with Greenfield Motors, of Balcarres, to examine and give a quotation on the work required. Herewith enclosed is report of Greenfield Motors, and estimates of some of the cost of the work.\n\nThe plumbing and sewage disposal at the File Hills School has not been in good condition for many years. If this school is to continue to operate it will certainly have to have considerable improvement in that system.\n\nThe estimates enclosed total $7,315.25 without any quotations on the sewage disposal plant. In my opinion the sewage disposal plant is the most important of the whole work and is likely to be found very costly. It would appear that in an effort to avoid having the disposal field below the school, where the water supply for the livestock and the school well are situated, the disposal field has been installed in the other direction, toward higher ground. I believe that the disposal field should be toward the lower ground, but if that is done certainly another well to supply water to the school appears a necessity. What the new disposal field and well would cost, it is almost impossible to estimate, but I would not be surprised if the figure given above would be more than doubled.\n\nWith this in mind, and a considerable doubt in my mind that a residential school is a necessity at the present site of the File Hills School, I have hesitated about making any definite recommendation pending the recommendation of the Joint Committee and the decision of Parliament on the matter of continuing the operation of a residential school to serve reserves such as the File Hills reserves, where conditions suggest day schools to me.\n\nThere is a two-classroom school on the site of the File Hills Indian Residential School which could be used as a day school by providing transportation for the children, perhaps at an average distance of six miles. The cost of renewing the plumbing and sewage at the File Hills Indian Residential School would pay for a lot of transportation of Indian pupils to a day school. Certainly the present location of this classroom building is not ideal to be operated as a day school to serve the children of that area, but, by providing transportation, it could serve for a few years until the cost of building two or three other day schools in proper locations would be a great deal less.\n\nMany of the homes of that area from which children are sent to the File Hills Indian Residential School are good Indian homes whose parents should be expected to do something toward their education, with the assistance they now receive from family allowances. I believe also that many of the parents would be very pleased to do so.\n\nI believe this matter should receive serious consideration by our Branch as to policy, and, if it is decided to continue operating the File Hills Indian Residential School, an engineer should be sent there to thoroughly examine the situation before anything is done about the enclosed estimate. Certainly a very important factor in carrying out this work has not been estimated upon at all. This is with regard to the sewage disposal plant. Consequently our own engineer should be asked to do some figuring on that part of the work before a decision is made.\n\nJ.P.B.

It will probably be many years before the roads in that area are suitable for year round use of motor transport. With school commencing the 1st of September, and the roads usually closing for motor transport any time after the middle of October, not re-opening again until the month of May, the investment cost of motor transport to serve our purpose would be prohibitive.\n\nIt is my opinion that there should be two Indians hired with driving teams and that each be supplied with a wheel vehicle and a bob sleigh, with a suitable covered cabin which could be used on either the wheels or the bob sleigh. This cabin should be provided with a wood heater for cold weather. The cost of operation of the two outfits should not exceed $3,000.00 a year, and two dependable Indians would be glad to have the employment.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nColonel E.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Repairs and Alterations at File Hills School\n\nIn the absence of Dr. Dorey I am taking the liberty of presenting some matters which were drawn to my attention during my recent visit in Saskatchewan.\n\nA year ago we appointed Mr. Lachlan McLean as Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School. Mr. McLean's first year of work can be very highly commended but in order that he may successfully carry on there are very necessary improvements which need to be given attention. These matters have been discussed with the Indian Agent and have, no doubt, come to you from your Saskatchewan representative, but I should like to assure you that if we are going to maintain the high standard of work which has been previously done there is great need for these expenditures:\n\n1) A complete new water system. When I visited the school two years ago I urged our Principal at that time to have new bathroom equipment installed, new floors in the rooms used, and all the pipes replaced. There was also a need for wash rooms in the basement or on the first floor in order that the children might not have to return to the dormitories to wash up for meals;\n\n2) The Play-Rooms - are very badly in need of new floors and the battleship linoleum covering the halls is worn through and needs replacing immediately;\n\n3) Re-arrangement of Basement rooms - If you have ever been in this school you will recall that the cook walks approximately 75 feet from the kitchen to the supply room for her groceries, therefore, the re-arrangement of the basement rooms and the provision of more space for play-rooms is urgently needed;\n\n4) A new lighting system - should be installed, and while I was at the school an engineer arrived to make some arrangements about the water system which again you may remember is pumped from a slough but a new dug-out is necessary in order that sufficient pressure may be obtained;\nColonel Neary - 2 -\n\n5) Re. Painting - Looking at the fine condition of the buildings at the Agency and then the drab appearance of our school buildings we were agreed that a general paint job is also necessary and desirable.\n\nConsidering the amount of work involved, $12,000.00 does not seem a large sum for these expenditures and I can assure you that Mr. McLean will use every dollar to advantage.\n\nRe. Agency Houses\n\nWith the difficulty in securing staff it has now become apparent that we must employ married men and with only one residence for assistants it is sometimes difficult to make suitable living accommodation for the type of staff which may be secured. Since the Agency will now have two vacant houses Mr. McLean is very anxious that these houses may be moved sufficiently close to the school to be used for the employees. When this matter comes to your attention may I assure you that there is a definite need for the establishment of these buildings as employee houses.\n\nI had a most satisfactory visit in Fule Hills where I found the children extremely friendly, in good physical condition and in great glee because of their anticipated return home.\n\nWith my kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. C. Maxwell Loveys\nHome Mission Executive Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have also requested them to secure the lighting plant and batteries which were recommended by Regional Supervisor Ostrander.\n\nMr. Ostrander also forwarded to us a copy of quotation which he had received from Greenfield Motors for very extensive repairs at the school. Acceptance of the quotation would involve an expenditure of upwards of $5,000.00. We have not provided this amount in the current year's appropriation and consequently are unable to consider that particular tender.\n\nWe would like to have a separate tender for each of the following:\n\n(1) Boys' Dormitory.\n   (a) Supply and install one single stall metal shower.\n   (b) Reset bath tub\n   (c) Recondition wash basins with minimum of new parts.\n(2) Girls' Dormitory\n\n(a) Recondition sinks with minimum of new parts.\n\n(b) Supply and install one single stall metal shower.\n\n(3) Laundry.\n\nMake minor repairs that would enable machinery to be satisfactorily operated for another year or so.\n\nWith reference to painting the building, we understand that the paint is still available at the school, but you have not submitted a quotation for the labour.

Boilers require a blow down tank and blow down valves so that boilers may be cleaned. This boiler must not be put into operation until the above work is completed and notice of such forwarded to this Department. These boilers should be replaced by a modern stoker unit.\"\n\nAt the request of the then Indian Agent, Mr. S.H. Simpson, a tender was received from Greenfield Motors dated June 4th, 1948, for the following:\n\n\"Supply and install blow off tank and valves, all pipes and fittings, to renew return lines from end of mains to boilers and install equalizers in each boiler. Complete cost of labour and material $797.60.\"\n\nThis was one of the many expenditures necessary to put the File Hills Residential School in reasonably good working order, which resulted in my decision to write my letter of June 15th, 1948, File 1094-311-11 A.U., in which I questioned the wisdom of incurring large expenditures at that school and mentioned that consideration might be given to replacing the residential school by one or more day schools. I have received Department letter dated June 19th, 1948, File 111-1-5 (E.1), to the effect that the File Hills Residential School will operate for at least another academic year.\n\nIn view of the fact that the boiler, in its present condition, has been condemned, it is very necessary that authority be given at once to have the repairs completed on the boiler before the school opens, or as soon as possible thereafter. Mr. Booth has recently spoken to Greenfield Motors in connection with their tender, as mentioned above. The completed work on which they have tendered will no doubt meet the requirements of the boiler inspector's order. Mr. Greenfield is prepared to make the installation at the price he quoted on July 4th, 1948.\n\nMr. Booth has received authority from the Department under letter dated July 21st, 1948, File 111-1-5 (E.1), to proceed with certain minor repairs and additions, and this work will proceed. The work on the boiler, as mentioned before, is even more urgent.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Booth be authorized by telegram to instruct Greenfield Motors to proceed at once with the work.\n\nJ.P.B.

This report is dated July 10th, 1948 and is completed by the Inspector of Steam Boilers, Department of Labour. It reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Install an equalizer pipe and new return water pipe. Boilers require a blow down tank and blow down valves so that boilers can be cleaned. This boiler must not be put into operation until the above work is completed and notice of such forwarded to this Department. These boilers should be replaced by a modern stoker unit.\"\n\nWe have also received a tender from Greenfield Motors Limited, Balcarres, Saskatchewan for the following repairs:\n\n\"Supply and install blow off tank and valves, all pipes and fittings, to renew return lines from end of mains to boilers and install equalizers in each boiler. Complete cost of labour and material $797.60\".\n\nMr. Regional Supervisor Ostrander has made the following comments concerning these needed repairs:\n\"In view of the fact that the boiler, in its present condition, has been condemned, it is very necessary that authority be given at once to have the repairs completed on the boiler before the school opens, or as soon as possible thereafter. Mr. Booth has recently spoken to Greenfield Motors in connection with their tender, as mentioned above. The completed work on which they are tendering will no doubt meet the requirements of the boiler inspector's order. Mr. Greenfield is prepared to make the installation at the price he quoted on July 4th, 1948.\"\n\nIt is recommended that authority be given to accept the tender of Greenfield Motors Limited for the repairs required at this school, to the amount of $970.60.\n\nAPPROVED\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 19, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nFile Hills Residential School\n\n(1) REPAIRS:\n\nBy now you will have received an Army Signal concerning the boiler repairs and the purchase of the lighting plant required at the above residential school.\n\nThe Minister has approved the acceptance of the tender of Greenfield Motors Limited, to the amount of $797.60 to carry out the repairs as listed in their tender of June 4th, 1948.\n\nYesterday we mailed a copy of purchase order 33063 covering the purchase of a lighting plant and a set of batteries from Greenfield Motors Limited.\n\n(2) FUTURE POLICY WITH REGARD TO THE OPERATION OF THIS SCHOOL:\n\nTwo days ago, Dr. Dorsey of the United Church of Canada visited this office. The contents of your letter of June 15th was discussed with him at some length and while not committing himself fully, it seems fairly evident that he is in agreement with the replacement of this residential school by day schools.\n\nMajor Clark was also present at the discussion and he too is in agreement with your recommendation. It\nis understood that the two class room school block now on the site of the residential school could be used as a day school, providing transportation for the children could be arranged. It was, therefore, agreed that Major Clark would visit the school this fall and go over the roads thoroughly and decide whether bus transportation is feasible. It would be appreciated if efforts could be made to improve the roads selected to the extent required for them to be used by a heavy school bus. Our experiences with such transportation in Ontario have convinced us that good roads are essential for the provision of adequate school bus transportation.\n\nI also understand that another day school would be required on this reserve near the File Hills colony. Would it be possible to have arrangements made for the school children at the File Hills colony to be admitted to the provincial school at Lerlie?\n\nTo summarize, therefore -\n\n(1) File Hills Residential School will be operated as a residential school during the 1948-49 academic year.\n\n(2) A thorough survey will be completed to decide what day school facilities can be provided to replace this residential school during the 1949-50 academic year.\n\n(3) Before the closing of this residential school is authorized, adequate educational facilities must be ready to provide for the continuance of the education of these children. In other words, we cannot close the residential school until the day schools required are complete and bus transportation is provided.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. McLean of the File Hills Residential School failed to notify us of the change of price of this article. He received notification from the Winnipeg Cabinet Company on August 31, advising him of the change in price.\n\nI was under the impression that this dish truck would cost only $95.00 until the invoice came in for $105.00.

The property on which the buildings are situated is deeded in the Department's name, and it is this property I wish to fence, with an additional 75 or 100 yds added to the north boundary, where the road passes through to the Agency. I had hoped to put off this work for another year, but this would be a great inconvenience, and if it is possible to do it this year, I should be very glad. Some of the work can be done by the boys. The fence should be made of barbless square mesh wire with cedar posts, in fact the same kind of a fence as was built around the school garden with the exception of the top rail, which will not be required. The estimated cost of the whole fence will be about $350.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 22, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the fencing of the grounds at the File Hills Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase the material and have this fence erected at a cost of approximately $350.00. The school authorities should supply some of the necessary labour and the material should be purchased by you at the best possible prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nRecently, the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church received a request from their leaders in Saskatchewan for $1500, with which to clear 100 acres of land in the vicinity of File Hills, that is now the property of our Church and that is being used in connection with the File Hills work.\n\nOur W.M.S. have 420 acres. 70 acres of this is under cultivation. Of this 70 acres, 48 have been cropped in wheat and oats and have been worked for years without rest. 10 acres is used for potatoes and the remainder is practically useless owing to timber and potholes. The fuel for the school has always been taken from this property.\n\nThe proposal now made is that 100 acres of the 420 shall be cleared. It appears that there is a man nearby who has a machine and is willing to do this work at $15.00 per acre, which will mean in all, $1500. I understand that Mr. Graham and Mr. Rhodes met in conference with the W.M.S. representatives in Regina, before this request was made, so it is quite evident that Mr. Graham approves the suggestion.\n\nThe matter has been taken up by the Board of the W.M.S. and as the Society has no money to apply on this work, it was decided to ask the Government to vote $1500 for the purpose. If the Department is not willing to expend money on land that does not belong to the Government, then the W.M.S. will be willing to sell the 100 acres at a very reasonable price. Or, they will be willing to sell the 420 acres, if the Government would prefer to take the whole farm.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply, believe me\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/HC\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., D.Litt., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nRe- File Hills\n\nOn Feb. 3rd, I wrote you recommending that the Government set apart $1500. to be used in clearing one hundred acres of land in the vicinity of the File Hills School. As yet we have not had a reply. I take it that you are consulting your representatives in the West.\n\nIf it is not asking too much, we would appreciate an answer before the Annual Meeting of our Board, which will begin its sessions March the 19th. At that time, our representatives from Saskatchewan will be here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/HG\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have postponed answering your first communication, until such time as certain information was to hand, and until a decision was reached as to the advisability of presenting supplementary estimates for Indian Education to Parliament.\n\nIn reply I have to state that it is not the intention to ask Parliament for an appropriation additional to our main estimates, at this time, and I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your suggestion at present.\n\nI am communicating further with our western representatives, and, at a later date, I hope to make a proposal relative to the land in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH.

Certain records have been lost, or mislaid, and the Department desires information concerning the school land.\n\nI understand that the East \u00a7 of Sec. 32, Tp. 22, Rge. 11, W. 2 M. is owned by the Presbyterian Church. That portion of Section 33 which is outside of the Indian reserve and on which the school is situated was, I understand, given by the Presbyterian Church authorities to the Department, in 1910, when the present school was erected.\n\nI have learned that 70 acres is under cultivation. I should be pleased if you would mark, roughly, on one of the blue prints the location of this 70 acres and return it to the Department. Further, in conjunction with Mr. Rhodes, please indicate the location of the 100 acres which it would be advisable to clear. I have learned that Mr. Rhodes met Woman's Missionary Society representatives in Regina, in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. L.

This Department understands that, in 1906, you acquired the West \u00a7 of Section 32, Tp. 22, Rge. 11 W. 2 M. and all that portion of Section 33 lying outside of the Okanase Indian Reserve. After a study of our files which, in this connection, are incomplete, or have been mislaid, I understand that fractional section 33, comprising 101.95 acres, was conveyed to the Department of Indian Affairs for educational purposes, when the new boarding school was erected in 1910.\n\nYour letter states that the W. M. S. have 420 acres. Should not this read 320, or the East \u00a7 of Section 32? Further, would you mark on the enclosed blue print the approximate location of the 100 acres which should be cleared, and return the same to the Department at your convenience.\n\nThis Department would be grateful for a copy of any instrument of conveyance that was given by your W. M. S. to the Department of Indian Affairs in 1910, when the present boarding school was erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Harrison, D.

(RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-9, part 1)\nSir,\n\nThe Department applied to the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church for a deed of the fractional part of Section 35 Township 28, Range 11 west of the 2nd Meridian, on which the new File Hills Boarding School is situated. The Church authorities, however, do not wish to transfer to the Department the whole of this piece of land, which contains about 100 acres, but state that they are quite willing to hand over five or ten acres, whatever may be necessary for the site of the building. The Department wishes, therefore, to obtain a piece of this land containing not less than 10 acres, but before a deed is prepared a description of the site is required. I have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to choose the site. It would be well for you to make a sketch showing the location of the buildings and the measurements of the lot, which will have to be described by metes and bounds. You should also show the distance from the corner of the quarter section. It is thought that the school site, which must embrace ten acres, should extend across the lot and touch the lake and road allowance. You are sent, under separate cover, a map of the township for your guidance. This you will be good enough to return to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\n(Signed) J.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter III-1-9, dated the 13th instant, I am returning herewith blue prints showing the location of the land already cultivated by the File Hills Boarding School and the land that it is proposed to bring under cultivation.\n\nWith regard to the ownership of the East half of Section 32, Township 22, Range 11, West of the Second Meridian and the fractional part of Section 33, which is outside of the Indian Reserve, I always understood that the whole of this land belonged to the Presbyterian Church, with the exception of 10 acres on which the School buildings stand. I have searched through our files and a letter from you to Commissioner W.M. Graham, dated Oct. 5th, 1910, a copy of which I am attaching hereto, would seem to indicate that only 10 acres were transferred to the Department. I may say that I can find no answer to your letter on our files so I am not quite sure whether the transfer of this land actually took place. I could however, get a copy of title from the Land Titles Office if the Department thinks it necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A copy of our letter of October 5th, 1910, to Mr. Commissioner Graham regarding the transfer of the 10 acres on which the school is located was also received.\n\nIn reply I beg to thank you for the trouble you have taken in this matter, and to inform you that it will not be necessary to obtain a copy of title from the Land Titles Office at the present time regarding this transfer.\n\nYou obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Edmison, D.D.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nWhen in Toronto you asked me to locate the 100 acres of our land at File Hills which should be broken in order to give a better opportunity to carry on farming operations in connection with our Boarding School there, in accordance with the request of J.D. McLean, Deputy and Secretary of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nI had a conference with Commissioner Graham today about this matter. He knows the land well. He says that the 100 should be broken on the South East quarter of 32, tp.22, R.11, w 2M, or almost wholly so. He is of opinion that a survey should be made when the contractor is ready to begin work. A good deal of this land is covered with scrub and some of it heavier than other parts. If it is imperative that 100 acres be named, I would recommend that it be described as follows: Starting at the S.E. corner of the S.E. quarter of 32.22.11, follow along the southern boundary of said quarter section 100 rods, then north 160 rods, then east 100 rods, then south 160 rods to the place of starting - 100 acres. Our present land now under cultivation is in small patches of 4 and 5 acres here and there, over this part of our farm. These patches were fairly free of scrub when broken.\n\nI am, yours sincerely,\n\nSgd.- Peter Strang.\nDuncan C.

Mr. Strang, of Regina, relative to the location of the land at the File Hills Indian Boarding School which should be cleared for farming operations.\n\nCertain information concerning the area of the school site is desired, before a decision is reached in this connection. As you were informed in official communication of this file number, dated the 13th ultimo, one of our files has been lost, and I should be grateful for a copy of any instrument of conveyance that was given by your W.

J.H.Edmison, D.D.,\nConfederation Life Bldg.,\nCity.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nMrs. Clark has handed over to me, as Secretary of the Property Committee of our Board, the copy of letter sent you by the Department on March 13th in this connection.\n\nFrom correspondence and files it would appear that the Board of Trustees holds in trust for our Society 415.35 acres of land in connection with this School. I am enclosing sketch of property showing different parcels of land. The N.E. 1/4 sec of 32 together with the fractional part of Sec. 33 was purchased from the Government at the rate of $3 per acre - total acreage 253.35 - costing $760.05. This transaction took place in 1906. The S.E. 1/4 sec of 32 was a free gift from the Government and had been homesteaded previously by Mr. Gordon on our behalf. According to the Land Titles Office in Regina the fractional section 33 which the Department understands was conveyed to them in 1910 is still vested in the Board of Trustees as the Abstract of Title which I recently filed with Dr. Laird's office will show. This is our authority for believing that the land was never conveyed to the Department and I suppose is considered the authority.\n\nTrusting that this information will be of service,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Signed) (Mrs. J.E.)

Society (253.35 acres) at $3 per acre - $760.05 in the year 1906. In addition to this S.E. 1/4 section 32 was homesteaded by Mr. Gordon for the use of the school. In our minutes of March 19th, 1907 this 1/4 section was legally transferred by the Govt. to our Society. I have also conferred with my predecessor in office and she has no knowledge of any transfer of land made by our Society to the Govt. Our W.M.S. recognize that the Govt. should own the land upon which the new school was built in 1910 and would be willing to deal liberally with the Govt. as we think they should own all land in connection with our Indian Schools.\n\nKindly confer with the Dept. on this matter at an early date, and oblige,\n\n(Signed) Adelaide Clark,\nInd.

I note that there was apparently no transfer to the Department, of any of the land owned by the Presbyterian Church at this school, at the time the new building was erected.\n\nReferring to your communication of March 3rd, last, in which you asked the Department to clear 100 acres, it is my suggestion that we make a transfer at a nominal sum, the S.E. quarter of section 32, Tp. 22, Rge. 11, W. 2. This particular quarter section was, I believe, acquired by the Church at practically no cost, by completing homestead duties. I understand from local officials that the whole of the 100 acres in question lies in this quarter. Following this proposed transfer, I shall endeavour to arrange for an appropriation for the proper clearing of the 100 acres or more, in 1924.\n\nFurther, as the present school buildings stand upon property owned by the Presbyterian Church, I should be pleased if you would make arrangements with the W.M.S. for the transfer, also for a nominal sum, of fractional section 33 - that portion of the section lying outside of the Okanese Reserve.

The acreage involved in these two parcels is about 262 acres. In addition our Society holds the N.E. 1/4 Sec. 32 and the recommendation of our Executive Board is as follows:\n\n\"That we offer to sell for a nominal sum to the Department of Indian Affairs all the land we hold in connection with the File Hills I.B.S. comprising about 415 acres, the matter to be considered with the Board of Trustees of the Church\".\n\nMrs. Clark has in the past secured valuations of this land and the lowest valuation was $15 per acre. We have to remember of course, that the total cost of the land to our Society was $760\u2014the amount paid for the N.E. 1/4 Sec. of 32, and the fraction of Sec. 33 totalling 253.35 acres at the rate of $3 per acre. The S.E. 1/4 sec. of Sec. 32 was a free gift by the Government. We should like advice as to what should be considered a nominal sum and also as to what the procedure is in connection with taking the matter up with the Board of Trustees.\n\nWhile the Government only suggests the purchase of the two parcels it would seem unwise on our part to retain the other 151 acres of land, hence our suggestion that the Department take over the whole property.\"\nMr. D.

S. and the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church would consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. The transfer of the S. E. \u00bc Sec. 32, Tp. 22, Rge. 11, W. 2, comprising 160 acres, which was a free gift from the Government, for the nominal sum of $1.00;\n\n2. The transfer of fractional W. \u00bc Sec. 33, comprising 253.35 acres, on which the present school buildings stand, and which should have been transferred to us when the main building was erected in 1910, for the nominal sum of $1.00;\n\n3. The transfer of the N. E. \u00bc Sec. 32, comprising 151.42 acres, for the more or less nominal sum of $1514.20.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J.

General,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have yours of July 12th re the purchase by the Government of the W. M. S. property at File Hills. There seems to be some misunderstanding. The facts are as follows:\n\n1. Our W. M. S. own the S. E. 1/4 Sec. of 32, Tp. 22, Rangell W.E., comprising 160 acres. You speak of this as a free gift from the Government. While this was referred to as a free gift by Mrs. Jones in her letter of May 17th, copy of which I sent you, this is a little misleading. This quarter section was homesteaded by a friend of our Principal, now Mrs. Motherwell and was later transferred to our Women's missionary Society with the approval of the Government. Homestead duties were done according to law. This seems to me as a little different from a free gift and the W. M. S. should be entitled to any increase in value, as property homesteaded by any private individual.\n\nThe other property owned by the W. M. S. is the West half of Sec. 33 comprising 253.35 acres for which they paid $3 per acre or $760.65. Mrs. Clark informs me that their Society through their Solicitor Dr. Hamilton Cassels, appealed to the Government at different times for a free gift. This was not allowed however, and they were obliged to pay $3 per acre. In the judgment of the W. M. S. it is worth more today either to the church or Department.\n\nThe N. E. 1/4 Sec. of 32, comprising 151.42 acres referred to in your letter of the 13th is included in this 253.35 acres. From this you will see that the W. M. S. own in all only 412.35. They feel that they should get at least $3,000. for this property.\n\nKindly let me know if the Department is prepared to buy at this price.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nIndian Affairs.

The item has been noted.\n\nFile Hills, Sask.\n\nThis school has been well taken care of in 1925 and is a credit to our Government schools. $2,000 should be spent in clearing more land which would aid very materially in the self support of this school.\nSir:\n\nWill you please advise me if any appropriation has been set aside to provide for the clearing of additional land at the File Hills Indian Residential School to enable the management to increase the area of their farming operations.\n\nThis matter has been under review for some considerable time, and if an appropriation has been made I should be advised as operations should be commenced almost immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 21, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nThere is an item of $1,500 in the Estimates for clearing additional land at the File Hills Indian Residential School. Mr. Commissioner Graham writes, asking if there is an appropriation for this purpose as the work, if to be undertaken, should be commenced immediately. I wish to recommend that $1,000 be allowed for this purpose and that the Commissioner be asked to undertake the activity on a day labour basis, using Indians.\n\nRussell Harrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 21st, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 306-11 A of the 17th instant, requesting to be advised as to whether an appropriation can be allowed for the purpose of clearing additional land at the File Hills Indian Residential School in order that the management can increase the area of their farming operations.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $1,000 for this purpose. You should arrange to have the work undertaken on a day labour basis, using Indian labour as far as possible. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, of the labour employed should be kept. These should be certified in the usual manner.\n\nI regret we will be unable to make an advance to pay wages at the present time. It is expected, however, that additional money will be voted shortly and will be available early next month, and if you should require an advance to pay the labour the same will be sent upon request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant #111-1-9, authorizing me to clear additional land at the File Hills School, at a cost not exceeding $1000.\n\nI regret to note that the work is to be undertaken on a day labour basis with Indian labour as far as possible. This is quite unsatisfactory; a man can put in weeks and show very little for it on a day labour basis, unless you get a first-class man, and it is hard to check them up. I think you should let this rest with me as to how the work should be carried out. I will do the best I can in the most practical way for the Department and the amount will not be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 306-11A of the 29th ultimo, relative to the carrying out of the work in connection with the clearing of additional land at the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that you may arrange to have the work carried out in the manner considered by you to be the most practical and satisfactory. It was in order that the Indians might have an opportunity to earn some money that the instructions contained in our letter to you of the 21st ultimo were given that the work be undertaken on a day labour basis, using Indian labour as far as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nOn the 21st April last, your letter No. 111-1-9, you granted me authority to expend $1000.00 in clearing land at the File Hills Boarding School. I was unable to get this work done during the summer as it was most difficult to get men to do this kind of work, owing to the fact that it requires men with some experience. I had made arrangements to have the work done by a certain party in July, but he failed me, and when harvesting operations came on it was impossible to get men unless we paid them $7.00 or $8.00 a day, which I did not think it wise to do. I was hoping to get some of the heavier scrub out this winter, but the snow has been very deep and it would only be a waste of money to attempt this work.\n\nI write to let you know that this $1000.00 will be available for the current year's expenses, and would ask you to have a similar amount placed at my disposal next Spring.\n\nI was not able to get as much scrubbing done at the Gordon School in the Touchwood Agency as I should have liked. So far about $200.00 of the amount of $300.00 allowed for this work has been made use of, and I should be glad if I could have $100 or $150.00 additional for this purpose out of next year's appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 11, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your 306-11A of the 4th instant which is relative to clearing at the Gordon Indian Residential School. In the spring, you may expend a further sum of $150 for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nKindly send me an accountable advance cheque of $1000.00 for clearing land at the File Hills School, and also cheque for $500.00 for labour in connection with new soft water system and Buildings at the same school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

The boy was born to her before her marriage to Dubois, and after this took place she evidently gave the child to her mother, Mrs. John Shingoose, but I cannot tell if any papers were drawn up or not.\n\nMrs. John Shingoose is willing to have the boy transferred to the File Hills school and has made a statement to that effect which I enclose herewith.\n\nThe boy is now 11 years of age, and of course if transferred to File Hills School, would be able to spend his holidays with his mother, with practically no expense to the Department. At the present time both he and his grandmother are staying with Mrs. Emile Dubois, and if the transfer could be arranged, it would cost the Department nothing to have him taken to the File Hills school, otherwise his fare would have to be paid back to Birtle.\n\nIt would seem to me that the request is very reasonable, and I would ask the Department to give it favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 31st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, requesting the transfer of \"Duncan Shingoose\" from the Birtle Residential School to the File Hills Residential School.\n\nA review of the June quarter return of the Birtle School does not show a boy by the name of \"Duncan Shingoose\". There is on this return the name of \"Douglas Robert Shingoose\" from the Cote Reserve. This may be the boy to whom you refer.\n\nI am writing to the Indian Agent at Birtle to interview the Principal of the Birtle School in connection with your application and, on receipt of his reply, you will be further advised. It might be well, also, for you to write to Mr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. Sutherland.\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. S.

A review of the June quarter return of the Birtle School does not show a boy named \"Duncan Shingoose\". There is, however, a boy named \"Douglas Robert Shingoose\" of the Cote Band.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Davis states that the Shingoose boy was placed in the Birtle School by his grandmother, Mrs. John Shingoose, and that both this woman and her daughter, Mrs. Emile Dubois, who is the boy's mother, now wish the boy to be placed in the File Hills School, which is closer to the mother's residence. I am asking Mr. Davis to also communicate with you regarding this matter.\n\nPlease interview the Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School and advise the Department if he has any objections to granting this transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nwould, I think, take the form of punishment and in view of the boy's low mentality I would not advise sending him to jail. In order to send the boy to the Detention Home it would be necessary to bring him before the Judge of the Juvenile Court for sentence. This would entail more or less expense which I know the Department are anxious to avoid if we can meet the situation and mete out adequate punishment by other means.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform the Department that John Archie Squatipew, aged 14 years, a pupil of the File Hills School, placed a quantity of paper and wood on the pipes at the back of the furnace in the school where it would have ignited if a big fire had been made. He also placed some paper and wood on the floor underneath the pipes so that the burning embers would fall and set fire to the paper on the floor. The Engineer discovered what had been done almost immediately after the boy had left the furnace room, and the Principal informs me that on questioning the boy he admitted that he was going to try and burn down the school so that they could get a holiday. There was really very little danger of this doing damage even had his plan worked out, as there is a cement wall and metallic ceiling and no refuse is left lying around. However the intent was there and Mr. Rhodes, the Principal, punished the boy by giving him a strapping on his hands.\n\nThis boy is of very low mentality; as a matter of fact he cannot be considered normal. The Principal feels very strongly that he should receive further punishment and suggested that he be sent to the Detention Home in Regina as an example to the others. I have received a strong plea for leniency from the Agent. It appears that the aged parents of this boy are taking the matter very much to heart, as they feel that he is not altogether responsible, and I would be glad to have the Department's views in the matter.\n\nPersonally, I feel that discharging him and sending him home would not meet the situation. In fact it might act as an incentive to other boys to attempt the same thing in order to bring about their discharge from the school. My suggestion is that the boy be sent to either Round Lake, Gordon's, or Elkhorn Schools for a month or two and then discharged if thought advisable. This\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 306-11B of the 27th ultimo, regarding John Archie Squatipew, a pupil of the File Hills Indian Residential School. The Department does not consider it advisable to send this boy to any of the residential schools mentioned in your letter without first laying all the facts in his case before the Principal and receiving his approval. You should, therefore, communicate with the Principals of the Round Lake, Gordon's and Elkhorn Schools and, if any one of them is willing to accept the boy for a limited time, the Department approves of your making the transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Ont.\n\nRe #181 Walter Shingoose.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe above mentioned pupil of this School was admitted as a grant earning pupil on Sept 28th 1932.\n\nThis boy is a former pupil of the Cote Bay School and after completing Grade 5 work did not return to the School for further tuition. I had a talk with this boy last August and he consented to attend here to continue his education.\n\nThis boy truanted from this School on December 1st and is now at his home on the Cote Reserve.

Approximately 2:40 p.m. of this date, P.G. LAZENBY, the agent for the Indian Reserve of Birtle, Manitoba called at this detachment and reported that the three above named juveniles had run away from the C.M.R. passenger train at this point, that the three above named were entrained for Balcarres, Saskatchewan where they were to attend the Indian school. Their respective ages being 16, 14 & 8 yrs. He further stated that these children after leaving the train had called at one of the houses west of the station where they got a drink of water and then continued west. He requested assistance of the police in locating these juveniles.\n\n2. Obtaining the description in detail and pursuant to instructions received from Det. Corp. Woods of Yorkton C.I.B., I immediately patrolled per Constable Parsons' P/Auto to the section of the city where they were last seen. I inquired at John KORUT's residence where they obtained a drink of water and there I learned that the boy mentioned about hiding on KORUT's premises but the elder girl decided to keep going. They continued another block south and then turned west. I continued searching along this route but failed to learn anything further. I continued patrol west and then proceeded to search the bush on the outskirts west of the city without results. Then I continued patrol to the first road west of the city and notify all the farmers along this road, and continued on road north of the city with the same results. After a general search of two hours, I got in touch with the detachment and learned that these children had been picked up by the Indian agent east of Yorkton. I returned to detachment.\n\n3. About 9:15 p.m. of the same date, P.H. BLANCH from the Indian School at Balcarres called at this detachment. I duly handed these juveniles over to him, obtaining receipt for same which is on file at this office, and escorted them to Balcarres same p.m.\n\nHANDED OVER TO DEPT.
