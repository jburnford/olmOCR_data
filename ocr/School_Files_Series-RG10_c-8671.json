L. Lowe, teacher of the school on John Smith's Reserve, requested to be transferred to the school on James Smith's reserve, Fort a la Corne. The reasons he gave were that the people were dissatisfied and that he himself felt that his work was not satisfactory. I had some conversation with Mr. Lowe, but I did not see my way to make any representation to your Department at the time. Now however matters seem to have reached a stage when some action is necessary. The Indians have sent a petition to the Bishop of Saskatchewan, complaining that their children are not making any progress and requesting a change of teachers.\n\nI would therefore respectfully enquire, Would the Department consider it advisable to carry out an exchange between Mr. Goodman and Mr. Lowe? Also, are the stipends the same at each of these two schools? I have no doubt the change would be an advantage to the John Smith's school. As you are no doubt aware, Mr. Lowe taught the South La Corne school for some time before it was closed.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 18, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, informing the Department that Mr. J. L. Lowe, Teacher of the school on the John Smith's Reserve, requests to be transferred to the school on the James Smith's Reserve, and stating the reasons for desiring this exchange.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there would be a difficulty in making this exchange. Mrs. Lowe is Field Matron, and her position has been established by the Civil Service Commission. If this transfer were made and her services retained, it would be necessary to have the position of Field Matron for the James Smith's Reserve established by the Civil Service Commission. The Department has not considered the appointment of a field matron for this last named reserve.\n\nThe salary allowed Mr. Goodman is at the rate of $750 per annum plus bonus; the salary paid Mr. Lowe is $600 per annum plus bonus and Mrs. Lowe, as Field Matron, $430 plus bonus.\n\nIn view of the above, the Department does not consider it advisable at the present time to arrange an exchange in positions between Mr. Goodman and Mr. Lowe, without some stronger reason being given therefor than has been up to this time set forth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nSynod Office\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lowe, teacher of the John Smith's reserve Day School, met with an accident, hurting his knee, when his horse ran away on his return to the reserve from Prince Albert. When I visited the reserve on the 12th instant, I found Mr. Lowe was walking lame and had a swollen knee. I advised him to lay up for a while and get proper treatment.\n\nI am today in receipt of a communication from Mrs. Lowe, which reads,\n\n\"I am writing to let you know Mr. Lowe is sick. He went to doctors on 19th & had his leg lanced; now he has to go in again today, he has another place to be lanced. Dr said he was not to take school but lie and rest. Will do reports as soon as able.\"\n\nThe reports referred to by Mrs. Lowe are the Quarterly School Returns for the quarter ending Sep. 30th, 1922.\n\nI have hopes that Mr. Lowe will soon be able to resume his duties.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nCPS/B.\nOTTAWA, November 14th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, informing the Department that Mr. J. L. Lowe, teacher of the John Smith's Indian Day School, had met with an accident which necessitated his giving up duties as teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the accident to Mr. Lowe is regretted, and it is hoped that he will soon have recovered sufficiently to resume duties.\n\nA return showing the days taught, etc., for the quarter ending September 30th, should be prepared by Mr. Lowe as soon as he is able to do so and forwarded through your office. In preparing his return for the current quarter, he should clearly state thereon the dates between which the school was closed on account of his accident. This is necessary in order that payment of his salary can be allowed for the time he was unable to teach.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC.

Perrier, Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI am writing concerning the John Smith's Day School in the Duck Lake Agency, Sask. There has been signed eight applications for entrance of pupils of this school to the Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nSeven of these have been approved by the Dept., one pupil has already gone without approval of the Dept. Two more applications are awaiting medical certificates before sending them in for approval. There is also one more pupil of this school for whom application is to be made for; think if all these applications for entrance to the Boarding School is approved, it will leave me with so few scholars that when the cold weather comes there will be only one or two who will come to school, and I am sure that the school cannot keep open as the few that will be left with me will be too small to come.\n\nI am so placed now that I ask through you that, if this school is closed, or about to be closed, would the Indian Dept. give me another position as teacher elsewhere. I have been teaching here four years. Previous to this I was at the South Forte No. One Day School six years. Report of the school\nwas given last October by School Inspector Mr. Tomlinson of Prince Albert.\n\nI would like to have a position in the Day School, but if not possible, I would teach in a Boarding School.\n\nI have worked conscientiously in this work and like it and do not wish to go out of the Indian work.\n\nI remain\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. L. Lowe\nTeacher.\nOttawa, Oct. 2, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, in which you inform the Department that the John Smith's Indian Day School will be left with very few pupils, if active recruiting is continued for the boarding schools. I have noted that you would be willing to accept a transfer to another day school, in the event that the Department decides activities should cease at the present school.\n\nI should be pleased if you would continue your efforts for the time being, and not only assist recruiting officers to secure children for residential schools, but make a special effort to have your own enrolment the best possible. If, in the course of the winter, we find the John Smith's Day School should be closed, because of lack of pupils, I shall be pleased to bend every energy to secure another day school, under Church of England auspices, for you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. L. Lowe, Esq.,\nDavis,\nSASK.\nSir:\n\nThe Indian houses on John Smith's Reserve appear to be very comfortable and the premises surrounding were clean.\n\nThe school on this Reserve is not doing good work. Mr. and Mrs. Lowe are by no means energetic and although there is excellent opportunity of doing good work they appear to have got into a rut. Mr. Lowe complained that his garden was full of sow thistle and that he was not able to do much with it. The whole garden could be ploughed in half an hour and the thistles growing there could be hand picked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. M.

Just a few words in regard to the school teacher Mr. Lowe.\n\nSome time ago I understood the Chief Robert Ross had mentioned to the Bishop that he wished the present teacher be removed and be placed a qualified teacher here.\n\nAnd the Bishop has promised to see after this. That was last spring.\n\nI also put this before Rev. & Abraham while Canon Paul was away.\n\nWe are anxious to have a change now, and I wish this to take place before end of Sept. quarter.\n\nI hope the Indian School committee will see to this for us, we want a qualified teacher. We have just as much respect to our teacher as any class of people, hoping to hear in near future.\n\nIndian Affairs.

George Exton Lloyd, D.D.\n\nBishopsthorpe\n\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nFriday, August 24th, 1925.\n\nRe John Smith's Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nSince writing you on August 18th with reference to Mr. Gentleman's name being submitted for the new school on Big Heads Fort a la Corne Mission, the enclosed letter has come in from John Smith's Reserve.\n\nFor the last two years every missionary going to this reserve had been greeted with the request that Mr. Lowe be removed. I had this in full measure last year but after hearing all that was to be said I took no action.\n\nBut it is quite evident that Mr. Lowe has lost the confidence of the Indians. There does not appear to be anything wrong in the man, but he seems to have got on the wrong side of the Indians altogether and they don't want him there.\n\nI don't think his resignation ought to be asked for without further trial and I would suggest that he might be given an exchange to Big Head and let Mr. Gentleman come to John Smith's reserve. If that were done, Mr. Gentleman would be within easy driving distance of Prince Albert in case his wife needed attention.\n\nIf, for any reason known to the Department, this is not advisable, would you consider Mr. Lowe's name for the Red Earth vacancy?\n\nI put the matter in this tentative way because I do not know whether there is any adverse report of Mr. Lowe's work in the Department. If so, it would be better to let him go because he is doing no good at John Smith's.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nG. E. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, August 28, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nWith further reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 16th instant and in reply to yours of the 21st instant, concerning teaching services at the Fort a la Corne South and John Smith Indian Day Schools, I have to state that the Department cannot give approval to the appointment of Mr. F. H. Gentleman at either school. This teacher taught at the John Smith School a few years ago, and, after a study of the files and knowing something of Mr. Gentleman's own wishes, it is considered most unwise to offer him an Indian school in what is known as our Duck Lake agency. When Mr. Gentleman was in Ottawa, on his way to England, he informed the Superintendent of Indian Education that, if he were not nominated for The Pas School, he would prefer to teach in Eastern Canada. There will be an opening in an Ontario undenominational Indian day school in October and I cabled to him yesterday, offering the position.\n\nI note Your Lordship's remarks concerning Mr. Lowe, the present incumbent at John Smith's. I hesitate to approve of the transfer of Mr. Lowe to either Fort a la Corne South or Red Earth. At these two schools there would be no stipend for Mrs. Lowe as field matron and a transfer would mean a considerable financial loss to Mr. and Mrs. Lowe. The public school inspector and our own officers have lately reported more favourably concerning this teacher's services, and, in view of the fact that the beginning of the school year is only a few days away, I feel it would be wiser to allow Mr. Lowe to continue at John Smith's for another year, on further trial, and to secure a new incumbent for the re-opened Fort a la Corne South Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. G. H. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is the Bishop's wish now that you should remain where you are until Christmas, and after that perhaps go to Montreal Lake.\" Another extract reads:\n\n\"Mr. Waite who was expecting to go to John Smith's will probably go to Fort A in the meantime. This arrangement will give time for further consideration of all matters involved, and doubtless by Christmas some satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at.\"\n\nI have now received a letter from the Indian Agent, Mr. Schmidt, Esq., under date of Aug 9th which reads: \"I am in receipt of a communication from the Department informing me that the Rev.

Canon McKim, Prince Albert, in which he states that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan desired that your transfer and that of your wife from your present positions at John Smith's be not made until Christmas, next, and that in the meantime other work has been provided for Rev. G. J. Waite. We have approved of your remaining at the John Smith's Indian Day School until Christmas and to carry on duties as formerly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn L. Lowe, Esq.,\nDavis P.O., Sask.\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIn answer to your letter No. 107-5-1 under date of August 1926 re. the reopening of Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to say that the reason I wrote the Dept. was that during an interview with Bishop Lloyd the first week in May 1926, His Lordship told me that it was his intention to transfer me to the Mistawasis school, that this school was to have been closed, but that arrangements had been made, and the school would now be kept open. This was satisfactory to me.\n\nI heard a week later from a young clergyman that the school was definitely closed. On June 3rd I went to see one of the clergymen on the Bishop's Indian Committee. I asked him as to the closing of the Mistawasis school and he said, \"The school will be kept open, arrangements have been made, and you are to go there.\"\n\nThe second week in July one of the clergymen of the Bishop's Commission called on me, and asked me to decide on one of two places offered, Mistawasis or Red Earth. I said Mistawasis, as I had been told by the Bishop it was his intention that I go there, also I knew nothing about Red Earth.\n\nA week later I received a letter from the Chairman of the Bishop's Commission, that Mistawasis school was definitely closed, and that I have been nominated for Red Earth, and a request that I write him. I wrote him asking for more information about Red Earth, saying that if this meant setting up my home, and travelling many miles out of civilization, the thought was not very pleasant especially with two young children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 2)\nReceiving no letter from him in a few days, I resolved to go on the 2nd of Aug. to the Pas and find out for myself the conditions from the Indian Agent J. Waddy.\n\nMeanwhile, while I am at the Pas, a letter arrives under date of 4th Aug. 1926, from the Chairman of the Bishop's Commission which reads\u2014\n\n\"Since writing you I have seen the Bishop and have talked matters over regarding Red Earth. It is the Bishop's wish now that you should remain where you are until Christmas, and after that perhaps go to Montreal Lake to relieve Reverend who is probably going back to England.\"\n\n\"M. Waite who was expecting to go to John Smith will probably go to Fort St. Louis in the meantime.\"\n\nThis I think will give you an understanding of the situation today.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn L. Lowe\nThe Superintendent-General\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir We the undersigned Chief of Council,\nand head men of John Smith Reserve respectfully\nrequest that in the interests of this band, and\nparticularly in the interests of our children\nthat the present Teacher be removed.\nFor some years the school has been going\nback until we find the attendance is very\nsmall, and there is no progress whatever;\na glance of the records will show that this\nschool in previous years was one of the\nbest day schools in the Dominion.\nWhile we don't like to complain we feel that\nin consideration for our children, a change\nis necessary.\nIn a word the present lack of interest we\nbelieve is not owing to us; but directly to the\npresent incumbent of the School, we would\ntherefore respectfully recommend that Mr. Lowe\nbe removed, and that a qualified Teacher\nbe placed on the John Smith Reserve.\nThis is respectfully submitted and your petition\nhumbly pray that it may receive your\nprompt attention.\n\nWe are Sir\nYour Humble Servants\nChief Robert Bear\nRobert Bear\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 2)\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have just returned to Prince Albert after a long round of the Indian missions of the North, extending from June the 24th to May. May I take up the points of some of these missions with you.\n\n1. John Smith's Reserve. I have had another visit of a deputation from John Smith's asking for the exchange or removal of their teacher, Mr. Lowe. As I wrote you more than a year ago, I am quite satisfied this man's usefulness on that reserve has come to an end some time ago, and it would have been much better had the Indian Agent's recommendation to continue him for another year not been followed. Not only are they dissatisfied with his teaching and his influence on the children but it is now become a matter of real grievance. Since meeting Mr. Lowe on the train the other day I am very loath to recommend him for any other Indian mission. His nature seems to be like steel rails. He has no qualifications as a teacher and he seems to be of a hard unsympathetic nature. I had suggested to him the mission of Red Earth on the Carrot River, but he thought himself entirely too good for that. However that offer is not now available.\n\n2. Red Earth. Mr. and Mrs. Ash both request to be continued as teacher in the Red Earth Reserve until the end of next June at least, and I have promised to endorse and send in this request. I understood they wanted to leave but they are now anxious to take this next year's school work until June 30th 1927. Mr. Ash and his wife are both fully qualified and certificated teachers.\n\n3. Montreal Lake. I am afraid Mr. Pereira and his wife will be giving up this school at Christmas. I talked things over very fully with him because he has been such a splendid success and those children in the school are totally different from what I saw before. He wants to return to England on account of the teachers' pensions. I greatly regret their going. This might be an opening for Lowe of John Smith's if one could be sure that he did not let the work down, and it is the only opening that I can see at the present time.\n4. Lac La Ronge. Everything here seemed to be going as usual and as far as I could judge quite satisfactorily.\n\n5. Stanley. The young teacher Mr. Strong seems to be doing very well at that summer school with the assistance of the Rev. Canon Paul. There is still the open question about the teacher last year, Mr. Taylor, carrying on the summer school right over into the Winter and early Spring. He claims that he had the recognition of the Indian Agent, and he thought the support of the Indian Department, and thinks that it depended wholly on the willingness of the Indians to keep their children there, he carried on. Of course he has had nothing but the Summer stipend and feels that he has a strong grievance against the Department, and has made no return of the money the Synod advanced to him to make the journey up there. I was in England at the time or I should have questioned his staying there long before I did, but he seems to have acted in a bone fide way, though the letters of the Department to our Synod Office gave no authority for anything but the summer school.\n\n6. Pelican Narrows. We spent the greater part of a day in this school inspecting their writing, drawing, nature study, singing and a very little reading. They seemed to be getting all that is possible in the short time, but are decidedly behind the children at Stanley.\n\n7. The Pas Day School. Everyone appeared to have a good word for the progress of the children in this day school under Mr. Humberstone. Missionaries and Indians agreed that the children were doing very well and one Indian father drew detailed comparison between his boy in the day school and the other boy in the residence school, and not to the credit of the residence school. I do not think that should be taken for anything more than satisfaction with what was going on in the new day school.\n\n8. Big Eddy Day School. I had a large deputation of the Indians including the Chief and all the councillors urging me to apply to the Department for a new school to replace the old log thing that Miss Millan has at Big Eddy. From all accounts the rain gets in and the mud smells badly, besides seeping out continually, and altogether the building is disreputable. All agreed with the missionary that Miss Millan's work was thoroughly good and clearly her influence is most marked on the Indians as well as thoroughly good teaching work with the children. She seems to put her whole heart into the work and I would strongly urge that a new school like Humberstone's should be built there. I ought to add that the opening of these two day schools there has had a very marked effect on the whole Devon Mission, it was a good stroke of work when those schools were opened.\n\n9. Moose Lake. The Rev. Mr. Parker and his wife have taken possession of this mission and school. As you know the wife is a fully qualified teacher and is herself an Indian graduate.\nof the Lac la Ronge Boarding School. She has been accepted by the Educational Department of Manitoba but of course there are the Indian children in connection with it as well.\n\nMr. Waite and his wife have moved up to Fort la Corne mission until Mr. Smith's school is vacated. Mr. Waite, as you probably know, has his B.A. and his first class teaching certificate, and has been very successful in his work amongst the non-English foreigners before he took up the Indian school work. In the meantime I am finding him temporary employment at Fort la Corne.\n\n10. Cedar Lake. I was very glad to see the new log house that has been put up at this point for the teacher and his wife. It is a great improvement on the old log affair that was there before.\n\n11. Grand Rapids Village. Mr. Horsefield is moving down from Pelican Narrows at the close of his engagement there in September to take this school. It is of course under the Manitoba Government but is just about as Indian as the reserve on the other side of the river. Mr. Horsefield is a highly qualified teacher and will be a help and companion to the teacher on the reserve opposite.\n\n12. Grand Rapids Reserve. I found everyone here has a good word to say for Mr. Wyatt. His wife and two boys joined him this summer coming via Winnipeg, and they are a thoroughly nice family with two well behaved little boys. I had no opportunity to inspect the school children but everyone seemed to be pleased with the progress made. The house however is quite unsatisfactory. The building itself is log and built backwards road to the lake front. The inside is quite unfinished and unfit for anyone to live in as it is. I found all his winter supplies and all the new mission furniture in the new school building where they are living, and after going carefully into the whole matter, I instructed him to stay where he was in the new school building until his house was properly finished and if necessary have the desks moved up to the old school building until the house was ready. Who is to blame for this I do not wish to say but a little checking up of the Indian Agent in Winnipeg would not do any harm. That Reserve is a very isolated one during seven months of the year and when we do get a really good teacher for places like that we want to keep them satisfied.\n\n13. I did not visit any of the schools in the Cumberland lake area although I was there for the purposes of the missions and the Barrier and Budds Point are of course provincial schools.\nI should be glad to hear from you with regard to the suggestion of Mr. Lowe transferring from John Smith's to Montreal Lake at Christmas, and if so then Mr. Waite's name will stand in nomination for John Smith's together with Mrs. Waite as matron.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSeptember 28, 1926.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, concerning the Indian missions of Your Lordship's diocese and with particular reference to the Indian day schools. I am very pleased to learn that satisfactory progress is being made generally and I wish to assure you that the Department will cooperate in effecting improvements whenever a school gives reasonable promise of success. I hope that Your Lordship will be in Ottawa in the not distant future and that we can have an interview regarding the future of the work.\n\nI note that Mr. Lowe will have to leave the John Smith School, as he has outlived his usefulness on the reserve. The appointment of the Rev. G. J. Waite to this school as from January first has already been approved by the Department. Your Lordship might suggest that Mrs. Waite apply for the position of field matron. She should indicate what domestic duties she has and how much time could be given to visiting.\n\nI learn with regret that Mr. and Mrs. Pereira are leaving the Montreal Lake Indian Day School. Mr. Pereira taught this school during August and has permission to close on November 30th. This should be kept in mind when Your Lordship is arranging for a successor. If you wish to try Mr. J. L. Lowe at Montreal Lake I shall be glad to approve when the definite nomination is to hand.\n\nI have directed that letters be sent to Your Lordship concerning the other questions that need attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

G. J. Waite that his appointment to John Smith's School was to date from January 1st, 1927, also about his wife's application.\n\nMr. Pereira is withdrawing from Montreal Lake on November 30th, to my great regret, and I have written Mr. J. L. Lowe of John Smith's that I am nominating him to succeed at Montreal Lake, as from January 1st, 1927, and have urged him to keep matters educationally and morally, at the present high level in that Reserve.\n\nI expect to sail from Montreal on October 20th, and hope to call upon you in Ottawa on either Monday or Tuesday, the 13th or 14th of October.\n\nBishop Lucas, late of MacKenzie River, is taking my duties over for six months.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nG. E. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, December 3, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1843-120-99 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the application of Mrs. G. J. Waite for the position of field matron on the John Smith's reserve. The Department approves of Mrs. Waite's appointment, at a salary of $300 per year. You should place her name on the paylist in due course and give her full instructions concerning her duties. The recommendation of the Commissioner of the City of Saskatoon is returned herewith.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. F.

Lowe was in charge as teacher but was being transferred to Montreal Lake at the end of the year. His wife has acted as Field Matron on the Reserve. Mr. Lowe, during his term as teacher at this school, has cooperated with the Indian Agent in connection with the management of the reserve. Mr. Schmidt speaks very highly of him in this connection.\nREPORT of Provisions used at John Smith's Day School\non John Smith's Reserve, for the Month ended December 31st, 1926\n\nAggregate Attendance: 90 girls\nMeals Served: 403\n\n| Item       | On hand | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month | Remarks |\n|------------|---------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| FLOUR      |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BACON      |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BEEF       |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| TEA        |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| RICE       |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| SOAP       |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| SUGAR      |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| SALT       |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| POTATOES   |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BISCUITS   |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BEANS      |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| OATMEAL    |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| TEAS       |         |                       |                  |                         |         |\n\nCertified Correct,\nJohn Leonard Lowe\nTeacher or Field Master\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gilbert Waite who is a University graduate and holds his 1st Class Professional.\n\nThe roll calls for 15 and I found 11 present. The grades range as follows:\n\nGrade I - 6\n\" III - 2\n\" IV - 4\n\" V - 1\n\" VI - 2\n\nThe attendance for September was 8.1, which is rather low. Mr. Waite has experienced considerable difficulty in having the children attend. I took this up with the Indians and pointed out that the children must attend unless sick, otherwise it will be necessary to place them\nJOHN SMITH'S INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nplace them in boarding schools. The Agent is giving this matter closer attention, and I would expect to find the attendance improve.\n\nThe children are making fair progress, and I found them to be clean and well clothed.\n\nA noon-day meal is served by Mrs. Waite, composed of soup, vegetables and biscuits. A splendid garden was raised this year, so there will be abundance of vegetables for the children.\n\nEach child is provided with a drinking cup, towel and tooth brush, all of which are made use of.\n\nI found the outside windows all fastened on, preventing any fresh air coming in except through a couple of inch holes at the bottom of the sash. Some of these sash should be on hinges, and the inside windows should be fixed to open from the top so as to prevent a direct draft on the children.\n\nThe school yards have been re-fenced, and I found everything in a neat and tidy condition. Mr. Waite is a good worker, not only in the classroom, but outside, and the condition of the place is a credit to him.\n**REPORT of Provisions used at John Smith's Reserve Day School**\n\non John Smith's Reserve, for the Month ended Oct 31st 1920\n\nAggregate Attendance: 347  \nMeals Served: 405\n\n| Item       | On hand 1st of Oct | Received during month | Used during month | On hand at end of month | REMARKS |\n|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Flour      | 64 lbs             | 98 lbs                | 80 lbs           | 82 lbs                 |         |\n| Bacon      | nil                | 60 lbs                | 60 lbs           | nil                    |         |\n| Beef       | nil                | nil                   | nil              | nil                    |         |\n| Tea        | nil                | 25 lbs                | 25 lbs           | nil                    |         |\n| Rice       | nil                | 14 lbs                | 12 lbs           | 2 lbs                  |         |\n| Soap       | nil                | 6 lbs                 | 6 lbs            | nil                    |         |\n| Sugar      | 20 lbs             | nil                   | 10 lbs           | 10 lbs                 |         |\n| Salt       | 53 lbs             | nil                   | 6 lbs            | 47 lbs                 |         |\n| Potatoes   | From garden        |                       |                  |                        |         |\n| Biscuits   | 18 boxes           | nil                   | 2 boxes          | 16 boxes               |         |\n| Brans      | 20 lbs             | nil                   | 10 lbs           | 10 lbs                 |         |\n| Oatmeal    | nil                | nil                   | nil              | nil                    |         |\n| Peas       | nil                | nil                   | nil              | nil                    |         |\n| Dry Milk   | 43 lbs             | nil                   | 7 lbs            | 36 lbs                 |         |\n| Yeast Cakes| 3 boxes            | nil                   | 2 boxes          | 1 box                  |         |\n| Baking Powder | 3 lbs            | nil                   | 1 lb             | 2 lbs                  |         |\n| Onions     | From garden        |                       |                  |                        |         |\n| Lard       | 11 lbs             | nil                   | 5 lbs            | 6 lbs                  |         |\n| Carrots    | From garden        |                       |                  |                        |         |\n| Barley     | 10 lbs             | nil                   | nil              | 10 lbs                 |         |\n| Syrup      | 4 lbs              | nil                   | 1 lb             | 3 lbs                  |         |\n| Black Soda | 2 lb               | nil                   | 1 lb             | 1 lb                   |         |\n\nCertified Correct,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher or Field Mat\n\nIndian Affairs.

The attendance here is highly satisfactory. It is pleasing to note that here too, where we have no resident Farming Instructor, the children were found to be well clothed and neat in appearance.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJOHN SMITH'S INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school is in charge of the Rev. G. J. Waite, a university graduate, and he also holds his First Class professional certificate. Mr. Waite is doing excellent work and the children are making good progress.\n\nThe roll calls for 18 pupils, and 16 were present. The attendance has been excellent, and for January was over 92%. The children appeared greatly interested in their work, and I found for the quarter ending January 31st, that 6 pupils had not missed a day during the quarter. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 8      |\n| II    | 4      |\n| III   | 1      |\n| IV    | 1      |\n| V     | 3      |\n| VI    | 1      |\n\nThe children were well clothed and neat in appearance. They have individual towels, which are made use of and each is provided with cup and tooth brush.\n\nA noon-day meal is served, and this is well prepared by Mrs. Waite, who also does the Field Matron's work on the reserve.\n\nA new garden was ploughed and made ready for this year, so that now the children can be kept in the school ground. It has, in the past, been the custom to use the school ground as a garden, and the children were obliged to play across the road. The new arrangement will be much better and will be safer for the children.\n\nThe pupils assist in the planting and caring for the garden, and the vegetables are used in the winter for the noon-day meal. The girls are taught knitting.\nJOHN SMITH'S INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nknitting and plain sewing by Mrs. Waite, and do some very nice work.\n\nI feel the Department are fortunate in the securing of Mr. Waite as teacher. Mrs. Waite does excellent work as Field Matron.\nCROSS REFERENCE SHEET\n\nEXTRACT FROM, OR PRECIS OF, COMMUNICATION DATED 21-4-33\n\nWRITTEN BY Mr. MacKenzie\n\nTO M. C.

Luckraft has sent in his resignation as Teacher in order to take another position under the Government.\n\nWe are doing our best to find another Teacher, but there is a great scarcity of Teachers, and many white schools in this district are now closed on this account. I have heard of one lady Teacher who may be available; but I am afraid we may not be able to find a man.\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. Luckraft is willing to carry on the School till a successor can be found. Mr. Simpson, the Indian Agent, tells me that this arrangement will be acceptable to the Department for a few weeks.\n\nI may point out that the salary at this School has been $80 per teaching month, or $720 per annum, whereas most of the other Schools have been allowed $90 or $95. John Smith's is one of the best Indian Day Schools, and the average attendance is very high, and I should like to suggest that the salary be made the same as most of the other Schools.\n\nThe Bishop is at present in Eastern Canada, and he is looking out for more workers, and it is possible that he might find another clergyman who is also a teacher to make Mr. Luckraft's place. I know he will do his best in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. J. Paul.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 109-5-1 dated September 21st., I beg to report that I interviewed Archdeacon Paul at Prince Albert yesterday in connection with procuring a teacher at the John Smiths Indian Day School.\n\nArchdeacon Paul informed me that it is most difficult to procure the services of teachers for Indian Day Schools under the present circumstances. He also stated that the salary offered at this school was lower than that being paid by the Department at any of the other Indian Day Schools in this part of the Province despite there being more work at the John Smiths School owing to the average attendance of pupils there being higher than at most of the other schools. If this is the case I would recommend that if possible an adjustment be considered in the rate of salary for teaching at this school. I have found that the members of the John Smiths Reserve give much better co-operation in having their children attend school than is the case on any other reserve in this Agency excepting the Moose Woods Sioux.\n\nArchdeacon Paul informed me that at present there was no one in view to fill the vacancy as teacher of this school, but that he had every hope of being able to procure a teacher by October 31st. and requested that Mrs. Luckraft be employed to carry on with this work until that date. Mrs. Luckraft is capable of doing so and in view of the circumstances I have requested her to open the school on October 1st., with the understanding that she will be relieved of this work by the end of that month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. H. SIMPSON\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSNS/H.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: John Smith Indian Day School\nNo. 610\n\nAs you were advised in official memorandum of the 21st instant, Rev. R.M. Luckraft has given up duties as teacher of the above-mentioned school. To succeed him we have appointed Mrs. R.M. Luckraft at a salary of $80.00 a teaching month, plus bonus, effective October 1, 1942. The necessary forms in connection with Mrs. Luckraft will be forwarded to you as soon as received. I enclose, for your information, copy of letter of appointment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the teaching services at the John Smith Indian Day School. I also received today a letter from Archdeacon Paul in regard to the same matter. The temporary appointment of Mrs. Luckraft is approved. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $80.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. I note from your letter that she began duties on October 1.\n\nWhile you state that Archdeacon Paul may secure a teacher before the end of the current month, the information contained in his letter is not so definite and consequently it is hoped that Mrs. Luckraft will find it possible to carry on at the school until a new teacher is secured.\n\nIf Archdeacon Paul is able to secure an unmarried, qualified, female teacher for this school, the Department is prepared to allow a salary of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nI enclose two sets of forms. One of these should be completed and returned immediately by Mrs. Luckraft in order to allow us to pay her for the period she remains in charge of the school. The other set of forms can be used when the new teacher is secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. S.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1942.\n\nEX'D.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Department approves the appointment of Mrs. R.M. Luckraft as temporary teacher at the John Smith Indian Day School. We will allow her the same salary as the previous teacher; namely, $80.00 a teaching month, plus bonus at the rate of 17%.\n\nIn the event of your being successful in securing the services of an unmarried, qualified, female teacher the Department will be prepared to consider allowing a salary of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Mrs. Luckraft has very kindly been filling in for the past month but feels she cannot continue any longer. I am therefore most happy to have made contact regarding the school with Mrs. Roberts.\n\nMrs. Roberts taught both in England and in Saskatchewan. She is 48 years of age and holds a third class Saskatchewan certificate. Her last school was in 1923. She is most anxious to be of some use to the country in the present situation.\n\nI wonder if I might ask for an immediate reply by airmail because I should like, if possible, that Mrs. Roberts should commence her school duties as from Monday next, November 2.\n\nWhile I am writing may I say how greatly we are going to miss Indian Agent R.S. Davis. I have found him most co-operative in the work on the reserves and most amicable towards the work of our Church. I do hope that his successor will be a man of like interests and sympathies. It was a pleasure to work with him.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEp./A\n\nThe Secretary,\nWelfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nOctober 26, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: John Smith Indian Day School\nNo. 610\n\nIn my memorandum of October 5, I advised you of the temporary appointment of Mrs. R.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nInformation for Purchasers of Canada's War Savings Certificates\n\nDate of Issue. War Savings Certificates will be dated the fifteenth of the month in which payment is completed. For example, whenever in any one month your Total Salary Deductions are sufficient to buy your War Savings Certificate, that Certificate will bear the date of the 15th of that month.\n\nRegistration. Each War Savings Certificate is registered at the Bank of Canada, Ottawa. Registration will be made in one name only. A War Savings Certificate is not transferable and cannot be redeemed other than by its registered owner. Provision is made for redemption in case of the death of a holder.\n\nCare should be taken to state clearly the name and address in which you desire Certificates registered. Spell out the first or Christian name in full, as well as the surname, and give proper prefix (Mr., Mrs., or Miss).\n\nFor example: Correct\u2014BROWN, MR.

No person may hold War Savings Certificates in excess of a purchase value of $500 purchased in any one calendar year. That is to say, you may purchase $500 worth this year, and up to a like amount in each succeeding year.\n\nIncome Tax. Due to the difficulties of calculation, the small amounts involved and the limited individual holdings, holders will not be required to report the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value of War Savings Certificates, as income in making returns under the Income War Tax Act.\n\nRedemption. War Savings Certificates cannot be called for redemption until they have matured to their date of maturity. The holder, however, has the option six months after issue date of redeeming his certificates for cash, and after the first year will also be paid interest to the date of redemption in accordance with the table of redemption values shown on each certificate. The Minister of Finance reserves the right to require ninety days' notice in the case of redemption before maturity.\n(To be returned to Indian Affairs Branch when original letter signed).\n\nOttawa, November 6, 1948.\n\nDear Sirs\u2014\n\nThis is to advise you that the services of Mrs. R.

Luckraft, formerly teacher\nJohn Smith Indian Day School,\n\nWe are enclosing herewith Dominion of Canada cheque No. 38946, for $40, drawn in favour of the above-named, being refund of Retirement Fund account. Will you kindly forward this cheque to Mrs. Luckraft. If, however, you are unable to locate her please return it to this office.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMr. Simpson, Indian Agent, Duck Lake Agency, was paying Treaty I accompanied the Treaty party to the different reserves in this Agency with the exception of Moose Woods Sioux.\n\nRegarding day schools in this Agency, of course when I visited the different reserves to pay Treaty the schools were naturally closed and as a man from the San and Dr. Morrow were X-raying all of the Indians the schools were being used for this purpose. However, I must say I am not very much taken up with the work that is being carried on at these schools at the present time. For instance there is a Mrs. Roberts teaching at the day school on the John Smith Reserve. The Agent informed me this teacher is not capable and evidently the Church has promised him she will be replaced. There is an Indian girl teaching at the For-a-lla-Corne Indian Day School and I believe she is a very good teacher but the daily attendance is very poor, being only 12. At the day school on the south end of the reserve where Mr. Ahenakew is teaching the average attendance is only 9. Therefore I consider we are not receiving the attendance we might expect, and I spoke to everybody concerned, that is the Agent, Farming Instructor, etc. The attendance at John Smith Bay School, of course is good but as I stated above, it is very poor at the other two schools mentioned and I expect to be up in that vicinity again later on in the Summer at which time I will talk to the Indians and the school teachers some more.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to advise that Doctor J.M. Morrow, Medical Superintendent has reported that there are eight cases of measles of a medium severity type among the children at John Smith's Reserve. Also that while he was at this reserve yesterday he instructed that the Indian Day School there be closed until after the summer holidays.\n\nS.H.

Luckraft, formerly teacher\nJohn Smith Indian Day School.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith Dominion of Canada cheque No. 6837, for $4.07, drawn in favour of the above-noted, being refund of Retirement Fund account (final payment). Would you kindly forward this cheque to Mrs. Luckraft.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nDuck Lake, Sask.  \nJune 11, 1943.\n\nM. Christiansen, Esq., General Superintendent of Agencies, Regina.\n\nI beg to report that the services of Mrs. M. Roberts, Teacher at the John Smiths Indian Day School, has not been found satisfactory.\n\nShe is unable to maintain proper discipline over the school children, especially during recess and mid day periods. The lack of discipline is also apparent in her home. I have been given to understand from a reliable source that her eldest daughter had been keeping company with one of the young members of the reserve and had entertained him in her home. I have since been advised that the daughter is now living away from home.\n\nThe teacher's husband, Mr. Roberts, has given up the work he was employed at and has been living on the reserve with his wife. He appears to be a lazy type of individual.\n\nMrs. Roberts does not appear to be capable of leading or instructing the women of the Homemaker's Club in their work on this reserve.\n\nIt is realized that under present conditions it is difficult to procure suitable teachers for this particular and important type of work among the Indians. However it is felt that if possible a more suitable teacher should be employed on this reserve.\n\nWhile at Prince Albert yesterday I interviewed the Right Reverend H.D. Martin, Bishop, and the Venerable W.E.J. Paul, Archdeacon, pertaining to this matter. Bishop Martin advised that he was under the impression that teachers could not be given notice that their services were no longer required during the school holidays and requested that the Department advise him as soon as possible as to its wishes in this case.\n\nS. H. Simpson  \nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. While paying Treaty at the John Smiths Reserve I advised...\nyou that Bishop Martin had agreed to have another teacher appointed in Mrs. Robert's place at the beginning of the next school term. I brought this matter to his attention on June 4th, when he then advised me that Archdeacon Paul had visited Mrs. Roberts and on his return had advised him that Mrs. Roberts had improved in her work and should now prove satisfactory. I advised the Bishop that her services were not satisfactory and it was arranged to go into this matter in the presence of the Bishop, Archdeacon Paul and myself as soon as possible, which was yesterday, and I am convinced that the Bishop is only too willing to procure a more suitable teacher if at all possible to do so. A copy of this letter has been mailed to the Bishop excepting this foot note.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Roberts, a teacher at the John Smith Indian Day School who has not been found satisfactory. I was at the school a short time ago and sent in a short report about the school. I know how hard it is to get teachers and if teachers were available I would have no hesitation in recommending a change. I do not know how it is down East, but I know that teachers here are practically impossible to get, therefore it might be well for us to consider before we leap.\n\nHowever, Mr. Simpson's letter is self-explanatory and of course you will take whatever action you think is necessary.\n\nM.

Roberts, teacher of the John Smith Indian Day School.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the contents of Agent Simpson's letter and, while I agree that teachers are hard to obtain, at the same time I feel that it would be inadvisable to retain Mrs. Roberts' services for the coming year. One of the most disturbing statements in the Agent's letter is that which refers to the teacher's husband, who is stated to have given up work and is now living on the reserve. We have had similar cases on other reserves and inevitably some trouble develops. Mrs. Roberts was only engaged for the current academic year and you may advise her immediately that her services will not be required for 1943-44. You should also request Rt. Rev. Bishop Martin to nominate another teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 27, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOttawa.\n\nThis is to advise you that the services of Mrs. Roberts, ceased effective July 1, 1943.

Therefore if our Branch knew of anybody who might be able to fill this position I wish you would take the matter up with His Lordship because the Indians of this reserve are really interested in getting an education for their children.\n\nM.

On reviewing the Nut Lake file, it would seem that Mrs. Weeks should be well qualified to teach in this school if she will accept the position. Unfortunately, I doubt if she will be able to obtain her release at this time because of the fact that such resignations are required by school boards one month before December 31.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that her name be suggested to Bishop Martin as a possible teacher.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFH/AN\nDuck Lake, Sask. December 6th 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find a copy of resignation (original submitted to Colonel, Bernard F. Neary) received at this office from Mr. F. W. Dann, Indian Day School Teacher on the John Smith Indian Reserve, Davis P. O., Sask.\n\nWhile I regret losing the services of Mr. Dann it would appear that he has attained his lifetime ambition and secured the position as an Ordained Minister with one of the Protestant Missions in the Province of Alberta.\n\nI recommend that his resignation be accepted.\n\nI might add that I am in receipt of a letter from the Rt. Rev. Henry D. Martin, D.D., Bishop of the Diocese of Saskatchewan in which it is noted that Bishop Martin is perturbed over the resignation of Mr. Dann and would attach the blame on our officials; however I am communicating with the Bishop and outlining to him that Mr. Dann has attained a lifetime ambition and it would appear that very little can be done about the matter by our Branch.\n\nN. J. McLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nBernard F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nSir,\n\nIt is with regret that I tender to you my resignation from the Department of Indian Education. I understand from your letter dated October 27th - Par - I - that I am not on the Permanent Staff and I should therefore hope that my resignation as from November 30th, and giving a full calendar month's notice will leave me free after December 31st.\n\nMy resignation also marks the end of a quarter century of teaching on three continents, for I am taking up the work of a Pastor of a Church in Alberta.\n\nI should like to thank all concerned for help and kindness rendered during the year and four months of service with the Department. I trust that you will be able to acknowledge this letter as early as possible, indicating that my resignation is accepted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. W. Dann.\nRegina, January 11, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to your File 610-1(E) regarding a Teacher to replace Mr. Danzat at the John Smith Indian Day School.\n\nYour letter dated December 3rd was received on December 7 and on that day I wrote to the Bishop of Saskatchewan suggesting that Mrs. Anna J. Weekes of Hasson, Saskatchewan might be induced to take that appointment as she did not get the Nut Lake Day School.\n\nA copy of my letter to the Bishop and the copy of his reply are enclosed herewith. Superintendent McLeod reported on December 17, that Bishop Martin had been in communication with Mrs. Weekes but there has been no report since that day.\n\nI am today writing to Mr. McLeod to ascertain if a Teacher has been appointed and immediately the reply is received, you will be advised.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been informed that Mr. Denn has resigned as teacher at the John Smith's Indian Day School, to be effective at the end of this year. It occurred to me that you might not have a waiting list of suitable teachers, as we had considerable difficulty to obtain a teacher at one of our new schools. Later, we advertised for applicants for another Indian day school, and quite a few teachers signified their willingness to take one of our appointments. A Mrs. Anna J. Weeks, of Hasson, Saskatchewan, applied for this school too late as an appointment had already been made. This lady has the necessary qualifications and considerable teaching experience to make a suitable teacher. I am submitting her name to you entirely as a suggestion in anticipation that it might be of assistance to you if your list of teachers is depleted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nRt. Reverend Henry D. Martin,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPRINCE ALBERT, Saskatchewan.\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nThank you for your letter of December 7th suggesting the name of Mrs. Anna J. Weekes of Hasson, Saskatchewan as a possible applicant for the vacancy at John Smith's Reserve Indian day school.\n\nI have written to Mrs. Weekes by this mail telling her about the school and also asking her to write to me giving me some particulars of her experience, etc., and I hope she may turn out to be the kind of person we want.\n\nI am sorry that Mr. Dann is leaving us because he is a well qualified teacher and did seem so interested in the Indians, but apparently his mind has changed. Unfortunately, I have nobody at the present time whom I can nominate as a suitable teacher here, so I thank you for your suggestion.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n(Signed) Bishop Henry Martin.\n\"B.F.\" SLIP\n\n\"B.F.\"\n\nFOR\n\nDate Jan 21\n\nInitials E\n\nIndian Affairs.

During that time we will study carefully the enrolment and average attendance of these children. I presume that\nthere will be sufficient room in the teacherage for a second teacher, and that you will keep this vacancy in mind when interviewing candidates of whose names I will shortly be notifying you.\n\nWe have forwarded to the Departmental Purchasing Agent a requisition covering the requirements listed by Mr. McLeod. We are sending an accountable advance of $150.00 for the labour required to convert this school dining room into a classroom.\n\nAs Mr. McLeod will be requiring the flooring and nails immediately, he can make local purchase of these items at once.

He had asked that the present Teacher, Miss Wilma Moore, help him to find an assistant teacher. I now hear that she has contacted Mrs. Lamb, Davis, Sask., who lives some ten miles from John Smith's, and Mrs. Lamb has consented to drive over every morning to teach this school at least temporarily. It is likely that she would be willing to continue permanently, if she were appointed. She has taught for four years in a white school at Canwood, Sask., and has excellent references. I am sorry that I have not more particulars, and the Bishop I will not be home till Sept. 21st.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLeod regarding application for re-qualification for Miss Moore, and I am in receipt of a letter from him to the effect that the forms were forwarded to Miss Moore some time ago, and she has not yet completed them.\n\nThe forms will be forwarded as soon as completed.\n\nJ.P.B.

Moore.\n\nEnclosed also please find a letter addressed to the writer over signature of Miss Moore the contents thereof is self explanatory with the following exceptions:\n\nItem 2. Janitor services.\n\nPersonally I see no reason why this work cannot be done by the older pupils free of charge to our Branch. Coal burning heating equipment has been installed in both classrooms with this type of equipment tending furnaces does not require any great amount of heavy work in comparison with tending wood burning heating equipment. I will follow the matter closely and if I find that janitor services are necessary a recommendation will be forwarded at a later date.\n\nItem 3. Manual Training.\n\nI am in agreement with Miss Moore in regards to training in wood work. We are fortunate in having one of the members of the John Smith Band who is an experienced and very competent carpenter and wood worker and his services could be made available for say one half day each week during the cold weather months. I estimate this additional training would entail an expenditure of approximately $20.00 per month, plus materials and tools in the amount of $75.00\n\nItem 4. Re application of Mrs Lamb.\n\nWe do not appear to have application forms on hand at this office and a supply of application forms are requested.\nI might add that I visited the John Smith Indian Day School on September 20th and found both classrooms in operation with a total attendance of 44 children in the school rooms.\n\nThe teachers appear to be quite capable and a spirit of enthusiasm was noted throughout by teachers and pupils.\n\nThe supplies listed on the enclosure are required as soon as possible.\n\nN.

She seems most anxious to do this work and as she has had experience both in white and Indian schools, she does seem admirably equipped. I thought I should inform you that I do not know Mrs. Stewart but she was introduced to me by her sister, Miss Moore, who is most anxious that she come to help her. Perhaps I should add that in my experience here I have often found that teachers like Mrs. Stewart who come back to the work after a lapse are most industrious and successful. I am, faithfully yours.\"\n\nIt is presumed you will advise me later concerning this teacher.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRegina, November 24th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nMiss Wilna Moore, Indian day school teacher at the John Smith's Reserve, of the Duck Lake Agency, has been in communication with Mrs. Flora L. Ross, day school teacher at the Thunderchild Reserve, of the Battleford Agency, regarding instruction in weaving, and is anxious that Mrs. Ross visit the John Smith's Reserve to assist in starting weaving at that school.\n\nAs the Department is aware, Mrs. Ross is well qualified to instruct in this work, and her knowledge has been passed on to other day school teachers from time to time, to the benefit of all concerned. I would therefore ask authority to send Mrs. Ross to the John Smith's Day School for the purpose. She would be away from the Thunderchild Day School for a week, but her son, George Ross, who is teaching the second classroom at the Thunderchild Day School, could supervise both rooms for that period without much difficulty.\n\nThe cost to the Department will be railway fare from Turtleford to Prince Albert, via North Battleford, and meals and hotel accommodation while passing through North Battleford and Prince Albert. The total cost will not exceed $50.00, and I believe that it will be money well spent.\n\nIf this meets with the approval of the Department, arrangements will have to be made with Mrs. Ross and Miss Moore as to the date.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ross, teacher at the Thunderchild Indian Day School, spend a week at the John Smith Day School in order to instruct the teacher of the latter school in weaving.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. Ross will spend one week at the John Smith School, and that the expenses incurred will not exceed $50.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nDecember 27, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

But he did not do so.\n\nOn Tuesday Dec.30 when the Agent was here I asked again for the September quarter, and since then I have received three mails on Jan. 3,6 & to day,16, covering two weeks, and still no September school return. If I send the present returns to Duck Lake they will most likely come back to be completed which means a delay of another two weeks, which I can ill afford.\n\nI would thank the Department for a cheque as soon as possible, and would ask that this not be delayed until the returns are finally completed. I have lately had to pay out upwmd of $109. for beef supplies, as the Indians here simply refuse either to sell or work for the Department unless paid without delay, and to get over this I have to pay out of my own pocket & then take the Indians cheque.\n\nI hate to complain about Mr Agent Schmidt but really sometimes it gets impossible.

It seems to me that I wrote regarding same, when this cheque reached me, but I cannot find a copy of the letter, and may not have done so. I would be glad to know the reason.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 11, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the amount of salary received by you as teacher of the John Smith's Bay School for the quarter ending December 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the deduction of $5.00 from your quarterly salary was made on account of your contribution to the Canadian Patriotic Fund. You authorized the Department to deduct $1.00 per month for a period of six months from your salary for the above fund and the $5.00 deducted was the contribution for the months of October, November and December, last. There yet remains a further deduction of $5.00 to be made from the March quarter's salary, as your contribution for the months of January, February and March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter No 117684/3, dated April 23, regarding contribution for the Canadian Patriotic Fund from my quarterly salary.\n\nIn reply I would like to observe that I notice that this amount is at the rate of $1.00 per month for six months, and also that you have already deducted $1.00 per month from my monthly Overseers cheques; I have before me at present an Overseer cheque No 7028 for $15.75 March salary, and they have been $15.65 for some months past, and it would appear as if you have already overpaid to the Canadian Patriotic Fund the sum of $3.00.\n\nHowever I have no objection to the overpayment of this amount, but would remark that the officials at the Headquarters of the various funds might be reminded that all these funds are well represented by local organizations which are not at all backward in bringing them to the notice of the outside services.\n\nI have no wish to appear mean in these matters, but with the high cost of living in England at present, I have to send large part of my salary cheque home, and while wishing to support Canadian Funds, it is not always possible to do so to the extent that one would like.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary.\nOttawa, May 1, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in further reference to the deductions on account of the Canadian Patriotic Fund made from your salary as teacher of the John Smith's Day School and as overseer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that deductions have been made for six months from your salary as teacher and overseer in error. This occurred through payments for each of these services being made in different branches of the Department and the deduction on account of the Patriotic Fund was inadvertently noted for payment in each branch. The Department is sending you a cheque for $3.00 on account of the deduction made from your salary as teacher for the March quarter, last, but is unable to refund you the $3.00 for the December quarter, as this amount has been forwarded to the Treasurer of the Canadian Patriotic Fund. There is, therefore, a total amount over deducted in error of $3.00 from your salary as teacher and overseer and it is hoped that you will consent to this amount remaining in the funds of the Patriotic Society, for which you have received due credit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Smith\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter #109-5-5 dated August 22nd last re Provincial School Inspector Tomlinson's report regarding his visit to the John Smith's Indian Day School on June 16th last and asking me to let the Department know what work I consider absolutely necessary. In reply I beg to say that there was nothing absolutely necessary unless it be filling in the old well which was ordered done over a year ago when I asked Rev Mr Waite, the Teacher, to arrange with Gilbert Bear to clean out, i.e; bail out all water and some sand from the bottom of the well now in use, also fill in with earth the old well, the cover of which was becoming rotten.\n\nBear cleaned the new well but put off filling in the old one. Last autumn I pointed out to Mr Waite that the work was not completed when he said he would speak to Bear, adding, \"I am holding the account for cleaning the well until he finishes the job, filling the old one.\"\n\nOn the 21st ultimo when on the reserve I called on Bear and asked him to finish the job at once which he promised to do and has been done. I am enclosing herewith voucher #8227 for $5.00 which was the amount I had agreed to pay for both jobs.\n\nAs regards to outbuildings, there are several things to do, however the main requirement of all buildings is Paint and this applies to all buildings in the Agency, not only to John Smith's.\n\nI fail to see why Mr Waite the Teacher worries about same or mentions it to the Inspector. As regards the Teachers platform I informed Mr Waite of the Inspector's wishes in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nS/C\n\nC.P.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDuck Lake, Sask., October 12th, 1937\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI beg to advise that I consider that the children attending the Day Schools in this Agency are not receiving sufficient nourishment from the cocoa, sugar, biscuits and potatoes served them at noon; especially during the cold Winter months when they have to walk to and from School. I understand that some of these children have little enough to eat before leaving for School and again on their return home. I feel that if a more nourishing meal was provided for them at the School it would not only help to keep these children in better health but it would also assist us to secure a more regular attendance in some of our Day Schools.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a list of supplies which I consider may be required during the coming Winter and Spring. In reference to potatoes being included therein I have to advise that the potato crop in this Agency was very poor this year. It was a total failure on the Moose Woods and Kinistino Reserves. This crop was also very disappointing on the James Smith's Reserve.\n\nIn reference to the supplies requested for the School now being built on the Kinistino Reserve I beg to refer to my letter No. 2410-6-31, dated May 26th last, which I advised in part as follows:\n\n\"It will be necessary to provide a noon-day meal as well as extra rations in order to secure attendance, as the parents are roamers and make their living by doing odd jobs for the settlers adjoining the Reserve, some hunting, and hay-making. In the Winter months the families who own cattle live at the Winter hay-camp, a distance of 12 miles from the School, as this is the only point at which feed can be procured in sufficient quantities. Arrangements could be made to board their children with families living near the School by supplying them with the following; 12-98s flour, 450 lbs. Beef and 25 lbs. Tea.\"\n\nI recommend that the supplies mentioned on the attached list be provided and that authority be granted to purchase them as they are required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. T. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSHS:GWN\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit attached letter from Mr. Simpson re midday meals for the day schools in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nThe supplies asked for are in addition to the small allowance now made these schools.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending this requisition be granted as I believe the quantities asked for are necessary in the interests of the children's health.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDuck Lake, Sask., November 6th, 1937\n\nSir;\n\nI beg to request authority to purchase for the John Smith's Indian Day School the following:\n\n2 Six inch Stove Pipe Elbows,\n3 Window glass 12\" X 24\"\n2 lbs. putty.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H.

If these amounts are additional, it should be distinctly understood that authority for the purchase is being given this year owing to prevailing economic conditions and the amounts allowed are not to be taken as a precedent for future years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It is also noted that there will be an item of approximately $4.00 for cartage.\n\nThis means that the total amount authorized for repairs to the John Smith's School will be $242.56. We have already authorized repairs and improvements at the other Day Schools in the Duck Lake Agency and the amount authorized at the John Smith's School exhausts the sum provided in the current year's appropriation. It will, therefore, not be possible to consider further repairs and improvements at the schools in the Duck Lake Agency during the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Luckraft. There are\n29 pupils on the roll and the average attendance is 24.\n\nCondition of buildings\n\nSchool and teacher's residence is in very good\nstate of repair, except that the school and children's\ndining room are very cold in winter. The teacher has\nrequested that these buildings be insulated this Fall\nwith shavings and Mr. Simpson, the Agent, is of the\nopinion that if this is carried out it will effect quite a\nsaving in fuel, practically enough to pay for the insula-\ntion. The teacher also complains that the children were\nnot getting sufficient food to provide a good midday meal\nas there was only $45.00 allowed last year for this\npurpose and Mr. Luckraft asked if possible that this be\nincreased this year.\nOttawa, August 11, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a recent report from Mr. M. Christianson, he refers to the condition of the John Smiths School and teacher's residence. He states that the teacher has requested that the buildings be insulated this fall with shavings.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our discussion during your recent inspection of this Agency pertaining to the Day School and children's dining room at the John Smiths Reserve being very cold during the winter months, I beg to report as follows:\n\nIt is considered that if the ceiling floors of these buildings are insulated with shavings prepared for this purpose it would prevent to a great extent the heat generated in the buildings from escaping. It would also insulate the ceilings against the cold drafts of air that penetrate into the attics of these buildings.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of insulation would be taken care of within two or three years due to the reduction in the quantity of fuel that would be required after the work was completed.\n\nI recommend that this work be done and request authority to have it completed before the school re-opens on October 1st, next.\n\nForm No. 37 listing the cost of materials and labour required are attached hereto.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. H. SIMPSON\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nFederal Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSHS/H.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am herewith attaching a Requisition for $48.00 submitted by Agent Simpson for the purpose of insulating the school on the John Smith Reserve.\n\nThis is referred to on Page 9 of my report on the Duck Lake Agency dated July 15th last, and I would recommend that it be allowed as it is going to effect a considerable saving in fuel.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, August 14, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $48.00 for insulating the John Smith Indian Day School. It is noted that this amount includes the cost of both material and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen.Supt. of Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nCor. Searth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nJuly 15th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReport on Duck Lake Agency\n\nI wish to report on my inspection trip to the Duck Lake Agency, which I began on June 16th last.\n\nJohn Smith Indian Day School\n\nCondition of building:\n\nSchool and teacher's residence is in very good state of repair, except that the school and children's dining room are very cold in winter. The teacher has requested that these buildings be insulated this Fall with shavings and Mr. Simpson, the Agent, is of the opinion that if this is carried out it will effect quite a saving in fuel, practically enough to pay for the insulation. The teacher also complains that the children were not getting sufficient food to provide a good midday meal as there was only $45.00 allowed last year for this purpose and Mr. Luckraft asked if possible that this be increased this year.\n\nM. Christianson\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nAugust 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 109-5-5 dated August 11th, I beg to report that on the 9th instant I submitted a recommendation to Mr. M. Christiansen to have the John Smith School and children's dining room which is attached to the teacher's residence, insulated this fall.\n\nThe estimated cost of material and labour to complete this work is $48.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

The cost of this extra work exceeded the amount authorized by Departmental letter 109-5-5, dated April 13th, 1943.\n\nThe railing around the open wooden porch of the school was also broken off. On examination it was found the sills and wooden foundation had rotted and was unsafe. The old porch was removed and cement steps and platform constructed, and the wooden top of the old porch replaced thereover. The cement that was used was from that left over after completing the Department Farm Buildings on this reserve in 1939. As this work was absolutely necessary and Mr. Bear had other work waiting which he expected would keep him employed until late this fall, I had him make the necessary repairs which are now permanent. Voucher no. 280 in favour of Mr. Bear, amounting to $11.20 in this connection is attached hereto.\n\nLack of discipline of the school children by their teacher is considered the cause of the damage done by them. The teacher's services were terminated on June 30th.\n\nS.H.

I instructed to have it cleaned out and in the meantime to have ice hauled to the school for drinking and cooking purposes.\n\nThe well was cleaned on January 18th which did not result in procuring a supply of water. This well has never given an adequate supply since it was dug in 1935, and water from other sources has since had to be supplied to the school from time to time. I have been advised that it was located away from the well sunk in 1926 which had a good supply of water but was abandoned on account of the cribbing having rotted and caved in.\n\nI recommend that a new well be dug near the site of the 1926 well early in April when the frost is out of the ground. Form No. 37 is attached hereto listing the materials and labour required for this work. The price of the lumber was quoted by the North Star Lumber Company, Prince Albert, who advised that there is no rough lumber available and that the usual 10 per cent discount allowed cannot be given due to recent regulations made by the War Time Prices and Trade Board.\n\nI beg to request authority to expend the sum of $4.00 per month to employ Indian labour to haul ice or water for the Day School and Teacher's residence until other arrangements can be made.\n\nVoucher No. 685, $4.50 in favour of Gilbert Crain is attached hereto for ice supplied to cover requirements for January and part of February, 1944.\n\nS.H.

It only consists of one ply of lumber. A new floor of one ply of lumber is required to cover the worn parts of the old one and particularly to strengthen it. Experienced Indian labour is available at this reserve to do the necessary work. The other materials listed to finish the flooring and interior cleaning of the house.\n\n**Moose Woods Sioux Day School - Teacher's Residence - $18.00**\n\nFive window blinds are needed to replace the old ones which have worn out, the other materials are needed for cleaning of the home.\n\n**Moose Woods Sioux Day School - School House - $60.00**\n\nThe interior of this building is badly in need of interior decorating. Indian labour to do the necessary work is available at the reserve.\n\n**Fort a la Corne North Day School - Teacher Residence - $35.00**\n\nInterior cleaning of this home is needed. The wall paper is required for the dining and sitting rooms.\n\n**Fort a la Corne North Day School - School House - $86.00**\n\nThe interior of this building requires re-decorating. Labour is available to do the work.\n\n**Fort a la Corne South Day School - School House - $92.00**\n\nThe interior of this building is in need of re-decoration. Indian labour is available for this work.\n\n**Fort a la Corne South Day School - Teacher's Residence - $4.00**\n\n**Kinistino Day School - Teacher's Residence - $32.00**\n\nThe materials listed are for interior decorating required in this home.\n\nIf there are any funds available for outside repairs to school buildings provision should be made to do all buildings at the Fort a la Corne North School which are very badly in need of re-painting. The buildings at the South School also should be done, but at present are in better condition than those at the other school. Both these items are listed in the estimates.\n\nS.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIn the 1944-45 Estimates, Duck Lake Agency, a request was made for interior decorations of the teachers' residences, at John Smith's Reserve, Moose Woods Sioux Reserve, James Smith Reserve, and Kinistino Reserve.\n\nI would recommend that these be approved of and granted. Mr. Simpson, the Agent, states that with respect to the interior decorations at the John Smith Day School the floors in the dining room and hall way are badly worn and in the first place there is only a one-ply lumber. There is sufficient experienced Indian labour on the reserve to do the work.\n\nThe Agent also requests that if funds are available outside repairs be made to the Fort A La Corne North Indian Day School. This building is in bad need of re-painting. I also notice that the South School on the same reserve could do with a re-painting but at the present time it is in better shape than the school north of it.\n\nM.

Owen Owens for a grant to establish a boarding school at St. Andrew's Mission Keys Reserve, Swan River Agency, I beg to say that there are 621 Indians in this agency, 167 of whom are Anglicans, 167 Presbyterians, 34 Roman Catholics and 223 Pagans. The Presbyterians have a boarding school on Cote's Reserve.\n\nIt seems that every Protestant denomination, as well as the Roman Catholics engaged in Indian work in the North-West, appears to think that they are entitled to a boarding school on the particular reserve on which they are working, ostensibly for the education of Indian children, but in reality for the support of the mission, and there is no limit to their demands for this class of school.\n\nYou will see by the statement I sent you a few days ago, showing the accommodation of the different boarding and industrial schools, that there is no necessity for increasing their number at present. There are vacancies at the Elkhorn Industrial school where the children of Indians belonging to the Church of England could be sent.\n\nThe Government has never taken the initiative in establishing boarding schools as yet, and I do not think they should do so in this case.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo The Hon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nSir,\n\nAs teacher of Key's School and Missionary in charge of the S. Andrew Anglican Mission, Key's Reserve, permit me to request your immediate consideration of educational matters on Key's Reserve and Key's Band.\n\nWe have as you are aware a Day School here. It has been in continuous work since the year 1885. As far as a Day School can be it has been a success.\n\nWhen this school was first opened every family on the Reserve were living at a distance of not more than one mile and a half from the school house. Attendance at school in such a case might be expected to be regular, but the average attendance then was not much higher than it is now. I took charge of the school on the first of July 1896 and have been always diligent in persuading parents to keep their children regularly at school with no time better results than an average equal to one half of the number of pupils on the school roll. Of late years the tents have had to scatter all over the Reserve in amount of the increasing quantity of hay required for each man's cattle. So that to-day we have only three families living within two miles of the school. The remainder are located in various directions extending from two and one half to about 5 miles by trail from the school house. Nearly all these families have one or more children close on school age but there are no elderly children to bring them to school from such a distance. Even if they had judging by past experience their attendance would so intermittent as to make permanent progress in their case very small. So small that in a few years after leaving school they will have forgotten nearly everything even the little English that may have been forced upon them.\n\nThe whole band are fully alive to the immediate need of a better educational system for their children. The chief and every other head of a family on the Reserve have twice this summer come to me requesting in the most pressing manner that I should call your attention and the attention of the Bishop Qu'Appelle to their urgent need of a boarding school for their children. They promised that twenty-five pupils would be forthcoming for a boarding school at once on its opening. The chief and headmen also desired me to tell you and the Bishop that they have a promise from the portion of the band that have not yet settled here; but who are now and always have been leading a wandering life, hunting and fishing; that they will furnish many pupils for a boarding school if one is opened here on their own reserve.\n\nMy own opinion is that if half of the promises are fulfilled, accommodation for thirty-five at least will be acquired within twelve months of the date of opening the school. It is perfectly useless to speak to them of sending their children away to distant schools as not only most of those that did go only came back to die, but also the education received has in most cases been of a character little suited to the needs of their future mode of life. I can bear witness to the undoubted fact that the pupils of the Boarding Schools in this and the Touchwood Hills Agencies have given satisfaction almost all whereas in the same Agencies the pupils of distant schools have not been a success. In fact some of them are decidedly detrimental in their influence on their less favoured friends. It is so here that any Missionary Teacher\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTeacher or Government Officer who would advocate sending more children to distant schools would forfeit all of what influence for good he might otherwise possess and justly so as all persons qualified to speak could tell you.\n\nI have already told you the conditions of attendance at the Day School here. I may be allowed to state farther that the most important part of an Indian child's education\u2014the implanting of permanent habits of regularity and industry\u2014is impossible in a day school.\n\nI therefore beg you will give your most favorable consideration of this and that you do cause to be placed in the hands of your Indian Agent here a sum sufficient to provide accommodation for thirty-five pupils and the necessary staff as well as making provision for maintenance of say 25 pupils for the first 6 months and 35 the following 6 months. Also provision should be made for plain furniture, etc.\n\nThe Secretary of the Executive of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle requested me to say to the Indians that if the Indian Department are willing to take the initiative and build the accommodation required they will be very glad to manage the school and do their accustomed part. I hardly tell you that the present is in every sense favorable to the commencement of a Boarding School here.\n\nI am now boarding and clothing two Indian children both motherless. We could have 5 or 6 others almost as indigent this winter, but I cannot afford to feed them; have you no means of meeting such cases in any way?\n\nIn conclusion I have to point out that a substantial building costing from $5000, up would be more economical in the end than a cheaper building. You can dispense with the expense of an architect, as your Agent here has a considerable experience and talent in that way. He is economy itself too.\n\nMay I request you to see that Hon. C. Sifton has an opportunity of reading this letter. Please reply.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n(sgd.) Owen Owens.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter from Rev. Mr. Owen Owens of Key's Reserve for your consideration. I am not sure that such an attendance could be secured as anticipated by him. In regard to the building itself, I might say that Catholics and Presbyterians of the District have erected their buildings at no cost to the Department and might be found unadvisable to do otherwise in the present case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nHon. Clifford Sifton,\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Brown,\n\nWhat school accommodation generally in your district?\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 27th December, 1904.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:-\n\nThe Indian Commissioner under date the 17th instant encloses a copy of a letter from the Rev. Owen Owens, Church of England Missionary on the Key's Reserve, urging upon the Department the advisability of establishing a boarding school there.\n\nThe total population of the Pelly Agency is 473. The last census gives the membership of the Church of England as only 47; the remainder being made up of 178 Presbyterians, 75 Roman Catholics, and 153 Pagans. There are two boarding schools already in operation there - the Crowstand conducted by the Presbyterians, which has an enrolment of 45 with an average attendance of 41. The Roman Catholics have a boarding school at Kisickonse which is not yet in receipt of the Government grant, but will be recognized when the St. Boniface deal is consummated. No returns are received from this school but I understand that they have an enrolment of about 15. The two Church of England day schools in the Agency, one on the Key's Reserve with an enrolment of 19, and the other at Shoal River with 25 on the roll. There are only about 120 children of school age in the Agency, and the present school enrolment accounts for about 92 of this number.\n\nMr. Owen's scheme would involve an immediate outlay of about $5,000.00 for buildings, $1,800.00 for the maintenance of 25 pupils and an additional $1,000.00 for equipment, and\n\nI do\nI do not think the Department could look to the Church of England for any substantial assistance either for buildings or maintenance as they have no money to spend. Mr. Owens has evidently taken his cue from the Minister's speech on the School Estimates in which he expressed himself in favor of the boarding school as affording the best means of educating and civilizing the Indian. I do not think the children of this Agency would suffer if action is delayed. The Church of England have a General Secretary for Indian Mission work and applications such as this should, I think, come through that officer, and the Department would then be in a position to find out how far the Missionary Society is able and willing to contribute to such work.\n\nMartin Bower\nOTTAWA, 30th December, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant enclosing a copy of a communication from Rev. Owen Owens, Ch. of England missionary on St Peter's reserve, urging upon the Department the advisability of establishing a boarding school there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot see its way clear to grant this request.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nI beg to say that when Inspr. Graham was at Key's reserve recently the Indians asked him to reopen a day school on that reserve. Mr. Graham asked me to see the Indians and have them guarantee to send 10 children daily to school and then write the Department about it. I saw the Band a few days ago re Surrender of Church Plot and at the same time they asked re School. They guarantee to send an average of ten pupils to school daily if the school is moved to a central location, as it now is at the extreme South east of the settlement. The Band agreed to move the school to a central location but it is a rough east house and would be ruined if moved. The farmer at Key's however needs a grainary and store house and the Indians agree to leave the old school house for him and to get out new logs and build a new school if the Department will supply the shingles door windows lumber for roof and floor and nails. They also said if the Department wished to supply the shingles lumber windows door and nails for a house for the teacher that they would build it, that is get logs and build the house complete. It would take approximately $200.00 for the necessary material for the school and a similar amount for the teachers house. If the Department approves of starting a school there it will be advisable to have the Indians get the logs out at once and put up the buildings before spring so as not to interfere with their spring work.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the Department's letter of the 27th March 1911, No. 117074/1, I beg to say that on my last visit to the reserve paying interest money, the Band again asked about the school and requested me to write the Dept. again. They have a school but it is too extreme south and remote from all the children and would have to be moved at least three miles to be near the children.\n\nThe Indians said that they would get out logs and put up the walls and complete the school house if the Department will furnish the lumber, shingles, door, windows, nails and tarpaper and furnish the school material and desks, stove and such necessaries. This is the only thing that can be done if a school is to be started on that reserve, because the old building could not be moved except at a heavy expense. Mr. Farmer Dean, phoned me that the Rev. Mr. Western, who has charge of the Anglican Mission on Key Reserve, said his church would build a teacher's house and supply a teacher. A school about 15' x 22' would be ample for that Reserve. If the Department considers building there I will be glad to be advised at once so that the logs may be taken out on sleighs. I will send a detailed statement of material needed if the Department decides to build the school, but the outlay will be small on a building of that size.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.G.

His absence from home visiting the Indian School at Touchwood has prevented my answering your request for information on the Macdonald Standing experience.\n\nThe teacher in England for a year has been teaching the language in England and for a year has been teaching in the Public Schools in this Province.

You will understand that I do not in the least bit want to have any friction or to interfere in any way with the regulations of the Department, but I shall be grateful if you will communicate with your agent in charge of this reserve about the matter. There is no unfriendliness whatever between our teacher there and the Roman Catholic authorities at S. Philip's.

The Department does not understand your reference to the transfer of these children. There are Roman Catholic boarding schools at which these children could attend and on no condition is the admission of Roman Catholic children to a Protestant school and vice versa allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Venerable Archdeacon Dobie,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Cyril G. Markham, teacher and Lay-Reader in charge of the Day school on Key's reserve. Mr. Markham makes a request to be allowed to teach school on one Saturday a month instead of on Monday in order that he may carry on his missionary work to better advantage. This request seems to me to be reasonable and I would ask that it be granted.\n\nYou will note that the water closets referred to in my report of last October have not yet been built, although the lumber was granted and has been on the ground for some time. It seems to me the Agent should have had this work done long ago. The stable too, which is half built, could have been finished if the proper effort had been made. It does not look very hopeful for the future of this school if the Officer in charge of the Agency takes so little interest in it that matters of this kind do not receive attention promptly.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Walter Western of Pelly, to lay the following matter before you.\n\nOne Sunday in every four he visits the Mission Church here to give the Indians a Celebration of the Holy Eucharist and on that Sunday I take his duty at White Beech, on Thunder Hill, at least thirty-two miles from here. Hitherto I have been at school on time on Monday morning, but this entails getting from White Beech to Pelly on Sunday night and leaving Pelly about 5 a.m. Monday morning & riding 15 miles to school. I have done this so far, but it is very tiring both for me and my pony. What we wished to ask is your permission to close the school on that one Monday a month and teach on the following Saturday instead. I do not think that in so doing the efficiency of the school would be in any way impaired.\n\nThe attendance and progress of the children since your visit of inspection has been very satisfactory. The children begin to understand English and I have gone slowing with them and have the satisfaction of knowing that what they can read they understand.\n\nI wish I could say the same of the school grounds. The stable is as yet unfinished and I had to stable my horse a half mile from school all winter and walk through the snow. I am at present trying to get the land behind the school ploughed for a garden. I think however I shall be successful in this. The privies for which lumber was granted are not up. The Indians go not seem at all willing to do anything for which they are not paid. I think perhaps a word from you to some of them on your next visit would materially help things.

Dance, a matriculate of London University and a student of St. Chad's College, Regina, as teacher in the place of Mr. A.J. Lawes, on Keyes Indian Reserve. I am not sure that Mr. Dance will be able to remain at his post after Christmas, but it is difficult to obtain the services of a regular teacher when nearly all of the young men of the Church of England are in the C.E.F.

Archdeacon Dobie and he informed me that the Church of England authorities had appointed Mr. Frank Browly as teacher at the Day School on Keys Reserve to succeed Mr. Tyson who formerly held the appointment. I presume that Mr. Browly will be paid the same salary as that paid to Mr. Fielden-Taylor as stated in your No. 117,074-1 of the 6th June, 1919.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

The last returns received show that this school has been closed since July, 1920; the former teacher, Mr. Fielden-Taylor, being transferred to the James Smith's school. I will be pleased if you will ascertain the qualifications which Mr. Browly possesses, and also the date on which he began duties. I would also like to be informed as to whether it is the intention to carry on the work during the summer.\n\nThe amount of salary allowed will depend on the qualifications which Mr. Browly possesses. If equal to those of Mr. Fielden-Taylor, he will be paid at the same rate, viz: $750.00 per annum, together with bonus provided teachers in the Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

No. 117-4-1 regarding the appointment of Mr. Frank Browly as teacher at the Day School on Keys Reserve.\n\nI note that this is the first intimation the Department had received of a teacher having been appointed at that point. The reason the school closed last July was that the teacher resigned, and the Church authorities were unable to find another to take his place, and have only now succeeded in getting Mr. Browly. The former teacher Mr. Fielden-Taylor, was paid, I understand, $720.00 per annum. He had no certificate, but was well educated. I understand Mr. Browly has no certificate, but is as well qualified to teach as Mr. Taylor was. I got this information from Archdeacon Dobie this morning. Mr. Browly understands that he will receive the same salary as Mr. Taylor received. This, I understand is agreeable to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It is considered that, unless he can furnish a sufficient reason for his absence for the length of time taken by him, payment of salary for the period the school was closed cannot be made. When forwarding his return for the current quarter, you should state thereon the dates between which he was absent, and he should also furnish a full explanation.

ANDREW'S DAY SCHOOL, KEY RESERVE.\n\nAs I had to use the school while making the interest payments the teacher had to dismiss the children for that afternoon. I believe there were seven children present. Both the school and the teacher's residence here are in a good state of repair and the yard and surroundings were neat and clean. I am of the opinion that Mr. Kerley is a good teacher. The biggest difficulty is that there are so few children on the reserve, and as some of the families are Roman Catholics, no doubt when the new Catholic school is built on the Keeseekoosce reserve those children which are of that faith will be going there.\nRegina, Sask., May 16, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am herewith enclosing Inspector Christianson's report on the schools in the Belly Agency.\n\nThe work in the little Anglican school on the Key reserve seems to be progressing satisfactorily.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nA new building of the improved type has been erected since my last visit, the old building having been destroyed by fire this spring.\n\nThere are 8 pupils registered and the grades range from 1 to 6. These children appear well along in their grades and I think Mr. Kerley, the teacher, is doing good work. In addition to the classroom work, each summer the children put in large gardens, the work of which Mr. Kerley supervises. This year the vegetables are excellent and there will be abundance of potatoes, carrots, beets and onions with which to supply the noon-day meal, which meal is prepared by Mrs. Kerley.\n\nThe verandah on the teacher's residence has been screened during the summer and this has made a great improvement as it was practically useless before.\n\nThe house\n\nST. ANDREW'S DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe house is in good repair and the upkeep in connection with the school should not amount to much for some time.\nKEY DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on two occasions, but was not there when the children were in class. I saw the children, however, and they appeared to be quite clean, well clothed, and had a happy appearance. There are 10 pupils enrolled, 7 boys and 3 girls. Two of these, I believe, are only attending temporarily pending their return to the boarding school. The School Inspector had visited them shortly before my arrival, and I understand was quite pleased with the progress they are making in their studies.\n\nI found both the teacher's cottage and the schoolroom in a good state of repair. There is a large vegetable garden, in which the children are given individual plots to care for. The garden has been well cared for, and has produced a fine crop, principally potatoes.\nKEY DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nPotatoes, carrots, onions, and turnips. I have seldom seen vegetables of a finer quality. The children are permitted to take the produce from their individual plots, to their homes as the teacher has a sufficiently large garden to provide the requirements for the mid-day meal, which is provided at this school.\n\nMr. W. J. D. Kerley, the teacher, appears to be well qualified. He has a second class teacher's certificate.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

They were well clothed, and clean.\n\nThe building is in good repair, and the playgrounds tidy.\n\nA garden is planted each year and the vegetables used in the preparation of the noon-day meal for the children.

Rourke, farming instructor at the Key's Reserve, resigned as from 1st May and his work is now being attended to by Mr. Kerley, the Day School Teacher at that reserve, who finds there is a great deal to do, as farming conditions were in bad shape and very little had been done in preparation for seeding. However, the Indians of that reserve are now working well and will no doubt have at least as much in crop as last year and perhaps more. The teaching of the Day School is continuing under Mrs. Kerley while Mr. Kerley is attending to the other work.\n\nJ. P. B. Gistrander,\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 17th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 11th instant that Mrs. J. D. Kerley is temporarily in charge of the Key's Indian Day School.\n\nPlease let me know, at once, Mrs. Kerley's age, also her qualifications and experience as a teacher. You might, also, state if Mrs. Kerley has any children and, if so, give their approximate ages.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. P. B. OSTRANDER, ESQ.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\n28th May, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th instant, No.117-4-1, I have to say that when the Farming Instructor at the Key's Reserve resigned as from 1st May the work of the Indians in connection with seeding had just commenced, and as I am without a clerk at the Agency I was unable to devote much of my time to the farming at that point.\n\nDr. Robertson authorized me to arrange for Mrs. Kerley to temporarily continue with the classroom work at the Key's Day School in order to allow Mr. Kerley some freedom to get about the Reserve and encourage and assist the Indians to get their crop in in time.\n\nMrs. Kerley is thirty-five years of age. She is not qualified to teach school in this province, but informs me that she taught a little over a year as supplementary teacher for primary work in a school in London, England. This is the only experience she has had, but as Mr. Kerley is with her off and on during the day the classroom work is going on practically the same as before.\n\nThey have two children, a boy of eight and a half years and a girl of six and a half years, and so far as I am aware Mrs. Kerley is not wishing to be appointed as teacher at the school and is only assisting us temporarily until some arrangement can be made. If your inquiry is made with a view to considering appointing Mrs. Kerley as teacher, I would respectfully suggest that no further consideration be given to the matter. However, she could certainly continue to teach for the remainder of this term without any material damage being done to the welfare of the pupils of the school.\nMr. Kerley would like to be appointed permanently as farming instructor or clerk at this Agency, preferably as clerk, both of which positions are now vacant, and he is capable of filling either position to the satisfaction of all concerned, but in either case Mrs. Kerley would not want to continue teaching the Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, December 26, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that Mr. W.J.D. Kerley, teacher of the Key's Indian Day School, will be appointed in the near future as temporary clerk at the Pelly Agency. If he is appointed temporary clerk, it will be necessary for him to give up duties as teacher of the Key School, as present regulations will not permit our paying him salary for two different positions.\n\nInformation on our files indicates that Mrs. Kerley is not a qualified teacher. In any case the Department could not approve of her appointment, as present regulations do not allow us to employ married women whose husbands are in a position to support them.\n\nIn view of the above, it will be necessary to secure a new teacher for the Key's Indian Day School at the earliest possible date and, as we have always permitted the Church of England authorities to nominate the teacher for this school, I would appreciate your interviewing Right Reverend E.H. Knowles, Bishop of Qu'Appelle, Regina, Saskatchewan, with a view to having him nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school immediately.\n\nAs soon as...\nAs soon as you have received the nomination from the Bishop you should advise me, giving full particulars.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A total of $26.00 credit on the account leaves today owing the sum of $57.41. Last payment on account was $10.00 on December 6th 1938.\n\nI have written to Jolley in a decent way for Mr. Chaloner asking for settlement of the account, and Chaloner was willing to clear the account by partial payments, but, Jolley, ignores the letter I have written him, has ignored the bills and statements of accounts Chaloner has sent him, and now of course does not come near Chaloner's established place of business, and the matter irks Mr. Chaloner.\n\nHence this letter, appealing to you, to arrange to have Mr Jolley make settlement of this account either direct with my client, or by means of payments out of his salary from the Department. It is ridiculous that a man of Mr Jolley's standing should act thusly with a fair and decent minded business man like Chaloner and I think the case warrants your consideration.\n\nI will be obliged if you would write to either myself or Mr Chaloner at once advising what assistance you will give.

However, it is hoped that Mr. Jolley will be able to return to duty at an early date. It is noted from your letter that no extra salary will have to be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to advise you that the Rev. John Jolley, our teacher at the Key Indian Day School, Norquay P.O., Sask., has, owing to reasons of health, placed his resignation in my hands. I have recently seen him about the matter and am convinced that it is better for him to resign for the reason of his health. I would therefore submit to you the name of the Rev. James Marsden Buck, whose address is - The Vicarage, Togo, Sask., as his successor.\n\nMr. Buck was born in this Province, his father being a farmer in the Moosomin district. He is a young man of ability and promise. Before entering our St. Chad's Theological College, Regina, of which he is a graduate, he completed his grade XII standing in the Province of Saskatchewan in full and therefore understands fully the teaching system of this Province.\n\nFor some time Mr. Buck has expressed the desire to take up Indian work and I feel that he is in every way capable of it. May I, therefore, commend him to you for appointment as teacher of the Indian Day School on Key I.R. I understand that the appointment would be as from October 1st. next, which, Inspector Christianson informs me, is the date on which this school would re-open.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Qu'Appelle.\nOttawa, August 19, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of the 14th instant, in which you submit, for departmental approval, the nomination of Reverend James Marsden Buck for the position of teacher of the Key Indian Day School, Norquay P. O., Sask.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Buck has secured Grade XII standing in the province of Saskatchewan, in addition to his theological training. It does not appear, however, that he has at any time taken the regular normal school course for teachers in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nI may state that about two years ago Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, complained rather vigorously to the Department that a number of the teachers nominated by the Churches were wholly unsuitable for work on Indian reserves. Dr. Robertson at that time had in mind teachers with full academic and professional standing and with some training or experience in agricultural methods. The matter was very fully discussed at that time and Bishop Burd, during one of his visits to the East, went into the problem very fully with the officials here and, if I remember correctly, with the Minister. It was finally decided by Bishop Burd that only teachers with full professional and academic standing would be nominated by him for positions at Indian day schools. Dr. Robertson was finally persuaded\n\nthat -\n\nRight Reverend E. H. Knowles, LL.B., D.D.,\nBishop of Qu'Appelle,\nBishop's Court,\nRegina, Sask.\nthat this was all we could possibly expect from the church authorities. If we now accept for the position at the Key School a teacher lacking professional qualifications, I am afraid that such an appointment may create a certain amount of dissatisfaction in other sections of Saskatchewan, particularly in the northern districts. It is just possible that there may be a scarcity of teachers in the immediate future and that we may have to appoint teachers lacking professional qualifications. I do feel, however, in the meantime, that a fully qualified teacher should be nominated for the Key School or that we should have, in writing, a statement intimating that it has not been found possible to secure a fully qualified teacher at this particular time.\n\nI regret to trouble Your Lordship with this matter, but you will, I feel sure, readily appreciate the position in which I find myself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the matter of a school teacher for the Key Reserve, Pelly Agency, Kamsack.\n\nAs you are aware, Mr. and Mrs. Jolly have been stationed there. Mr. Jolly, who was the Missionary and teacher, took sick some time last Spring and had to come to Regina for medical treatment. Mrs. Jolly, however, finished up the term there. When I made my inspection of the Agency they were at Carlyle Lake.\n\nBishop Knowles was in the Office yesterday morning and informed me that Mr. and Mrs. Jolly were unable to return to Keys, which pleased me greatly as I knew these people very well a few years ago when they were at Day Star, and their work was not very satisfactory. He, however, suggested the Reverend James Marsden Buck, who is at the present time stationed at Togo, Saskatchewan, as teacher for Key School. Mr. and Mrs. Buck, he informed me, were born on farms around Moosomin, both have had Grade XII but did not take Normal training. Personally, I believe their services would be satisfactory and a great improvement on Mr. and Mrs. Jolly.\n\nThe Bishop is writing direct to the Department and I advised him that I also would write this letter. In due course we shall be glad to know the decision of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant in which you discuss a vacancy that has occurred at the day school on the Key Reserve owing to the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Jolly.\n\nWe have experienced, as you are probably aware, in recent years, a great deal of difficulty in the appointment of teachers at Indian day schools in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nBishop Burd visited the Department about two years ago and entered into an agreement with us at that time that only fully qualified teachers would be nominated by him for work at Indian day schools in his Diocese. It occurred to me, therefore, when the Bishop sent forward the name of the Rev. James Marsden Buck, who lacks professional qualifications, that I should remind him of the understanding reached with Bishop Burd and do all I possibly could to secure a fully qualified teacher for the Key School. Inasmuch as this problem is likely to confront you from time to time in the future I am sending forward for your information copy of my letter to Bishop Knowles.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-1, part 1)\nAugust 23rd., 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th inst. in regard to the appointment of the Rev. J.M. Buck of Togo, Sask., to the Indian School on the Key Indian Reserve. I have noted carefully what you say with regard to the person to be appointed to this work having professional qualifications, i.e. a Normal School training. This point was carefully considered by us before we recommended Mr. Buck for the position as at present we have not a clergyman in Orders in this Diocese who has a Normal School Certificate and is available for this work.\n\nWhile we have every regard for the desire of the Department to always have professional teachers in our Indian Schools yet may I suggest to you that there are other qualifications which might easily far exceed the advantage of Normal School training so far as the particular work on Key Indian Reserve is concerned. The school is not a large one and the pupils are not nearly as far advanced as they are in some other Indian Day Schools. Again, important as the teaching experience is, yet in our purview it is even more important on this particular Reserve that the teacher and his wife would be people who in their social life with the Indians and the help that they could give them in their daily life and work is a most important factor. In this we have no doubt in assuring you that the Rev. J.M. Buck and his wife are highly qualified and we do not think for a moment that the lack of a professional certificate will in any way hinder the good work that it is possible for this man and wife to do for your Indian people on this Reserve.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nIf I could secure a clergyman who is a qualified teacher I would not hesitate in doing so but, as before stated, we have not one amongst our clergy at the moment who could satisfy this requirement. May I therefore ask that under these circumstances you would reconsider the appointment of Mr. Buck.\n\nI am,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nAugust 28, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of August 23 in which you submit additional information with respect to the qualifications of the Rev. J. M. Buck of Tege, Sask., for the position of teacher of the Key Reserve Indian Day School.\n\nI have discussed this appointment very fully with Mr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, who called at my office a day or so ago. It is noted that you find it impossible to secure a missionary or clergyman who is at the same time a fully qualified teacher. In view of this fact I am prepared to approve of the appointment of Mr. Buck for the coming academic year.\n\nIn view of the existing regulations that only teachers with full academic and professional qualifications should be employed I have been wondering if it would be possible for Mr. Buck to make an arrangement with the Saskatchewan educational authorities whereby he could take up part, at least, of his professional course at one of the summer schools provided for teachers in the Province of Saskatchewan. I make this suggestion in view of existing regulations and in order to avoid misunderstandings and friction, with respect to the employment of teachers lacking full professional standing, that may arise in other districts of the Province.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

Saskatchewan.\n[DELLY DETACHMENT CASE]\n\n19-7-42\n\nOn this date, the Rev. J.M. BUCK, Anglican Minister and Indian school teacher, employed at the Indian School on the Keys Indian Reserve, called at this detachment and complained that during the first week in July this year, some persons had unlawfully entered the storehouse in his school by means of a skeleton key and had stolen therefrom four dresses, two coats and various other articles of clothing. Mr. Buck went on to say that the clothing stolen was part of a bale of used clothes sent to the Reserve by the Anglican Church in Ontario for distribution amongst the needy Indians. It was learned that at the time of the offence, Complainant and his wife were away on vacation. Mr. BUCK stated that actually the clothes stolen were not of a very great value but previous petty thefts had been committed in and about the school premises and he felt that the matter should be investigated. As good a description as possible was obtained from Complainant but due to the fact that he and his wife had only casually checked over the bale, complete description was not available.\n\nMr. BUCK gave good reasons for believing that two Indian girls - the captionally noted - were responsible for the offence, but he stated that at the moment they were both away to the Yorkton Fair and he understood that from there they were going to the Regina Fair and that therefore it would be useless to make a patrol to the Reserve. He stated that he would advise us when the girls were at home on the Reserve.\n\nRecently, information was received that the two suspects had returned to the Reserve, therefore, on the p.m. of the 7th Inst., whilst in Porcupine on other duties, patrol was extended per /car Code # 8127 to the Keys Indian Reserve for the purpose of investigating this complaint. On arrival, Rev. BUCK and his wife interviewed and further information obtained. It was learned that on a recent date, Evelyn CALDWELL had called on Mrs. BUCK and handed her a brown flannel dress, complete with belo which they positively identified as being one of the dresses stolen herein. Evelyn was questioned by Mrs. BUCK and she stated that Ethel BRASS had given her the dress and that she did not know where she (Ethel) got it but she had since heard that it was stole.\n\nComplainant also went on to state that he had heard that Mr. KANE, resident near the school had found some clothes hidden in the bush near his house. Evelyn CALDWELL had been visiting at the KANE house during the week that this offence was committed.\n\n[CON. ON PAGE 2]\nEthel BRASS (JUVENILE) and Evelyn CALDWELL (T.I.'s)\nB.B. & Theft (460-386) from School Store house\nKeys I.R. Bank.\n\n5. Patrol extended to the house of William Keys. He was away from home but his wife stated that the information obtained was correct. She produced a rose and pink shade girl's light coat and a man's brown suit coat, both garments had been chewed by gobers and were now of little or no value. The girl's light coat was positively identified by Mr. Buck as being one of those taken from the sale. I took possession of these articles for further investigation.\n\n6. Patrol extended about the Reserve in an effort to locate these two girls for interrogation. Ethel BRASS had gone to Norway with her mother and Evelyn CALDWELL was berry picking, however, after considerable searching, the Caldwell girl was located and in due course the following statement was obtained:\n\nRESIDES: About the beginning of July 1942, Ethel BRASS and I went to the school on the Keys Indian Reserve, it was after dark. Ethel went there to get some blankets which she had left in the school. I knew that Mr. & Mrs. Buck were away. The school is never locked. Ethel went into the school and I stayed on the road allowance. After a short while she came back carrying the blankets; at that time I did not know that she had anything else but the blankets. The next day I found out that she had some dresses etc., wrapped up inside the blankets. I did not find this out until the following evening. She gave me a brown flowered dress, a greyish coat, a blue dress and a little grey skirt. At the time she gave me these clothes I did not know she had stolen them. I thought it was her own as she has lots of clothes. When I found out that these things were stolen, I took the brown flowered dress back to Mrs. Buck, I traded the grey coat with Mrs. Jim Crane for a jacket, I still have the blue dress and the grey skirt at home. I don't know how Ethel got into the storeroom at the school.\n\nSgd. Evelyn Caldwell.\n\n7. Evelyn Caldwell is a member of the Cote band of Indians but is visiting on the Keys Reserve. She does not enjoy a very good reputation, her mother was murdered about 5 years ago by Louis Severight on the Cote Reserve. She is 16 years of age, she will be 17 years next Febry. 22nd, 1943. I felt that she was not telling the whole truth but she stoutly maintained that she was not a party to this offence.\n\n8. The blue dress and the grey skirt were produced and handed over. An effort was made to locate Mrs. Jim Crane in order that we could question her regarding the grey coat but the whole Crane family were away. From other Indians it was learned however that she has the grey coat.\n\n9. My enquiries led me to interview Mrs. Russell BRASS as it was indicated that she had purchased a dress from Ethel BRASS. The following statement was obtained\u2014about a month ago, Ethel BRASS sold me a white dress with green leaves and dots on it. I paid her $3.50 for it. She said she got the dress from Mrs. Bryant, the Agent's wife at Cote Indian Res. I heard some time after I bought the dress that it had been stolen from the school. I never spoke to Ethel about where she got it from. (con. on page 3)\n\nIndian Affairs.

A couple of weeks ago, someone stole\nthis dress from my house, together with another dress,\na grey print one, I have no idea who took them.\n\nSgd. Mrs. Russell Brass.\n\n10. Ethel BRASS was finally located on her return\nfrom Marquay, she gave the following statement:\n\nI was 14 years old last Oct. 31st, 1942. I went as far as\ngrade four in school. About the first week in July this\nyear, Evelyn came and I went to the school on the Keys\nReserve. We knew that there were some bales of clothes in\nthe school store-room and we talked about getting some\ndresses. I first went into the school and tried the store-\nroom door, Evelyn stayed outside and was watching. I could\nnot open the door so then Evelyn came in, she had a skeleton\nkey, which belongs to my mother. Evelyn opened the door\nwith this key and we both went into the store-room. We\nsaw the bale of clothes there and we took, two coats, a pink\none and a greyish one, three dresses, a white one, a blue\none and a brown flowered one, a woman's brown coat and a\nboy's small coat, a black hat and a man's green coloured\nshirt. We also took four exercise books with black covers.\nWe tried on the clothes after we left the school, they were\ntoo small for me but fitted Evelyn. I kept the white dress\nand later sold it to Mrs. R.Bras. Evelyn took the rest of\nthe clothes. If Evelyn says that I gave her these clothes\nshe is lying, we were both together in the storeroom and\none was as bad as the other.\n\nSgd. Ethel Brass.\n\n11. In view of the information in the above statement,\nEvelyn CALDWELL was again located and faced wit Ethel and\nher statement. She at first tried to stay with her original\nstatement but finally gave the following:\n\nThe first statement I gave is not completely true. I was\nnot in the school but I was watching whilst Ethel went in.\nI knew that she intended getting some dresses. I knew that\nthese dresses and clothes were stolen from the school store-\nhouse. After she came out we both went to Archie PARADISE'S\nwe stopped along the road and tried on the dresses, they all\nfitted me. Ethel kept one a brown flowered dress and I kept\nthe rest. Ethel kept a white one with green flowers. I hid\na rose pink coloured girl's coat and a brown checked man's\ncoat near William Keys place.\n\nSgd. Evelyn Caldwell.\n\n12. There are still some discrepancies in the two\nstatements, it will be noted that Ethel claimed that they\nwere both in the store-house, whereas Evelyn claims that\nshe was not; she still maintains that Ethel unlocked the\nstoreroom door and actually removed the clothes, her only\npart being that of a watcher. The two girls were faced\nwith each other and contradicted one another regarding\nthese points.\n\n13. The girls agreed to gather up the clothes still\nmissing which were (CON.

There is no doubt but that both of these girls are guilty of the offence indicated and that they would plead \"Guilty\" should a charge be laid. In spite of the fact that Ethel BRASS appeared to be telling the most complete story, she enjoys a more unsavoury reputation than the girl Evelyn. It is considered that she was the one that thought of and engineered the affair. Mr. HICK reports that she is a very poor pupil and does not attend school regularly. Her father, Solomon BRASS is in the Army, stationed at Saskatoon, her mother is considered a very loose woman and the home atmosphere is far from good. It is suggested that this girl's morals are not of the best, in fact there seems to be a suspicion that she is suffering from venereal disease, contracted from some source whilst she was attending the fairs held at Yorkton Regina & Saskatoon. She denied that she had such disease although admitted that she had recently received a letter from the Chief of Police in Saskatoon, telling her that she was apparently suffering from gonorrhea and advising her to take proper treatment. He stated that she did not know from whom the Chief had obtained this information.\n\n15. Indian Agent BRYANT of Cote I.E. has been contacted in this regard. He stated that he would advise Dr. J.I. WALLACE of Lumsden, Indian Doctor of this possibility and that appropriate steps would be taken to have the girl examined.\n\n16. In view of the fact that a Juvenile is involved herein no Information and Complaint has been laid by the Complainant, although he feels that this girl should be prosecuted. Mr. HICK is rather inclined to the belief that a spell in the Reform School would be a good thing for this girl; however, he states that he will be content to abide by the wishes of the Police or the Bureau of Child Protection. In view of the fact that Evelyn CALDWELL is just past the Juvenile age, he does not feel it would be just right to prosecute Evelyn and not Ethel, particularly when it is considered that Ethel has a more questionable reputation than Evelyn.\n\n17. Personally I feel that this investigation in itself will have a good effect on these girls; however, the Rev. HICK who is personally acquainted with these girls, is rather inclined to favour a prosecution, particularly against the Juvenile, he considers that she is a loose, bad girl and there does appear to be good reasons for his opinion. In view of the facts outlined, it is respectfully requested that the matter be referred to the proper Departments for an expression of their wishes.\n\n18. It might be stated that it is hard to estimate the value of the clothing stolen, however, Complainant places it in the neighbourhood of $5-10.

She has now been cured and the Agent suggests that she be sent to the Gordon School. If this is satisfactory to you I shall take steps to see that this is carried out.\n\nIn the case of Evelyn Caldwell, this girl belongs to the Cote Reserve and has no home there.

Buck is giving up duties at the Key Indian Day School at the end of the current month. His resignation is accepted. I also note that you have already been in touch with Bishop Knowles who expects to be able to nominate a teacher. The salary of the teacher at this school is at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus, and the school will be in operation during the academic year 1943-44 for a period of ten months; namely, September 1, 1943, to June 30, 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJune 7th, 1943\n\nThe Department of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am advised by the Indian Agent (Mr. Bryant) of the Cote Agency, Kamsack, Sask., of the resignation of the Rev. J.M. Buck as teacher of the Indian Day School on the Key Indian Reserve, his resignation to take place as at June 30th, 1943.\n\nI desire to recommend for this appointment the Rev. Walter Thomas Browne, a graduate of St. Chad's College, Regina. Mr. Browne is 28 years of age and was ordained Deacon in 1935 and Priest in 1934 by the Bishop of Qu'Appelle. He is a man of exemplary character and has been a successful Priest in charge of the Missionary District of Rockglen, Sask. He has had no teaching experience in the public schools of this province, but he has proved himself to be most efficient in his parish in Sunday School work and in his methods with young people with whom he is much beloved. I have no hesitation in recommending him for work in this Indian Day School and as Priest in charge of St. Andrew's Mission on the Key Reserve.\n\nI shall be grateful if you would kindly advise me as soon as possible as to whether you approve of Mr. Browne's appointment to this position as men are very difficult to get in these times and I am most anxious to secure the services of this good man for this work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdward Qu'Appelle\nBishop of Qu'Appelle.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Key Indian Day School\nNo. 611\n\nIn my memorandum of June 4, I advised you of the resignation of Rev.

Browne as teacher of the Key School for the academic year 1943-44. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus, for a ten-month period; namely, from September 1, 1943, to June 30, 1944.

As you know none of our teachers come under the superannuation fund; therefore I would be very glad if you would advise me why this was retained and also let me know what Mr. Buck has to do to get the money that has been retained each month. I informed him that I could not give him this information but that I would write to Ottawa.\n\nM.

Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building, Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, you are correct in stating that none of our teachers contribute to the Superannuation Fund. However, a special Order-in-Council, passed in April, 1940, provided that all temporary employees, appointed after September 1, 1939, should have deducted from their salary an amount of 5% monthly. This amount is placed in the Retirement Fund and interest is allowed at the rate of 4%. Principal and interest are refunded to the employee when he leaves the Service of the Dominion Government. I am requesting the Representative of the Treasury to return to the Reverend J. M. Buck the amount due him.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the amount deducted is on the basis of 5% on the basic salary, which in Mr. Buck's case is $90.00 a month. This makes the deduction $4.50 a month.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nBoys' School\n\nWhen I was at the school the children had been discharged\nfor the summer holidays but everything seemed to be in fair shape around\nthe place.

During the past two years we have been very unfortunate with the teachers at the m/n school. The children are making little headway with the present teacher, discipline is very slack, and whilst Mr Brown's intentions are good, he has very little control over the pupils, and no teaching ability. Many complaints are reaching me from the parents that the children are making no progress and in my opinion the complaints are justified. I recently inspected the school, tested some of the pupils and found them very backward, some of the 12 year olds could not read Grade One lessons. I know it is difficult to get teachers at this time, but must report that Mr Brown is unsuitable for the position as teacher and recommend that a change of teachers be made as soon as possible.\n\n2. For your information, please.\n\nJ.L. Bryant\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 20, 1945.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the teacher of the Keys Indian Day School. The Department regrets that his services are not proving satisfactory. We were rather surprised to hear this, in view of the fact that the Public School Inspector, in his report dated October 11, 1944, reported very favourably on the work that was being done by Mr. Brown.\n\nI discussed the contents of your letter with Mr. Hoey, and we feel that Mr. Brown should be allowed to remain until the close of the current academic year. In the meantime we will communicate with the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, with a view to having another teacher appointed for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Mr. Bryant,\n\nI am writing to ask if you would kindly forward this application for an increase of salary on my behalf to the proper authority.\n\nMy present salary is $90.00 per month for 18 months per year. This is $100.00 less than the minimum salary paid to uncertificated teachers in this province.\n\nConsidering the improvement shown in the school, and the greater amount of work entailed owing to the larger number now in attendance, I think that recognition should be made of these factors. I am therefore applying for an increase in salary of $20.00 per month i.e. $300.00 per annum.\n\nTrusting that you will respond favourably\n\nI am yours faithfully\n\nW.J. Brown (Rev.)\n\nTeacher and missionary\nThey Day School\nKey Reserve\nPelly Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from Reverend W.S. Browne, Indian Day School teacher at the Key Reserve, Pelly Agency, asking for an increase of $20.00 per month.\n\nI am forwarding this for the consideration of the Department but I do not recommend it. He has done nothing so far as I am aware to justify an increase in salary and if he becomes dissatisfied and resigns I do not think we will have any difficulty in securing the services of another teacher at least as good and at the salary now being allowed.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 16th November, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant enclosing letter received from Reverend W.S. Browne applying for an increase in salary as teacher of the Keys Indian Day School. The request has received careful consideration but the Department is not prepared to grant him any increase.\n\nIt is interesting to note that he states his salary is $90.00 a month. Evidently he overlooks the fact that in addition to the amount stated he receives $18.42 a month bonus making a total payment of $108.42. From this there is a deduction of $2.40 a month for Income Tax and $4.50 for the Retirement Fund, making a net monthly payment to him of $101.52.\n\nOf course the amount paid to the Retirement Fund is actually compulsory savings as it will be refunded to Mr. Browne when he leaves our employ.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to report that I visited the Key's Indian Day School of the Pelly Agency on the 12th instant in company with Mr. J.L. Bryant, the Indian Agent.\n\nI do not consider Mr. Browne a satisfactory teacher. The discipline in the classroom was about the worst I have ever seen. The children were wandering about the room at will, talking to each other, interrupting each other at their work, interrupting the teacher when he was trying to give lessons to others, and there was a steady procession of children to and from the room.\n\nMore than half of the children were sitting in the classroom with their overshoes on their feet, and their face and hands were not clean, their wearing apparel generally untidy and badly chosen. There were twenty-five names on the roll with eighteen present on that day, but the continuous wandering in and out of the room by the children made it difficult for me to actually check the number of children who were present.\n\nAs to the results of Mr. Browne's teaching, I have nothing favourable to report. I do not believe Mr. Browne knows whether he is accomplishing anything or not. He was endeavouring to teach reading to one class and there was such a noise going on that I could not tell whether the children were reading properly or not.\n\nMr. Browne's personal appearance was certainly no example to the untidy and badly clothed children. He was badly in need of a shave, and was wearing a sweater, a pair of old trousers, and a pair of moccasins. The trousers are apparently the ones he has been wearing when he milks the cow and had an accumulation of milk stains of long standing.\n\nThe habits of personal cleanliness and tidiness of Indian children are bad enough even when the best possible example is set by the teacher; and this is my reason for criticising Mr. Browne's personal appearance.\n\nThe register showed very irregular attendance by many of the children. I instructed Mr. Browne to submit monthly statements to Mr. Bryant of the actual attendance of each child, and........\nattendance of each child, and informed Mr. Bryant if the regular attendance of the children was not improved many of the parents of these children should have their share of family allowance stopped until they realize that regular attendance is essential in order to qualify for family allowance for children of school age.\n\nJ.F.B.

Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 28, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Knowles:\n\nWe have just received a report regarding the Key's Indian Day School. It appears that the services of Rev. Mr. Browne are not satisfactory; it seems practically impossible for him to keep discipline in the classroom. The following comment has also been received regarding this teacher:\n\n\"Mr. Browne's personal appearance was certainly no example to the untidy and badly clothed children. He was badly in need of a shave, and was wearing a sweater, a pair of old trousers, and a pair of moccasins.

However, it would be very much appreciated if you would either interview Rev. Mr. Browne or write to him and suggest that he put forth a special effort for the balance of the current academic year. We hope also that he will give more attention to his personal appearance in the classroom.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nRt. Rev. E.H.

Very few of the day schools have qualified teachers and I think these should be employed by the department and not by any church organization if we are going to get suitable men and women for this very important work. A day school teacher could be employed for the full 12 months, and they should devote considerable in organizing sports and healthy recreation for the young people.\n\nWe have one residential school and two day schools at this agency, but have several pupils from all reserves attending residential schools at other points in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In a residential school good management and an efficient teaching staff are a prime necessity and in St Philips school here, we fortunately have a good teaching staff and a school that is exceptionally well managed. Apart from academic subjects the pupils are taught cooking, sewing, general housework, manual training, field work, care of livestock, and poultry etc. This school is filled to capacity at present and there are several pupils at home at present that should be in school if accommodation was available. There should be provision made for at least another 40 pupils and this may not be sufficient in another ten years. We would also like to see pupils that are anxious to make something of themselves, given the opportunity of staying on in school after they are 16 years old, in fact I think it would be a great help to many of the girls if they were kept in Boarding school at least another year longer.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nJ.L.

Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd inst. advising me that you are instructing Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander to notify the Rev. W.F. Browne, teacher of the Key Indian Day School that his services are not required after the end of June.\n\nI have recently had an interview with the Rev. W.F. Browne who came to Regina for a special medical examination on a heart condition from which he is suffering and which is serious.\n\nI have his written statements of the events which led to his being in a condition to which Mr. Ostrander has good cause to report to you adversely about him, as follows: \"On the evening before Mr. Ostrander's visit, I had been called out at 11:00 P.M. to bring the doctor out from Norquay (13\u00bd miles) to a sick baby, and to a woman in childbirth. The roads were bad; so bad that in bringing the doctor out the car skidded on the icy road, and landed in the ditch. However, we got out again and resumed our journey. After taking the doctor to the two sick persons, it was 5:30 A.M. when I reached home. Rising that morning at 7:00 A.M. I was required about 8:30 A.M. to drive the doctor back to Norquay, he having completed his duties. It was quite late when I got home again that morning. This disruption accounts for my not having shaved, nor having taken time to change into my regular school clothes. So then, Mr. Ostrander saw me under very exceptional conditions. The only lack of discipline lay in the fact that one of the beginners class interrupted to ask some questions of her teacher. It was reading lesson time, and some of the younger children, just the same as in other schools, had not completely mastered the art of silent reading, but mumbled or whispered as they read to themselves. Both Mr. Bryant (the Indian Agent) and the school inspectors would testify to the quiet and good order in the school on the occasions of their visits, and which is the general condition.\"\nMr. Browne is perfectly willing to resign his position, but feels this explanation should be made known to you.\n\nHis deep interest in the Indian Work is such that he pleaded with me that he might remain at the school until it is possible for us to provide a successor, fearing, as we do, the consequences upon the Indians on the Reserve if there should be a long interregnum before another teacher can be obtained.\n\nI have taken up this matter with the Chairman of our Indian Committee (The Rev. F.E.R. Badham, Secretary of Synod, Synod Office, Regina,) and the members of the Committee, and we are now advertising and making every effort to obtain the services of another teacher. We have already advertised for several weeks, but so far without success. We shall continue these efforts until a teacher can be obtained. It is our hope that we may be successful before the end of June, and we shall keep you advised in the matter.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Qu'Appelle.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are the missionaries on Key Indian Reserve. Today our Agent, Mr. Bryant, called, partly in answer to a letter he had received from Mrs. Brown, in which he stated that he had been ordered to bed by the Doctor and cannot do any work for six months. He had also told Mr. Bryant that I had consented to take over the teaching duties, rather than let the children go without school for the last two months.\n\nI have my permanent First Class teacher's certificate and eleven years teaching experience in this province and so said that I would expect remuneration in accordance with my standing and experience. Furthermore, a substitute...\nteacher anywhere receives more salary than a teacher hired by the year.\n\nMrs. Bryant said he could give no information regarding salary so suggested that I write direct to you.\n\nKindly let me know before the end of this month, what you wish me to do\u2014that is\u2014do you wish me to continue as a substitute until the end of June?\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Mrs. W.J.) Margaret E. Browne\nOttawa, May 21, 1946.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nFollowing reports received from Inspector Ostrander, we have been in communication with Right Reverend E. H. Knowles, Bishop of Qu'Appelle, with a view to obtaining a new teacher for the Key Indian Day School for the academic year 1946-47. The Bishop is now endeavouring to secure a qualified teacher.\n\nYou should, therefore, advise Mr. Browne that his services will not be required after the end of June.\n\nToday I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Browne, in which she states that her husband is ill and will not be able to conduct the school for the balance of the current academic year. Mrs. Browne states that she holds a first class certificate and is willing to teach the school until the end of June but considers that she is entitled to more salary than we were paying Mr. Browne. I am not certain from her letter if she has already started teaching, but if you approve, you may authorize her to keep the school open until June 30. We will allow her salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month, plus 17% bonus, and if she properly completes the enclosed TD 1 A form, no income tax will be deducted.\n\nIf you prefer to hire someone else, you may do so.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nYE478 36/35 NL=FD REGINA SASK 31=\nPHILIP PHELAN=\nDEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT=\nMAY WE ADVERTISE FOR TEACHER FOR KEY RESERVE SCHOOL AT\nSAME SALARY AS YOU WERE PREPARED TO PAY AT DAY STAR NAMELY\nONE HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLAR PER TEACHING MONTH PLUS 17 PER\nCENT BONUS=\nSECY SYNOD QUAPPELLE DIOCESE=\n\nIndian Affairs.

In all $129.50 was deducted from my salary for the superannuation fund, at the rate of $4.50 per month for 29 months. I understand that this amount is refundable to me now, and would be pleased to accept your cheque for the same at your very earliest convenience.

This cheque was forwarded to Mr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Saskatchewan on the 24th instant.

Joseph Scott Wilson of Hornpayne, Ont. for appointment as teacher of our INDIAN Day School on the Key Indian Reserve, Norquay, Sask.\n\nMr. Wilson taught for one year on a permit in a public school in Ontario, and also for three years in Indian Day Schools in that province in the Anglican Diocese of Moosonee. He also taught in England before coming to Canada. He can read the Cree language. His wife is a nurse, which would be a great help to this kind of work on an isolated reserve such as Key's is.\n\nWe have taken up this matter with Mr. J.B. Ostrander, Indian Inspector of your Department in Regina, and he favours this appointment. As we are most desirous of filling this vacancy made by the resignation of the Rev. W.J. Browne in the end of June last, and as winter will soon be approaching, we shall be grateful for a reply as soon as possible.\n\nWe have taken up with Mr. Ostrander the question of the grant the Department would offer for this work. Our understanding is that for a Certificated teacher it would be $105.00 per month for the ten teaching months, plus bonus of $7.50. Mr. Wilson is not a certificated teacher, but his several years of teaching experience in Indian School gives us hope that he may receive from the Department the salary of a qualified teacher. It is intensely difficult for us to obtain teachers for our Indian Day Schools owing to the high wages offered for teachers in the Province of Saskatchewan, and after three months of advertising we have only had this one application.\nIt is most desirable that we should fill this vacancy at once as there are 23 Indian children on the roll of this school, and we are informed that there are now other children of school age on this reserve.\n\nMr. J. Scott Wilson was for four years a student in theology of St. John's College, Winnipeg. We are therefore assured of his ability as a clergyman.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Qu'Appelle.\nApplication FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI hereby make application for employment in the\n\nIndian Day School.\n\nDate\n\n(Signature)\n\nI PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\nName in full (please print) WILSON\nSurname JASPER\nChristian Names SCOTT\n\nDate of Birth July 23, 1906\nPlace of Birth England\n\nSex Male\nReligion Anglican\nHealth Good\n\nCanadian Citizen Yes\nService in H M Forces No\n\nII ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS\n\n| Type of Education | Dates | Name of School | Diploma, Certificate or Degree Granted |\n|-------------------|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------|\n| High School (or equivalent) | 1926-1930 | St. Joseph's Grammar School | Graduation Certificate |\n| University | 1930-1934 | St. John's College | Special Theological Course |\n\nAdditional (Technical Agricultural etc.)\n\nIII PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\nWhere and when did you take your teacher training?\n\nWhat teaching certificate(s) do you hold?\n\nFor how long valid?\n\nFor how many years have you taught in provincial schools?\n\nIn what province(s)?\n\nIn what Indian schools have you taught previously (give dates)?\n\nTotal teaching experience years.\n\nIV SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\nList any special qualifications you have for Indian work\n\nV REFERENCES and INSPECTOR'S REPORTS\n\nPlease attach copies of references and your latest Inspector's Report (if any)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Efforts have been made to secure a local teacher until Bishop Knowles can supply one but there appears to be no qualified person in the district willing to take on the duties.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nBernard F. Neary, Esq., Superintendent,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nMarch 3, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly send us full information regarding the salary now being paid to our teachers at the Fishing Lake and Day Star Reserves, namely the Rev. A.J. Lawes and Mr. Robert Hick? You might also include the proposed salary for the teacher on the Key Reserve. Your Regina office apparently has none of the information required.\n\nWhat is your policy regarding the teachers salaries? Are the teachers graded and paid according to their qualifications? We are of the opinion that provided the teachers have similar qualifications, there should be no difference in the salary paid to those teaching in Indian Day Schools.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that at long last we are meeting with some response in our appeal for a teacher on the Key Reserve. Since the vacancy occurred, we have been advertising in the church and secular press, only to be disappointed with the applications made. Three ladies - two of them elderly enquired about the position, but they were not very interested. The prospect of living alone, so far removed from others, and without telephone communication, did not appeal to them. Two laymen, both retired school principals are interested in the position, both should be acceptable to the Department of Indian Affairs, but as yet they have not submitted their applications.\n\nAs you know there is a scarcity of teachers in our Province. Those who apply to teach in Indian Schools do so because they are especially suitable and qualified for the work and like the Indians, or because they cannot be a success as a teacher in the \"white\" schools. On the other hand, there are those well-intentioned and missionary-minded ones\nwho wish to undertake this work. These people at the present time, appear to be definitely in the minority.\n\nI suggest that there are a number of essentials, if we are to get teachers for our Indian Day Schools:\n\n1. They should have a knowledge and liking for the people, and the children they are going to work with.\n2. They should receive a salary at least equal to what is paid by the Province of Saskatchewan, where the minimum salary is $1200.00.\n3. There should be continuity of pension rights. We have had applicants terminate an interview on being informed that the time given to teaching in Indian Schools would be considered as lost time, so far as their superannuation is concerned.\n4. Warm and comfortable homes for the teachers. In this connection a well built and roomy basement is a necessity, if the teacher is to be able to keep vegetables required, not only for their own use but for the noon-day meals they prepare for the school children. Good drinking water is also of great importance.\n5. A good road from the teacherage to the nearest highway or municipal road, also telephone communication to the \"out-side\". A teacher may require the services or advice of a Doctor for herself or himself and family and for the Indians amongst whom they live.\n\nRegarding the present situation at Keys may we have your permission to engage a person whom we feel is able to teach the children but who is not a certified teacher, and may we offer a salary similar to that at present being paid to Mr. R. Hick of the Day Star School. We are, of course, most anxious to obtain well-qualified and suitable teachers for our Indian Day Schools, but it may be expedient that we should get the next best, when they are not available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of Synod.\n\nB/F\nSteebey Lake = 1/2 00\nDay Star - 1/2 00\nKey 105\nThis amount 131 00\nOttawa, March 8th, 1947.\n\nRev.

Badham,\nSecretary of Synod,\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle,\n1657 McIntyre St.,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nDear Reverend Badham:\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of March 3rd concerning teachers' salaries. The information which you request is as follows:\n\n(1) Fishing Lake teachers' salary - $112. a teaching month.\n\n(2) Day Star teachers' salary - $112. a teaching month.\n\nOur policy in teachers' salaries is to pay for qualifications and experience. The maximum salary for a non-qualified teacher (i.e., a teacher not holding a first class or high school teachers certificate in English of a province of Canada) is $112. a teaching month.\n\nIn the near future you will receive the full details of our salaries scale which has recently been approved by the Treasury Board.\n\nTo summarize this for you; the minimum salary for a teacher holding a second class certificate (that is one where the teacher has Junior Matriculation plus one year normal school) will be $120. a teaching month. The minimum salary for teachers holding a first class certificate (that is one where the teacher has a Senior Matriculation plus one year normal school) will be $126. a teaching month.\n\nI have noted the essentials which you list in order to get teachers for our day schools and I have spent a great deal of time in preparing the salary scale.\nas mentioned above and also in negotiating for the inclusion of our day school teachers as permanent Civil Servants. However, you will receive more details of this later.\n\nIs the minimum salary for teachers in Saskatchewan $1,200.? or is the minimum for qualified teachers $1,200.?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F.

Badham, Secretary of Synod of this diocese of Qu'Appelle, is forwarding to you the application of the Rev. Gilbert Hugh Mansbridge, the Vicarage, Broadview, Saskatchewan, for appointment as teacher at our Key Indian Day School, Norquay, Saskatchewan, for whom I am able to give the following reference.\n\nDr. Mansbridge is a Master of Arts of the University of Cambridge, England and a Doctor of Philosophy of the University of London England. His age is forty (40) years, he is a married man with wife and four children. His wife is a Certificated Teacher of the Province of Saskatchewan (Second Class), and has had some years of experience, teaching on the prairie. His Doctor's Degree was taken in the Science Section in which he specialised in Biology. There can be no question about his Scholarship and he has been out in Canada before in the part of the country where the Key's School is situate, and has had some contact with the Indians and thus knows something about them. Though he has never before been engaged in Indian Work, both Dr. Mansbridge and his wife feel very much drawn toward this kind of work on one of our Reserves, and I have every reason to believe that they will take a deep interest in the personal welfare of our Indian Children and their parents.\n\nIt has been a matter of deep regret to us that there has been no teacher on this Reserve since July 1st, 1946, though we have made every effort to obtain one, and this does seem a favourable opportunity to us to make an appointment, hence this recommendation. Owing to the great depth of snow on the prairie with most of our highways and all our side roads closed up, it does not seem possible to get a teacher and his family into this somewhat isolated Indian Reserve until say, May 1st, 1947; though Dr. Mansbridge would be prepared to go at any time required by your Department.\n\nI am, sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nBishop of Qu'Appelle.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1947.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves the appointment of Rev. G.H. Mansbridge as teacher of the Key Indian Day School. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $112.00 a teaching month.\n\nIt is noted that he is prepared to begin duties about May 1st.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. F.E.R. Badham,\nSecretary of Synod & Registrar,\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle,\nSynod House,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to the Key Day School, Rt. Rev. E.H. Knowles has nominated Reverend G.H. Mansbridge. His appointment is approved on the understanding that he is prepared to open the school about May 1st. He should be given every possible assistance.\n\nEnclosed are staff questionnaire form and T.D.l form which he should complete and return as soon as he begins duties.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBernard F. Neary, Esq., Superintendent,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nMarch 19, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of the 8th and 12th instants. I note that Rev. G.H. Mansbridge has been accepted for the position of teacher at the Key Indian Reserve Day School at a salary of $112.00 per teaching month. I have been in touch with Mr. J.B. Ostrander, your Regina representative regarding the arrangements for Mr. Mansbridge to commence his duties as teacher.\n\nI have carefully considered your letter of the 8th instant and note that you will be sending me full details of the new salary scale, recently approved by the Treasury Board. I think this is an excellent idea, as it should provide an incentive for those teaching in Indian Schools to acquire the best qualifications possible. The better qualified they are, the higher the salary. So far as the Province of Saskatchewan is concerned the $1200.00 I quoted you in my letter, refers to qualified teachers who are those holding valid permanent Second or First Class Certificates. With regard to the Second Class Certificates no new Certificates are being issued, it now applies only to those who were granted Second Class Certificates some years ago.\n\nI note that there is every likelihood for the inclusion of our Day School Teachers as permanent Civil Servants. This is a good thing and will, I am sure, enable us to get better teachers for our Indian work.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity of saying how deeply I appreciate your careful consideration of the matters we have referred to you. We can only have progress and development amongst our Indian People if there is a close co-operation between those who are responsible for their welfare, especially the Department of Indian Affairs, and in our case the Anglican Church. I do not wish to offer much criticism, suffice it to say, that in the past, correspondence received from the Department of Indian Affairs, has left much to be desired. If I may say so, your letters to us indicate a change of policy and a step in the right direction.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-1, part 1)\nBernard F.

Mansbridge for the first time, also observed their work in the classroom for a very short time.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Mansbridge were both teaching at the same time in the classroom. My impression was that Mrs. Mansbridge is a very capable teacher and that Dr. Mansbridge is not. In view of the fact that Mrs. Mansbridge has a Second Class Teaching Certificate and many years of experience it would appear to me that Mrs. Mansbridge should be appointed teacher rather than Dr. Mansbridge, then we can say that the teacher is qualified.\n\nAs you probably know, there is much criticism over the fact that many of our Indian day school teachers are not qualified and have never attended Normal School. For this reason I think it is unwise to continue the present arrangement at Key's Reserve. Mrs. Mansbridge is doing more teaching than her husband, therefore I can see no reason why she should not be appointed the teacher and her husband continue as the Missionary under the direction of the Anglican Church.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nReverend F.E.R. Badham,\nSecretary,\nSynod of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter I wrote to Reverend F.E.R. Badham, Secretary of the Synod of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, Regina, in connection with Dr. and Mrs. Mansbridge at the Key's Reserve, Pelly Agency, also copy of Mr. Badham's reply.\n\nAs the Department is aware, Dr. Mansbridge was appointed teacher at the Key's Day School about a month ago. I did not have the opportunity to see Dr. Mansbridge before he went to the school, therefore I visited the school as soon as possible after his appointment and my letter to the Reverend Mr. Badham was the result of that visit.\n\nI do not think that I have anything to add to my comments in my letter to Mr. Badham with the exception that I should perhaps deal with the second sentence of Mr. Badham's letter to me. In this connection I can only say that I was wondering why they were both teaching in the same classroom. My opinion was that the work of the classroom would have been done much better if Mrs. Mansbridge had been teaching alone. Certainly it would not have been as good if Dr. Mansbridge had been teaching alone. I have every reason to think that Mrs. Mansbridge is an experienced teacher who could perform excellent service with the Indian children. My impression of Dr. Mansbridge is that he is perhaps too highly educated to lower himself to attending normal school and that he will never be a school teacher until he is prepared to admit that he has a lot to learn about teaching school and attend normal school for that purpose.\n\nMrs. Mansbridge has taught school in Alberta and in England, each for a number of years, also attended normal school in Saskatchewan and has a Second Class Teaching Certificate for Saskatchewan. Dr. Mansbridge has a Ph.D. and M.A. and might eventually become a teacher if he commenced in the right way. It appears to me, however, that we should be training Indian children and not teachers.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Mr. Badham:\n\nI visited the Key's Day School yesterday and saw Dr. and Mrs. Mansbridge for the first time, also observed their work in the classroom for a very short time.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Mansbridge were both teaching at the same time in the classroom.

Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nJPBO/ed\nMr. J.P. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nREGINA - Sask.,\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 31st re the Rev. Dr. G.H. Mansbridge and the Keys Indian School.\n\nI am wondering why Dr. and Mrs. Mansbridge were both teaching at the same time in the class room. Such a situation coupled with the fact that you were present making an inspection, would I am sure, be sup-setting to Dr. Mansbridge, and you would not see him at his best in the class room. Knowing the size of the class room it would seem to me to be an almost impossible task for two people to be teaching at the same time. No doubt Mrs. Mansbridge was there for the purpose of helping her husband, and I am glad to know that you recognize and appreciate her ability as a teacher.\n\nFrom the stand point of education, I venture to say that there are few people in this Province who have the qualifications that Dr. Mansbridge has, but I recognize the fact that he had no experience as a teacher in a public school before going to Key Reserve. Do you not think that Dr. Mansbridge might acquire ability to teach, especially in view of the fact that he has Mrs. Mansbridge to help him?\n\nI note that you emphasize the fact that Dr. Mansbridge has never attended Normal School, and while I realize that this is a requirement before a Teacher's Certificate can be issued, I know from experience that some who have attended Normal School and who have been granted a Certificate, have shown little ability to teach.\n\nI wish you to know that we feel that the best is not too good for our Indian children, and that we appreciate your efforts to assist us in this direction. At the same time we are anxious that Dr. Mansbridge should be given a fair chance to prove his ability as a teacher. I realize that you are a very busy man, and that your work covers a large territory, but I am wondering if it would not be possible for you to make a further inspection of the Key School perhaps near the end of this month, or at a time when Dr. Mansbridge will have had sufficient time to prove whether or not he has the ability to teach the children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.E.R. Badham\nSecretary of Synod.\n\nB/F\nExtract from letter from Inspector Ostrander, dated November 4, 1947. Original on 117-5-1\n\nThe attendance at the Key's and Cote Day Schools was very unsatisfactory. That of the Key's School was 70.23%, and that of the Cote School 58.95%. The Key's School, with 26 on the roll, had an average daily attendance of 18.26. The Cote School, with 44 on the roll, had an average daily attendance of 25.94. I pointed this out to Indian Agent Mr. J.L. Bryant, and the teachers concerned, and drew the attention of Mr. Bryant to the fact that Family Allowances payments should be stopped in many instances. Mr. Bryant is to immediately warn the parents that failure to greatly improve the attendance will result in loss of Family Allowances payments, and possibly prosecution. Aside from the matter of attendance I feel that very little is being accomplished at either the Cote Day School or the Key's Day School, and I do not consider the teachers concerned are giving the service which we are entitled to expect.\nOttawa, February 25, 1948.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nInspector's Reports -\nKey, Fishing Lake and Day Star Indian Day Schools.\n\nI have answered your letter of February 19th and as requested am attaching hereto a copy of the last Inspector's report upon the Reverend Mr. Lawes' work at the Fishing Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThe last Inspector's report upon Mr. Hick at the Day Star Indian Day School is also attached. You will note that it is dated June 29, 1946. We have, therefore, asked the Provincial Department of Education to make certain that this school is inspected again this year.\n\nThe last report upon the Key Indian Day School is dated November 2, 1945 and was submitted upon Mr. Walter Browne. We have also asked the Provincial Department of Education to submit an Inspector's report upon Dr. Mansbridge who is now teaching there.\n\nWith regard to the question which you have raised concerning janitor work at the schools, I would suggest that this be taken up through the Indian Agent's office so that they can make a definite recommendation in each case. I will expect to hear further from you concerning these matters.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F.E.R.

Gorehynski, Superintendent of Schools, Kansas, Saskatchewan, following his inspection of the Key Indian Day School, March 15, 1948.\n\nDr. Mansbridge has taken charge of Key Indian Day School in May, 1947. He has excellent academic standing but no teaching experience. After graduating with Ph.D. in London, he was employed as research technician in biology and foods. He specialized in biology.\n\nAlthough Dr. Mansbridge is not acquainted with teaching techniques and newer methods in the primary grades, his work in the classroom is satisfactory. His kindly manner and attitude secure splendid classroom co-operation.\n\nIn reading, the selections studied were well analyzed, explained and discussed. The pupils read well but are somewhat deficient in comprehension. The writing and spelling as well as number work are well taught.\n\nThe classroom is too overcrowded. An additional building, with separate cloakrooms, cupboards, bookcases and washing facilities is strongly recommended. The old building could be converted into a kitchen, dining room and recreation hall. At present, noon lunch is served in crowded classrooms. An allowance of $60.00 per annum for noon meal is insufficient. It should be doubled, since at least 12 beginners are to start school this spring.\n\nSport equipment and facilities are inadequate. At least one football should be provided for winter months. Swings, tester-totters would be very helpful for playground activities.\n\nHealth rules and general cleanliness should receive more emphasis.\n\nConsidering the equipment available and the lack of classroom materials, Dr. Mansbridge is doing good work in this school.\nRETIREMENT FUND APPLICATION FORM\n\nDEPARTMENT: Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch\n\nTHE SUPERANNUATION DIVISION,\nDEPARTMENT OF FINANCE,\nNEW POST OFFICE BUILDING,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nRETURN OF THE AMOUNT AT CREDIT OF THE UNDERMENTIONED EMPLOYEE IN THE RETIREMENT FUND IS REQUESTED.\n\nName: Mansbridge (surname) Rev.

Lunchlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nExtract from letter from Rev. F.E.R. Badham,\nSECRETARY OF SYNOD AND REGISTRAT, SYNOD HOUSE,\nRegina, Sask., dated June 24, 1948.\n\nWe visited the Reverend and Mrs. Mansbridge at the KEY RESERVE and had a long talk with them about the work they are doing. They have thirty children at the school, these and eleven others are expected to enroll when the school re-opens in September. However, if the Gordon's Residential School is re-opened it is possible that six of the pupils presently attending the Kay Day School will go there. The noon-day meal allowance for this school is $60.00 per annum and we cannot understand why the Indian Department expects thirty children to be given a daily meal on an allowance of $6.00 per month.\n\nWe were informed that the school and house can be kept comfortably warm during the very cold weather. Apparently the teacher is not getting the school books ordered from the Indian Department. We were informed that the Provincial School Inspector made an inspection in February and that he suggested there should be a larger allowance for feeding the children and if possible a second room provided. The present system of feeding the children their noon-day meal in the schoolroom then having to clean up the room before resuming classes is very unsatisfactory.\nwho are engaged in Indian Work and I look forward to the time when we can go about amongst our Indian people with pride of achievement which is more than we can do today. There is a lot more that I could say on this matter, but must refrain from doing so. We feel the Government is taking a new interest in the Indians and we hope this will be continued.\n\nWith every good wish for your work,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. T. K. Badham\nSecretary of Synod.\nJuly 29, 1948.\n\nRe Day Star School: We appreciate very much the Inspector's Report upon the above day school and it is good to know that while Mr. Hick is not a Certificated teacher, he has those qualities which may in the long run have a most helpful effect upon our Indian children. Knowing Mr. Hick as I do, I agree with the School Inspector Logie that he has a deep love for Indian children and a most understanding way with them. The most qualified teachers in the world would never get very far with Indian children unless they had the same characteristics of Mr. Hick. From time to time I have noted the remarks and questions raised by members of the House of Commons at Ottawa regarding Indian work and in some cases it would appear that the speaker has never even seen an Indian child. May I reiterate that we are anxious to do our best for our Indian children and doubt very much if some of those who criticize our efforts would do as well.\n\nWe trust that it will not be long before we are advised that the recommendations on the general condition of the schools made by the School Inspectors will have received the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn your letter of the 13th instant and regarding the request for sports equipment at Day Star School, you state that you checked your files and did not discover any reference to a requisition from Mr. Hick for these supplies. All our teachers will tell you that whenever they need anything for their schools they must make requisition through the Indian Agents. In the case of Mr. Hick I have every reason to believe that he on more than one occasion drew the attention of the then Indian Agent Davies of Punnichy to the need for these things. This therefore, my contention that the failure to make a requisition for athletic supplies can be placed upon the Indian Agent concerned. However, we are very grateful indeed to learn that you have ordered sports equipment for Mr. Hick.\n\nIn concluding I wish on behalf of Bishop Knowles and myself to express our sincere thanks to you for the help and encouragement you have given to us. I personally can say that in the eight years I have been connected with Indian work, I have never received such help and encouragement as you have given us; there is a great deal of criticism being directed at those...\nJuly 29, 1948.\n\nBernard F. Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA - Canada.\n\nDear Sirs-\n\nI have just returned from holidays and wish to thank you for the letters etc. received from your Department during the time I was away.\n\nOn June 29th you sent the Inspector's Report for Day Star and Key Indian Day Schools.\n\nWith regard to Key Indian Day School, you will recall the correspondence between your Department and our office during June 1947 at which time Mr. J.P. Ostrander did not give a very satisfactory report on the teaching ability of Dr. Mansbridge. It was chiefly because of this report that Mrs. Mansbridge was appointed teacher in the place of her husband. In commenting on Mr. Ostrander's report I pointed out that Dr. Mansbridge had been at the school for only about three weeks and that he had not really had much time to settle in to a new work. I would kindly refer you to my letter of June 4th, 1947. In view of the complaints we received it is indeed gratifying to know that School Inspector Gorchynski on March 15th reported that \"Considering the equipment available and the lack of classroom materials, Dr. Mansbridge is doing good work in this school.\" I feel, Sir, that it is to your Department that we must look for guidance in respect to the teachers we have in our Indian Day Schools and that we should expect reports on their teaching ability from a qualified school inspector rather than the Superintendent of Indian Agencies. I realize of course, that we must look to the latter on the general conduct etc. of our teachers. We have noted the suggestions made by the school inspector for the improvement of this school and trust that those things which are the concern and responsibility of the Department of Indian Affairs will be attended to as soon as possible.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 611-7 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT KEYS\nDAY SCHOOL\nGENERAL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM SEPT. 1894\nTO Sept. 1948\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 611-1 VOLUME 2\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 611-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6287)\n\nFile 611-1, part 1\nPelly Agency - Keys Day School - Teachers\n- General Administration. 1894, 1901 -\n1904, 1910 - 1948\n\nFile 611-3, part 1\nPelly Agency - Keys Day School - Teachers'\nSalaries. 1913 - 1934, 1943 - 1947\n\nFile 611-5, part 2\nPelly Agency - Keys Day School - Building\nMaintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1930 -\n1938\n\nFile 611-5, part 3\nPelly Agency - Keys Day School - Building\nMaintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1941 -\n1949\n\nFile 611-8, part 1\nPelly Agency - Keys Day School - Teachers'\nResidence - Building Maintenance - Supplies\n- Accounts. 1920 - 1925, 1942 - 1947\n\nFile 612-1, part 1\nBattleford Agency - Little Pines School -\nTeachers - General Administration. 1910 -\n1934\n\nFile 612-1, part 2\nBattleford Agency - Little Pines School -\nTeachers - General Administration. 1934 -\n1949\n\nFile 612-3, part 1\nBattleford Agency - Little Pines School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1926 - 1935, 1943 -\n1947\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Lawes, Fort Pelly, Sask., a cheque No. 2645 for $125.00, being the salary of the teacher of the Keys Indian Day School for the December quarter.\n\nThis cheque was sent in error to Mr. Lawes and should have been drawn and sent to B. H. L. Dance, who taught during that quarter. A night lettergram was sent Mr. Lawes on the 25th ultimo in which he was asked to return the cheque and he was also written to on the same date confirming the lettergram. No reply has been received up to the present time and I have to request that you will be good enough to make enquiry regarding this matter.\n\nMr. Lawes should either return the cheque or refund the amount, or it will be satisfactory if he endorses the cheque and hands it over to Mr. Dance.

I trust this meets with the Department's approval. Regarding the lettergram and letter of confirmation re same sent to Mr Lawes I would say that if they were addressed to Mr Lawes at Fort Pelly it would be some time before Mr Lawes would receive them at Punnichy, as Fort Pelly is an inland Post office and only receives and despatches mail once or twice a week. As there is no telegraphic communication with Fort Pelly the lettergram may possibly be held at Pelly station, seven miles distant from the Fort Pelly, until called for.\n\nI will notify the Department when Mr Dance advises me of receipt of the cheque.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 21, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant, I beg to say that it is noted that you have given instructions to have the registered letter containing the cheque sent Mr. A. J. Lawes, Fort Pelly, forwarded to him at his present address, and also that you requested him to endorse the cheque and send it to Mr. B. H. L.

Bradbrooke Esq.,) has the cheque in\nquestion come to him at the Agency.\n\nI would that you would take into consideration\nthe fact that my residence is twenty-four miles from the Agency and\nit is very seldom that I am down to it especially owing to the\nfact that conveyances are not always convenient. Last quarter\nI did not receive my cheque until August 13th, owing to the fact\nthat the Agent had neglected to send in my report but had simply\nleft it on file in the office at the Agency, now this quarter my\ncheque has been at the Agency for two weeks, the weather is\ninclement and I cannot go down for it, and therefore I am\ncompelled to wait the Agent's pleasure.\n\nI understand that no other Teachers cheques\nused to come to the Agency at all, but were sent direct to him\nfrom Ottawa, and I have the honour to request that my cheques be\nhandled in the same way, for it does seem to me right that I should\nhave to wait five months for my salary especially now when we all\nneed all the necessary finance at our demands to make things meet.\n\nI beg to state that I am not writing this\nin the form of a complaint, but because I feel that you do not\nunderstand the position, and therefore trust that in the future my request will receive your consideration.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your attention regarding this matter,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nP.W.

G. C. ANDREWS, PROVINCIAL SCHOOL INSPECTOR, DATED MARCH 13TH, 1936, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KEY'S INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nToilets are in extremely poor state of repair - there are holes in the wall of one, the roof has blown off the other, neither have doors. The present neglected condition of the outbuildings is, aside from hygienic conditions, a very poor example for the children.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, April 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a report on his visit to the Key's Day School on the 13th ultimo, Provincial School Inspector G. C. Andrews writes:\n\n\"Toilets are in extremely poor state of repair - there are holes in the wall of one, the roof has blown off the other, neither have doors. The present neglected condition of the outbuildings is, aside from hygienic conditions, a very poor example for the children.\"\n\nThe Department cannot understand why the toilets have been allowed to continue in the condition mentioned by the Inspector. Please let me have at once an estimate of the cost of repairing the present toilets or erecting new ones.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, No. 117-4-5, in connection with the report of the school inspector to the effect that the outside toilets at the Key's Day School are in bad shape, I beg to say that his report is quite true. The roof of one of these buildings blew off during the winter and, as they should be moved, it was my intention to ask for authority to dig new holes and move them as soon as the frost goes out of the ground this spring. It cannot be done before that time. The cost will be about six dollars for material and labour. There have never been doors on these buildings and apparently it was not intended that there should be when they were built. If the Department intends to have doors put on it will cost another six dollars for material and labour.\n\nIn connection with this school, I would like to point out that the greatest need is exterior painting of the teacher's residence, which was asked for in the current year's estimates. I asked for an amount of $175.00 for this purpose and for kalsomine for the interior of the teacher's residence and class-room building. The Kalsomine is not essential and no damage will be done if delayed for another year, but the need of exterior painting is very urgent. Apparently it has been needed for some years as the shingles are all curled with the weather and the siding on the walls will have to be renewed before many years owing to the fact that it is so badly warped and twisted from need of paint over a period of years.\n\nIt will require at least $100.00 to make a good job of this exterior painting, and even more than that if I have to get outside labour at Union rates. There is no reason why the work could not be performed by an Indian, in which case $100.00 will be sufficient for both material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, you may arrange for the erection of two toilets at the Key's Indian Day School, at a cost of $12 for material and labour.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department regrets that it will not be possible to authorise any exterior painting this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

The cost of a new pump and pipe will be approximately $25.00 and there should be a further amount of $5.00 allowed to finish the top of the well with concrete.\n\nThe flag pole at this school needs replacing as it has rotted and fallen down. The cost of this complete, including digging and setting, will be about four dollars.\n\nI beg to request authority for these amounts as I would like to have the work completed before the new school term commences.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, you may expend an amount not exceeding $35.00 in purchasing a new pump and placing a new top on the well at the Key Ineian Day School. You may arrange, also, for the erection of a new flagpole, at a cost of $4.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. P. B.

He has been getting $10.00 per year in the past and it is not nearly sufficient to serve anything worth while to the children. He has been able, in other years, to give a fairly good meal of soup and vegetables when he had a good garden, but the garden this year was a complete failure. He has asked for 200 lbs. of beef, 10 sacks of potatoes, 2 sacks of carrots, 4 sacks of flour, 50 lbs. of lard, 8 pkgs. yeast, 14 lbs. salt, 50 lbs. of rice, 50 lbs. of beans, 40 lbs. of sugar and 10 lbs. of cocoa.\n\nThe total cost of the above foods will be about $60.00, and I would be glad of your assistance to obtain authority for this expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 25th June last, in connection with repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Key's Day School, I have to say that the exterior of the teacher's residence is badly in need of paint and the interior of the class-room building is in need of kalsomine and varnish. The material for this work amounts to $43.75, or within the amount of $50.00 so I am making the purchase at once.\n\nI think the balance of the money should be spent on excavating the cellar of the teacher's residence. This is now only a small hole in the ground and not of much use. The excavating and labour on the foundation can be done by Indians and will cost about forty dollars. The painting, kalsomining and varnishing can also be done by Indians and, after this is done, the balance of the $150.00 allowed, could be spent on tools and equipment for the use of the teacher instructing the boys and girls in carpenter work, sewing, and other useful work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

It is noted that you have purchased the kalsomine and varnish at a cost of $43.75. Your action in this regard is approved.\n\nThe amount of $40.00 may be expended for labor in excavating the cellar of the teacher's residence.\n\nAny balance left from the amount provided, viz., $150.00, may be expended in purchasing the tools and equipment mentioned in the last part of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nJ.

Cement is required to fix the steps in the house where the teacher is living. Temporary repairs to the foundation are also required in addition to repairs to windows both at the school and the house. Further the interior of the school needs kalsomining and repairs are necessary for the basement and steps in front of the school, also to the window screens. The teacher will do the work and the cost of the material and some extra labour he will have to hire to help him will cost about $35.00.\n\nAgent Bryant knows what has to be done, therefore if you give him the authority he will see that the work is carried out properly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Buck, school teacher at Key Reserve.\n\nWhen I visited his school early in the summer the Reverend Buck complained that the premises had been in a filthy condition when he arrived and he was forced to purchase a quantity of paint to fix them up before he could move in. However, he stated he had never been paid for this. I informed him that it was not necessary to take steps to buy paint to fix up the premises because if they thought it necessary our Branch were always willing to supply the material. Mr. Bryant had not been long at the Agency at that time, and since Mr. Buck was a new man, the matter was not attended to.\n\nIf it is at all possible I would ask that this voucher be paid because the Reverend Buck is a married man with two children and goodness knows he cannot afford to buy paint for the Government.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Alex Brass,\nNorquay, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Pelly Agency, stating that shortly after I had inspected the teacher's residence at Key Indian Day School last Summer, they had a four inch rainfall and the walls of the basement caved in.\n\nMr. Bryant advises that in his opinion the only thing to do is to put in a full sized cement basement. The former basement was just a dugout and the house is on a cement surface foundation. He further states he has been trying to get a contractor to estimate a price on this ever since it happened but he has been unable to do so. However, he now has a price quotation from Alex Brass, an Indian from the File Hills Agency, and I am attaching copy hereto.\n\nI will admit that putting the house on a cement foundation is probably the best method but I have no guarantee that Alex Brass is able to do this. Personally I think we had better get some logs to build a foundation, dig out the basement and line it with common boards because after all the teacher only needs a basement large enough to take care of his potatoes and provide room for the rain water cistern tank that is now in the dug-out basement. By banking the house up well it can be just as warm as if there were a cement basement.\n\nI am just suggesting the above because it should cost much less than by doing it with cement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\nSeptember 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Repairs, teacher's residence,\nKeys Indian Day School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, in which you intimate that certain repairs are urgently needed at the above-noted school.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the matter, you are authorized to take whatever steps may be necessary to have the basement of this residence reconstructed. It is noted that the cost of this work under your direction is not likely to exceed $100.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen.

However, since it was necessary to put the potatoes and vegetables in the basement right away the work will have to be left over until next Spring and will then only cost about $25.00 at the most. In the meantime sufficient braces will be included in our purchase of the material necessary for this work. These braces will be used now to make it safe during the Winter.\n\nThe attendance at the school has been poor during October because everybody was out threshing. Those who had grain of their own were harvesting and threshing this while others were out working for white farmers, but I.....\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\nfor white farmers but I presume that the attendance will increase now that the cold weather is coming on.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

It has given service for many years but is now beyond repair.\n\nIt is planned to put in new treated posts with at least four strands of barbed wire; the cost for labour and material will be approximately $25.00 to $30.00.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this expenditure could be authorized as soon as possible, as a good home garden means a great deal to Mr. Browne in supplying vegetables for the school children as well as for his own use.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 8, 1944.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $20 in rebuilding the fence around the school and teacher's residence at the Key Indian Day School.\n\nR.A.

As these articles are necessary will you please approve the purchase.\n\nThe interior of this school badly needs renovating which would cost approximately $20.00, and the outside should also be done at a cost of approximately $60.00. Please also give these items your consideration for approval.\n\nYours truly,\nJ.L. Bryant\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTREASURY ONLY\n\nPay to: THOS.

Morris,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1944.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nIn reporting on his visit to the Keys Day School Mr. Morris writes as follows:\n\n\"Keys Day School - not locked - needs painting very badly and a couple of boards will have to be renewed on the back of the building. Both outside toilets are a disgrace. Agent Bryant was requested to build new ones and have them ready for the opening of classes next fall. Note: The school teacher was in Regina at a religious convention and left the school unlocked. Agent requested to have the building properly locked immediately.\"\n\nWhile the Department gave permission for the teacher to attend the religious convention, it is difficult to understand why he would leave the place unlocked. There is certainly no reason for the toilets to be in such condition as reported. I feel certain you visit the school regularly and the toilets should always be inspected and any repairs or cleaning should receive prompt attention. It is evident from Mr. Morris's remarks that very little attention has been given to this building. You might let me have an estimate of the cost of redecorating it.\n\nR.A.

In addition, the cost of food has increased considerably.\n\nI would therefore respectfully draw your attention to the fact that we still only get a $60 p.a. grant for school (mid-day) dinners. If this was sufficient three years ago it is not sufficient now. With careful use of garden produce & by my wife giving supervision to the meals we have managed to get $60 to last from Sept 1st to the present date. But the $60 is now exhausted, for we have 30 children to feed. We need a further grant for this term as well as an increased grant for next year.\n\nWe trust you to give this your sympathetic attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ H. MacIntosh\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nApril 19, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nI attach for your information a letter received from the teacher at the Key day school.\n\nIt has never been our intention to supply all the food required for mid day lunch. This applies especially since the payment of Family Allowances commenced. The Indian parents should be in a position to give some lunch to their children when going to school and the lunch provided by the Department through the co-operation of the teacher is only intended to supplement what the children bring.\n\nIn addition to the expenditure of $60.00 authorized for mid day lunch at this school, we also supply several hundred pounds of biscuits.\n\nIn view of the above we do not consider it advisable to authorize for the current academic year an expenditure greater than the amount already approved.\n\nBernard F.

Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThe attached extracts are from the Inspector's report submitted by Mr. J. P. Gorczyanski.\n\nWith regard to the overcrowded classroom, it is presumed that we will receive a report from you as to how this condition can be alleviated. I would recommend that this be one of the schools that our Educational Survey Officer be asked to inspect when he visits your agency this spring. A copy of this letter is being sent to him so that he will be aware of the Inspector's recommendation.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl.\n\nCopy sent to Major Clark\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-5, part 3)\nExtracts from Report of Mr. J. P. Gorszkowski, Superintendent of Schools, Kamisk, Saskatchewan, following his inspection of the Key Indian Day School, March 15, 1948.\n\nDr. Mansbridge has taken charge of Key Indian Day School in May, 1947. He has excellent academic standing but no teaching experience. After graduating with Ph.D. in London, he was employed as research technician in biology and foods. He specialized in biology.\n\nAlthough Dr. Mansbridge is not acquainted with teaching techniques and newer methods in the primary grades, his work in the classroom is satisfactory. His kindly manner and attitude secure splendid classroom cooperation.\n\nIn reading, the selections studied were well analyzed, explained and discussed. The pupils read well but are somewhat deficient in comprehension. The writing and spelling as well as number work are well taught.\n\nThe classroom is too overcrowded. An additional building, with separate cloakrooms, cupboards, bookcases and washing facilities is strongly recommended. The old building could be converted into a kitchen, dining room and recreation hall. At present, noon lunch is served in crowded classrooms. An allowance of $60.00 per annum for noon meal is insufficient. It should be doubled, since at least 12 beginners are to start school this spring.\n\nSport equipment and facilities are inadequate. At least one football should be provided for winter months. Swings, teeter-totters would be very helpful for playground activities.\n\nHealth rules and general cleanliness should receive more emphasis. Considering the equipment available and the lack of classroom materials, Dr. Mansbridge is doing good work in this school.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                        | AMOUNT |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|--------|\n| April 16  | To pay cleaning Key Day School | 3.00   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

We understand that your Department has always encouraged the teachers in the day schools to have the children take part in sports and exercises in order that they might develop physically as well as mentally. At the Day Star School Mr. Hick is particularly interested in this part of their development and a certain amount of equipment has been provided. However, it was our Bishop who provided the money to pay for this equipment. The Indian Department apparently refused to provide the necessary money. We did not go into this matter with the teachers at the other reserve schools, but we have reason to believe that a similar situation exists.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: **G.

Original on file 611-6\n\nBoth toilets should be replaced in the immediate future. Seats and floors should be scrubbed at least once a month.\n\nSport equipment and facilities are still inadequate although one football was provided. Another football, teeters and skating rink would eliminate the weakness.\nNovember 25, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nIn a report dated November 18th, Inspector Gerohynski states that both the toilets at eh Asys Day School should be replaced at once.\n\nPlease let us know the cost that would be involved.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nThe children of this school have very few opportunities of taking part in healthy winter sports and I have considered the advisability of erecting an open air skating rink near the school.\n\nA plot 30 feet by 100 feet could be levelled and flooded for approximately $20.00 a 3 foot high board fence around this would cost another $110.00 including material and labour. Once this work was done subsequent removal of snow and flooding when necessary would be done by the children themselves under Mr. Mansbridge's supervision. Norquay is approximately 12 miles from the Key school but few if any of the children from the Reserve would have the opportunity of skating there except on very rare occasions.\n\nThe Indian children love to skate and many develop into very good hockey players. The initial investment would be well worth while as the board fence could be built in sections, taken down and piled in the spring and used again for many winters to come.\n\nIf funds are available I would strongly recommend that this project be given favourable consideration.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent.\nPelly Agency.\nNovember 27, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent,\nPelly Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nKey Indian Day School\nRef. your 1-3-8 of November 24\n\nThe Department approves of the operation of open air rinks at our Indian Day Schools, but unfortunately, we have received so many requests this year that we are unable to meet large expenditures in this regard.\n\nWe are quite prepared to advance a sum of $25.00 this year and to provide a larger sum next year, providing you write in soon enough. Please explain to the Indians that this small contribution is entirely due to the fact that we have had too many requests of a similar nature and we have expended our funds allotted for this purpose.\n\nI would suggest that they do everything possible to raise some funds themselves as is being done at other Indian schools. Please advise me if you wish an accountable advance of $25.00 in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Key School Toilets.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of November 25, 1948, regarding the toilets at Key Day School.\n\nThese toilets were upset on Halloween night and again by some of the grown up Indians about a week later. On the latter occasion the school door was wired up with barb wire. It appears that the Indians wanted to hold a box social and dance in the school on this certain night and were not allowed to do so, and they showed their displeasure in this manner. The toilets had not been properly replaced on the occasion of Inspector Gorchynski's visit.\n\nI do not consider the toilets need to be replaced but they do need some repair. One requires a door and a new seat and both require some other minor repairs.\n\nI would estimate that $30.00 for labour and material would put them in quite fair shape.\n\nNext summer new pits should be dug and solid posts put in to which the toilets could be fastened to prevent them being upset so readily.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent.\nPelly Agency.\nDecember 22, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $30.00 for labour and material for repairing the toilets at the Key Day School.\n\nBernard F.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. 484\n\nDate: May 20, 1949\nThe interior of the above noted school was damaged by fire recently. Mr. Mansbridge started a fire in the school box stove in the morning and left the building at 8:40 a.m. He claims one of the school girls arrived at the school about ten minutes later and found the walls near the stove on fire.\n\nIt is supposed that an overheated stove or pipes started the fire in part of the wall behind the stove. Some plaster had cracked and fallen from the wall which exposed the laths at this point.\n\nMr. Mansbridge thinks that a spark came through a very small bolt hole in the back of the stove and that this started the fire but I am of the opinion that the stove became overheated.\n\nI would estimate that lath nails and lumber to repair the walls will cost approximately $20.00 and about 35 square yards of plaster will have to be replaced. This will require about 300 lbs of hardwall, 100 lbs of hydrated lime and 150 lbs. of finish and approximately 1 yard of sand. This material with the exception of the sand can be purchased locally from the Monarch Lumber Company at Norquay, Saskatchewan. Wages for labour will require approximately $100.00.\n\nIt is very difficult to secure the services of a competent plasterer and his charges would have to include transportation costs of his equipment from Kamsack to Key school a distance of 25 miles. The total cost of material and labour should not exceed $150.00.\n\nI would like to have authority to proceed with this repair work as soon as possible after school closes in June.\n\nThe soft water cistern in the teachers residence is in very poor condition. I had Mr. Finnie, tinsmith, from Kamsack check this over recently with the hope that it could be repaired. However, it is so badly pitted that it is beyond repair.\n\nA new cistern of the same size would cost approximately $60.00 installed.\n\nI would recommend that the new cistern be installed.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent,\nPelly Agency.\nMay 26th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the fire that occurred at the Key Indian Day School. We are pleased to know that it was discovered before serious damage was done.\n\nThe Department approves the expenditure required to make the repairs suggested in the fourth paragraph of your letter.\n\nYou may also supply a new cistern at a cost of $60.00 installed.\n\nBernard V. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nRe: Key Day School.\n1949-1950 Estimates.\n\nIn our estimates provision was made for an addition to the teachers residence at Key Reserve at an estimated cost of $900.00, also a stable for the children's horses at an estimated cost of $1,000.00. I am now of the opinion that additional class room space is the most urgent requirement at the present time. This should be provided by building a 12 or 14 foot addition on the east end of the building. I would estimate roughly that the cost should not exceed $1,600.00 for labour and material. The present east end wall up to the ceiling would have to be removed with the exception of possibly 18 inches on each side. A rod could be put through from wall to wall at this point to add additional support.\n\nThe shingles on the present structure are showing signs of age and if this addition is approved I would suggest that these shingles be replaced by asbestos shingles.\n\nThe building should also be painted. There will be approximately 36 children this fall of school age on Key Reserve. The capacity of the school at present should not exceed 24 and this leaves very little open space not occupied by school desks teachers desk and a large box stove for heating purposes.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give these suggestions consideration and if they meet with your approval I will submit a plan of the addition, an estimate of the building material required and approximately what the construction of the addition would cost.\n\nJ.

I have added a number of blanks for recording future school populations. There are enough for you to keep copies in your office, even allowing separate copies for denominations on Key, Cote and Kesekoose.\n\nDo you suppose that you and I will have to take a day off to exterminate the gophers and fill up the holes in Mrs. Monbride's school yard? Maybe I could get a departmental rifle and ammunition if poison is too great a hazard for the dear cats, but the cats will have to keep out of the way in any case.\n\nAside, however, from the gophers I hope to see the renovated Key school in the fall and also to follow out your suggestions for a visit to Cote and St. Phillips. Answer!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCharles Fordyce Clark.\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nAlterations to Key Indian Day School:\nWith Mr. Stranier and Mr. Bryant visited this school today.\nPresent floor area is only 460 sq. ft. (20 x 23)\nIt is recommended that the length be increased by fourteen feet.\n\nPut in two casement-opening windows (approx. 3' x 1')\nup high on the opposite wall of new addition.\n\nOrder twenty feet of new blackboard for the\nfront of the room. Include good blackboard chalk too.\nPlace the old blackboard along the blank side\nof the new addition.\nAs much of the plaster was damaged by fire in\nMay, remove all plaster and substitute plaster board.\nRe-position stove for pupils' comfort and fire-prevention.\nPaint the whole structure. Treat roof.\n\nCost is estimated at two thousand dollars.\n\nThese are the joint recommendations of the\nRegional Supervisor and Mr. Dept.

Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Addition to Key Day School.\n\nI wish to refer to Mr. C.A.F. Clark's letters of June 23, and June 25, in connection with the proposed addition to Key Day School.\n\nI thought it advisable to estimate for an addition 16' x 22' instead of 15' x 22' as there would be very little additional cost due to a certain amount of loss of material in the 15' addition.\n\nThe estimate prepared by the Monarch Lumber Co. Ltd. of Norquay, is approximately correct but in a job of this kind where alterations are being made to the present structure a small amount of extra material may be required. It is noted that there is an error in the size and number of the windows, we require 8 windows 26x30 instead of 4 24x26. I feel satisfied that an additional $50.00 would cover any extras that might be required.\n\nThe Porcupine Lumber Co of Pelly, Saskatchewan have been asked to submit an estimate but this has not yet been received, in any case Norquay is the closest point to Key Reserve and I am of the opinion that somewhat better building material is supplied by the Monarch Lumber Co. Ltd.\n\nI expect to receive a tender in writing for the labour this week from Mr. Ole Anderson of Norquay. He advised me today that he would first discuss the matter with his son, but he thought they could do the work for approximately $850.00 which would include painting the building inside and out. This would also include insulation of the ceiling with shavings that are obtainable in Norquay at $2.00 per truck load. We would have to supply the shavings and 50 lbs. of lime at the school site.\n\nMr. Anderson will supply necessary sand and gravel for the cement work at no extra cost. Charges for trucking lumber etc. from Norquay, should not exceed $25.00.\n\nIt is very difficult to obtain competent carpenters for this type of work a considerable distance from town and I doubt very much if I can obtain another tender for the work which must be completed before September 5th. Mr. Anderson is reported to be a reliable workman and I consider his tender for the labour is fair and reasonable and should be accepted forthwith in order that he may be advised and ready to start work as soon as the material is purchased.\n\nJ.

Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Bryant:\n\nSince returning to Ottawa I have reviewed the file of Key School and studied my photographs and diagrams.\n\nI can see how it will be difficult to place 12 windows along one wall of the enlarged school. I notice that you are adding only four windows and that these will probably be in the new extension. That will make eight windows in line along the 46 foot wall. Do you not think that it would be possible to increase the number of windows to 10 by adding two more in the present blank space between the existing four windows and the cloak-room? Indeed 12 windows along one wall would come closer to giving the desirable fenestration ratio.\n\nThe cost for additional windows during the present extensive alterations would be a small fraction of the total. If they are omitted now, and we have complaints later about the lighting, the expense will be much greater.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\n\nCAFC:MMcN\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of July 30, 1949, regarding the acceptance of the tender of Ole M. Anderson of Norquay for labour in construction of an addition to this school and painting interior and exterior of the Building.\n\nMr. Anderson is ready to start work on the addition and alterations at this school, but we are unable to start as the purchasing agent has not yet placed the order for the material.\n\nWork will have to be rushed if we are going to have the school ready by September 6th. It would be much appreciated if the order could be placed immediately with either the Beaver or Monarch Lumber Company.\n\nA wire advising which firm was getting the order would allow us to get the cement and get the building started at once.\n\nJ.

The painting may not be finished inside but if necessary some of this could be done at week ends however I would like to get it done before school opens.\n\nI am attaching a requisition for the estimated paint that will be required and would appreciate having this rushed through as soon as possible. I would suggest a light blue for the interior walls with a white ceiling, please change this if the colour scheme does not meet with your approval.\n\nIf the Sherwin Williams Co could be wired by the purchasing Agent to supply this paint it would no doubt save considerable time.\n\nThe painting of the school building inside and out is included in Mr Andersons contract for the construction and alterations and it would be unfortunate if work is delayed for lack of paint. I mus$ admit that this should have been ordered sooner, but I was under the impression that the requisition had gone forward with the requisition for Cote Day school paint.\n\nJ.L.Bryant,\nSupt.

A. Bradbrook, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOctober 4, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle recommended that a residence be provided for Mr. Kerley, the present incumbent at the Keys Indian Day School. Mr. Kerley is well qualified, is doing good work and is a married man. I promised His Lordship that we would make enquiries and advise him.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 611-8, part 1)\nOttawa, October 6, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle has recommended that a teacher's residence be provided to replace the present old building at the Keys Indian Day School. I shall be pleased to have your recommendation regarding this request. If you are of the opinion that a new building should be erected, please intimate the type of same and state the approximate cost, also whether you could undertake the purchase of the material and arrange for the necessary labour, etc. It may be too late in the season to undertake the erection of the building this fall, but, in order to give consideration to His Lordship's request, I shall be pleased to have your views on the same, giving full information as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant informing me that the Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle has made a request that a residence be provided for the day school teacher on the Key Reserve. This school as you are aware is a very small one and I have always been reluctant in spending money on this institution. The present residence of the teacher is really a poor affair and I would be prepared to recommend that $3,500.00 be placed in the estimates to meet the expense of building a house for the teacher.\n\nI find that the Pelly Estimates have mailed to you, and I would be glad if you will place this amount in the estimates when they reach you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 29, 1924.\n\nMr. Paget,\n\nWould you kindly let me know whether we can provide from this year's estimates the sum of $1500.00 for a school and teacher's residence on the Keys reserve, and also $1500.00 for a day school on Day Stars reserve. Mr. Graham represents that these expenditures are advisable.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\n\nRequirements at Keys School have been noted in 1926-27 Estimates.\nJanuary 13, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to your memorandum hereunder, I have to report that funds could be found from this year's appropriation for a $1800.00 school and teacher's residence at Keys and a like amount for a day school at Day Stars, if it is your wish that they be proceeded with at once.\n\nI have written to Mr. Graham, asking him to submit a definite proposal with reference to Day Stars and I was awaiting his letter relative to the situation at Keys, before taking any action. This was agreed upon at the time of our recent conference.\n\nThere is no item for these schools in the preliminary draft of the Estimates, 1925-26.\n\nRussell J. Turner,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:\n\nSince returning home I have made enquiries regarding the school house and teacher's residence on Kev's Reserve in the Belly Agency. Mr. Inspector Christianson, who has just visited this school a short time ago, tells me that the house is absolutely unfit for occupation; that it was built by me some twelve years ago; built of logs, and at a small cost. The logs are rotten and the building is really beyond repair. No further money should be spent on it. I would, therefore, ask for an amount of $2,000.00 to erect a log cottage with a lean-to kitchen. If the money can be advanced in order to get the logs out this winter, so much the better.\n\nThe school house is not in very bad shape. A new floor should be put in, and there is too much light owing to the fact that there are windows on both sides of the building. You will notice that $100.00 was placed in the Estimates for 1925-26 for general repairs to this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 2, 1925.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am pleased to inform Your Lordship that Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, of Regina, is being authorized to provide a teacher's residence for the Keys Indian Day School. Mr. Graham has recommended that logs be taken out immediately and the necessary authority is being directed to him today.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. M.T. McA. Harding, D.D.,\nBishop of Qu'Appelle,\nBishopstone,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 2, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 310-11A of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the advisability of providing a teacher's residence at the Keys Indian Day School. In reply I have to authorize you to expend the sum of $2,000 in the erection of a cottage with a lean-to kitchen. Under separate cover, an accountable cheque for $150 is being directed to you, for the purpose of getting out logs this winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nIn connection with the teacher's residence that we are building on the Key's Reserve in the Pelly Agency, I might say that after the building is completed I think a saving will be made in the amount that was allowed.\n\nThe Church authorities here have asked that they be supplied with a cook stove and heater for the use of the teacher. I shall be glad to have your authority to make this purchase, to be charged against the appropriation that was allowed for the building of the house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 20th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 310-11A of the 16th instant, informing the Department that you anticipate that after the building of the teacher's residence on the Key's Reserve is completed a saving will be made in the amount allowed. You may arrange for the supplying of a cook stove and heater for the use of the teacher, the cost of which should be included in the amount allowed for the building of the residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

However, on looking up my report dated July 3rd I had this to say: \"However, we have some work to do on the foundation of the teacher's house and we have, I think, most of the material on hand. Mr. Bryant is looking into this matter further, because, as I have told you before, I do not want to spend a lot of money on it.\" I do not want to quarrel with Mr. Bryant over this because I may not have made myself clear enough to impress upon him that we had to have authority for this.\n\nAs you know, when you start working on basements you do not know what you are going to run into and since the work has been performed the only thing I can say is that I would recommend payment of this. I am very sorry that this has happened because I have never been in the habit of authorizing work to be done unless the proper authority has been obtained.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 23, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Regina Saskatchewan,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, inclosing four vouchers in connection with repairing the basement at the Key Indian Bay School. Cheques are being issued and will be sent to Indian Agent Bryant.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Ostrander,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nNo doubt it is quite unusual for you to hear from the wife of a missionary but I'm afraid I just cannot keep still any longer and let you continue to think that the teachers provided by our Canadian Government on Indian Reserves \"are good little houses, for which many a person in Regina would be very thankful.\"\n\nIn the first place I very much doubt if one person out of ten or even a hundred in Regina, would be thankful to live in any house (even the best one on College Avenue or Angus Crescent) if it was not here on Key Reserve. In the second place they wouldn't live in this house the way it is but would soon fit it up into a decent house\u2014which we would have done long before this if it were our own house. It is no wonder that the Bishop cannot get missionaries.\n\nMorquay, Sask.,\nJan. 29/46\nto stay here more than two or three years. No man could stand such conditions any longer.\n\nLast spring when you were here I had you look at the basement to see how the house is away from the foundation with cracks large enough to put your finger into. At the time you said that would be very easily fixed\u2014but is it fixed? No! Everything on the shelves froze the first cold snap and each can has to be thawed out before we can use it. The cellar is frozen too. The floors are so cold all day that I can't stand the cold on my feet and for weeks have been suffering terribly from chilblains. Unless one has suffered from it, one has no idea how agonizing it becomes.\n\nNo doubt you will say that it is not the policy of the Government to improve teacherages especially during 1946. In that case they shouldn't expect people to live in them. It was patriotic to put up with such conditions but my patriotism is tested\nbeyond endurance, these last three years,\nespecially when every citizen of Canada\nis not and couldn't even imagine living\nunder such conditions as these. People\nwho are responsible for the building of\nsuch places should have to live in\nthem.\n\nThere should be a full-sized cement\nbasement under this house with a furnace,\nand good cistern. The house should be\nenlarged and some clothes closets and\ncupboards built. There isn't a room large\nenough to contain both our Chesterfield and\npiano. The latter is in a bedroom which\nserves also as serving room. You can\nimagine how much space there is left in\na room 12x12'.\n\nThe walls should all be insulated as\nthere is frost on them and the beds have\nto be kept away as I found the bedding all\nwet when it touched the wall. Last winter\nruined one end of my cedar chest. I kept\nit a good bit under from the wall but the veneer is all cracked and coming off one end. I certainly feel badly about it as it was an expensive chest and couldn't be replaced in these days.\n\nYou have my permission to use this letter to forward to the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa or I may even write directly to Ottawa.\n\nMrs. Browne and I both consider the work amongst our Indians very important and I don't think you will find any missionary who work harder than we do as we have given of our time and talent, unstintedly to this work and pray incessantly that God may use us to further this work any way we can. But it is hardly necessary to have to live in such a house, to be a good missionary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n(Mrs. W.J.) Margaret E. Browne\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from Mrs. W.F. Browne, the wife of the Day School Teacher, Key's Day School. I make no comments on the contents of this letter as I think it speaks for itself.\n\nThe teacherage at the Key's Day School is a fairly comfortable small cottage with only one major fault. It has only a hole instead of a full-sized basement. When Mrs. Browne complained to me about the house they were forced to live in I informed her that although it is better than many of the teacherages it was our intention to ask for a full-sized basement as part of the program for improvement of all of our buildings but it was certainly not one of the first things that had to be done, in my opinion. The second paragraph of her letter is, I presume, a reference to my remark to her that I would be glad to have her teacherage for my home in Regina as I have none.\n\nIt has been recommended that Mr. Browne be replaced as Day School Teacher of the Key's Day School at the end of the present term as he is entirely unsuitable, therefore Mrs. Browne's complaints have little importance.\n\nJ.P.B.

T. Demeris.\n\nYour Church has on this reserve a teacher's dwelling and there would appear to be a good field for an active teacher. If Your Lordship can nominate one with proper qualifications a liberal salary will be allowed. It would not, however, appear to be advisable to dispense with Mr. Demeris' services until there is some assurance that a successor can be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nIn reply to your letter No. 371267 of the 9th July addressed to the Bishop of Saskatchewan referring to report received of unsatisfactory progress in the Little Pine's day school I beg to say that these reports are correct, and efforts will be made to secure the services of a competent teacher as soon as possible, in accordance with the wishes of the Department.\n\nI would however point out that the school house is in very poor condition and should be thoroughly repaired without delay. It is also too small but there is an open fire place which might be removed to increase the floor space.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, Sept. 19th., 1910.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd. instant I beg to say that on the 16th. ultimo Mr. Roy, Indian Agent, was asked to have certain repairs made to the Little Pine day school, which it is hoped will make the building quite comfortable.

If this change is to be made soon, I would like very much if the Department would allow me to remain in my position as teacher at least during the winter months of this year. I am stationed here with my family and not in any too good circumstances.\n\nThe season is closing up and we have been preparing for the winter.\n\nI have been now 19 yrs working for the Dept doing all in my power for the benefit of the Indians. So on behalf of the party I am only wish that my request at your hands will seem again consideration.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nC.J. Desmarais\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 3, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the nomination of a teacher for the Little Pines day school rests with the Church authorities and you should communicate with the Ven. Archdeacon MacKay, Battleford. If the authorities have not made any arrangements for a teacher for this school the Department would not object to your remaining on till March 31st, next, provided you obtain their consent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nC. T. Desmarais, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nPaynton P.O., Sask.\nOttawa, October 3, 1910.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nMr. C. T. Desmarais, the present teacher of the Little Pines day school, has written to the Department asking that he be allowed to remain in charge, at least during the winter months. He has been advised that the nomination for this position rests with the church authorities and told to communicate with you.\n\nIf you have not made any definite arrangement for a teacher for this school the Department would have no objection, under the circumstances, to allowing Mr. Desmarais to remain in charge till the 31st of March, next.\n\nI may say that his reasons for asking for this favour are that he is in poor circumstances and that this is not a favourable season of the year in which to look for new employment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 117078 of the 12th ult., I beg to recommend as teacher of the Day School on Little Pine's Reserve the Rev. Mr. Butten, who is not a certified teacher, but has had experience in teaching and other work that should fit him for the duties required in the above school.\n\nThe Indian Agent has put the repairs of the school house in the hands of a competent workman and they are going on at present but not yet completed.\n\nMr. Demarais has been notified that the school will be taken over by Mr. Butten in the beginning of November.\n\nAs the old Mission House is at a distance from the school, and also Mr. Demarais would have been inconvenienced by being asked to remove so late.\nIn the mean time, a small dwelling house for Mr. Butten is being erected near the school. This house is put up in such a way that an addition may be conveniently made, should larger premises be required in the interests of the school.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\nBattleford, Sask., Oct 8th 1910\n\nHugh Pedley Esq\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Pedley,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr C. T. Desmarais, teacher on the Little Pine Indian reserve, Battleford District to the effect that he has a communication from Archdeacon McKay to the effect that the Department are putting another teacher in his place and giving him notice to vacate the position.\n\nMr Desmarais has been a teacher for the Department for the past twenty years, and his work has been satisfactory, and if the Department have the making of this appointment any maintenance of same I would urge upon you the importance of retaining Mr Desmarais in the present position until advised further by me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Butcher, who, although not the holder of a certificate, you consider competent to perform the duties required.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to accept this nomination and will pay Mr. Butcher at the rate of $500.00 per annum. The Department will communicate direct with Mr. Butcher after November 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, October 17, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the continuance of the services of Mr. G. T. Desmarais as teacher of the Little Pine Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the reports received by the Department from several sources showed that the school under Mr. Desmarais' management was making no progress whatever and it was decided to ask the authorities of the Church of England, with whom the nomination of a teacher rests, to relieve Mr. Desmarais and recommend someone else for the position. This the Church did and they have completed all arrangements to transfer to this school Rev. Mr. Butcher, one of their missionaries. The Department regrets very much that it is not, therefore, in a position to comply with your request.\n\nI may add for your information that the Church has been good enough to let Mr. Desmarais remain in the house at present occupied by him for an indefinite period. He will not, therefore, be put to the inconvenience of moving this season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Champagne, Esq., M.P.,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, October 17, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn response to a request from the Department the Church of England has nominated for the position of teacher of the Little Pine day school Rev. Mr. Butcher to succeed Mr. Desjarais. It is the wish of the Department to greatly improve conditions at this school and you will be expected to render Mr. Butcher every assistance in your power.\n\nIt has been suggested that a light mid-day lunch would prove an incentive to regular attendance and the Department wishes to try the experiment. There is an Indian living near the school-house whose wife it is stated is quite competent to prepare a simple lunch and you should at once make terms with her to do so. You should, in addition to the usual issue of biscuits, supply some soup meat, rice, salt, tea, flour, beans and a little bacon. The object is not to give a full meal, but rather to supplement the lunches brought from home by the children. These lunches are provided now in a number of our schools and very often take the form of some soup, which is much relished by the children.\n\nThe Department will expect monthly reports showing the total cost of this lunch and the number of meals served. The cost per meal should be approximately 2 cents exclusive of the cost of preparation.\n\nIt has also been suggested to the Department that\n\nJ. P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nthe children on this reserve should be conveyed to the school. You will be good enough to submit a sketch showing approximately the location of the Indians and the distances they reside from the school. You should obtain an estimate of the cost of conveying the children to and from the school, at the same time reporting fully your views upon this matter.\n\nIn the meantime arrangements for the mid-day lunch should be made to go into effect when Mr. Butcher takes charge, which will be in the first week of November. I may say that his salary will be at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nYou will be good enough to give these matters your best attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have only just received your letter No. 117070/1 of the 25th inst., referring to Mr. C. T. Demarais, teacher of the Little Pine's day school. As definite arrangements have been already made and the Department has sanctioned the appointment of the new teacher it would seem undesirable to reconsider the matter.\n\nI would also state that we have treated Mr. Demarais with all the consideration we could under the circumstances. He is allowed to occupy the Mission house as long as it suits his convenience and I know that he is not by any means in poor circumstances. He has some cattle, implements and vehicles, and a residence which I am told is one of the best in the district, near the Reserve.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nIndian Affairs.

Because we Roman Catholics are in the majority and think it only fair that the school should be a Roman Catholic School.\n\n2. Because we want our children taught the Roman Catholic religion in the school.\n\nTherefore we prefer sending them to a Roman Catholic School.\n\n[Signature]\nMarquis\n\n[Signature]\nAtsinaqua\n\n[Signature]\nWilliam Scott\n\n[Signature]\nKanpatapquay\n\n[Signature]\nChequano\n\n[Signature]\nJim Child\n\n[Signature]\nHiskekort\n\n[Signature]\nOkechewan\n\n[Signature]\nPeter Kakum\nIndian Affairs.

This church has a vested right in the school that cannot be ignored. Again the latest statistics do not show that your claim that the Roman Catholics are in the majority is well founded.\n\nFor these reasons it is, as above said, impossible for the Department to consider any action along the line suggested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMasquaw,\nIndian,\nLittle Pines Reserve,\nPaynton, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say, relative to the Little Pine Day School, that I have been there three times since the receipt of your instructions on this subject.\n\nRev Mr Butcher, the Teacher, commenced his duties on the first of November last. I am glad to say that since he took over the management of this School, a very great improvement has taken place both in attendance, conduct of the institution and the progress of the Children; and judging from present indications the attendance continues to increase; I should think that after the next mid-Summer Term this School House will be much too small for the accommodation of the Pupils; and I would respectfully recommend that a new School House should then be built, also a residence for the Teacher, who should be a married man; and that a small extra compensation should be allowed the Teacher's Wife for the preparing of the mid-day Meal for the Scholars.\n\nWhen Mr Butcher commenced his duties at this School, we talked over the subject of Noon Meal; but as no woman could be obtained situated at a convenient distance from the School who was suitable or willing to undertake the preparation of this Meal, Mr Butcher himself signified his willingness to do this work, as J. D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\n\nASSISTANT DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Butcher is meeting with success in his work.\n\nIn view of the extensive building operations that the Department is already under obligation to undertake during the coming summer the erection of a school-house here will have to stand over till next year.\n\nYour action in procuring the necessary articles to furnish the mid-day meal is approved and the accounts have been paid. I would call your attention to the fact that in letter of October 17th, last, you were informed the Department would like to have monthly reports showing the cost of this meal. Kindly give this matter your attention.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report upon the seating accommodation, stating the number of desks and the kind and whether more are needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I sent children home who were ill and on Thursday 14th 911 were down with it. So I thought it best closed for a few days to prevent it spreading. 3 of 4 present on Thursday were down with it on Friday & Sat. and as Saturday & Sunday came so close I considered they would have far greater opportunity for speedy recovery & less for spreading.\n\nAs Wednesday next being Ash\n\nIndian Affairs.

Where Agency employees have a right conception of their duties and responsibilities to the Indians as well as to the Department pronounced amelioration in the conditions on the reserve is in evidence in their homes and mode of life. The Department is undertaking Indian education in its broadest sense and everything must not be left to the teacher; all should co-operate to obtain appreciable results. It is hoped, therefore, that you will make an earnest endeavour to assist the new teacher and make a success of the Little Pines day school, where prospects at the present time are evidently very fair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nBattleford, Sask.\nNov. 28th 1911\n\nAssume it has been reported to you that Rev. Mr. Butten gave up the school on Little Pine's Reserve at the end of the last quarter, as he had to return to Calgary to finish his course. With the concurrence of the agent, James Wintune, a graduate of the Battleford Industrial School, has been appointed temporarily. It is hoped that Mr. Wintune will keep the children under good influence, and that some progress will be made, and that this arrangement will be better than closing the school. James Wintune has been lately married to a very nice girl, also a graduate of the Battleford School, and it is expected that their influence on the Reserve generally will be for good.\n\nIt is not expected that the Department will give Mr. Wintune a higher salary than the ordinary rate.\n\nIt is to be regretted that Mr. Butten had to leave for a time, as his work showed a very marked improvement on the former state of things, but it is not to be expected that such a teacher as the Department desires can be permanently secured until then.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nin suitable accommodation.\n\nThe present school house is too small and altogether out of date, and the teacher's house is a flat-roofed shack, 18 x 12 feet, which was hastily run up last autumn to accommodate Mr. Butten. The former teacher's house is unfit for further use and was always too far away from the school.\n\nYours, sir,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\nOttawa, December 5, 1911.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to the resignation of Rev. Mr. Butcher as teacher of the Little Pines Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this was the first intimation that the Department had of the resignation. The temporary appointment of Mr. James Wutunee at a salary of $300.00 is approved. I may say that Mr. Butcher's resignation is regretted and it is hoped that you will be able at an early date to nominate a competent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. Mackay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, December 5, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the Ven. Archdeacon MacKay advising of the resignation of Rev. Mr. Butcher as teacher of the Little Pines Day school on September 30th, last. It seems very strange that this resignation should not have been reported by you and I have to ask you to explain. I may add that the temporary appointment of Mr. James Wutunee at a salary of $300.00 per annum is approved. I would ask you to give him the necessary instructions as to his work.\n\nIt is noted that you have not carried out the instructions to make monthly reports upon the day schools in your agency since May, last. From this time forward these reports will be expected regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say that on the 28th July last an Interim Return of the Littlepine Day School, made by the Rev Mr Butcher, was forwarded to the Department; and in the Remarks Column it is stated by him \"Receipts and Usage to be put in next\" \"Report at end of Quarter - A full List left for\" \"Successor.\"\n\nI note what you say as to the temporary appointment of James Wuttanee; and will give him the necessary instructions as to his work, and also any help he may actually need for the successful carrying on of this school. With regard to the Monthly Reports on the Day Schools of this Agency; I will, in the future, send them in regularly.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\nASSISTANT DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMarch 19th 1812\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to my previous letters regarding the school on Little Pine's Reserve I beg to say that it appears Mr James Britten was under a misapprehension with regard to the salary when he took charge of the school. The case is as follows. I authorized Rev. J. Matheson in my absence to endeavor to find a teacher to take temporary charge of the school but I did not name any salary assuming that the ordinary rate would be all that could be expected without a special arrangement with the Department. Then when I read that James Britten had been engaged I wrote to the Department mentioning the same salary which I considered would be all that the Department would be prepared to pay to a man of his stamp without any special qualifications.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nappears that Mr. Mactavish was engaged without any definite understanding with regard to stipend but he had heard that the former teacher had been in receipt of a larger stipend and appears to have expected more than the $300 per annum. His success with the school has certainly far exceeded my expectations and I think his case deserves consideration.

Dated August 15th, 1912.\n\nOriginal on File 117070/5\n\nI understand from Arch deacon Mackay that a field matron is to be appointed to the reserve. My mother, Mrs. Edith Butcher, has been doing this work since June 1st of this year and if you will appoint her will be glad to prepare the children's meals, teach domestic science and to care for the children when they are unwell. Also so far as she has the time, to do anything for the adult Indians. My mother has attended the Indians on more than one occasion of sickness and is constantly called upon to treat them. May I ask what rate of salary the Department would offer her and if she might be appointed as from June 1st, last, seeing she has done the work. I wrote the agent about this and other matters, but receiving no reply to a single communication, I am obliged to write to you direct.\n\nYours very faithfully\n\nSgd. Alweyn V. Butcher,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 24th, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 15th instant, in which you deal with the field matron work on the Little Pine Reserve, I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to accept your mother's services, and will make payment at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nHer duties will consist of the preparation of the mid-day meal, the teaching of Domestic Science in the school room, and general field matron work among the Indians of the Reserve, as far as it is possible for her to attend to this part of the work. If accepted the Department will pay a full quarter's salary at the end of the month of September, which will be fair remuneration for the month of September and also for the work done previous to the holidays.\n\nAs soon as you are heard from the Agent will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Butcher, teacher of the Little Pines School, for her services as field matron on the reserve during the past summer. It appears that Mrs. Butcher has prepared the mid-day meal and done general field matron work among the Indians of the reserve. She is leaving on October 10th and the Department will make payment from the time she commenced the work up to that date at the rate of $300.00 per annum, payment to be based on the actual number of school days that she was engaged.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that a voucher is forwarded as quickly as possible.\n\nRev. Mr. Butcher states that he will be pleased to supervise the preparation of the mid-day meal in future and asks to be provided with a suitable stove and the necessary wood. You are hereby authorized to purchase as a stove for this purpose and also to see that the necessary fuel is provided. A small stove is all that will be necessary and you should see that it is bought at the lowest possible price. You should be guided by the patronage list in making this purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nAsst.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to your post card of the 2nd instant I beg to inform you that a cheque for your salary as teacher of the Little Pines Day School for the September quarter last, was sent to your address at Paynton, Sask., by registered letter on the 30th ultimo.\n\nThe Indian Agent was requested to forward a voucher covering the amount due to Mrs. Butcher for her services as field matron during the quarter ended September 30th, last. This has not yet been received, but the Agent is being written to again with reference to this matter.\n\nNo accounts for wood supplied have yet reached the Department. The Agent will also be asked to forward these.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. E. Butcher,\nTeacher,\nLittle Pines Indian Day School,\nPaynton, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say, with reference to the payment of Mrs Butcher for her Services as Field Matron on Littlepine Reserve during the past Summer, that I am forwarding herewith Voucher No 53 $108.70 which is based upon her pay for four months and eight days, at the rate of $300.00 per Annum = $25.00 per month; the eight days in October are reckoned as 8/23 of the school days in that month.\n\nMrs Butcher commenced her duties on the 1st of June last; and if her services are computed on the basis of School days from that date, until the 10th of October, the amount would be as follows viz., 95 school days @ $300.00 per Annum of 216 school days = $131.94 - however this School was only open 22 days in June, and 29 days in September Quarter, and counting eight school days in October, this would be equal to 59 days @ $300.00 per Annum of 216 school days = $81.94 - which would be deducting the 37 holidays when Mrs Butcher was during Vacation, absent from the Reserve.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

This calculation is made as follows: from the first of June to the 10th of October inclusive there are 46 teaching days. There are 200 teaching days in the year, not 216, as you will see by reference to the Day School Regulations, and Mrs. Butcher is, therefore, being paid $8/200 or $300.00, or $72.00.\n\nA copy of the Day School Regulations has already been sent to you, but in case it has been mislaid another is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nI much regret it should be necessary to write you again and beg you to bear with me while I state certain facts in connection with this work here. May I say in the first place that at time of writing Nov 26th it is quite possible this may cross with a letter from you to me, and if so, part of this letter with reference to field location work will not apply.\n\nYour letter of Nov 7th reached me on Tuesday last and your agent Mr. J. Rowland happened to be here at the time. I pointed out to him that you had not received the vouchers whereupon he declared he had sent them in person himself. My mother left here on October 10th continuing the work of field location up to that date, having commenced on June 25th of this year. She requests she be made payable to me as I advanced her money before she left. Should the cheque be sent by way now & cross with this & be made payable to Mrs. Beattie I will send it on to her for her signature. But it is most unfair that we should have to wait so long & be so much inconvenience.\nwrite to your agent neglect of duty.\n\nII. The bill for wood which I have supplied to the Indians I sent to the agent on Oct. 1st for $12.00. Since then I have had to buy another load at $3.50 making $15.50 in all. The Indians will not supply wood on trust. Even now our Reserve Inspector has had great difficulty in getting a man to haul the wood as the Indians say they do not care to wait six months for their money when by hauling the wood a few miles they can sell for cash at $5.00 per load. I am aware this is not due to the department, but it is only right that the agency of the agent in these matters be pointed out. I have been writing to the agent since last June about this matter. No reply has ever been made to my letters & the first load has only just been bought, this after five months of writing every Sunday for $15.00. Moreover, I can no more afford to wait so long than the Indians can. I may just as well work to a non-existent person as work to the Battleford agency. And when the agent came down he was full of apologies, but...\nBut this does not help matters much.\n\nI apologize for having to take up your valuable time with these things, but the negligence of the Agent cannot go unheralded.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours Very Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to matters in connection with the Little Pines School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on November 18th the Department sent a cheque in favour of your mother for $72.00, being payment of her services as field matron on the reserve from June 1st to October 10th. At the time this cheque was sent the Agent was requested to forward voucher for $12.00 for the wood supplied the school. This has not yet come to hand and he will be again written to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. H.

English and wife for Little Pines.\n\nI have heard indirectly that he has applied to you, but that may not be correct. He is eminently fitted as a teacher as he has been a schoolmaster (successfully) all his life till he came to Canada. She is a most capable mother, housekeeper, etc., and would have an excellent influence, besides having had experience in nursing and domestic medicine, having brought up a large family. The drawback - on their side, not ours - is a family of children, but they are willing to accommodate themselves to conditions, if only the house is sufficient to barely contain them, and the salary is sufficient to maintain them. I can recommend them heartily, both as to capabilities, energy, and character. Of course they know absolutely no Cree language. Little Pines has a number of children, and needs some encouragement and extra effort. For this appointment there is necessary (1) the completion of the new residence with accommodation (even though barely so) for parents and 3 or 4 children. (2) a proper school and equipment and (3) a \"living wage\" salary. To such a couple as the Englishes I think you should offer the same as to Mr. Smiths (Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman) or at least $500, or $900 between husband and wife. I should be glad to hear what you are prepared to do and offer in this case.\n\nIndian Affairs.

English.\n\nMethods and Success.\n\nMr. English's manner and qualifications are evidently much better adapted to white pupils and those of more advanced grades, but without making a special effort to adapt them to his present work they are unsuitable and unsuccessful. The teacher appears to have adopted but few devices for drawing out his pupils, leading them out of their timidity and self-consciousness and inducing them to think and speak. The pupils respect their teacher highly, but hold him in such awe that they cannot be induced to speak in any case above a whisper. I fear that Mr. English's present duties as teacher will never enlist his interest to any large extent. It is but fair to say so far as the examination is concerned, that the teacher stated that all his brightest pupils happened to be absent on the day of inspection.\n\nSgd. W. J. Chisholm,\nInspector\nOttawa, June 25, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that part of your report on the Little Pines Day School, in which you refer to the teaching methods of the Rev. W. H. English, the Department trusts that you pointed out to Mr. English his defects, and also offered him helpful suggestions that would enable him to change his manner and become more in sympathy with his pupils and thus enlist their attention and co-operation.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to point out to you, that when you visit any school and find deficiencies in the teaching methods, you should not only report the matter to the Department, but also offer such suggestions to the teacher as you, from your experience, know should cause improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

English is a teacher of many years' experience in English schools & that I believe he started out to do his best at Little Prince. I know that both he & his wife take deep interest in the Indians, & are always doing kind actions for them. But he gets no response or help from the parents. The children are allowed to stay away as they like. It is painful work for an educated man like going over the same elementary ground, again & again, with the same pupils, and lastly too often the local Indian Agent or Farm Instructor is not only no help but is positive hindrance. It is not fair to punish the teacher for the sins of the Agent. I beg you to consider this.\n\nI remain Yours Truly\n\nJ. A. Newcomb\nBishop of Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 23, 1916.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 15th instant with reference to the progress being made in his work by the Rev. W. H. English, teacher of the Little Pines Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await the report of Your Lordship's inspection of the work being carried on by the teacher of this school. The Agent is being written to and instructed to give the teacher every assistance he can, as well as to use his influence with the parents in order to secure a more regular attendance at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, August 23, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department is in receipt of reports on the Little Pines Bay School which show that it is making little or no progress. This matter was brought to the attention of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, who states that he will make inquiry and, if possible, an inspection of the work of this school as soon as possible. The Bishop speaks very highly of the experience and interest taken in the work by the present teacher, Rev. W. H. English, and his wife. His Lordship states that the trouble at this point seems to be the irregular attendance of the Indian children and that the teacher gets no response or help from the parents in regard to sending their children to school.\n\nI have to request that you will give the teacher every assistance in your power and endeavour to have the parents send their children more regularly to this school. It is the duty of Agents to impress on the parents their responsibility in connection with the sending of their children regularly to school and also at all times to assist and encourage teachers as far as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CROMIE ON THE LITTLE PINE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nTeacher,- Rev.W.H.English\n\nThe discipline of this school is good but this appears to be maintained by the somewhat stern attitude of the teacher, who appears to be held in awe by the pupils. He does not seem able to get them to speak out and I found it almost impossible to get an answer of any kind from the pupils.\n\nI noticed, also, that at times he makes use of the Cree language in school and the opening exercises are conducted by him both in Cree and English.\n\nFrom the long experience Mr. English appears to have had in teaching in white schools and from observation of his methods in school I can only conclude that he is more adapted to teaching in a school for white boys where the strictest discipline has to be maintained.\n\nI can only report that so far as I was able to observe the pupils of this school are making very little progress.\n\nDate of Inspection,-October 15th, 1916.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith Inspection Reports upon all the schools in the Battleford Agency, which I trust will be found to be in order.\n\nWith regard to the cost of noon meals. In order that a closer check may be kept upon the provisions supplied for noon meal, I would suggest that every Agency in this Inspectorate adopt the monthly \"Report of Provisions Used\" form now in use at Carlton Agency. The clerks might also be instructed to forward to the Department each month a memorandum of cost of meals in the schools. The cost of meals in the schools of the Battleford Agency appear very excessive and I presume it would be in order for the Department to notify the teachers just what the meals are expected to cost.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nEncl.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Crombie, who recently visited the schools in your agency, has brought to the Department's attention, the cost of the mid-day meal at these schools.\n\nThe cost of these meals seems to be rather excessive and the Department wishes you to furnish at once a menu of the mid-day meal served at the Little Pine, Murray Lake, Red Pheasant and Poundmaker schools.\n\nIt is, also, noted that, at the Red Pheasant school, the driver received his meal each day. This man is paid for driving the children and it was not intended that he should, also, receive his meals. You might report on this when you are answering the question contained in the previous paragraph.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReference your letter No 117070-1, Dec. 21st., 1916.\n\nI beg to advise you that the following is the menu for the midday meal at the day schools.\n\nPoundmaker School. They are given either bean, rice, pea or barley soup and either beef or bacon with two biscuits. The meat is usually cooked with the soup.\n\nLittlepine School. This is the same as the Poundmaker School with the addition of rice pudding occasionally.\n\nMoosomin School. This is the same as at the Poundmaker School.\n\nRed Pheasant School. At this school they have pea, bean, barley and rice soup with vegetable soup once a week. They are also given beef and bacon with potatoes and two biscuits.\n\nAt all the schools they are given tea with milk and sugar.\n\nRe. the driver at Red Pheasant School receiving his meal.

I'm not quite sure, but I think he meant that he had sent his resignation to your Department.\n\nI have secured the offer of a married man and wife, who seem fitted above the average for this school. They have both had experience in teaching (for some years) & have taught & managed Indian Day schools in the far North, Mr. & Mrs. Henry Ellis. They are well spoken of. They would like to begin at once, & Mr. Ellis wishes to leave at once. I beg to nominate Mr. & Mrs. Ellis for the positions of Teacher & Matron of Little Pines School, at the scheduled rate given me of $600 per Teacher & $300 per Matron.\n\nI would ask an early reply as I may not be able to secure them if there is delay.

However, in view of Your Lordship's recommendation, Mr. and Mrs. Ellis may be appointed as teacher and matron and they should take up their duties as soon as Mr. English leaves.

(c) that I could not honestly approve of his appointment and have told him so and (d) that I had already offered the school to Rev. M.B. Edwards, a diligent and earnest Miss'ry to the Crees, now at Ft. Stanley, and whose wife also is very diligent in work among the women.

D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. M.B. Edwards resignation as Teacher at Little Pines, and would recommend that it be accepted, as he has been teaching by substitute since last spring on account of sickness from which he cannot recover. Mrs. Edwards resignation was forwarded to you some time ago.\n\nI am of the opinion that the Department would be justified in closing up this school as well as the one on Poundmakers, there are 270 Indians on these two Reserves and it is rare to find more than six children in either school at any time which makes the cost per capita nearly double what it costs at the Boarding Schools, and the results certainly do not justify it, if anything the Poundmakers school is less use than the other, they are both used principally for missionary work, the education of the children is secondary, and the Indians simply won't send their children or make any effort to assist the schools and when wood is required it is a case of hold up and a fight to get them to bring it. The buildings at Poundmakers are rented from the Catholic Church at $75.00 a quarter and the church is used as the school.\n\nThis might be made a success if the Little Pines school buildings were moved down to the Farm Instructors at the boundary and one school used independent of the churches, with drivers for each reserve, it would certainly be cheaper.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) S.L. MacDONALD,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Sept. 29th, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have to advise you that Mr. M. B. Edwards has resigned as teacher at Little Pines, in the Battleford Agency, to take effect at the end of this month; and I enclose a copy of the report received from Mr. Macdonald, in which he advises the closing of the school at this Reserve, as well as the one on Poundmakers. I agree with the recommendations of the Agent.\n\nIn regard to the children who have been attending the day school at Little Pines, it seems to me that we may adopt the same arrangement as has recently been adopted at Carlton, and have these children taken to the boarding school at Brandon; and if you concur in this suggestion, I will communicate with Mr. Ferrier.\n\nThe expense of maintaining the day schools is not justified by results, and you will note Mr. Macdonald's comment, that the cost per capita is nearly double that at boarding schools.\n\nIn regard to the school at Poundmakers, this should also be closed, and accommodation found for the children at Delmas.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nExtract from Report of Insp. W. Murison on the Battleford Agency, dated Sept. 16, 1920. Original on 427021-5\n\nLITTLE PINES DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is situated in a central position on the Little Pines Reserve and is under the auspices of the Church of England. There are 10 pupils enrolled, 6 boys and 4 girls. The average attendance for the June quarter being 4.59 which is very unsatisfactory. The pupils looked and were untidy and in anything but a clean condition. The Rev'd Mr. Edwards is teacher and his wife field matron. They have both sent in their resignations owing to the continued ill health of Mr. Edwards who is in Battleford Hospital and is not expected to recover.\n\nThe class-room work has been carried on by Miss Coates who does not appear to me to be a competent teacher.\n\nThe Department have provided splendid buildings here. They are in a good state of repair but require repainting. There is room for an up-to-date protestant boarding school in the Battleford agency.\n\nW. Murison.\nInsp.\nOttawa, October 28, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo informing the Department that Mr. M. B. Edwards has resigned as teacher of the Little Pines Indian Day School, his resignation to take effect from the last day of September, and also enclosing a copy of a report which you received from Mr. Agent Macdonald, in which he advises the closing of this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the Agent's recommendation, which is approved by yourself, this school may remain closed for the present. Your suggestion that the children from this reserve be sent to the Brandon Industrial School still receive consideration.\n\nWith reference to the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve I beg to say that the Department is including in the estimates for submission to parliament at the next session an increase of forty in the pupilage at the Thunderchild's Boarding School, and, if this item is approved, the children of school age on the Poundmaker's Reserve can be placed in the Thunderchild's Boarding School. With the new addition, which is just about ready for occupation, this school will be able to provide adequate accommodation for ninety children and the grant will be increased to that number, but will not be available until April 1st, next. In the meantime the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve is to remain open. I shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Agent Macdonald accordingly.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give the necessary instructions to those concerned for the placing of all the children of school age who are Roman Catholics and in good health in the Thunderchild's Boarding School after the first of April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I can speak the Indian language, though not perfectly. I can speak enough to hold a conversation with an Indian.\n\nI have had one year High School training in Saskatchewan, also a Business Course at the Western Commercial College, Saskatoon.\n\nIf these qualifications are satisfactory, would you let me know upon what terms you would engage a teacher. I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs) J. J. Dallop.\nOttawa, February 11, 1921.\n\nMadam,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant applying for the position as teacher in the Little Pines Indian Day School and stating the qualifications which you possess.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the intention at present to re-open this school, and the Department, therefore, is unable to avail itself of your services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gallop,\nBox 260,\nNorth Battleford,\nSask.\nBishopthorpe\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\n2-5-21\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nAfter our long talk the other day, I am putting into writing my earnest request, and the earnest plea of the Little Pinee Indians, that their school be reopened. I append extracts from a letter I received last week. Our Indians will not send their children to the R.C.School at Delmas, and should not be asked to do so. Our boarding schools are over-full, and the I.D. will not give another. Elkhorn is too far away, and besides its new re-opening is yet only in the air. Little Pinee Indians have never had proper opportunity either from the Church or the I.D. They desire (they say) and should have educational facilities. It seems doubly hard and unjust to them that the Poundmakers School, with only 2 or 3 pupils, is kept open, and the R.C.s receive $300 per ann. for rent for same! They promise to send their children more regularly. This preferential treatment of the R.C.s naturally causes discontent and talk. If you decide to re-open the school, I should like to know soon, and to know the salary offered, as it may take time to find a competent teacher for such a salary.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"J.A. Newnham\"\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\nExtracts from a letter to the Bishop of Saskatchewan from a clergyman who knows Little Pines, and takes an interest in the Indians there.\n\nApril 1921\n\n\"Our Indians of Little Pines are earnestly asking that the school be re-opened. I interviewed many of them. 27 children of school age on the Reserve.\n\nThe Rom.Cath. School in Poundmakers' is not closed (Apr.21) it was to be closed on April 1st. Their average is only 2 the Farm Instructor tells me the Little Pines Indians feel that their children should have an equal chance. The I.D. is paying $300 per ann. for use of the R.C. Bldgs. while they have a new and empty school on Little Pines Reserve. I promised our Indians to write and let you know their feelings. Meanwhile the R.C. priest has spent much of his time and argument to persuade our Indians to send their children to Delmas R.C.school, but they do not wish to do so. If the school is re-opened, they have promised to send their children regularly. The one substantial meal a day the pupils used to get was a great help to their health. There has been much sickness this winter.\"\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. May 4th, 1921\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter I received from the Bishop of Saskatchewan this morning.\n\nI may say that the Bishop called on me the other day and discussed different matters regarding the school question in his Diocese. The Bishop complains that the order to close his school was carried out, and the Roman Catholic school was allowed to continue on. I explained to his Lordship, that it was the intention of the Department to close both schools; but that the Roman Catholic school was carried on for a few months pending the additional grant for the pupils at Delmas school.\n\nI do not approve of the re-opening of the Little Pines Day School, nor do I approve of continuing the Day School on Poundmaker's. I had a phone message from the Agent, and he stated that the school is practically closed now.\n\nWould it not be well for you to issue instructions to send those children that were formerly attending the Poundmaker School, to the Delmas School, and thus close the matter out?\n\nI do not think that the Roman Catholics have had any preferential treatment, other than they were allowed to continue this school for a few months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

GEORGE EXTON LLOYD, D.D.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\n\nJune 28th, 1922\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have lately been to Little Pine's Reserve in the Battleford Agency where the Improved Day School has been closed for some time. There is a nice lot of children of school age on that Reserve and it seems a great pity that they should have no chance of education. At the same time it is I am well aware a very difficult problem to deal with. The school was closed because there was not sufficient attendance. The Indians now profess to be very anxious to have it re-opened. Whether any arrangements can be made to ensure such an attendance as would justify its being reopened will be for the Department to decide. I would earnestly and respectfully request your kind attention to this matter.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Shockey\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, July 6th, 1922.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the re-opening of the Improved Day School on the Little Pines Reserve. As stated by you, the reason for closing this school was the unsatisfactory attendance.\n\nWe are referring the question of the re-opening of this school to Mr. Commissioner Graham, and asking him to furnish a report as to the number of children who should attend, and whether the Department would be warranted in undertaking the expenses involved in re-opening the school.\n\nAs soon as a reply is received, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

MacKay, Prince Albert, in which he requests that the Improved Day School on the Little Pines Indian Reserve be re-opened. He states that he recently visited this Reserve, and that there is a number of children of school age, and it seems a pity that they should have no chance of an education. He further states that the Indians now profess to be very anxious to have the school re-opened.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to your letter of May 4th, 1921, No. 302-14, in which you stated that you would not approve of the re-opening of this school.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views as to whether the attendance would warrant the Department in undertaking the expense involved in giving this school a further trial.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, stating that you had received a communication from the Venerable Archdeacon A.J. MacKay, Prince Albert, in which he requests that the Improved Day School on Little Pine Reserve be re-opened.\n\nI may say that I have taken this matter up with Agent Macdonald requesting him to furnish me with his views and if he believes that there is any good reason why the Department should now re-open this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

C. or Anglican.\n\nI could not recommend re-opening this school unless Archdeacon Mackay would be willing to guarantee a steady attendance of at least 15 pupils, and from my past experience with this band and attempts to get them to send their children, I figure there is small chance of getting enough attendance to justify it. If this school was re-opened there would be an uproar till the Poundmaker's school opened, and that is worse if anything.\n\nWhen this school was open these Indians would not turn a hand to help it or try to get their children to school without being paid, and I canvassed every house on the reserve before it was closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW.

We have received reports in connection with this matter from Mr. Agent Macdonald, Battleford, and Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina. Both these officers state that they could not recommend the re-opening of this school, as there is a very small chance of getting a sufficient attendance to justify it.\n\nIn view of the reports received, the Department is of the opinion that the results achieved would not warrant the expenditure incurred in having this school re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Archdeacon MacKay to re-open the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. Gentleman has been informed that we do not consider the attendance would warrant the school being re-opened and that we are not prepared to accede to the request made by him at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

MacKay's experiment at the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nThe Rev. Gentleman has been given permission to occupy the buildings and to test the present attitude of the Indians regarding the education of their children. Any assistance you can give him will be appreciated by this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Archdeacon J. A. MacKay, of Prince Albert, has made a special plea in person to this Department, concerning the re-opening of the Little Pines Indian Day School, of the Battleford Agency. The Archdeacon has been given permission to re-open this school, on condition that he gives it his personal attention and supervision, until such time as the experiment has proved successful, or otherwise. The Rev. Gentleman is quite familiar with the discouraging features in the matter of attendance at this school in the past; yet, he is convinced that the Indian Band should be given another opportunity to show an interest in the education of their children.\n\nThe Department will not be to any expense until after Archdeacon MacKay has reported to us that he has the school started and that the attendance warrants an official re-opening. We are asking Mr. Agent Macdonald to assist in any way possible as the Rev. Gentleman undertakes the work.\n\nThe Department has further promised Archdeacon MacKay some equipment and assistance in the matter of keeping about 10 of the smaller children in residence, if he and our agent report favourably after the school has been commenced. We would have to have strong evidence that the scheme would be worth while and the Archdeacon would have to assure us that he has secured the proper type of teacher to carry on the work. In the interim, the Department is not asked to make any expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nJanuary 31, 1925.\n\nMEMO. FOR FILE:\n\nDr. Westgate visited the Department today, and was assured that the activity at Little Pines Day School would not develop into even a small residential school.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to my visit to Ottawa in Sept. last and the interview which you kindly favoured me, the question of the Little Pine Day School was discussed, and, as the Department did not consider it advisable to undertake the re-opening of the school, you kindly allowed me to make the attempt on my own responsibility and at my own expense. It was understood that the school buildings would be placed at my disposal.\n\nOn my arrival from the East, I found that due instructions had been sent to your agent, and I have the pleasure of stating that Mr. McDonald has been most willing to assist me in every way in his power.\n\nI was not able to make complete arrangements for opening the school until towards the end of the year, and the school was only actually opened in the beginning of January. I am forwarding herewith, the Return for Quarter ended March 31st, which shows an enrolment of 26 pupils, and an average attendance of 23 1/12ths. We could easily have had an enrolment of over 30, but, with the number that we have had the school room has been pretty well filled.\n\nFor teacher I secured the services of Miss A.L. Cunningham, one of the best Indian school teachers that I know of, and, under her management, the school is admirably conducted.\n\nIn carrying on the school, I have furnished a mid-day meal, and in every way endeavoured to conduct it according to the Department's system of conducting an Improved Day School.\n\nIn conversation with you regarding the school, there was mention made of keeping a few temporary or weekend boarders. I had forgotten, however, at the time, that this school building does not provide accommodation such as the Mistawasis and a few other schools do, so that the idea had to be abandoned, and I found that it was necessary to have a driver in order to secure a regular attendance.\n\nWhen the Department decides to take over the school, as I hope and trust it will, I shall be prepared to furnish a statement of expenditure, and I think the Department will find that the expenditure has not been expensive and that the results are satisfactory.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

I note, further, that you have arranged for the transporting of those children who are living some distance from the school.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will prepare a statement of the expenditure that you have incurred and give an estimate of the current expenses as from April first. These should be presented to Mr. Agent Macdonald, of Battleford, who is being asked for a report and a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen.

I shall be pleased if you will give us an independent report on this activity, generally, and make a recommendation as to the advisability of the Department's formally taking over the work. You should also forward the Rev. Gentleman's statement of expenditure. It will not be necessary to have this supported by proper voucher forms, at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Mackey, left two days ago for the Carleton Agency and will be away two weeks so that I will not be able to get the Statement of expenditure for the Department till he returns, but beg to report as follows on this school.\n\nA very careful annual report was made on this School which the Department has no doubt seen by this time and while at Little Pines this week I spent a whole forenoon in the school and if anything it is improving, there were 22 children present, their progress is very good, the discipline, school room appearance and condition of the children is exceptional.\n\nI have thought this matter over carefully and would recommend to the Department, that the school be left under the direct charge of the Ven Archdeacon and that the Department supply the necessary school supplies and pay him a lump sum for the running of the school based on the cost per month, of the four months that the school has been open, he could send his reports etc through this office in the regular way and come under inspection, but to have practically a free hand in running the school.\n\nMy reasons for the above recommendation are firstly that I would not like to see this school again deteriorate to the regular Day school standard, which it would naturally do, as the Department do not assist and clothe these children and people or feed them the way it is done in this school. The children are well dressed and given two outfits of everything in the way of clothing, as well as many extras in food as well as clothing which is all supplied free by Church Aid Societies, this is never available to the same extent in the Department schools and they would now expect it.\n\nAs soon as the Archdeacon returns I will get the Statement of expenditure and forward it to the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 1, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 595-304 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the Little Pines Indian School. I have noted your remarks and your recommendation, and will await your statement of expenditure, before making a decision regarding the future of this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The well has gone bad and the water is not fit to use, the Archdeacon thought it needed cleaning and had a Well digger out, cleaned the well and went down an additional ten feet, but it seems no better, this item was paid for by the Archdeacon but has not been included in his statement, the cost was $50.00.\n\nThe Lavatories are in bad shape, with the flooring and seats almost gone and one should be built at the Teachers residence, the two at the school should be moved when they are repaired, as they are caved in and almost filled, I would advise that this repair work be done when the Contractors are building the Little Pines residence as the Carpenters and material will be right there.\n\nWith regard to the Department taking over the School, I recommended that it be left with the Archdeacon in my last letter and I mentioned this to him and he stated that he would much prefer the Department to take it over, with Miss Cunningham in charge and that he would continue to reside there and assist when possible. I might add that the Ven Archdeacon has been in rather poor health lately and as he is over 85 cannot stand very much and the work is telling on him.\n\nMiss Cunningham would stay on, but I believe that an increase to $60.00 a month would not be out of place for the work she is doing and the Assistant Miss Wallis could be retained as Field Matron to work under the direction of Miss Cunningham who is a trained Nurse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A copy is herewith enclosed.\n\nI have left out one item of expenditure, $50.00 which I paid for having the well cleaned out and deepened. The work, I am sorry to say, is not very satisfactory, and I am not sure that the well can be depended on to furnish a sufficient supply of water.\n\nI am glad to state that the attendance at the school continues regular, and that the progress of the pupils, under Miss Cunningham's tuition, is all that could be expected.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 19, 1923.\n\nDear Archdeacon MacKay:\n\nYour letters with reference to the activity of the Little Pines Indian Day School have been drawn to my attention. Very satisfactory reports have come from our Agent, Mr. Inspector Morrison and from the Public School Inspector for that district. I wish to congratulate you on your very successful re-opening of school activity at this point.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Department approves of the appointment of Miss A. L. Cunningham and Miss Wallis to the positions of senior and junior teacher, respectively. Their salaries will be at the rate of $50 and $25 per month, as from January first, and for the quarter commencing September first, next, will be increased to $60 and $30, respectively. I have directed that the cheques for their salary for the March quarter be made payable to you, as I understand that you have financed the school to date.\n\nFurther, the Department is prepared to reimburse you for the expenses in connection with the kitchen and dining room equipment, the sleigh complete, fuel for the school and the transportation of the children\u2014a total of $518.36, as shown on your financial statements forwarded to the Department by Mr. Agent Macdonald. You should present to Mr. Agent Macdonald the receipts that you have obtained in this connection, and he will prepare vouchers in your favour and submit them to the Department. I am also directing that the teacher's residence be calcimined and that the outside lavatories be put into good condition.\n\nThe expenses, other than the teachers' salaries for the September and following quarters, will be met by Parliamentary Appropriation. The school will be allowed to purchase certain provisions for the noonday meal and we will continue the transportation of children. Mr. Agent Macdonald is being instructed in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nLittle Pines Indian Day School,\nRaynton P.

(RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 20, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 647-304 of the 28th ultimo, with general reference to the Little Pines Indian Day school. In view of the satisfactory reports by yourself and others, the Department has decided to officially re-open this school and assume the responsibility. Miss A. L. Cunningham and Miss Wallis are appointed to the positions of senior and junior teacher, at salaries of $50 and $25 per month, respectively, as from January first and at the rate of $60 and $30 as from the first of September, next. The Department is making cheques for the March quarter payable to the Ven. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay. It is understood that Miss Wallis - whose Christian name should be mentioned by you in your next communication in this connection - although appointed junior teacher, is to undertake extension work on the reserve.\n\nFurther, the Department is prepared to reimburse Archdeacon MacKay for the expenses he has incurred in connection with the kitchen and dining room equipment, the sleigh complete, the fuel for the school and the transportation of the children - a total of $518.36, as shown on his financial statements forwarded by you. The Rev. Gentleman has been instructed to present to you receipts covering these items and you should prepare vouchers in his favour and submit them to the Department. You will also make arrangements to have the teacher's residence properly calcimined and have the outside lavatories put in good condition. This last repair may be done when the contractors mentioned in your communication are on the ground. For the future you are authorized to continue the arrangements made by the Archdeacon for the transportation of the children. You should also supervise the purchase of the staple provisions that are allowed for the noonday meal. Accounts should be presented to the Department, properly certified by yourself, from time to time.\n\nYou may also inform Miss Cunningham that, in the event of Archdeacon MacKay leaving the entire management of the school in her hands, the Department will give favourable consideration to a remuneration more in keeping with the type of work she is doing. The Department will expect you to keep the expense in connection with the outbuildings at the school as low as possible. Please obtain competitive prices if material is purchased and keep proper time sheets for any labour that is engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 20th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has approved of the re-opening of the Little Pines Indian Day School. As you were informed under cover of December 25th, last, the Ven. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay was given permission to commence this activity sometime ago. Such successful reports have reached the Department that we have decided to assume the responsibility and continue the school operations.\n\nMiss A. L. Cunningham and Miss Wallis have been appointed to the positions of senior and junior teacher, at salaries of $50 and $25 per month, respectively. These salaries will be increased to $60 and $30 per month, as from the 1st of September, next. Further, the Department is prepared to carry on the school on the improved plan, viz: noonday meal for the children, and, in addition, their transportation to and from home in the case of those living at some distance from the school.\n\nMr. Agent Macdonald has been instructed in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter No. 105-2-1, of the 19th ult. and to thank you for the same.\n\nI am very thankful to hear that the Department approves of the appointment of Miss A.L. Cunningham and Miss Wallis to the positions of senior and junior teacher, respectively, in the day school here, and that their salaries will be increased for the quarter commencing September first, next.\n\nI beg also to express my sincere thanks for the refund by the Department of the salaries of these ladies for the March quarter, and also for the information that the Department is prepared to reimburse me for the various other expenses in connection with the school to the amount of $518.36. The receipts for the various items will be presented to Mr. Agent Macdonald, in accordance with your instructions.\n\nI have to thank you also for directing that the teacher's residence be cleansed, and that the outside lavatories be put in good condition.\n\nI shall be glad to have the Department re-assume complete control of the school, but I shall continue to do my best to see that the work is a success.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 27, 1923.\n\nMemo. for File:\n\nI have noted, with deep regret, the passing on Sunday, last, of the Ven. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay.\n\nHe was in charge of this improved Day School.\n\nDec 15:\n\nBishop Boyd urges us to carry on as now conducted.\n\nR.H.A.\nSir,\n\nOn the 11th while at Little Pines Reserve, I spent the afternoon, with Miss Cunningham at the Little Pines Day school, I arrived there unexpectedly, so that I found the school as it actually works each day and it was a credit to any school, the work of the pupils, condition and appearance of the children and school was a treat. There were 29 children present and three absent and the attendance had been almost perfect.\n\nMy chief reason for this letter is, regarding the Salary of Miss Cunningham, which is at present $600.00 and as I understand the grade of wages for teachers is $600.00 and where they have qualifications $800.00, Miss Cunningham informed me that she did not have qualifications, but her experience and ability and training as a Nurse are certainly worth the better salary. She is without doubt the best I have yet seen in the way of teachers in Indian schools and in my estimation is worth several pf the average teachers holding written qualifications and with neither the knowledge or ability to properly teach Indian Children, which after all is the principle requirement in teaching the Indians and I would strongly recommend that Miss Cunningham be paid as a qualified teacher.\n\nWith regard to the School driver, I would like authority to increase him from $1.50 to $2.00 per day as his work is really worth $2.50, he has to drive 14 miles to pick up the children and bring them to school usually arriving at 8.30 and has to make the 14 miles again to take the children home after four, at the Consolidated school at Paynton near the reserve, the drivers are getting $4.00 a day for the same work.\n\nI might add that Miss Cunningham has made no protest about her salary, but it is just a case of, if she got a better offer she would take and she is one of the teachers that is worth keeping and deserves encouragement for the work she is doing, the condition and personal appearance of the children are as important as the actual school work and both are far above average in her school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Feb. 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1021-304 of the 18th instant, reporting on the activity of the Little Pines Indian Day School. I am pleased to note that the work has been successful and that Miss A. L. Cunningham, the Senior Teacher, deserves great credit. In view of your recommendation, the Department will increase her salary to $750 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law - such increase to date from April first, next. Please inform the teacher accordingly. You are also authorized to pay the driver who brings the children to school a remuneration of $2 per day. Such increase will also date from the first of the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, Feb. 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Miss A. L.

L. Cunningham, Senior Teacher of the Little Pines Indian Day School, and on account of the Department's wish to retain her services, it has been decided to increase her salary to $750 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law.

I presume you refer to Miss M. Wallis, the junior teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School, who performs field matron's duties. If this is the case, please intamate the source of your information and the Department will correspond with the Church Authorities with reference to a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your #105-2-1 of the 22nd instant, I beg to state that my information that the Field Matron at Little Pines had resigned was furnished me by Mr. S.L. Macdonald, Indian Agent, who has since further written on the subject stating that he has made arrangements with Miss Faithfull, Missionary on the Reserve, to assume the duties of Matron until an appointment can be made at a salary of $25.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 2nd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 302-12 of the 26th ultimo, regarding the arrangement that has been made to continue the duties of the junior teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of Miss Faithfull performing the duties of junior teacher, which includes matron's duties, at a salary of $25 per month, until such time as the appointment of a successor to Miss Wallis, who recently resigned, can be made. We are requesting His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan to nominate a junior teacher for this school, and you will be advised when the appointment has been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, September 2nd, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe department has been informed that Miss M. Wallis, the junior teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School, has resigned. Mr. Agent Macdonald, Battleford, has made arrangements with Miss Faithfull, missionary on the Reserve, to assume the duties until the appointment of a teacher can be made, with salary at the rate of $25 per month. I shall be pleased if Your Lordship will nominate the services of a qualified person to succeed Miss Wallis as junior teacher and to perform matron's duties. The salary allowed will be at the same rate as was paid Miss Wallis.\n\nI shall be pleased if Your Lordship will concur in the arrangement made by the Agent to carry on the work until a successor to Miss Wallis can be obtained.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nReferring to your #105-2-1 of the 2nd instant and prior correspondence, I have to advise you that Mr. S.L. Macdonald, Indian Agent at Battleford, has again written me on the subject of the appointment of a Field Matron, and informed me that Miss Faithful was not able to take on the work on account of poor health. He informs me further that he has engaged Miss Maud Edwards until January at a salary of $30.00 per month and bonus as allowed the former matron.\n\nI have written Mr. Macdonald informing him that he had no right whatever to make any arrangements to fill the vacancy before consultation with the Department, more especially in view of the fact that the duties of Matron on this Reserve have been combined with that of the junior teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School, and the Department usually confers with the church authorities before making an appointment. In my opinion there was no need for such haste, and I have so informed Mr. Macdonald, and further that in future he will assume no such responsibility without first referring the matter to me or to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 302-12 of the 11th instant, with reference to the engaging of the services of a junior teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School. I have noted that Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald has temporarily appointed Miss Maud Edwards, at a salary of $30 per month plus bonus.\n\nOn the 2nd instant I wrote the Bishop of Saskatchewan, telling him that temporary arrangements had been made in this connection and asking him for a nomination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Ahenakew this morning, that the name should be Miss O.N.H. Newell and not Miss Faithfull.\n\nHe spoke to me about her at the General Synod and I agreed to her name being given to the Indian Agent to be sent forward to the Department.\n\nThis clause appears in Mr. Ahenakew's report to me. \"The Inspector has been to both this school and that at Thunderchild's and was highly pleased in each case. The attendance in both has been splendid showing that the Indians will support a school if it is run properly.\"\n\nFrom all I can see, I am sure this is correct, a good day school is an incalculable blessing.\n\nWith kindest regards, believe me to be,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEp.\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Newell as assistant teacher and matron at the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to draw Your Lordship's attention to official letter of September 2nd, last, in which you were informed that Mr. Agent Macdonald, Battleford, Sask., had arranged with Miss Faithfull to assume duties temporarily. It subsequently appeared that Miss Faithful was unable, on account of poor health, to take up duties, and the Agent engaged the services of Miss Maud Edwards until the end of the present calendar year. While the Department approved of the temporary appointment of Miss Edwards, the Agent was informed that he should have consulted the Church authorities before making the appointment. The Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Newell to take charge upon the retirement of Miss Edwards. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $300 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law, payment to be based on ten months' service in the school year.\n\nI shall be pleased if Your Lordship will communicate with Mr. S. L. Macdonald, Indian Agent, Battleford, and arrange for Miss Newell to take up duties upon the retirement of Miss Edwards.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Newell as assistant teacher and matron at the Little Pines Indian Day School. We are informing him that you engaged the services of Miss Maud Edwards temporarily until the end of the present calendar year, and that we would approve of the appointment of Miss Newell to take charge upon the retirement of Miss Edwards. The salary allowed Miss Newell will be at the rate of $300 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year.

Little Pines Day School.\n\nMiss Faithful is now doing the work of Junior Teacher but the offer of a stipend of $25.00 a month for ten months for a qualified certificated teacher is absurd (See Mr. MacKenzie's letter of Sept. 2, No. 105-2-1).\n\n[Signature]\n\nInterview\n\nOctober 24\nOttawa, November 11, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to the salary allowed in the case of the junior teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School. You will remember that you raised the question at the time of your interview in the Department last month. I have to inform Your Lordship that, when the late Archdeacon MacKay re-opened this activity, he paid a salary to the two workers of $500 and $250 for the 10 teaching months. When the Department formally took over the school and refunded to Archdeacon MacKay the moneys he had expended, it was decided to allow the senior teacher $600 and the junior teacher $300 for the 10 teaching months, supplemented in each case by the bonus. Your Lordship will understand that Miss Newell, who was classified as Junior Teacher at this school, is really engaged doing field matron's duties, and a stipend of $50 a month plus bonus is considered adequate. She does not have to possess professional qualifications.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter No.105-2-1 Oct 29th, Re Employment of Miss O.M.H.Newall as Matron and Assistant Teacher at Little Pines.\n\nMiss Edwards left on Oct 15th and Miss Newell started to work on that date, Miss Edwards worked as Matron from August 22nd to Oct 15th and if there is any further salary due to her, her address is Miss Maud Edwards, 1010 Elliot st, Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nThe above was all reported to Commissioner W.M. Graham, on Oct 30th.\n\nMiss Newell's full name is Olwen Mary Holt Newell and she is an experienced kindergarten teacher. Would it be allowable to put Miss Newall on the Pay list each month as done with the other matrons.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 13th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department that Miss O. M. H. Newall assumed duties as assistant teacher and matron at the Little Pines Indian Day School on the 15th ultimo. The Department is allowing salary and bonus to Miss Edwards until that date.\n\nWe are forwarding an advance of $25 on the salary of Miss Newall. It will not be necessary to place her name on the pay list each month. This position has not been classified by the Civil Service Commission and she has therefore been appointed as assistant teacher to perform field matron's duties. As you have been informed Miss Newall's salary will be at the rate of $300 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law, and payment of same will be based on ten months' service during the year. She will be paid quarterly, the same as the regular teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, November 13th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has nominated Miss O. M. H. Newall as assistant teacher of the Little Pines Indian Day School to perform field matron's duties. Miss Newall began duties on October 15th, last. The salary allowed her is at the rate of $200 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Miss Maud Edwards who was appointed temporarily performed the duties as assistant teacher from August 22nd to October 15th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nare a number of the larger boys on the reserve who are anxious to attend school during the winter months but she has had to refuse them admission owing to the crowded condition of the classroom.\n\nIn my opinion, present conditions at this school would justify the enlargement of the classroom by about 15 ft. in length. The children's dining room is too small to accommodate the present pupilage; it is 16' x 16' in size. An addition of 15 ft. to this building would, in my opinion, meet the requirements.\n\nThe water supply at this school is not good. They are hauling the water from the Battle River. They had a well at the school at one time but this well is out of repair. I made inquiry regarding the quality and supply of water which this well produced when it was in operation but no one appeared to know anything about it, and under the circumstances it might not pay to have the old well cleaned out and deepened; it might be more satisfactory to have a new well dug.\n\n**STAFF**\n\nMiss Cunningham who holds a Junior Matriculation Certificate from Havergal College is the teacher in charge. She has had considerable experience in teaching and appears to me to be a very excellent teacher. She has a lot of good common sense and exerts a very beneficial influence over the people on the reserve who appear to have every confidence in her. The attitude of the Indians towards the school is an evidence of this. They are very proud of their school and are giving it their hearty support.\n\nMiss Cunningham is assisted in her work by Miss Edwards who acts as assistant teacher, and Miss Faithful who is a missionary worker. It is encouraging to find a Day School with such a good record of attendance, the average attendance for the quarter ending September 30th being 31 out of an enrollment of 32 pupils.\n\n(Sgd) W.

There were no children in attendance. I examined the school register and noted the condition of the buildings. The buildings are all badly in need of painting and interior decorating, and, acting on your instructions I arranged to have this work done and it should now be well under way. There are 32 pupils on the register, 19 boys and 13 girls. There is no difficulty experienced in getting a regular attendance at this school; all the children attend unless prevented by illness. The Indians on the adjoining reserve, Poundmakers, are anxious to send their children to this school but there is barely sufficient accommodation for the children belonging to Little Pines. The school building is 20 x 36, with 12' studs. The classroom is 18 x 28 and is too small to admit of taking any more than the present number on the roll. The teacher informed me that there\n\nW. M.

Macdonald Agent at Battleford this morning advising me that Miss C.M.H. Newell the new Matron for the Little Pines Reserve is in poor health and cannot do the work. The Agent states she is sick half the time and has been more of a care than help to Miss Cunningham the teacher. He suggests utilizing the services of Mrs. Brown, Field Matron at the Thunderchild, to cook the noon meal and do the housework until another Matron can be appointed for Little Pines.\n\nIn view of the circumstances I sanctioned the employment at Little Pines of Mrs. Brown temporarily.\n\nIn view of Miss Newell's ill health it would appear advisable to make another appointment at Little Pines and recommend this to the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I also note the suggestion that Mrs. Brown, Field Matron at Thunderchild, be employed temporarily to cook the noonday meal and do the housework at Little Pines until another matron can be appointed. I presume that her field matron's duties at the Thunderchild reserve would take most of her time and that she would only be able to perform this work for a short time temporarily. We could not pay her anything for her services at Little Pines.\n\nI am writing His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, advising him of the fact that Miss Newell is too ill to perform her duties, and asking him to nominate someone in her place.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Mrs. Brown however, should return to her own duties on the Thunderchild Reserve and I should be glad to know if any steps have been taken to make an immediate appointment at Little Pines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I have received a reply from him to the effect that they have received various applications for this position, and expect in a few days to forward a nomination.

Ahenakew, the driving clergyman in charge personally went down to Saskatoon until he had found the right person, and took her straight back with him to help with the pressure of work and sickness.\n\nOf course this should not have been done without the consent of the Department, but as I was away on the missions at the time, he did the best thing possible. I would therefore, ask that Miss Brown's appointment may date back to the first of January, otherwise Mr. Ahenakew must himself provide one month's stipend for her. I think he was justified in doing this, and therefore if the Department declines to date the appointment back, I must provide this month's stipend from our mission funds.\n\nWith kindest regards\n\nBelieve me to be yours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott\nSuperintendent General\nIndian Affairs\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 2nd, 1925.\n\nThe Rt.

She has had considerable training and much experience as a nurse but is not a certificated one. She had another position waiting for her but Mr. Ahenakew took her to Little Pines at once and communicated with the Indian Agent and myself.\n\nMiss Brown is said to be a very capable woman, with a nice personality, refined, and keen to take up the work and is apparently healthy and strong. She has had a good deal of training but did not complete her course for a certificate as qualified nurse.\n\nI beg to nominate her for this position, and ask that the appointment date back to January the first, 1925.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me to be Yours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott\nSuperintendent General\nIndian Affairs\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brown, Little Pine's Indian Day School.\n\nIn your letter of the 2nd ultimo, referring to the resignation of Miss Brown, Assistant Teacher and Matron, Little Pine's Indian Day School, you state that it will be necessary to obtain the services of a \"qualified teacher\" as her successor. I am writing to ask whether that is to be a new departure, as Miss Brown was not a qualified teacher. Her duties were chiefly that of Matron, but she assisted in the teaching of the little ones also. I am asking simply so that we may be quite sure in making a nomination to fulfil all the requirements and avoid delay.\n\nOur missionary at Little Pine's, the Rev. E. Ahenakew, writes to say that he thinks the letter of the Department requiring us to nominate a \"qualified teacher,\" may be inaccurate, and he would like to be quite clear on the point. He states qualifications and duties of the matron and Assistant Teacher as follows:\n\n1. Some knowledge of nursing and dispensing simple medicines.\n2. To prepare midday meal for children.\n3. To assist the teacher generally.\n4. To take a class of the smaller children for short periods during the day.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience regarding these matters, believe me\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCharles W. McKim\nChairman of the Bishop's Commission.\n\nC.W. McKim\nOttawa, July 7, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to the appointment of an assistant teacher and matron to succeed Miss M. Brown at the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in our letter to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan of the 2nd ultimo, we should have requested that the services of a suitable person be secured, instead of a \"qualified teacher.\" The person whom you nominate as successor to Miss M. Brown as assistant teacher and matron should possess some knowledge of nursing and dispensing of simple medicines. She should be able to assist the teacher generally and, if required, take a class of the smaller children for short periods during the day. She should also be responsible for the preparation of the midday meal for the children.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to secure the services of a suitable person for this position in time to begin duties when the school opens after the summer holidays. Please submit for the approval of the Department the name, experience, etc., of the person whom you may recommend for the appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

She is twenty-one years of age, has completed her first year in University, is healthy, missionary spirited, and has taken a course in first aid.\n\nThe Rev. E.

Miss Scholefield has first class standing as a teacher and has considerable knowledge of nursing. She is also well up in basketry. Miss Scholefield is well recommended by the Bishop of Edmonton, and I have interviewed her personally and believe her to be suitable.\n\nMiss Scholefield has been doing duty at Little Pine's school since the 17th of August and we would be grateful if your department could date her appointment from that time.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully\n\nCharles W.

The following is an extract from his report:\n\n\"Miss Scholefield has only recently arrived from England and is still in the trial stage. She is doing fairly well but needs more experience in this work.\n\n\"As Miss Annie Letitia Cunningham is a superior teacher in this type of work, I would recommend that she hold the place of principal and that Miss Scholefield be considered an assistant until such time as she has proven her ability to carry on. Miss Cunningham has had charge of the pupils for several years with great success.\n\n..................\n\n\"As you will understand from previous remarks, Miss Scholefield is in charge of the older children. She has had very little experience in this class of work up to the present, but seems capable of making good under instruction. Miss Cunningham is a splendid teacher and could be very useful in giving advice and illustrating the handling of classes. She is in charge of the beginners (Grade I Jr.) and looks after the general house work. If she were given to understand that she was the principal and Miss Scholefield were requested to ask her advice, I believe matters could be happily arranged. The long experience of Miss Cunningham counts for a great deal. As matters stand, one is loath to give advice and the other to ask it. If the relationship, for the time at least, were principal and assistant, Miss Scholefield might develop into a very successful instructor.\"\n\nThe Department believes that the Inspector's suggestion is a valuable one and I should be grateful if you would arrange to have instructions issued to the teachers in accordance with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is noted that Miss Scholefield's resignation took effect on the 7th instant. If there is any balance of salary due her for the few days she taught during the present month, I have to request that you will state the exact number of days taught, and if any amount is due therefor, a cheque will be sent in favour of Mr. Ahenakew.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Cunningham in charge and assisted by Miss I.M. Feilhfull, who has been there now for over a year. They are both first class teachers of Indian Schools and handle all the duties together and are both very capable as field matrons.\n\nThe attendance at this school is not as big as it was, some have gone to Boarding school to finish and others have finished and left, but it is expected that enough new pupils will enroll this spring to bring the attendance up again.\n\nA school driver is also employed and makes about a seven mile circuit twice a day delivering the children to and from school, he is an Indian of the reserve and is willing and prompt at his duties.\n\nWith the exception of a little interior decorating the buildings are in first class shape.\n\nThe progress at this school is exceptional and teaching of the children and the efforts of the staff is more than visible in the homes of the reserve particularly in the homes of the children who are attending and taking a pride in their habits and appearance.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith the annual school report for the battleford Agency, for the year ending March 31st, 1928.\n\nThere are four schools operating in this agency, the Thunderchild Residential school and Day schools at Red Pheasant, Little Pines and Thunderchild reserves, with an attendance of approximately 190 children.\n\nS.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have Department letter #105-2-5, April 10th with letters attached from the Teacher at Little Pine Day School.\n\nAt the present time Miss Cunningham is paid as teacher in charge and Miss Faithfull as assistant and between them they handle all the teaching and Field Matron work, for the last year Miss Faithfull has done most of the Teaching, as the classes now overcrowd the school, Miss Cunningham takes the Junior and Baby classes in the Dining room as well as looking after the Matrons work, they divid or take any of the duties and pool or divid the salary at the end of the quarter.\n\nThere is perfect harmony between them and they are without a doubt the most capable staff I have ever seen at an Indian Day school, the attendance, average and general results will speak for their ability and their whole time and thought is for their work and the school and they are certainly deserving of a substantial increase and should both be rated as teachers which they rightly are;\n\nWith regard to the School driver I have allowed her to retain him probiding he does not neglect his Farm work.\n\nThe school building is too small for the present attendance but they can get along for this year but if it keeps up should be enlarged next year.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I have to say it is noted that both these ladies are performing satisfactory service.\n\nRegarding your request that they be granted an increase in salary, I have to say that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, the Department will, in view of the salary at present allowed Miss Faithfull, grant her an increase from the last instant at the rate of $15 per teaching month.

W. T. Hallam, M.A., D.D., Bishop of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, if he desires to nominate a teacher to succeed Miss Jones. In the event of his nominating a teacher, her name, age and qualifications should be forwarded for our consideration.\n\nIf he does not wish to nominate a teacher, you should so advise the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, January 3, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatoon has nominated the services of Miss Margaret Armitage, B.A., for the position as assistant teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School. The Department is approving of her appointment as from the first instant, with salary at the rate of $60 per teaching month\u2014which is the same as allowed Miss Jones, the previous teacher. Miss Armitage has a first class permanent certificate and has had three years' experience. I would request that you give her any assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. A. R. BROWN, PROVINCIAL SCHOOL INSPECTOR, DATED NOVEMBER 27, 1935, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE LITTLE PINES INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on No. 105-2-6.\n\nANNIE LETITIA CUNNINGHAM - Salary $900\nMARGARET M.R. ARMITAGE - $600.\n\nMiss Armitage is doing very well. Miss Cunningham is satisfactory as matron and as contact between the school and the parents. Her experience stands her in good stead.\n\nMiss Cunningham has engaged Miss Cordelia Winnifred Elizabeth Stewart, B.A., Int. 1st Class (Sask.) to act as her substitute in actual classroom instruction in Grades I - III. Miss Stewart is doing excellent work. I consider this a satisfactory arrangement.\n\nI understand that Miss Stewart has been engaged by Miss Cunningham to substitute for her in actual class teaching without consultation with the Department. With regard to the latter point, I have no interest, but I beg to repeat that the present arrangement has greatly improved instruction without increase in cost to the Department. Miss Cunningham, on account of her long experience, is valuable as a general matron and as the contact between the parents and the school. She is also able to give valuable advice to the other teacher. Miss Stewart is doing excellent work. In my opinion much better work than Miss Cunningham could do - in the junior room. I would recommend that this arrangement be given formal approval for, say, a year. The situation could be reviewed on my next inspection. I understand that Miss Cunningham pays Miss Stewart $35 per month out of her own salary.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. INSPECTOR MURISON, DATED JANUARY 7, 1936, WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE ABOVE REPORT.\n\nMiss Cunningham is not only a good teacher but an excellent manager and one who has made her personality very effective in the living conditions and behaviour of the Indians on this Reserve. Through her efforts this school has been raised from a very low standard to one of the best Indian day schools in the Province. I note the Inspector's remarks that Miss Cunningham has engaged the services of a teacher at $35.00 per month which she is paying out of her own salary. This is the first intimation I have had regarding this matter. It appears to me, however, that possibly Miss Cunningham feels that she can give better service to the pupils in this way and, as the services of Miss Stewart are not adding to the cost of the maintenance of the school by the Department, I do not see anything to complain of in her action.\nEX'D.\n\nBattleford, Sask.,\nOctober 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my monthly report for the Battleford Agency for the month ending Sept. 30th, 1936.\n\nNo. 7 General:\n\nThe schools are all going with a fair attendance, and the health of the children generally has been good to date. The attendance is very good as usual at the Little Pine Day School, and is holding up well at the Red Pheasant Day School, and will improve there as soon as the hay camps are broken up, and the Indians come back to their regular homes. I can also report an improvement in the attendance at the Thunderchild Day School, and it is hoped there will still be a few more when the Indians settle down for the winter.\n\nAll the schools in the agency were visited during the month with the exception of Beauval, and it is my intention to visit that school shortly, and will report conditions there in my next report.\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nLittle Pine Res.,\nPeyton, Sask.\nJune 28, 1937.\n\nD. L. Macdonald Esq.,\nIndian Office,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is with regret that I now send my resignation to you, as it is necessary for me to teach in a \"White School\" before taking up Educational work in the Foreign Mission field.\n\nI have been offered a position on the Public School Board in Saskatoon at a salary of about $1,100 a year.\n\nI can only say that my pleasant associations at Little Pine will be with me always.\n\nYours truly,\n\nElizabeth Stewart\nBattleford, Sask.,\nJuly 24th, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward attached letter from Miss A. L. Cunningham, for the Department's advice and would certainly recommend, that her requests be considered as this school is and always has been outstanding in Day schools and she has for the last several years paid a Junior teacher from her own salary and Miss Stewart just resigned and was one of the best teachers we ever had and the regular Assistant, Miss Armitage is also outstanding, in fact they were a combination that were hard to beat.\n\nS. L. Macdonald.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 4th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication received from Miss A. L. Cunningham, teacher of the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nAs Miss Stewart was not engaged by this Department but was personally hired by Miss Cunningham, no action by the Department is required in connection with her decision to give up duties.\n\nPlease inform Miss Cunningham that the Department is opposed to the policy of teachers employing assistants in connection with the school work. Such procedure is liable to lead to considerable difficulty. Consequently, it is expected that Miss Cunningham will not take such action in future.\n\nNo provision was made in the current year's appropriation for a larger salary for Miss Ammitage and, therefore, I regret that the increase requested cannot be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nThe schools all reopened again at the first of the month, with good attendances that are well over last year's attendance and they have all been visited and everything in this respect is going in good order.\n\nThe same teachers are at Little Pine and Thunderchild Day schools, but a new teacher, Mr. Morgan has taken over the Red Pheasant school and already a big improvement is noticeable in every respect, it is his first experience at an Indian school and I believe this will be to the benefit of both the school and the Indians.\n\nS.L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nTHE BISHOP'S ROOM\n59 YORK BUILDING\nSASKATOON\nJuly 15, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThank you for your letter of July 12th. I am on the look-out for a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Armitage at Little Pine. I visited the Reserve last Monday and also had conversation with the Indian Agent at North Battleford the same day. I am definitely under the impression that the stipend was $60.00 a month or $720.00 a year. I wish you would let me know regarding this because I wish to attract as well qualified a teacher as I can. Your records will show you that Miss Margaret Armitage was a graduate in Arts of the University and also in Education. I understand that you desire not only ability to teach the ordinary subjects in the course but also the ability to give guidance in academic and domestic work if possible.\n\nWill you let me hear from you in the matter at your convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBp/MF\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 20, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 15th instant, in connection with the salary paid to the junior teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nFor some years past, the Department has been allowing an amount of $900.00 a year for the senior teacher and $600.00 a year for the junior teacher. The salary of both teachers is paid in the same manner as the salary of the teachers at the other Indian day schools, viz.: on the basis of ten months in the academic year.\n\nOur report for the last fiscal year shows an enrolment of 38 and an average attendance of 25 at this school. This is not a large attendance for two teachers and it is, therefore, felt that it should be possible to secure a new assistant teacher for the amount previously allowed, viz.: $600 a year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. W. T. Hallam, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatoon,\n59 York Building,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith, my monthly report for the Battleford agency, for the month ending June 30th 1938\n\nThe Inspector made us a short visit at the end of the month and attended the closing of the Little Pine School. Miss Armitage, Assistant Teacher at this school has tendered her resignation which is to be regretted as she was a good teacher.\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nCOPY\n\nFrom Rev. Geo. H. Eccleston, Glen Ewen.\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nThis is to certify that I have known Kathleen Good for over two years, during which time I have found her to be a very exemplary person along the lines of social, community and religious services, not to speak of her vocation as a Public School teacher, in which I have every reason to believe that she has been successful.\n\nShe is a member of our choir, teaches in the Sunday School, where she also plays the organ, has been President of our Young Peoples' Association for several terms.\n\nIn a word, I have no hesitation in saying that Miss Good will prove her usefulness in whatever position of trust she might be called upon to act.\n\n(signed) GEO. H. ECCLESTON.\nTo Whom it May Concern:\n\nMiss L. Kathleen Good has taught in our school in a very efficient manner for the past two years. She was well thought of by her pupils who were all sorry to see her leave. Her Inspector's reports have been very good, receiving highest marks of any school in the Inspectorate. Miss Good leaves of her own free will.\n\nThe Board has no hesitation in recommending her to other Boards.\n\n(signed) MRS. MARY PORTER,\nSec.-Treas. Orangedale S.D.#115\nGlen Ewen.\nREPORT of W. J. Stevenson, Inspector of Schools,\nApril, 1938.\n\nThe general standing of your pupils in their individual activities in the subjects tested is 80%, which continues to be especially good and is among the highest in the Inspectorate. The creative and social activities of the curriculum have continued to receive especially good attention and an attractive display of the pupils' projects is shown.\n\nMiss Good continues to give especially good service to your district. Good discipline and cordial relations between teacher and pupils are evident.\nTHE BISHOP'S ROOM\n59 YORK BUILDING\nSASKATOON\nAugust 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your request for a nomination for an assistant teacher for Little Pine Indian Day School, I beg to submit the name of Miss Kathleen Good of Glen Ewen, Sask. Miss Good is a young woman of twenty-four years of age with her first-class permanent teacher's certificate, with additional pedagogical subjects which she has taken at the University of Saskatchewan Summer School. She has four year's teaching experience in two school districts in the south of the Province, where she has taught all grades from 1 to XI. Enclosed herewith are the copies of her inspector's reports. She has capability in manual training having been accustomed to handling carpenter's tools, and she has the usual qualifications in knitting, sewing, etc. She has musical ability and her recommendations show her to have been actively interested in the general life of the community where she has been, so I count on her taking some interest in the life of the Reserve as well as the School.

(RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBattleford, Sask., Nov. 14th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my monthly report for the Battleford agency for the month ending October 31st, 1936.\n\nNo. 7 schools\n\nThe schools are all running in good order and the day schools at Red Pheasant and Little Pine are making a very good showing and Mr. Morgan, teacher, at the latter is doing wonderful work and now has the school where it is overcrowded. Miss Cunningham at Little Pine has her school right up to standard as usual, but the day school at Thunderchild is lagging; the teacher has every qualification, but is not up to the mark and a change should be made there at the end of this year and a married couple taken on so that some welfare work can be started.\n\nS.L. MacDonald,\nIndian Agent.\nLittle Pine Reserve,\nPaynton, Sask.,\n18th February 1939\n\nTo\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your very encouraging letter of 7th February. The great interest shown by the Indian Department during the last two or three years makes one wish that we were beginning instead of nearing the end of our work here. We really have our work planned out until 1940, as that would give time to leave the Handicrafts fairly well established. Work amongst adult Indians is a long slow process.\n\nThough we always had a certain amount of satisfaction in our small corner, the reserve as a whole was so backward and official opinion so unfavourable at first, that things seemed almost hopeless to those who were bent on improvement. It gives one real hope for the future to know that the Indian Department now expects the workers on the reserves to achieve something. It used to be so easy to blame the poor wretched Indian for all failures.\n\nYou will be interested to know that this month we received our first order from England - for nine dozen bead mats. If we can continually raise the standard of work and secure another order next year, this opening might develop into a permanent market. We are quite pleased with the beadwork that is coming in now.\n\nThe history of this industry is quite interesting. Beginning with one or two, now all but the very old women\nare working, and our ex-pupils especially are learning very quickly. Two years ago the \"Arts and Crafts Society\" of Saskatoon gave us a start by supplying beads and buying most of the mats made, but as they can take only a limited number, we are continually on the lookout for other markets.\n\nThe women and also the men take real pride in this work. This is a step towards the community spirit, the lack of which retards progress. There is a full-time job for someone, for years to come, if the lack of co-operation is to be replaced by a wider outlook and unselfish work for the reserve and race. No doubt as the Indians get beyond the stage of semi-starvation and discover how to make a decent living, this wider outlook will come.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. L. Cunningham.\nOttawa, February 24, 1939.\n\nDear Miss Cunningham:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly interested in the attempts you have made to promote a handicraft project on your reserve and delighted, of course, to learn that you have received an order from England. We have at this date an official in the Department charged with the responsibility of promoting Indian handicraft projects on reserves. This official is also responsible for the sale of handicraft products. A few weeks ago we engaged the services of a commercial traveller who will devote practically all his time to selling Indian products. These products consist in the main of baskets, hand loom woven scarfs and ties, crochet work, porcupine quill work and leather goods, such as cushion covers, etc.\n\nI have this morning discussed with the officials the desirability of securing samples of the work accomplished by your Indians, in the hope that we might be able to promote the sale of their work in the East. If the suggestion appeals to you, therefore, you might send forward samples of the bead mats, moccasins or any other handicraft goods you may have on hand. It is not our intention that you should send large quantities but rather a few samples of the best work -\n\nMiss A. L. Cunningham,\nTeacher,\nLittle Pine Indian Day School,\nPaynton, Saskatchewan.\nwork produced by your Indians.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that I was delighted to learn that you had your work planned out until 1940 and that the Department and the Indians would have the benefit of your services until that date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 24, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received by me from Miss A. L. Cunningham, teacher at the Little Pine Indian Day School, Battleford agency, Saskatchewan.\n\nMiss Cunningham has spent 20 years in the teaching profession and has been employed at the Little Pine School for the last 16 years. A few years ago this teacher, at her own expense, employed the services of an additional teacher to take her place in the classroom in order that she could devote her entire time to the promotion of handicraft projects and to the general betterment of the Indians on the reserve. A few weeks ago she intimated to Dr. Robertson that she was leaving at the end of the present school year, but Dr. Robertson and I persuaded her to remain until the end of the academic year 1940. The additional teacher is still employed at this school, without cost to the Department. The devotion and self-sacrifice of Miss Cunningham has been so unusual that it occurred to me the Deputy Minister or the Minister might desire to drop her a line, thanking her for the contribution she has made to the welfare of the Indians on this particular reserve.\n\nI have this morning discussed with Miss Moodie ways and means whereby we might dispose of the handicraft products produced under Miss Cunningham's direction in eastern Canada. I have already written asking her to forward samples.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nC. W.

Hoey Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are glad to comply with your suggestion that we should send samples of our handicraft work. Enclosed is a list of a few articles which will go out with this mail, under separate cover. We have kept the prices as low as possible, but it is necessary to allow for the mail charges on beads and work and these are heavy.\n\nAt first the beadwork was rough and crude, but during the past winter we have spent much time on training the workers, and can notice improvement. The spinning was started last year and the weaving just recently. We are using nearly all the woollen goods produced locally, but hope after the summer exhibition, to have more for sale.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.L.C.\nA.L.

If you can make immediate delivery, please send us two dozen of the beaded purses 6\" x 5\", finished. I would suggest that the name of the maker be printed inside so that it will be seen when the zipper is opened. It has been suggested that there would also be good sale for bags made by sewing two large mats of the same pattern together using a zipper the same length as that used in the flat purse. These round bags or purses should have a handle of skin about 2\" wide, preferably with a line or two of beading.

We were glad that the work met with your approval, for the women have made great efforts to improve.\n\nOur stock of beads was low, so we sent off immediately for more, with a request that the order should be sent by return, for the Hudson's Bay Co. usually takes some time to collect the various colours. It takes time for the women to turn out good work but we have several suitable mats on hand and these can be made up, so we can promise one and a half dozen purses, and possibly a few more may be ready.

At such short notice we could not complete the number of purses asked for, especially as we had to send to Winnipeg for beads. We are therefore sending only five of the two dozen purses you ordered and as three of these are first attempts, they are not as nice as the next ones will be.\n\nThe sixteen bags were made from beaded mats as you suggested, but as zippers add to the cost and we had to hurry the work, we used dome fasteners and hope that for evening bags they will be sufficient. The beaded handles are stronger than they look and are daintier. We have had two or three orders for these bags here, and the buyers wished for a different design on each side, so we are sending samples of these. We hope that these bags and purses will be satisfactory and we would welcome any further criticism or ideas as to beadwork.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.L.

The beautiful shades are superior to those supplied by the Hudson's Bay Company. The \"Arts and Crafts\" in Saskatoon and Edmonton object to the large beads so we have been using seed beads only. However we think that these you have sent would do nicely for a cushion cover which has been ordered for England. We should have to secure a few more colours and are writing direct to Montreal to find out if 20c. and 25c. is their regular price for a large bunch. From the Hudson's Bay Company we get beads at this price, but only if we order five dollars' worth, through the Indian Office at Regina. If we find that work done with the large beads is saleable, we would order more from Montreal - given the low price.\n\nWill you please deduct the cost of the package of beads you sent us, from the value of our goods which we hope, reached you before 15th.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\nA.L.

Good who has recently retired as teacher of the senior room in above Day School. Archdeacon Alderwood of Saskatoon and myself have today interviewed Miss Frances B. Little of Asquith, Saskatchewan, and beg to forward her name to you as our nomination for above mentioned teachership.\n\nMiss Little has had nine years' experience in rural and graded schools and holds a First-class permanent certificate. She has specialized in primary methods and physical education at the University of Saskatchewan and has also taken special training in First Aid, Physical Training and Art and intermediate work at the University of Alberta. She has musical ability, can play the piano and teach musical theory. She is twenty-seven years of age. I enclose herewith copies of recent Inspectors' reports. We believe that Miss Little will be suitable in every way to undertake the work required and therefore hope that you will see your way to confirming this nomination. As the time is getting near when the school should be re-opened we shall be grateful if you will kindly reply by Air-Mail to me at the Synod Office, Prince Albert, and I can telephone Miss Little.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArchdeacon.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAgain on this occasion I found this school to be doing work of good quality. There has been ample attention to drills so that in subjects such as arithmetic, computation, spelling, writing, oral reading, these pupils are well advanced. Information subjects were being reviewed on this afternoon and the tests given plainly revealed familiarity with facts and ability to reason with these facts. Even the appreciation subjects touched on, gave evidence of development of this throughout the year just coming to an end. This group of students is studious and interested and opportunities are given for expression which has developed in your school an excellent response. I noted further that these pupils are enjoying the experiences of school life, that they are developing those most desirable qualities which we associate with good citizenship. In all the situation in your school for the past few years has been very splendid and Miss Little has laid excellent foundations upon which others will build later on\".\n\nMr. W. A. Ross Kindersley,\nLaPort Sask.\nNovember 1936.\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nWe the undersigned Trustees of the Bailey S.D. 3014 have pleasure in recommending Miss F. B. Little as a capable and conscientious teacher. Miss Little taught in the Bailey School from 1930 to 1936 continuously, during which time she gained the approbation of the ratepayers and the affection of her pupils. The reports of the Inspector of Schools bear ample testimony to her ability and continued progress in her efforts to advance the education of the pupils in her charge, both in the elementary and higher grades.\n\nMrs. Gladys McLay\nMr. Roy Adams,\nM. E. Hayes, Chairman.\nHillside School, September 1936. Intermediate grades.\n\nThe work was taken in reading, mathematics, literature, language, history, geography, health education and music.\n\nMiss Little had the work very well planned for the day. Lessons were interestingly presented, main points being emphasised. The children were quite attentive and responded well throughout the day. The students were making very good progress in lessons taken. Miss Little is conscientious in her work. Supervision of class room work was well done. Miss Little taught some very fine lessons. She has plenty of energy and should give good service.\n\nMr. Wm. Sexsmith,\nRosetown.\n\nMayfield S.D.\nApril 16, 1938 - Junior Grades.\n\nMiss Little's room as observed today was one of the most attractive in appearance that I have ever seen. There was also good evidence of project work. Pupils co-operated well with the teacher and with each other. In reading and number work, as well as in other respects the majority of pupils have been making satisfactory progress. There was evidence of adequate preparation on the part of Miss Little. She works well in the class room, and I have little fault to find with her methods.\n\nI am of the opinion that the pupils will do well under her direction.\n\nShe is capable and conscientious.\n\nMr. H.

As you are aware the junior teacher at this school has previously been allowed a salary of $700.00.\n\nOn reviewing the whole matter it has been decided to allow Miss Little salary at the rate of $750.00 a year from September 1, 1939.\n\nI regret that there was a mistake in my previous communication.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Paul, B.A., LL.B.,\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter, file 105-2-1, of the 29th ultimo, re salary allowed Miss Frances B. Little, at Little Pine Indian Day School. I note that the $900 previously mentioned was an error, and that $750 will be the amount allowed her.\n\nBishop Hallam usually nominates teachers for this school himself, and it was owing to his absence that he asked me to do so. Therefore I did not know what the usual salary was, and was somewhat surprised to read of the $900 salary.\n\nI appreciate the Department adding the $50, and hope that Miss Little will not be too disappointed. I have written to her about it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\nLittle Pine Reserve,\nPaynton, Sask.,\n19th December, 1939.\n\nJ.P.B.Ostrander Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Miss Little, who came in September, to take charge of the senior room, expects to be married next Saturday, 23rd December. I do not know if it will be in order for her to finish out the year here. If not, I would suggest that Mrs. Warden, who is an experienced High School teacher and now teaching these Public School grades in her own home, would be the best to fill the gap for the remainder of the year. January is a difficult month in which to make a change, for one used to a steam-heated house, feels the intense cold, and nearly two months of this school year has already been wasted, with a teacher totally inexperienced in Indian work, and probably unfitted for it. Mrs. Warden has all the necessary qualifications for the school work, and having already gained considerable influence over the Indian women, the personal touch with the children would be a great asset in her future social service work here. If a teacher is able to teach only the school curriculum, the Indian child is better left uneducated, for character building is the essential thing.\n\nIf the Indian Department refuses to appoint Mrs. Warden, rather than hazard the loss of more time in the class-room, we would suggest carrying on ourselves, as we did before, with excellent results. We do not wish to do this for there are so many important duties on the reserve. The bead-work is developing into quite an industry and we are receiving more orders than we can fill. Then the women are learning to card wool for the surrounding farmers and the machines have been busy all fall. All this with many other duties needs constant supervision and advice. The adult India learns slowly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) A.L.Cunningham.\nSome comment is desirable in connection with the suggestion in Miss Cunningham's letter that they could carry on for the remainder of the term without a teacher, replacing Miss Little, if the Department so desire. The only alternative Miss Cunningham would have in that case would be Miss Faithful, who is engaged by Miss Cunningham, and who does not exist, officially, so far as the Department is concerned. Miss Cunningham's suggestion might lead the Department to believe that one appointee could do the work of this school. Such would be impossible, unless we are prepared to drop a considerable amount of the useful work which is being done. I do think, however, that when Miss Cunningham retires, the appointment at this school should be a man and wife, similar to the arrangement recently made at the Thunderchild's Bay School, but this is for future consideration.\n\nWith regard to appointing Mrs. Warden, temporarily to complete the term, I have only to say that I believe Mrs. Warden, wife of the Farming Instructor at the Little Pine and Poundmaker's Reserves, would be an excellent teacher, and she is, even now, helping some with the Little Pine School work, without remuneration. Mrs. Warden is just as strong-minded as Miss Cunningham, and would not likely be willing to stand aside in everything, any more than Miss Little has been, consequently there would soon be a clash, if she were appointed. I am also very doubtful of the Department considering appointing her, unless the need for a change was very urgent, and no one suitable could be found.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nBattleford Agency\n\nBattleford, Sask.,\n21st December, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, a copy of a letter received from Miss A.L. Cunningham, of the Little Pine Day School, in connection with the marriage of Miss Frances B. Little, who was appointed teacher at that school for the current school year, on authority of Departmental letter 106-2-1, dated 22nd August, 1939.\n\nI do not know how the Department will view the matter of this lady's marriage, or whether they will consider that, in the best interests of the school, she should be asked for her resignation, consequently I am referring the case to you for your consideration and your recommendation. She told me, yesterday, in conversation, that her prospective husband is a teacher at some white school in Saskatchewan, and that he will continue with his present appointment, after their marriage. She would like to continue at the Little Pine school, at least for the remainder of this term and that, as far as she is concerned, her marriage will make no difference in the present arrangement. If there is to be any change, it will be for the Department to decide.\n\nI do not wish to offer any criticism of the work of Miss Cunningham at this school, nor of her attitude in the case under consideration, but it is only fair to Miss Little that I should point out that her work in the class-room has been very satisfactory. She has not shown anything particular in connection with the other work being done at this school, and when I spoke to her of this, yesterday, she informed me that she is very interested in the other work, but that Miss Cunningham does not permit her to take part in it as she would like to, consequently, to avoid any possibility of friction, she has not taken any active part. Knowing Miss Cunningham, I feel sure this statement is true.\n\nI firmly believe that both these ladies are trying to do their best, in the interests of the Indian children, but it is evident that their viewpoints clash in some matters in connection with the work. I pointed out to Miss Little that Miss Cunningham has been doing, and is still doing, good work at this school and that she is, to some extent in charge. Miss Little says she understands this, and has been overlooking some things which were unpleasant for her, on this account, and that she will continue to do so, if the Department decides to let her complete her term, notwithstanding her marriage.\n\nAs Miss Cunningham will not be in the work much longer, and Miss Little wants to remain in the work, for some years, if acceptable to the Department, and I believe will be useful in the work, I would not recommend asking her resignation. I make this statement because I do not think that any teacher would be completely acceptable to Miss Cunningham unless she was prepared to stand aside and be completely overshadowed by Miss Cunningham, and I do not think this is the type of people we want in our service.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6287, file 612-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Little Pine Day School, Battleford.\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter from Miss Cunningham, teacher at the above school, advising that Miss Little, in charge of the senior room, expects to be married on December 23rd, together with copy of a letter from Mr. Ostrander on the matter.\n\nYou will note that Miss Cunningham states that two months of the present year has already been wasted with a teacher totally inexperienced in Indian work, and suggests that Mrs. Warden, wife of our Farming Instructor, be engaged to finish out the term. You will also note in Mr. Ostrander's comments that he points out that Miss Little's work in the classroom has been very satisfactory; that she has not shown anything in particular with regard to the other work being done in the school, and when he spoke to her in this regard she informed him that she was very interested in the other work, but that Miss Cunningham does not permit her to take part in it as she would like to, and to avoid friction, she has not taken any active part. He also considers that if Mrs. Warden were appointed there would soon be a clash.\n\nYou will also note Miss Cunningham's remark, \"If a teacher is able to teach only the school curriculum, the Indian children are better left uneducated, for character building is the essential thing\", and I must say I am in whole-hearted accord with her on this matter. Miss Cunningham has been an outstanding teacher and leader. One has only to visit her reserve and meet the Indians to realize the actual work she has done. As Mr. Ostrander states, Miss Cunningham is a very strong-minded woman. She could not have made the success she has had\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nshe been otherwise. At the same time, I have found Miss Cunningham very amenable to suggestions, always ready to adopt any policy which she believes is for the welfare of the Indians. For instance, when I first came on here, I found that she was devoting practically all her time to working through the men for improvement of conditions. I suggested to her the idea of devoting more time to the women. She was very doubtful at that time, but quite willing to try it out, and she has on a number of occasions since expressed regret that she did not take up women's work earlier. She is now devoting considerable time to it, with splendid success.\n\nMrs. Warden is also strong-minded. She holds a first-class teacher's certificate, in fact is a B.A. She has been doing excellent work among the women of the reserves and has been assisting Miss Cunningham in the work at the school. I do not believe there would be any clash between Miss Cunningham and Mrs. Warden, as both Mr. and Mrs. Warden have worked with Miss Cunningham since coming to the reserve. They understand each other well and I feel they would both take particular pains to see that no friction developed.\n\nIt is very apparent from Miss Cunningham's letter that she does not feel that Miss Little is of very much assistance to her. I therefore feel that if it were possible to allow Mrs. Warden to carry on for the balance of the term, it would be advisable to let Miss Little go. If this is not possible, however, I feel it would be better to allow Miss Little to carry on her duties, as otherwise we would be faced with the problem of securing another teacher who would probably have less experience than Miss Little. With regard to Miss Cunningham's suggestion that she and Miss Faithfull could carry on, I consider this would be a great mistake, as it would prevent Miss Cunningham from carrying on the work she is doing, which, in my opinion, is of the first importance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nTR/FMc\nOttawa, December 28, 1939.\n\nRe: Little Pine Indian Day School,\nBattleford Agency, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd instant and also certain correspondence relating to the employment or re-employment of a teacher at the above noted school, attached thereto.\n\nI am particularly anxious that we should not get our wires crossed with respect to educational and welfare effort on this particular reserve. I am naturally anxious, also, that in the employment of teachers we should adhere as strictly as circumstances will permit to the departmental regulations now in force.\n\nI have pointed out on a number of occasions to our inspectors and Indian agents that we are not permitted, under existing regulations, to employ married women as teachers, other than women whose husbands are physically incapacitated and unable to support them. This regulation has been strictly observed throughout the government service but seems to be somewhat difficult to apply in the employment of Indian day school teachers. The regulation was passed by the Government in the interests of those who were in receipt of unemployment relief and naturally anxious to become self-supporting. A great deal of the trouble that occurred at Montreal Lake was due to our inability to pay Mrs. Stenhouse for the social service work she undertook and accomplished on that reserve. You may be interested to learn that the claims of this woman for remuneration have been carefully reviewed by the Director of this Branch, the Superintendent of Medical Services and the Treasury officials during the last week, but, under the regulations now in force, no remuneration could be allowed her. In order to employ Mrs. Warden at the Little Pine Day School, the officials of the Training Division would be called upon to declare that her husband is permanently disabled and no longer capable of supporting her. We have no evidence before us that such is the case.\n\nThe conditions at the Little Pine School are, as you know, somewhat unusual. At that school we have a pupil enrolment of 23 and an average attendance substantially lower than that figure. We have three teachers employed to provide instruction for these pupils - two of whom are paid by the Department. In view of the fact that Miss Cunningham is likely to resign at the end of the present academic year,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nthe conditions at this particular school should be carefully reviewed and discussed fully and in detail with the church authorities. My own opinion is that a first class teacher should be employed to give instruction to the 29 pupils. I mean by instruction the usual academic course plus vocational instruction for boys and elementary domestic science - sewing, crochet work, weaving, etc., for girls.\n\nIf, in addition to this teacher, it is felt that a social service worker should be employed, application should be made for such an appointment. If, however, there is a farming instructor employed on the reserve, it would be exceedingly difficult to persuade those responsible for such appointments that a social service worker is really needed. The point I am anxious to emphasize is that such work should not be, and must not be, charged to our educational appropriation. Such charges cannot be recognized by the Treasury officials as legitimate charges on the educational appropriation, and I am afraid that someone either in this office or on the field is likely to get into trouble when the full facts of the case become disclosed. We are reminded here almost constantly by Treasury officials that each appropriation appearing in the estimates must be spent, and spent only, for the purpose for which it is voted by Parliament. If a social service worker were employed at the Little Pine reserve, I am disposed to think that such a worker would come under the direction of the General Superintendent of Agencies. We have no such workers that I am aware of at any reserve throughout the Dominion.\n\nIn respect to the immediate problem confronting us, may I point out again that it would help us here if our agents did not recommend the employment of married women. The agents should know by this time that in asking us to employ such women they are asking us to ignore existing regulations. I have discussed with the officials here very fully the case of Miss Little, who has been until now in charge of the senior room at the Little Pine school, and who was, as I understand it, married on December 23. If we were adhering strictly to the regulations, this woman should be immediately dismissed. In view of all the circumstances, however, I am inclined to think that she should be permitted to continue with her teaching duties until the end of the academic year, on the distinct understanding that she cannot under any circumstances be re-employed after that date.\n\nI am fully aware of the splendid program undertaken and carried forward by Miss Cunningham on the Little Pine reserve. Work such as this should be, in my judgment, encouraged and extended. It is welfare work in the truest and best sense and is indispensable if our Indians are to become self-reliant and self-supporting. Under existing regulations, however, it cannot be linked up directly with educational effort and unless our officials in the field can persuade the Government or the Civil Service Commission or the Treasury officials, or all three, that the regulations should be changed, we should in all fairness keep these two services on our reserves separate and apart.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAugust 10, 1940.\n\nChief, Training Dept.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Little Pine Reserve. Miss A.L. Cunningham has concluded her services at Little Pine Reserve School, and has left the Reserve. I do not know whether she has sent in a formal resignation to your Dept. or not, but I find from a letter to her from Mr.R.A. Hoey, the Superintendent, dated Feb. 24, 1939, acknowledging her decision to stay on until June 1940 at his request.\n\nThe one I desire to nominate in her place is Clarence W. Foan. He is a married man, age 32, Anglican, English descent, permanent first class teacher's certificate, seven years teaching experience, one year of University training at University of Saskatchewan, good moral character, good health. He has brought good references particularly from his last three years where he has been assistant principal in the Kelliker High School.\n\nHe recently married Miss Little who taught at Little Pine School until June, 1940. I am sure that they together will be of great help in the work of the school and the reserve. Mr. Ostrander has had an interview with Mr. Foan, and he tells me that he can confidently add his recommendation to mine.\n\nI hope that official notification will be sent to Mr. Ostrander, your agent at Battleford, and Mr. Foan, so that Mr. Foan may be able to make out the requisitions for the coming term. He tells me that supplies are low.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.T. Saskatoon\n\nBp/MMA\nOttawa,\nAugust 20, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant advising me that Miss A.

He will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a month. As you are aware all Indian day schools in Canada will only be in operation for a nine-month period during the coming academic year and consequently the Little Pines School should be reopened on October 1, 1940, and continue to June 30, 1941.\n\nI note that the assistant teacher, Miss Little, was recently married and according to present regulations is not eligible for employment during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nThe aggregate attendance at this school does not exceed 30 and the average attendance is much less; consequently, one teacher should be sufficient. Mr. Ostrander is being advised that we have approved Mr. Foan's appointment and that only one teacher will be at this school during the coming academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. W. T.

Hallam, D.D., Bishop of Saskatoon, that Miss Cunningham gave up duties at the Little Pines Indian Day School on June 30, 1940.\n\nThe Bishop nominates Mr. Clarence W. Foan as teacher of this school for the coming academic year. He holds a first-class teacher's certificate and has had 7 years' teaching experience. We are advising the Bishop that his appointment is approved. As all Indian schools in Canada will only be in operation for a nine-month term during the academic year 1940-41 this school should re-open on October 1, 1940, and continue in operation to June 30, 1941.\n\nAs the aggregate attendance at this school is about 30 and the average attendance less than this number it is considered that one teacher should be sufficient and we are so advising Bishop Hallam.\n\nI might add that Miss Little, who was teaching the school as Miss Cunningham's assistant, has recently married Mr. Foan. In view of present regulations she would not be eligible for appointment as teacher for the coming academic year.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have Mr. Foan complete and return to the Department as soon as he begins duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J.P.B.

He did so while I was there and I hope this kalsomine and paint will be allowed.\n\nWhen I last visited the school at Little Pine one and one half years ago, I was not greatly impressed with Mr. Foan. However, he and his wife impressed me much better on this trip and I believe they are capable of doing good work. Mrs. Foan especially impressed me as being a very capable young woman and in the future we will have to depend on her to handle the homemakers' work on this reserve.\nLittle Pine Reserve,\nPaynton, Sask.,\nSeptember 30, 1942.\n\nMr. J.B.

This lady has served in the same capacity for the 1939-40 school term, as Miss Frances B. Little, as referred to in Department letter of August 22nd, 1939. She married Mr. Clarence W. Foan at Christmas, 1939, but continued to teach the school for the remainder of that term, after which, her husband was appointed. During the continuation of her husband's appointment at the school, Mrs. Foan has done a great deal of the work, and has been in close touch with it for the whole time, consequently she can take hold, at once, and carry out the work with satisfaction to all.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending that Mrs. Foan be appointed to this school. I should mention that I do not know the reason for Mr. Foan's decision to leave the school and seek employment in a war industry, nor his reason for leaving it so late to so advise his wife, and our Department, through her. He left for British Columbia shortly after the school closed at the end of June, and his wife remained at the school, to take care of the Department property and the school garden, which is of some considerable importance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F.B.

Mr. Spence is the only applicant. You are well aware of the shortage of teachers in this province. Last year Normal School students were sent out with only three weeks training in some cases.\n\nMr. Spence has Grade XII, and requires only four more subjects to gain his B.A. from the University of Saskatchewan. For the last few years he has been seasonal school teacher at Stanley so he has had some teaching experience although he has no certificates as a qualified teacher. Your Agent at Punnichy, Mr. R.S. Davis, under whom he has served at Stanley, has written highly commending his work and his influence among the Indians. At Stanley he has been teaching grades 1 - 4. At Little Pine the grades at present are 1 - 6. Mr. Spence's academic work at the University would indicate that he is capable of teaching all the grades.\n\nMr. Spence graduated from your Elkhorn School and came to Saskatoon where he held his own in the University and the College, taking an active part in the athletic life there. He is a fine type of man. He speaks Cree fluently. He is thirty-one years of age and has a wife and child. In his application he says: \"Being a native myself I have the good of the Indian at heart. I will try to translate this desire of mine into the better language of deeds\".\n\nYour Agent at Battleford, Mr. Ostrander, knows about him and has received testimony about him. I am convinced that Mr. Spence's appointment to the School would be a great help to the life of the whole Reserve as well as the School. It is with entire confidence that I nominate him for the post. He will be available to begin work about Sept. 1st.\n\nTo Philip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The rest of the boys have not been in school. Yes, they have been working but most of the time they have not. It is going to mean that every pupil at those ages will want to quit school too unless constructive action is taken.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nThere will be at least fifty pupils for the Little Pine Day School for next term and the teacher, the Reverend A. Spence, says that, as about half of these will be in the beginners classes, it will be impossible for him to teach all of them without assistance.\n\nThe present class-room is not large enough, of course, to accommodate fifty pupils, but Mr. Spence has made the suggestion that the assistant teacher could take the beginners classes in the dining-room until better arrangements could be made.\n\nI suppose the Department will have many problems to solve in order to meet the increased demands upon the day schools which will result from the extra pressure put upon them through the efforts of Indian parents to comply with the requirements of the Family Allowance Act. The arrangement being suggested, that the children be taught in the dining-room, is not a good arrangement, but it will be better than nothing. If it is decided to employ another teacher for this school, something should be done about locating one suitable for the work in sufficient time for the next term.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 26, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Indian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the necessity for increased accommodation at the Little Pines Indian Day School, in order to properly handle the larger number of pupils who are attending.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion to employ another teacher and use the dining room, I presume that you refer to the dining room used by the pupils attending the school. In the event of a second teacher being appointed, it would be necessary to provide living accommodation. Where could a second teacher live? Would the Reverend Mr. Spence and his wife be prepared to provide accommodation for a second teacher in their residence?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBattleford, Sask.\nApril 11th, 1945.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nReplying to your letter No. 105-21 of the 26th ultimo. In the event of a second teacher being appointed at the Little Pine Indian Day School, the Rev. A. Spence advises me he will be able to provide accommodation, though the teacher will have to provide her own bedding.\n\nC.S.Bell\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, April 19, 1945.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Acting Agent Bell, recommending the employment of a second teacher at the Little Pines Indian Day School for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nWe were not able to provide the funds in the current year's appropriation for a second classroom, but the acting Indian agent states that one class could be conducted in the dining room located in the school. He further advises that if a second teacher is appointed living accommodation could be provided in the teacher's residence, which is now occupied by the Reverend Ahab Spence and his wife.\n\nIn view of the fact that the agent believes there will be at least 50 pupils in the coming academic year, the Department agrees that the services of two teachers are necessary. Would it be possible for Your Lordship to nominate a second teacher? Salary would be allowed at the rate of $80.00 per teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. W. T.

Bell, Acting Indian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, regarding the transportation of children to the Little Pines Indian Day School. It is noted that you request this service for five months, instead of three months last year.\n\nIt has been decided to allow the amount requested for five months, namely, $100.00, but you should arrange for the teacher to keep a careful check on the attendance during these five months and submit same for our consideration, in order that we can decide if providing the transportation results in increased attendance.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLittle Pine Reserve,\nPaynton, Sask.,\nNovember 28th, 1945.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am contemplating on completing a B.A. degree course from the University of Saskatchewan at the earliest possible time. I only need two classes that I must take intra-murally during a summer session. The session is of six weeks' duration, and costs about one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) per session. It would take two summer sessions to finish the course as one class only is allowed per session.\n\nMy academic record is as follows so far. Graduated from Emmanuel College, Saskatoon, in 1937, with a Licentiate in Theology with an average of 69.8%. Since that time I have taken extra-murally at my own expense the following classes from the University of Saskatchewan, with results as follows:\n\n| History C Division C | Philosophy 5. Division A. |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| History 24.B Division B | Philosophy 52. Division C. |\n\nLast year I planned on attending the University Summer Session, but was not able to do so because I had to take my wife to the hospital early in June at North Battleford, and the following month proceeded to Prince Albert to have X-rays taken of Mrs. Spence. Next month I must again take my wife to a Prince Albert Hospital...for an addition to our family.\n\nAs you know, babies cost money, and I'm not getting any younger. I would like to get my B.A. as soon as possible. I will not be able to manage the course again this coming summer without some financial assistance. I am wondering whether the Indian Department would consider to assist me to get my degree?\n\nHoping to hear from your Department re this matter soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd. Ahab Spence.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Reverend Ahab Spence, presently day school teacher at the Little Pine Reserve in the Battleford Agency.\n\nMr. Spence is an Indian from The Pas and has had some assistance from the Department in the past, I believe, toward his education. It would appear from his letter that he is hoping for assistance to the amount of $300.00 toward the cost of two summer sessions at the University of Saskatchewan for the completion of a B.A. degree.\n\nI would be glad to be informed by the Department whether there is a possibility of this assistance being granted Mr. Spence.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, December 12, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing communication from Reverend Ahab Spence, requesting us to allow him $500.00 towards the cost of two summer sessions at the University of Saskatchewan, in order that he can complete his B.A. Degree.\n\nSome years ago we gave Rev. Mr. Spence considerable assistance in order to enable him to secure his education.\n\nThe amount provided for tuition grants is limited and it is only fair that it should be reserved for those to whom we have not yet given any assistance. We feel that we have dealt reasonably well with Rev. Mr. Spence and that he has received his share.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945, ON BATTLEFORD AGENCY\n\nEDUCATION\n\nThe following Day Schools were in operation:\n\nLittle Pine, Red Pheasant,\nThunderchild.\n\nRed Pheasant School re-opened November 12th, with Mr. A.

I tried to institute the idea the first year I was here. On the whole it went over fairly well, but some parents refused to sign it as they thought that there was a \"catch init somewhere\". But I am willing to co-operate with the Department with that splendid step in Indian Education.\n\nI am also wondering why the Department will not go further and institute \"promotion Certificates\" and proper Commencement Exercises at the end of each academic year to which all parents and friends will be invited, and the Inspector of Indian Agencies or the Indian Agent would be the Master of Ceremonies. One realizes of course that the Inspector is a busy man, and so is the Agent but I think they could make a point of being present and as he cannot be more than one place at a time each Day School could have the honour of having him in turn. But the idea is that Commencement Exercises should be the Annual Affair of the school year.\n\nThere is another matter that I would like to suggest to you before you go as a witness in Ottawa before the committee there studying the Indian Act. To you think that the various Day Schools in our reserves could be graded for the purpose of promotion for our Indian Day School teachers? It would be an incentive for the teacher and I think would raise the standard of our teachers and raise the standard of our schools as well. Of course the higher the grade of school the larger the salaries. (I believe you have that system in your Indian Agencies with regard to Indian Agents and Doctors).\n\nI hope Sir, that you will not feel that I have gone out of bounds in making these suggestions to you, but I assure you that I honestly think our Day Schools could be improved.\n\nI look forward to receiving the Indian School Bulletin every two months and of course I keep it on file as instructed but a proper file worthy of the high standard of this publication should be provided in my opinion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Ahab Spence\nRegina, Saskatchewan, March 26, 1947.\n\nAttention Col. Neary\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from Rev.

The natural increase would indicate that there should be an increased enrollment at this school bringing the total to a point where two teachers would be necessary for the work. I endeavored to obtain actual figures from Mr. Spencer and from Mr. Pell as to the enrollment for Sept. 1947 but it is difficult to secure these from the Indians. Having the opportunity of securing two teachers who were anxious to work together, and having also the determination of the department to develop fully the educational plan for the Indians as set out in the Bulletin, it seemed an ideal\nOttawa, July 5, 1947.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nI have received your letter of June 28 requesting a second teacher at the Little Pine Indian Day School.\n\nOur policy has been to provide for an additional teacher where the average attendance in a classroom is over 30.\n\nOur records show that for the last two quarters at Little Pine Day School the attendance has only been as follows:\n\nQuarter ending December 31, 1946 - 22.2\n\" March 31, 1947 - 23.16\n\nWe are quite prepared to authorize the employment of a second teacher if the attendance is sufficiently high to warrant such an expenditure.
