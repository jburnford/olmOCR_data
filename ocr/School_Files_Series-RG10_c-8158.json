This is a large school and the Department has lately put up a first-class building and Mr McLennan, who has had charge of it for the last year, is doing well. His present salary is only $250.00, which is a very small sum and should, I think, be increased to at least $300.00. The teachers of Indian schools in Nova Scotia have lately lost the local Government aid. Of the ten schools in Nova Scotia, seven of the teachers already receive $300.00 from the Department, which is, I think, the lowest salary we should offer to any of your schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Beaver\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclose Mr MacLennan's return for\nIndian School, Wly Coonowag Reserve, for\nperiod ending March 31st, 1904.

McLennan, Esq.\nInverness,\nN.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter has suddenly filled me with a flood of myself. Really I must be next to Mahomet, so great have doubts become. You say that if the man has appetite, \"holds the necessary qualifications he may be appointed,\" to teach the Indians, nothing to draw his salary, namely $300 per annum. Are any other qualifications needed besides holding the good will of the responsible members for the district? If so please let me know what they are since you impose upon me the pains of finding out whether the man holds the necessary qualifications.\n\nI remain in your greatness. On the other hand I find that there is an Indian agent above me in this county else I should be advising you from more serious resignation and not you me. Of course there is no good blood between me and our representative since I put him in the hole a few years ago. Anyway he is master of the administration in this County at least so he has his fling. May he prosper. He told a man that would not tell me a lie that when he asked for anything in Ottawa he had to get it. He would make them give it. Another man told me that a member of Parliament told him that our men took off his coat to the Member of Parliament for an order like that. And must over the appointment of Public Officers. A secret police being still doing indirectly.\n\nIn the present case you do more for me than in a former one if I am similar. Kindly you give me the new teacher's address. Surely the doctor's\nnephew is not going to quit before finishing up\nthe summer quarter as the long holidays would\ntherefore go unpaid for, so the possibility of\nhis finishing this term gives us plenty time to\nfind out what you consider necessary\nqualifications. You know my mind already,\nAll that is needed is the favour of our M.\nI am glad that Mr. MacLennan is through.\nOne must be a conscientious worker to\nkeep up interest in such a school. For my\npart I take little or no interest in the\nwork for I find myself dealt with so\nharshly that I have no heart in trying to\nimprove things. I get no cooperation from\nthose who should stand by me. When I was\ngoing to college I happened to pick up\nas a prefect in the studies more than one\nyear. I found that I could not control the boys\nso thought they should be controlled. Having\nno other prefects, had to do the Vice-rector to\nwhose care discipline belonged. With his support\nfound everything moving smoothly but if he\ntook but little real interest in the matter I liked\nout a miserable existence and discipline was\nbelow par. When we got no support as with a\nchange of rectors we sometimes did we tried to\nhobble through somehow. If our work suited them\nwe could do nothing better than suit them. If my\nwork suited for all well and good. I believe\ncan do more for the Indians, even handicapped\nas I am, than almost any other person within easy\ndistance of them. Otherwise I should throw the agency\naway high to those who are sorry I even got it.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n97. Mo. Bn.B. 11 Pd. Via. Z.\n\nInverness, N. S. Sept. 11th\n\nHon.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that as Mr Donald Gillis has satisfied the Department as to his qualifications for the position of teacher, of the Whycocomagh Indians school, you will be good enough to instruct him to take charge immediately. Mr Gillis' address, as you were informed by official letter of the 17th ultimo, is South-West Margaree.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. D. Macpherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendaloe, C.B.,\nN.S.\nRiver Bourgeois, St. John, January 21, 1907\n\nSir,\n\nComplaint having reached me about the Indian School at Whyosomagh, Newcomb, Co., and being within reasonable distance of it on the 10th inst., I decided to visit it and endeavour to ascertain the cause, if any, for grievance.\n\nA year ago, almost to a day, I inspected the school for the first time, and while the teacher, Mr. Daniel J. Gillis, an entire stranger to me, did not impress me favourably at all, the few pupils in attendance\u2014I think there were six\u2014gave evidence that some one had taught them to read indifferently and write fairly well, besides the bare rudiments of arithmetic and geography. But I was not in a position to make comparisons with regard to the standing of the school then and at any previous period. When I inspected it again on the 10th inst., seven pupils were present, and a few tests of their attainments revealed the fact that no progress whatever had been made during the year. The teacher could not deny that such was the case, and said that irregular attendance, due to carelessness on the part of parents, was the cause. His statement was correct in a measure; but I am disposed to agree with the Indians of Whyosomagh who assert that it is almost, if not quite, useless to send their children to the school while it is conducted by the present incumbent. They assert further that it has retrograded under his management.\n\nI am convinced that Mr. Gillis does not possess the qualities necessary for a successful teacher.\nin any school, much less an Indian school. His expression is that of a person not well-balanced in mind; and he is evidently of a nervous, excitable temperament.\n\nI am altogether of opinion that the salary paid him by the Department is money well spent to gain advantage, and in the interests of education among the Indians of Whycomagh, who are naturally rather intelligent. I feel that there should be a change of teacher. My personal opinion in the matter is only that of official duty; and I should like the Department to ascertain what the actual views are on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J. Boyd\nIndian Dept.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 2nd July, 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Indian School at Whyccocomagh, Inverness Co., N.S., and in reply beg to state that in view of the unfavorable condition of affairs you found when there, the Department has decided that the services of Mr. Gillis, the Teacher, should be dispensed with, and you are hereby authorized to notify him that his engagement will not be renewed after the close of the current quarter.\n\nYou will also be good enough to take necessary steps to secure a duly qualified teacher for this school, so that it may be re-opened after the summer holidays. Any applications you may receive should be submitted to the Department for its approval, with certificates of qualification and character.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nA.

Gillis, who was appointed in 1905 at the instance of Mr. McLennan, then M.P. for Inverness.\n\nMr. Boyd does not hesitate to say that he considers that a change of teacher is necessary, as no progress has been made and Mr. Gillis is not possessed of the qualities necessary for a successful teacher of any school, much less an Indian school.\n\nSee letter under.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArthur Benson\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., No. 103167-1, and to say that I shall notify, as requested, Mr. Willis, teacher of the Indian School at Shingwauk, Ontario, No. 1, as soon as I ascertain his present whereabouts. This being vacation time, the school is closed.\n\nThe matter of his successor will have my best attention; and I shall take the responsibility of securing the services of a thoroughly qualified and suitable teacher, providing the Dominion representative for Shingwauk, etc., will not interfere and insist, in a manner of his choice, getting the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If the charges against Gibbs are such as will necessitate his removal I certainly protest against engaging Mr. Murphy. I think, as the Superintendent of the County, it is my duty to consider myself a friend to all who wish to promote a just person as the parties who are evidently attempting to injure this family. I must also observe that I cannot see any good reason why indeed in this matter. However, I do not intend to be bullied aside that easily by pigmy politicians such as I am suspicious have to be getting their way & the suspicion has to be getting away.

I have a very clear idea how why Mr. Hill was dismissed & determine effort was made to make a place for Miss Murphy. The question of what work she did & that without my knowledge is a pretty strong against her something shady was being done.\n\nI know Mr. Hill's way will be an opinion that he is an intelligent schoolteacher well suited to that in the Indian School Wheaconough. However, I am writing that he be removed if there is cause. Therefore asks that Mr. Hill be Remove without delay who applied for his position on what ground.

They say that it has retrograded under his management. Mr. Boyd further stated that he is convinced that Mr. Gillis does not possess the qualities necessary for a successful teacher of any school, much less an Indian school.

Minister of the Interior,\n\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, August 16th., 1908.\n\nEx'd,\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your card of the 16th instant I beg to inform you that on the 30th ultimo the Department replied to your letter of the 6th July, to Scottsville, the address that you had furnished, to the effect that your application would receive consideration, and that the salaries paid by the Department in Nova Scotia range from $300.00 to $350.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJas. D. Gallie, Esq.,\n78 Lockman St.,\nHalifax, N.S.\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nGentlemen,\n\nMight I ask if\nI am granted the position\nof Teacher in the Whiskey\nPoveshell Indian School\nin Nebraska? I wrote\nto the Min. of the Interior before\non this Matter, an early\nreply will oblige, yours etc.\n\nJames D. Gillis\nTeacher.\n\nP.S. I wrote before from\nScottsville, Mo., O.\nOttawa, August 23, 1909.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nRe Whyccoomagh Indian School.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a statement regarding the dismissal of Mr. Daniel J. Gillis, teacher of the Whyccoomagh Indian school and the proposed appointment of Miss Margaret A. Murphy as his successor.\n\nMr. A.J. Boyd, Indian Superintendent for Nova Scotia, reported on the 31st June, last, that, owing to complaints which had reached him about this school, he made a special visit, in order to ascertain the cause, if any, for grievance. He had inspected the school a year previous, and he states that, while the teacher, an entire stranger to him, did not impress him favourably, he was not then in a position to make a comparison with regard to the standing of the school, but on his second visit a\nfew tests of the pupils' attainments revealed the fact that no progress whatever had been made during the year, a condition which the teacher did not deny but claimed that irregular attendance due to carelessness of parents was the cause. Mr. Boyd admits that the teacher's statement was correct in a measure but that he was disposed to agree with the Indians of Whyccoomagh, who assert that it is almost, if not quite, useless to send their children to the school while it is conducted by the present incumbent. The Indians further assert that it has retrograded under Mr. Gillis' management.\n\nMr. Boyd says that he is convinced that Mr. Gillis does not possess the qualities necessary for a successful teacher in any school, much less an Indian school. His expression is that of a person not well-balanced in mind and he is evidently of a nervous, excitable temperament.\n\nMr. Boyd concludes his report by stating that he is altogether of opinion that the salary paid by the Department to Mr. Gillis is money not spent to good advantage and in the interests of education among the Indians of Whyccoomagh, who are naturally rather intelligent, and feels\nfeels that there should be a change of teacher.\n\nIn view of this report the only course open to the Department was to dispense with Mr. Gillis' services and secure another teacher, and Mr. Boyd was instructed to take the necessary steps to secure a qualified teacher for this school, so that it might be reopened after the summer holidays, applications received by him to be submitted to the Department for its approval, with certificates of qualification and character. (Instructions dated July 3).\n\nOn the 25th of that month Mr. Boyd forwarded an application from Miss Margaret A. Murphy, of St. Peters, N.S., accompanied by a certificate from Mr. Jp P. MacNeil, Inspector of schools for the district, who stated that she was the holder of a certificate, Class C of the Province, with Normal training, and known to him since childhood as a young lady of irreproachable moral character. He further said that Miss Murphy had taught school under his supervision for several years past and always gave good satisfaction to her employers as well as to himself as Inspector and that he had great pleasure in recommending her.\nher to any Board of Trustees requiring the services of a teacher of her class.\n\nThe Department had decided to appoint Miss Murphy but, owing to Mr. Chisholm's protest, action was deferred.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Chisholm's claim to have the right to recommend a successor I may state for your information that it is not the practice of the Department to refer the appointment of teachers of Indian schools to Members of Parliament. The usual course was followed in this instance, and, had it not been for Mr. Chisholm's intervention, Miss Murphy would have received the appointment at the usual salary of $300.00 per annum, and the school would have been reopened on the 16th inst.\nOttawa, August 27, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter, undated, I beg to say that the Department has not as yet come to any decision with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Whycocomagh Indian school.\n\nI may add that both your previous communications, addressed from Scottsville and Halifax, were replied to.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJames D. Gillis, Esq.,\n208 Lockman St.,\nHalifax, N.S.\nRiver Rouge, N.B., Aug. 7, 1909\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 25th inst. concerning the Whyosough Indian school; and to say that, if possible, Miss Murphy will avoid entering into any binding agreement to take charge of another school until after the Indian Superintendent of Education has made his report on the situation at Whyosough.\n\nI expect to visit Mr. Scott at Point Tippera on Monday as requested by him in a telegram just received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Gillis of 21 Morris St., Halifax, N.S., in which he states that he has not yet received a reply to his previous communication of the 6th July last making application for employment as a teacher in one of the Indian schools. I am advising Mr. Gillis that his letter of the 27th ultimo has been transferred to you for reply. When he last wrote to this Department his address was Scottsville, Inverness Co., N.S. Perhaps you will be kind enough to see that a reply is sent to him as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., inclosing a second communication addressed to The Honourable the Minister of the Interior by Mr. Jas. D. Gillis in reference to his application for the position of teacher of the Whyocomagh Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this Department has sent six letters to Mr. Gillis, the last being on the 1st inst. The trouble appears to be that he does not stay long enough at one address to receive his mail. Only one of the above communications has been returned as \"Unclaimed For\".\n\nThe Department trusts that he will receive the last letter above mentioned and will have no further necessity to write to your Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nP.G. Keyes, Esq.,\nSecretary's\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhycocomagh Oct. 15th\n\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir - In reply to yours of the 23rd Oct. No. 108167/1 I would say that I am ready to take charge of the school at the Micmac reservation as soon as the families finish their work inside. I think it will be ready this week.\n\nIn the meantime I am going around among them and get acquainted. Please send a new register and blanks for the quarterly reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Ellis\nOttawa, October 7, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., advising the Department that you will be ready to take charge of the Whyocomagh Indian school as soon as the painting is finished.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is satisfactory to the Department. As you are probably aware the attendance at this school for some time past has been very poor, and the Department trusts that you will be able to effect a great improvement in this respect. In this connection your proposal to become acquainted with the Indians is commendable, as one of the primary conditions of success is the obtaining of the good-will of the parents. In other ways also personal visitations in their homes will prove of benefit, as it will show to them that you are interested in their welfare, as well as that of their children.\n\nAs to ways and means of interesting the children in their school work nothing need be said, as you are an experienced teacher. The Department trusts that you will meet with a large measure of success in your new field and will be glad to hear from you at a later date.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJohn Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhyocomagh, O.R.\nAsst. Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to Education among the Indians of this Agency I have only this to say. Nothing your Department has done for the Indians under my care, in this line seems to have any other end than to please the representative for the locality and hence School keeping has generally been a farce, that has nevertheless provided a sitting down job at a lazy man's salary for some party, storm beater, cheater. This accursed political expediency is sapping the Vitality of our young Empire and in your policy with regard to the Indian schools you worship the totem on bended knee, at least in this locality.\n\nIf the Department has any confidence in me as its agent it ought to defer to my opinion in preference to any other until it became convinced by proper investigation that I was not capable to represent it, then I should be replaced. The Department knows well that it has no more conscientious employees than the Catholic clergyman. We work to please God. I have taken such interest in the Schools of this County that the Local Government appointed me to a special Commission to investigate their condition, report thereon and suggest reforms or improvements. Only last night a School Inspector of the mainland wrote me for my opinion on a matter affecting schools. In spite of everything I am to have no hand in training those poor Micmac children who are as dear to me as my heart's blood. Since I took this agency I can't say that much improvement was made.\nby its children at school. Under the circumstances I can't take much interest in Indian school matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald MacPherson P.C.,\nIndian Affairs.\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of March 31st which, although in reply to a request for special report for publication in the Annual Report, is a criticism of the official course with reference to Indian education within your Agency. You have entirely failed to recognize the improvements which have been made during the past year. Following a report made by you on the 16th of July 1907, the Department erected a commodious school building on the Malagawatch Reserve and has appointed a competent teacher at that point who appears to be taking a great interest in his pupils. Is it possible that you have not visited the Reserve and seen these improvements which were based on your own recommendation? The former teacher at Whycocowagh has also been replaced and a competent teacher has been engaged who has since the summer holidays largely increased the attendance and stimulated the interest of the Indians in educational matters.\n\nYou ask the question whether you are to have no hand in training these poor Mic-Mac children. If you stand aloof from the means employed to train them, the answer must be in the affirmative but if you take an active interest in these matters and assist the teachers with your advice and encouragement, there is no doubt that their efficiency will be materially increased.\n\nToo great stress can be laid upon the evils of the system of political patronage. This system becomes vicious only when men\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, G.B.\nN.S.\nunfitted for the duties that they have to perform receive appointments. It is equally objectionable where political partisanship prevents the due recognition of good and valuable services performed for the Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 26th November, 1910.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to advise you that the Department has decided to grant you an increase in salary as teacher of the Whycoomagh school from $350. to $400. per year. This increase of $50. will date from the 1st of October last, and Rev. D. MacPherson, Indian Agent, has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher Whycoomagh School,\nWhycoomagh, C.B.\nEx' Ottawa, 26th November, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has increased the salary of Mr. John Gillis, teacher of the Whycoomagh school, from $350. to $400. per annum. This increase will date from the 1st of October last, and Mr. Gillis has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. D.

Boyd Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nSir\u2014At the urgent solicitation of a large number of the adults on the reserve here I have consented should the Department concur to open a night school here after my return from my Christmas vacation.\n\nThey would like to attend school so as to learn to read and write; besides a great deal of good will arise from teaching them habits of cleanliness and the laws of health generally. Besides it will give me an opportunity to impress on their minds the necessity of earning a living without being dependants on the Government or charity of the public.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn R. Miller\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit to the Department the enclosed application by Mr. John A. Gillis, Indian Teacher, Whycocomagh, N.S., to open a night-school for the benefit of the adult Indians of that place.\n\nAs you may be aware, Mr. Gillis has taken a very active interest in everything tending to promote the welfare of the Whycocomagh Indians since his incumbency as teacher of their day-school. His efforts in their behalf have met with a large measure of success, and he can justly claim for his exertions the rare merit of being uninfluenced by selfishness.\n\nI have faith in Mr. Gillis's proposition, and believe he must see that a night-school conducted for the Indians of Whycocomagh would be productive of good results. I am acquainted with no Indian Settlement in Nova Scotia where conditions are so favourable as at Whycocomagh for successfully conducting a school of that kind; and, all things considered, I have much pleasure in recommending his application to the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 19, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to the establishment of a night school for the Indians of the Whycoomagh Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the satisfactory work that has been performed by Mr. Gillis the department is prepared to give night classes a trial and Mr. Gillis will be written to direct and the necessary instructions given him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, December 19, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Superintendent Boyd has forwarded to the Department your communication of the 5th instant in reference to the establishment of night classes on the Whycoomagh Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to try the experiment of conducting a night school on the Whycoomagh reserve from January 3rd to March 31st, next. Instruction should be given by you for 2\u00bd hours for three evenings a week and you will be paid at the rate of 50 cents per hour. These classes are instituted for the benefit of those who are not in a position to attend in the daytime and for a time at least the Department would like to have from you weekly reports in which you should deal with the attendance, work performed, success attained, etc. The necessary stationery will be supplied you upon requisition and you should also ask for any other requisite articles to properly carry on your work. At the end of the quarter, if the classes are continued that long, a complete return on the usual form should be submitted to the Department when payment of the salary due you will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhycoomagh, O.S.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nSir,- I hope you will pardon my tardiness in replying to yours of the 19th Dec 103167/11. I arrived only just with a steamer shortly after getting home on my vacation. I beg to say that I will open a right parcel on the same in conformity with your instructions, so soon as I get back to Ottawa, which will be on Monday Jan 2nd.\n\nWould you kindly forward me the necessary report blanks etc.\n\nWith reference to yours of the 20th re the pictures of their Majesties King George V and Queen Mary, I beg to say that I had them framed and hung in a conspicuous place in the schoolroom as soon as I received them. I also received the manual of Calisthenics and have exercised every day the weather permits. Though an oversight on my part and the loss of other articles I forget to make the necessary returns but will attend to it immediately on my return.\n\nI also opened a bureau through the kindness of Messrs John Smith & Co. for the distribution of lands, letters, etc., manufactured by the Indians and have received some orders already which I am going to have filled on my return. In this way I hope to assist the poor people self-supporting.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nJohn Jones\nOld Servant\n\nJ. W. A.

It is also noted that none of the young women on the reserve attend this school and the Department considers that it would be to their advantage to do so. You will, therefore, endeavour to have as many as possible of them enrolled. Further reports from you will be gladly received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn A. Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhycocomagh, C.B.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Feb. 15th, 1910.\n\nI wish to say that the effect of the school at Wabosquatch is so far inappreciable. This is not strange, only seven names are on the roll and the attendance mode is poor. While the attendance at Whigocomagh last year was encouraging, this year it is not near so good. If something could be done to make children attend better some results might ensue.\n\nThink if Simon Beagley, Captain of the Band at Whigocomagh were appointed with a salary of about $40 a year. He would be trust officer and constable for the band. It would do more good than anything else into which the Department would put as much money for the benefit of the schools of this agency. Although there has been school at Whigocomagh since away back, its influence on the people was nearly nil. If I gave you my opinion as to the wherefore you would say I was knocking again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6051, file 259-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 13, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter in reference to the attendance at the Whycocomagh Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the returns for the past year show a decided improvement in the enrolment and average attendance at this school and it is hoped that Mr. Gillis will be able to maintain the same. I may say that the Provincial School Inspector, in his last report on this school, spoke in very complimentary terms on the improved conditions on this reserve since Mr. Gillis took charge. If future returns show a falling off in the attendance your recommendation will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D.

Original on File 103167-6\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI think that some regulation should be in force which would compel the children to attend school more regularly and punctually. The readers now in use, are, in my opinion, too hard for pupils of their mental calibre. I think that the \"Nova Scotia Series\" prescribed for the Nova Scotia public schools would be more suitable. I would also suggest that the teacher be instructed to give a lot of time to the \"Conversational\" method of teaching English in order to develop a facility of expression. A good text, as an aid, is the \"Berlitz Method of Teaching English.\"\n\nSgd. James MacKinnon,\n\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, January 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Public School Inspector has submitted his report on the Whyocomagh School, which, taking the conditions into consideration, is satisfactory.\n\nHe suggests that the Nova Scotia Series of Readers should be used in your school and it is thought well to carry out this suggestion. You may, therefore, make requisition for the number that will be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn A.

This was right wrong because he positively held no claim against me. The Justice was J. S. Hart Whycocomagh Inverness Co., N.S. I wrote O. J. Daniel\nAtt. General\nHalifax N.S.\nabout this matter and he made J.S. Hart dismiss the case. Lately when on Militia Duty I was served with summons in the same matter. I have no doubt but the J.P. i.e. Mr. Gillis\n\nJno. Ind. Sch. Teacher\n\nWhy do you think they chose that very time as a compliment to the Micmacs. Really I believe that Mr. Duchemin ought to see if Mr. Gillis is opposed to the acting a J.P. besides his Govt. duties. The Trial is to take place in 5 days on the 24th inst. Please wire Mr. Gillis to dismiss that case. No man but he & J.S. Hart would give any heed to Micmacs. McKinnon's imaginary acquaintance & closest friend.\n\nJno. D.

I.A.\nSir, We the undersigned members of Whycocomagh Band respectfully request that a night school be opened at this reserve from January 1st, 1912 to May 1st in order to enable those of us who are unable to attend the day school to get some instruction in reading, writing, and general knowledge.\n\nGabriel Selkirk\nLevi Rollat\nAndrew Gould\nStephen Morris\nStephen Silbey\nJoe Gould\nFrancis Bernard\nAndrew Bernard\nBenjamin Silbey\nJames Gregory\nJohn Henry\nStephen Silbey\nPeter H.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Gabriel Silipoy,\nWhycoomagh Indian Reserve,\nWhycoomagh, O.B.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\nOTTAWA. December 11, 1912.\n\nThe Schools Branch,-\n\nApplication is made to have a night school established at the Whycocomagh Indian reserve, this to be in charge of Mr. Gillis, the present teacher. Will you kindly let me have a memo. with reference to this.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, December 12, 1912.\n\nMr. Bedley,\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of yesterday's date in reference to the establishment of a night school at Whycocomagh I beg to say that a night school was conducted for 36 nights during the winter months of 1911. The attendance was fairly satisfactory, but a number of the Indians were advanced in years. While the average attendance was very fair, being 22 out of 28, this is accounted for by the fact that a number of the Indians were very regular, at the same time there were several who did not show by their attendance any great interest in the school.\n\nNo request was made for the establishment of the school last winter and when a number of the Indians made application last month, asking that a night school be established from January 1st to May 1st, 1913, the Department advised them that it did not consider that it would be of any great benefit to them. One of the reasons for taking this attitude is the fact that none but male members of the band are allowed to attend the school. If the\nthe women might be allowed to attend and obtain advantage from the instruction that might be given in hygiene or if practical lessons could be given them in some of the branches of domestic science, I think that the night school might be of benefit.\n\nThe Indians on this reserve have not in the past evidenced a proper interest in the work of the day school, although there is a good teacher in charge, and a number of the men who attended the night school were married men. I may say also that the teacher did not furnish reports regularly, as asked for, and the Department for that reason is not fully aware of the work that was accomplished during the season that the school was in operation. However, if it is the wish of the Department to conduct a night school the experiment might be tried again for three months on three evenings each week, the remuneration to be at the rate previously paid, viz.- 50 cents an hour.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 22nd ultimo I beg to say that upon further consideration the Department has decided to try the experiment of conducting a night school on the Whycocomagh Reserve during the months of January, February and March for three evenings each week. It is expected that the Indians will take full advantage of this opportunity and that the attendance will be good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Gabriel Silipoy,\nWhycocomagh Indian Reserve,\nWhycocomagh, O.B.\nOttawa, December 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nAt the request of the Indians the Department has decided to have a night school conducted on the Whyco-comagh Reserve during the months of January, February and March only for three evenings each week, the session to be two hours from 7 to 9. For this you will be remunerated at the rate of 50 cents per hour. You will note that the session has been reduced from two and a half to two hours. When the night school was conducted two years ago the Department asked for weekly reports, but these were not sent regularly. This year you will be required to send reports at least every two weeks.\n\nUnless there is some valid objection the Department is of opinion that the young women on the reserve should share in the benefits of this night school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nReport of Inspector James MacKinnon on Whycocemagh School.\n\nSchool inspected on November 25th, 1913\n\nThe chief drawback to the progress at the school is the irregularity of attendance. Next comes the lack of interest in the work on the part of both parents and children. Indeed the former condition is due in no small part to the latter. As already indicated there is scarcely any parental control over the children\u2014that is to say it is scarcely ever exercised either in school or any other matters. Consequently, notwithstanding the earnest efforts of the teacher, I cannot report satisfactory progress. The sanitary conditions in the homes although considerably better than in former years afford room for great improvement. At school the teacher insists on the observance of the ordinary rules of sanitation but once beyond the jurisdiction of the teacher the children seem to forget. I am of the opinion that if the children are to make any material progress in education they must be separated from their parents and put into an institution where the teacher can have full control over them during the whole term. At any rate the present system is a failure as evidenced by the fact that to my knowledge none of the Indians' schools under my observation has produced within fifteen years a single scholar capable of writing an ordinary letter correctly or able to converse on ordinary topics in passably good English.\nOttawa, February 3, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector McKinnon in his report on the Whycocomagh School lays particular stress on the lack of interest in the school by both parents and children and states that so long as the parents are indifferent to the education of their children no satisfactory progress can be made despite the earnest efforts of the teacher.\n\nThe Department would like you to impress upon the Indians the necessity of sending their children regularly to school. There is a truant officer appointed for this school and you should see that he performs his duties faithfully.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D.

You will see what the teacher reports on attendance days taught, and the reasons for no school. I did not figure out how much was coming to Mr. Ellis and could not do so. There seems to be a distinction between the teacher and the people, perhaps Mr. Boyd could investigate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 8, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the March quarter return of the Whycoomagh Day School, also a return showing the attendance at the night school for the same period.\n\nWith reference to your salary as teacher of the day school the Department is withholding payment for the seventeen days which this school was closed on account of your illness. If, however, you forward to the Department a doctor's certificate stating that you were unable to teach during these seventeen days the amount of salary withheld for that period will be sent you. You will be good enough to attend to this matter at once.\n\nYour returns shows that you closed school four days during the above quarter on account of the school-house not being scrubbed. The Department considers this a trivial excuse and will expect you in future to keep this school open regularly.\n\nWith reference to the return of attendance that you have forwarded for the night school the Department is unable to arrive at the amount due you for this service from the return sent. You will be good enough to state the number of nights which you conducted this night school.\n\nJohn A.

By 37 nights I mean that was 37 teaching nights in the quarter. According to instructions received from Rev. D. McPherson Indian Agent I was to keep the school open two hours each night for which I was to receive fifty cents per hour.\n\nWith regard to the four days school was closed waiting for it to be scrubbed. I may say that it is a custom among the Indians here and elsewhere among the poor mass for everyone to take their meals together Christmas day and the day after and also at Easter so that the condition of the schoolroom after one of these \"festivals\" had better be imagined than described, for with great remnants of bread and tobacco to find on the floor is usually an inch thick. The Rev.

The parents are not enthusiastic about the education of their children and in some cases they are opposed to it.

Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nExtract from Teacher's Annual Report on the Whycocomagh Indian School for the year ended December 31, 1916.\n\nOriginal on 160370-22F, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe children are not sufficiently clothed to protect them from the cold. This winter many of them are in a semi-starving condition. An issue of warm clothing and a mid-day meal would increase the attendance especially during the winter months.\n\nSgd. John A. Gillis,\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th ultimo, I regret having to corroborate Mr. Inspector McKinnon's report, which, if he had known the facts, might have been qualified by the statement that Indian parents at Whycocomagh, as I am convinced, should be able to accomplish more than they are doing in providing their children with food and clothing.\n\nIt appears to me, as it must to you, that instead of becoming self sustaining, Whycocomagh Indians are getting to be more dependent on the Department for support; and I begin to believe that they would rather live by scheming than by honest labour. At any rate, there can be no doubt that the majority of them might be better off than they are, and as a proof of this statement, I may say that, when I visited Whycocomagh reserve a few days ago, I found Charles Tony, a young man 33 years of age with a wife and two children - all enjoying good health, in very destitute circumstances; while his neighbor, Noel Gould, with a wife and five children had full and plenty for his family. They have exactly the same opportunities, so far as I could discover, with an advantage in Tony's favour, because he has only four in family, whereas, Gould has seven.\n\nThere is no good reason why Tony should not be\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbe as well circumstanced, at least, as his neighbour, and I have an idea that he might be, if he were given to understand that he must either work or go hungry. There is plenty of employment in Cape Breton this year, perhaps not always at one's door, but certainly within reasonable distance, as Noel Gould's case shows.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt also that several children on almost every reserve in Nova Scotia are unable to attend school in winter for want of shoes, stockings, and other articles of clothing - a condition of things for which they are in no wise responsible, and I am disposed to recommend in every case an expenditure for their benefit.\n\nWith regard to Whycocomagh reserve, I recommend an expenditure of $40.00 to provide shoes, etc. for children of school age in need. I would also recommend the usual midday lunch of biscuit and cheese for pupils of Whycocomagh school as an experiment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, 24th March, 1916.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, making report relative to the children attending school on the Whycocemagh Reserve; and in reply I beg to say, with regard to their requirements in the way of clothing, that the Department is of opinion that it would be to the interest of the Indians generally if they were obliged to provide clothing for their children, under all ordinary circumstances, instead of relying upon the Department to come to their aid. I may say that in view of your recommendation that $40.00 be expended in the purchase of clothing for the most needy of the children the Department will allow expenditure to that amount for the purpose stated. This matter is left in your hands, but it is expected that you will, from this time on, endeavor, along practical lines, to make the Indians generally rely upon their own exertions to provide clothing and other necessaries for their families. As above intimated the Department agrees with you that such a course will result in benefit to the Indians.\n\nWith regard to the case of Chas. Toney there would seem to be no doubt that this man is under the impression that the Department will come to his rescue in granting relief whenever he is in need and that he is thereby relieved from the necessity of work. You should disabuse his mind of this idea. It is hoped that you have not been too lenient in the past in dealing with these cases of this nature.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Burgeois, N. S.\nI may add that the Department does not consider it advisable at the present time to inaugurate a noon day meal at the Whycocomagh school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nJuly 22, 1916.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nNotwithstanding instructions previously given you, it has been brought to my attention that you are continuing to give orders for relief and authorizing expenditures without the sanction of the Department.\n\nIt is not compatible with business administration that employees should be allowed to authorize expenditures without control by the Department, and, if any more cases are brought to my notice, where you make purchases without authority either from headquarters or Superintendent Boyd, I regret that it will be necessary to dispense with your services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn A. Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhyocomagh Indian School,\nWhyocomagh, C.B.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, July 25th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your information copy of a letter of the 22nd instant, which has been written to Mr. John A. Gillis relative to purchasing supplies without authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\n\nA. J. Boyd Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N. S.\nSir - I beg to tender my resignation as teacher of the Wyjocowagh Indian school, the same to take effect on the thirty first day of October next.\n\nI must take this opportunity of thanking the officials of the department for their unfailing kindness and courtesies, and more especially their willingness on every occasion to adopt the humble suggestions that I made from time to time during the last seven years, for what success would be a benefit to the Indians.\n\nMy sincere thanks are also due to Mr. Supt. Boyd, and Reds. Agents MacPherson and Maclean, for many valuable hints that proved of great service to me in my duties. In conclusion I may say that I hope and trust that the poor Indians may so develop along the lines of intellectual progress, that they may one day measure up to our standards of good citizenship.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Gillis\nOttawa, October 3, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo tendering your resignation as teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian School to take effect on the 31st day of October, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your resignation is accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Gillis in which he tenders his resignation as teacher of the Why-cocomagh Indian Day School, the same to take effect on the 31st of this month.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to make inquiries with a view to securing the services of a suitable teacher to take charge of this school on the 1st of November, next.

As this is not a Government school the attendance is very irregular caused through the parents going to other reserves. For this reason I would like to have another report.\n\nMy qualifications are known to the Indian Superintendent (Mr. A. J.

If, upon receipt of these you consider that Mr. Richardson would make a suitable teacher, you will be good enough to make any recommendation or otherwise to the Department regarding his appointment as teacher of this school to replace the present teacher, Mr. John A.

You may commence your duties there as soon as Mr. Gillis leaves and you will be paid at the same rate as you received at the Tuft's Cove School, viz., $400.00. Mr. Superintendent Boyd and Mr. Acting Agent McLennan will be advised of your appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nGeo. F.

He has been advised that he may commence his duties as soon as Mr. Gillis leaves and he will be paid at the same rate as at Turf's Cove, viz- $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nA.

He has been informed that he may commence his duties there as soon as Mr. Gillis leaves and he will be paid at the same rate as at Tuft's Cove, viz\u2014$400.00 per annum.\n\nMr. Gillis should forward a return in the usual way for the number of days he taught during this quarter and when this is received a cheque for the amount due him will be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. John McLennan,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nSir,\n\nDelay in acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 19th inst. is due to my absence from headquarters recently on official business.\n\nOn an earlier occasion, while I was in Halifax, Mr. Richardson spoke to me about the Whycocomagh school, and I advised him to make application for it direct to the Department, so as to avoid delay, believing that he would be recognized at once as the highly efficient teacher of Tuft's Cove Indian school, which evidently cannot be kept open much longer, and I was most anxious to retain the services of Mr. Richardson, who, I have no hesitation in saying, is the most competent and successful among the Indian teachers of Nova Scotia, if not of the Maritime Provinces.\n\nHis qualifications cannot be questioned, and as they have already been recognized by the Department, as intimated above, it having employed him for several years past as Indian Teacher at Tuft's Cove; and I do hope it will not hesitate to retain his services by transferring him to the much more important position of teacher at Whycocomagh reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

It closed during December. The teacher that was there left. The closed that school about the first of November.

I have been considering the question of me going there and I find it would be impossible for me to live on the salary the Department offered. I have written Mr. J. Boyd (Superintendent) telling him I would not accept the school.\n\nI did not know Mr. Gillis had left, as I thought he would finish the December quarter and as I had not received any word from Agent, I thought he was still there.\n\nI trust the Department will appoint a young and active teacher for this school, one who is not afraid of work. Every year a number of children come from this school to me and after attending school from three to five years it should not be necessary for me to teach the child its letters.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nGeo.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. John Gillis, one time Indian Teacher at Whyccoomagh in the County of Inverness sent me a letter which he received from the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Stewart and dated November 7th, 1916; No. 103167-3. Mr. Gillis complains that you were not treating him fairly in connection with his final payment. If you were paying him from time to time along the rate of wages mentioned in the Assistant Secretary's letter, I do not quite understand why he would not be paid in full for the last year or half year that he taught according to that rate of salary which you allowed him. A school year is a school year including the holidays and when one is paid by the year for teaching school in Nova Scotia, that includes of course that he is paid for the holidays as well as the rest of the time. I have no doubt but Mr. Gillis sent his statement of facts to the Department and I trust you will look into it carefully and see that he is paid all that is coming to him.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMCK/H\nDecember 25th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie -\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, in reference to the salary of Mr. John Gillis, formerly teacher of the Whyeeconagh Indian School.\n\nI have looked up the records and I find that Mr. Gillis had been paid for his services in full to the end of the school year, June 30th, last, and taught to the end of October. He will be paid that proportion of the annual salary which the number of days he taught bears to the total number of teaching days in the year, namely 200. We do not take the holidays into account in payment of our teachers.\n\nIf a teacher puts in the full year he gets the full year's salary; if he is engaged only a portion of the year he is paid for the actual time that he worked on a basis of 200 days to the year.\n\nWhen a change of teacher takes place during the year and the annual salary has to be\n\nD.

I should have his answer not later than the 26th., and shall communicate it to you as soon as received.\n\nMeantime, kindly advise me if the Department will insist on engaging only a duly qualified teacher for this school - that is, one holding a Certificate of Scholarship and Normal School Diploma.\n\nI am not aware of any teacher available at present that I would care to recommend for the school outside of Mr. Richardson. Should he finally decline to accept the position, I think it will be on account of the salary attached to it, which he finds is not adequately remunerative. He is a superior man, as teacher, and I am disappointed that he did not take charge of the school promptly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

Report dated February 2, 1917.\n\nOriginal on 160370/23E.\n\nThe school at Whycocomagh is a fine building, in good repair, well equipped and comfortable. This school was in charge of Mr. John A. Gillis, who resigned as Indian teacher on the first of November, 1916. It remained closed until the first of February, when it was opened by Mr. G. F. Richardson, who was Indian teacher at Tufts Cove, Halifax County, for a number of years. He, however, left in two weeks times, and the school is now in charge of Mrs. Annie McNeil, who taught in the Malagawatch School.\nWhynacough R.S.\n19th Feb 1917\nDunca & Son Co.\nDept General\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease send me as soon as possible forms of release, for quitting Indians School\u2014please send out\u2014\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nAnnie H.

He taught up to, and including the 16th inst., when he resigned as teacher, and I at once appointed Mrs. MacNeil to succeed him, according to your instructions. She began teaching last Monday, 19th inst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

Richardson, as teacher Indian day school, I beg to say, that in accordance with instructions from Mr. A.J. Boyd, I came here from Malagawatch School on the 16th Feb., and took charge on February 19th. (Nineteenth) at Whyconong.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nMrs. Harris MacNeil.\nWhycocomagh\nInverness Co., N.B.\n\nDear Mr. Boyd,\n\nThis is certainly some place\u2014a fine spot to live. If I remain here much longer, I will be a fit subject for an insane house.\n\nI would like to return to Halifax next fall. Do you think it possible to secure a teacher for the school by then?\n\nIf the school at Supt. Cove is vacant, I would like to assume teaching there. But if this cannot be arranged, it will be perfectly O.K.\n\nI would like very much to be able to remain here but, contrary to Boyd, I could never content myself in a place like this.\nI have registered twenty pupils, and considering all things they are doing very well.\n\nIf Mrs. McNeil be appointed a teacher here I think it would be a good idea if she would come before I take my departure. This would save another interruption in the school work.\n\nI am very sorry to have to give the school up. But I think you understand yourself that Whycoomagh is not the place for a person like me.\n\nWill you let me know if Mrs. McNeil shall come before I leave?\n\nTruly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFeb 8-17.\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.,\nFeb. 24th., 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nReferring to the subject of your letter of the 20th. inst., just to hand, I beg to inform you that I wrote the Department yesterday as follows:-\n\n\"With further reference to your letter of the 20th. ultimo, I beg to advise you that Mr. Richardson opened school at Whycocomagh on the 1st. inst., as intimated in my letter to the Department dated Jan. 29th.

The teacher has applied for these articles in her \"Return.\" She is very much inconvenience for want of a school register in particular.\n\nIt is my duty to bring to your Dept's attention the fact that the present teacher of the Wyecongah school has been unable to carry said at the rate of $450.00 per annum; while her predecessor was paid $600.00. He claimed he could not make a living at this salary, and had to give up the school. This was the case a little. Everything in the line of necessaries of life is now nearly doubled in price. Mr. McNeil has repeatedly asked me to bring this to your attention, and I submit that it should be only just to pay her the same salary as her predecessor namely $550.00 per annum.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\nOttawa, October 12, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing the September quarter return of the Whyccomagh Indian Day School, together with a requisition for school material and applying for an increase of salary for Mrs. Annie MacNeil, the teacher.\n\nWith reference to the request that Mrs. MacNeil receive an increase in salary, I beg to say that the Department is unable to grant this request at the present time, as, owing to the war, the funds at its disposal are limited. Her salary at the present time is at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYou will be further advised regarding the school material required for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Whyecocomagh Indian School.\n\nMrs. McNeil, teacher at above school, receives a salary of only $400. This is very small considering the high cost of living nowadays. Besides, I understand that the teacher at Nyanza gets $500. I do not mean to say that he gets too much\u2014far from it\u2014but the work at Whyecocomagh is considerably heavier than at Nyanza and it would seem only fair that the teacher should receive at least as much salary as is paid at Nyanza. I would respectfully suggest that this matter be inquired into and adjusted.\n\nTrusting that this may meet with your favourable consideration,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Department of Indian Affairs]\nOttawa, Dec. 21, 1918\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application made by Mr. Gallant, Barrister, of Inverness, N.S., for an increase in the salary of Mrs. McNeil, teacher of the Indian school on the Whycocomagh Reserve, I beg to say that Mrs. McNeil has only been in charge of this school since February 19, 1917, at a salary of $400.00. Previous to that time, for two years, she had been teaching the school at Malagawatch, which was only open for the winter months, at a salary of $30.00 a month.\n\nThere are twelve Indian schools in the province of Nova Scotia and the teachers of nine of these schools are paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum, one is paid $450.00 and the other two are in receipt of $500.00, Middle River (Nyanza) being one of these. These salaries compare favourably with those paid at the provincial rural schools and I do not see how we could increase Mrs. McNeil's salary without an all round increase to the other schools there.\n\nIn October, last, Mrs. McNeil made a similar application.\napplication through the Acting Indian Agent, who was informed that the Department was unable to grant the request then, as, owing to the war, the funds at its disposal are limited.\n\n[Signature]\nMr. Buxton\n\nHow do teachers qualification,\nAnd attendance does improve\nUpon compare at\nWynocumask & Middleburg\nA.M.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn further reference to my memorandum of the 22nd instant regarding the application for an increase in the salary of Mrs. McNeil, teacher of the Indian school on the Whycocomagh Reserve, I beg to say that the enrolment and attendance at Whycocomagh and Middle River are about the same. Last quarter there were 23 enrolled at Whycocomagh with an average of 11 and 22 at Middle River with a similar average.\n\nIf anything Mrs. McNeils' qualifications are better than those of the teacher at Middle River, as she is the holder of a Grade \"C\" Certificate, and Mr. MacRae, the teacher at Middle River, is a B. A. and holds a Grade \"D\" Certificate.\n\nI may add that Mr. Gillis, who previously taught the Whycocomagh School was paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nThere have been no inspector's reports on this school since Mrs. McNeil took charge and, when the Inspector's attention\nAttention was called to his omission, he stated that he would visit both this and the Middle River School as soon as the weather conditions and the roads would permit.\n\n[Signature]\nMarch 25th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Gallant -\n\nI have your letter of the 15th inst., in which you ask for an increase in salary to Mrs. McNeil, teacher of the Whyceesnagh Indian School. I am informed that we have had no report on this school since Mrs. McNeil took charge. The Public School Inspector has promised to inspect and report at an early date. When this report is received, I shall give consideration to the question of giving Mrs. McNeil an increase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThomas Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nOttawa, March 28, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 11th instant, in which you stated that you would visit the Whycoconagh and Middle River Indian Day Schools as soon as weather conditions and roads permit, I beg to say that the Department would like you to inspect these two schools as soon as convenient.

She gives the following reasons:\n\n1. That the Government recently gave the Indian Doctor, H. M. D. Dunfield a horse and he would connect them directly to the Doctor.\n\n2. That the Indian teacher at Nyanza Victoria Co., has the Driftwood Conference.\n\n3.

Original on 103167-6\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI regret to have to say that the progress and general conditions in this school are far from satisfactory. The attendance is poor, the discipline weak and the hygienic conditions not up to the standard required. The unsatisfactory attendance and discipline are due chiefly to a lack of interest in education on the part of the parents and the failure of the truant officer to do his duty. There can be no progress without fairly good attendance and proper discipline. Although there has been school here continuously for many years, I am not aware that there is a single Indian on the reserve capable of writing a letter in fairly correct English or who is able to carry on a conversation on ordinary topics in passably good English. There surely must be something wrong with the administration of the Indian schools when conditions such as those described above persist. It appears to me that the matter of the education of the Indians has not yet been taken very seriously by anybody.\n\nI would recommend that the truant officer and all others concerned with the educational administration be spurred on a little.\n\nSgd. James MacKinnen,\nInspector\nOttawa, November 15, 1919.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector MacKinnon's report on the Whyosecomagh Indian Day School and regrets to say that the progress and general conditions at this school are far from satisfactory. The attendance is poor, discipline weak and the hygienic conditions not up to the standard required.\n\nThe Department understands that Gabriel Syllieboy is truant officer for this reserve. You should immediately instruct him to take steps to increase the attendance at this school and also to see that the attendance is regular in future. The Department will be pleased to have a report from you in regard to general conditions at this school and you might state whether you consider it would be advisable to have a change in the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. John McLennan,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGlendale,\nN. S.\nDear Sir,\n\nI undertake to make complaint of our school mistress Mrs. A.

So that all the other Indians are anxious to have the school mistress charged.

He states that the children are making no progress and that she does not exercise any discipline or control over them.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of November 15, 1919, regarding the report of the school inspector. At that time you were asked to report as to the general conditions at this school and also whether you considered it would be advisable to make a change in the teacher. I may say that Mr. Inspector MacKinnon is being requested to visit this school at his early convenience and make a thorough inspection of the work being performed by the teacher.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a report at once regarding school matters at Whycoocmagh and whether you consider that Mrs. McNeil is performing her duties satisfactorily or whether you would recommend that her services be dispensed with and that another teacher be secured. Kindly give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

Genl., Indian Dept.,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for the report received today, but it is not the one I wanted, but the report of the Superintendent of Indian Education for the years 1919-1930. I will explain my reason for writing hurriedly for the same.\n\nI find since the last quarter here my school not as progressive as it ought to be and by seeing the reports of other schools, matters might be remedied. As you know, I have been in the service since 1908, at Nepisig - Malagawatcha here. I have a young son of 13 years, that I am trying to send to school. May I add that he expects the Indian League\nfluently. Would you please see if you can do something for me? Find me something to do in the Service elsewhere or in some other Dept.\n\nI have not sent in any resignation to the Agent, or Mr. Boyd yet but am going to, and would like that you will consider the matter and see that I may find something to do\u2014since the new Chief, Spillacy has been appointed. Matters are not so progressing as under the old Chief\u2014the present situation is alarming and her mischievous ways be the cause of this. We be glad to have a reply & then\u2014also the report of the Dept. of Indian Education for the Years 1919-1920 as stated. Long to remain.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMrs. Anna J. MacNeil\nOttawa, December 2, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Superintendent of Indian Education has not published any report during the past few years. Owing to the expenditure involved, it was found necessary to curtail the Department's annual reports. The only report now published is the one sent you and, if you will refer to page 32 of Part I and to pages 80 to 95 of Part II, you will find all the information published regarding Indian schools.\n\nAs all appointments to the civil service are now made by the Civil Service Commission, it will not be possible for this Department to assist you in obtaining employment in one of the departments. If you desire a position in the service you should apply to The Secretary, Civil Service Commission, Ottawa, for information regarding appointments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Annie J. McNeil,\nWhyccomagh,\nCape Breton Co., N.S.\nOwing to the small attendance for the first quarter, I hereby tender my resignation as Teacher, Whyoomagah Indian Day School, to take effect the end of this quarter, Dec. 31st, 1920.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 2nd ult., I have to say that the teacher of the Indain Day School at Whyconagh C.B. has resigned which resignation I endorse. The same to be effective at the end of the present quarter.\n\nA female teacher is not suitable for Whyconagh Reserve, because by lack discipline. A married man would suit better there than any.\n\nI may say that there are now about twelve children of school age at Malagawatch where there is a fine School-house. This school should be opened and the term to close about the 15th of May when the parents generally leave to work elsewhere. In case it should be opened, this Mrs. McNeil Teacher gave satisfaction there before, as the children are small and in elementary work.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nOttawa, December 7, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant enclosing the resignation of Mrs. Annie J. MacNeil, teacher of the Whyccocomagh Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the resignation of Mrs. MacNeil is accepted.\n\nYou should endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher to succeed her, to begin duties when the schools re-open after the Christmas holidays. It might be well to consult the Public School Inspector for the district, who may be able to recommend a suitable teacher for the position, and you should also institute inquiries with a view to obtaining the services of a teacher. For a properly qualified teacher the Department would be disposed to allow a higher salary than was paid Mrs. MacNeil. Any applications received by you for the position should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department and full particulars should be given regarding the qualifications and experience which the applicant possesses. You should give this matter your prompt attention, in order that, if possible, the services of a teacher can be secured in time to re-open the school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nWith reference to your request that the school at Malagawatch be re-opened during the winter months I beg to say that this matter is receiving consideration and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

I think there must be something radically wrong with the administration of the Indian schools when conditions such as those described above persist; It would appear that the matter of the education of the Indians has not yet been taken very seriously by anybody. I would recommend that the truant officer and all others concerned with the educational administration be \"spurred on\" a little.\n\nJas. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, January 3, 1921.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Public School Inspector MacKinnon, in a report on his recent inspection of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School, states that the progress made and the general conditions found in this school were far from satisfactory; the attendance was poor and the discipline weak and the hygienic conditions not up to the standard required. The unsatisfactory attendance and the discipline are due chiefly to the failure of the truant officer to do his duty and a lack of interest in education on the part of the parents. The Inspector states that, although there has been a school here continuously for many years, he is not aware that there is a single Indian on the reserve capable of writing a letter in fairly correct English, or who is able to carry on a conversation of any kind in passably good English.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that it is hoped that, when a new teacher is secured for this school, there will be a decided improvement as regards the discipline, attendance and progress in the class-room. You should inform the truant officer that, when the school re-opens, it is expected that he will perform his duties faithfully and see that all the Indian children attend regularly. If he neglects to attend to his duties you should endeavour to secure the services of a competent person to do this work and the services of the present truant officer should be dispensed with. It is hoped that you will soon be able to nominate a teacher for this school to succeed Mrs. Annie J. MacNeil, and it is hoped that, with a new teacher and the truant officer performing his duties, there will be a decided improvement in the educational work on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Scott, Esq.,\nPost Dept., Indian Dept.,\nElliston Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg the liberty of writing you personally, etc. I take my leave of here, and explain to you myself in my resignation etc.\n\nAbout the first of November an Indian, Mr. Scott's officer here, Levi Prolet, came to the teacher's house, where my little boy & myself have been living, since coming here, or rather since Mrs. Gillis took up my residence here. She having occupied the house, when I came to teach in February, of course her very small children did not come until May. Anyway, Prolet had been away on his duties as Indian Officer, since some weeks previous\u2014anyway, I asked a drop in the\nattention \u2014 but I never at first wished until this day, why? I replied to Poveshell why do you want me to leave, will he did the Chief desire you to resign, who else, he said Mr Boyd. I said well Mr Boyd & Sackett were both here lately, why did they not tell me, if I have done anything wrong, or any way why do you ask me to resign \u2014 anyway, but myself little by little took this to heart, after getting ready for the winter, raising out hay for a cow & house in town. I called up Rev J.M. McL and him, told him to be civil keep on with your work. This I did, when again, I had a letter saying that complaints had come in to Bishop that I had better resign, well, of course, I sat down wrote my resignation, at the same time said I think it unfair to ask my resignation without determining the charges or the charges name. A reply came saying the charges are, disobedience, no progress or attention poor. I replied, I deny all the charges except the attention. Which was good up to the first of Oct. I do not think I am responsible for the same \u2014\nThe Inspector of Schools visited my school on Thursday the 16th Dec. I had 15 children present, only five children not enrolled, the Indians he said afford no other Indian Schools. McRee at Myanga he said, had only 5 children present the day he visited but, had an average of 12. I need to have an average of 16. 17-18 other quarters I had but 9.7. But it was through no fault of mine.\n\nNow, will you please see that I have the names of the Charges, I put about 4 tons of hay in the barn here for my own use, I will have to sell, any cow or horse or more anything at this time of year, I say. I would have been grateful to either the Capt or Capt. if they had notified me of any complaints & then regarding my school. Seriously.\n\nNow, I shall give you a few facts regarding Tobacco smoke, the men etc. They are a lazy crowd, the Capt of the band was digging his potatoes on the 14th Nov in a snowstorm, the Chief is even worse. They let their hay up on the meadow, what the cattle from town.\nDo not destroy\u2014of course one or two try to\nmake their hay\u2014the majority do not.\nThey then call on the Dept & say their\ncattle are starving\u2014and unfortunately\nthe Dept will furnish the hay\u2014instead\nof making them look after their hay at\nthe proper time\u2014to keep cattle from feeding\non their hay land\u2014now here is an\nexample\u2014I got a field to care for from\nan Indian named Peter Isaac\u2014& obtained\nmore difficulty in keeping the same than\nyou can understand\u2014why? well\u2014\njust this, some of them were jealous that\nI was keeping up the fence for the poor\nIndian\u2014who was obliged to leave\nhis house & the place\u2014in fact if\nhis neighbors\u2014when I got up one\nday\u2014the hay was drying after\ncutting\u2014I found the fence down\u2014the\ncattle in on the hay eating away\u2014\nI called to come Indians who were\nplaying\u2014gambling on the school\ngrounds\u2014to please put out the cattle.\nI called the Capt & said to put up the\nfence\u2014he consented\u2014tomorrow they\nTo-day I said, the hay will be all gone by tomorrow, one poor fellow went over to fix it, only to be rebuked for doing so. Said I must save the hay. Now, is it any wonder that the white man is getting tired of such work? I merely want to say that if a person tries to do right here he is no good. Gambling on the main road & in the school lot was carried on all last summer.\n\nIt would be a good thing to investigate conditions. I am living here, and know better than either Agent or Supt., they only see the thing in its better form, while I see it in every form. The Malagawatch & Middle River, were a different class altogether. These Indians were raised by Dr. Gillin, who it appears was allowed to help them. April 6th, we knew, if his authority was as little as mine, Demond scarcely with a letter for me, then, without being asked by me, yet for no doing...\nOn Sunday, I said the hay will be all destroyed by then, one poor fellow went to try fit the fence, only to be about by the rent. There is a house near the school, which the last closed year ago, owing to the unusual climate of the winter, this year it is still again, but the husband is not there\u2014has not come back. The guest conduct here is low, debauchery, etc., and I do not make any false statements. There is about seven tons of coal, in the coal house, they opened the school for their Christmas prayer meeting, all the boys have a church\u2014the school room is in a deplorable condition, so they are to have a priest. Even so when they do, they become the class in order to dance, and then how our school store was broken. The Chief demanded the school building free for his daughter's wedding. Need no authority to give it them, as he has not been from the visit the owner.\nOttawa, January 4, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to your resignation as teacher of the Whyccocomagh Indian Day School.\n\nIn connection with this matter I beg to say that the Public School Inspector, in reports on his inspections, stated that the progress made and the general conditions found in the school were far from satisfactory.\n\nThe Department, in view of the expense you were under in providing feed for your horse and cows will consent to your remaining as teacher until such time as the services of a qualified teacher can be secured. Mr. Agent McLennan is being informed accordingly and instructed that, should you decide to remain on the above conditions, you may do so.\n\nThe Department does not hold you responsible for the unsatisfactory attendance, which is due chiefly to the failure of the truant officer to do his duty and a lack of interest in education on the part of the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She has, therefore, been informed that, should she decide to remain until you have been able to secure a suitable teacher to succeed her, she may do so. If she agrees to this arrangement she may remain as teacher until a successor is appointed. In the meantime, however, you should not lose sight of the engaging of a suitable teacher for the position, as instructed by official letter of December 7th, last.

There was only 3 children that had signed papers for their release to go. I went to Maton for Halloween last day of All Saints coming in succession or I walked to a small store in Maton who closed at 5 pm. We looked after fearing for their safety so we might be delayed. The rain continued all night. I asked him if I could get the children for the 6 p.m. and I returned. He said you need not that p.m., same returning late and will then examine the school.

There is very little work to want of a little more work to do, along the garbage inside the meme is painted, the school room is being used, we want a teacher next year. I stated before that the houses are in order and the more good things.\nI was broken before last year when they had a firework. Now they have removed the store, and an old kitchen stove in the school house that they used for cooking for the school. I must find work for cooking for the school, I must find the master to clean up at once or replace store he has not yet done so, and I am ready to begin work, owing to the cold weather. So hard to be unemployed, when there are two children, boys of 13 & 15 years, to support you can understand how that I am anxious to continue, even under such adverse circumstances, and am grateful to you for consideration, may God that I would be glad that I could be kept in the service until my boys could work, or could teach.

Christie to succeed Mrs. Amos & Mr. Neil, resigned, as teacher for the Anishin Day School in the Whyeconagh reserve. He is a Second Class teacher - Grade X - and has about twenty-five years experience as a teacher. I consider it a mistake to appoint a female teacher for this school. He farms, and should therefore be capable to direct the Indians of Whyeconagh in this work.\n\nHe is earning at the rate of $50.00 per annum. I may say that teachers' salaries have been largely trebled in this province within the past four years. Qualified teachers are difficult to secure at this season of the year, as they are engaged in the months of July and August for the full term of nine months.\n\nI am -\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

Chisholm as teacher of the Whyccomagh Indian Day School, to succeed Mrs. Annie J. McNeil, and stating the qualifications he possesses and the amount of salary he requires.\n\nIn reply I beg to say with reference to the salary, that, while the Department is prepared to pay an increase over that allowed previous teachers, it cannot pay the teacher of this school a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, as asked for by Mr. Chisholm. I would point out that there is a teacher's residence in connection with this school, and the outside amount that could be allowed for salary for a qualified teacher would be $600.00 per annum. You should inform Mr. Chisholm accordingly and, if he is willing to accept this offer, consideration will be given to his appointment. In the meantime Mrs. McNeil may continue as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. McLennan,\nIndian Agent,\nGlenisle, N.S.\nOttawa, February 26, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will visit the Whyccomagh Reserve at as early a date as your other duties will permit and inquire fully into educational matters there and report to the Department.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his visit of inspection in December, last, states as follows: \"I regret to have to say that the progress made and the general conditions found in this school were far from satisfactory. The attendance is poor, the discipline weak and the hygienic conditions not up to the standard required. The unsatisfactory attendance and the discipline are due chiefly to the failure of the truant officer to do his duty and a lack of interest in education on the part of the parents. There can be no progress without proper discipline and fairly good attendance. Although there has been school here continuously for many years, I am not aware that there is a single Indian on the reserve capable of writing a letter in fairly correct English, or who is able to carry on a conversation of any kind in passably good English. I think there must be something radically wrong with the administration of the Indian schools when conditions such as those described above persist. It would appear that the matter of the education of the Indians has not yet been taken very seriously by anybody. I would recommend that the truant officer and all others concerned with the educational administration be 'spurred on' a little.\"\n\nIn November, last, Mr. Agent McLennan, forwarded the resignation of Mrs. McNeil, the teacher, which she later withdrew in a personal letter to the Department, and she has been allowed to remain temporarily in charge until a suitable teacher to succeed her can be secured, and the Agent was informed accordingly.\n\nThe Department is advised that Mrs. McNeil receives no support in her work and that the truant officer neglects his duties and that the Indian parents are indifferent regarding education. It would appear that she is competent to teach the school and that the lack of success is due to causes outside her control. The janitor's duties are also not properly attended to, and the Department understands that there has been no proper heating facilities in the school, as the Indians removed the stove for the purpose of holding a dance and returned another stove in place of the one which they removed. The teacher has recently complained of the condition of the stove and in this regard you were written to on the 22nd instant.\n\nThe conditions on this reserve as regards educational matters, as reported by the Public School Inspector, are most unsatisfactory, and, at the time of your visit, you should inquire fully into all the conditions and complaints. You should also closely inquire into the duties performed by the truant officer and the janitor and, if they are not satisfactory, both should be discharged and competent persons engaged to replace them. You should instruct the Indian parents that it is expected that they will see that their children attend regularly, and in addition\n\nA. J. Ross, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nthat the school building is not to be used for other than school purposes and for religious instruction, if required.\n\nA full report from you regarding the conditions at this school and the work being performed by the teacher, truant officer and janitor, as well as any recommendations you desire to make in order to improve conditions, will be waited after your visit, which you should arrange to make to this reserve as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you were already acquainted with this, there was a long delay in getting school house stove up & repaired after the Easter vacation. When you notified me to go back to work, I found it difficult to get started, owing to the conditions already stated. Yet, however, I began work when Mr. Boyd requested Mr. McDonald to order a new stove for him. Mr. McDonald sent a messenger for his old stove name & manufacturer's name, & asked me to return the same & lend by same messenger. This I did, after a few days this same stove arrived. The Mr. Donald sent a handy man over to put it up \u2014 the man failed to do so, owing to the upper part having expanded, as the heated letter will show. I might have purchased the letter for the old stove from Mr. D., but did not think I would need it, nor desired to nothing but await stove repair & yet, the agent who was here in May, etc., blamed me for stove, etc., I am willing to give\naffair before a Jt. to this effect. I did not have\nthe C. opinion of Oct 7 Sept. as urged, and am\nnow, or may be soon, and drawing from this school. Why\nyou will not justice done me, in regard to my wages, and\nneed my money to pay bills here.\n\nThe Department of Education wrote me under date of March 2\nafter I had written Premier Murray of Nova Scotia that he\nthe Department reported falsely & they should have\nnot you the gratification from this letter, we could do nothing\nnot act to my report on your School district do nothing\nbetter than allow you to get a copy of it and see for yourself\nwhat I say \u2014 after you have read the full report I shall be\nwilling to discuss it with you. I may say however, that I\nfirmly believe that any report that was made & do with you\ndocument. It may have served the purpose of an excuse\nfor releasing you of your duties by some one who wanted to\nget you out of the way \u2014 in other words, they made me the fall\nI may say that my last report was very little different.\n\nFor the reports I have been sending in for a number of\nyears \u2014 even before you ever came here, and almost identical\nwith reports that I made on other Indian schools where\napparently there is no thought of disturbing the teacher \u2014 if\nreported against anyone, it was against officials before, and\nnot the Department itself, for not adopting a system\nthat would give the teacher a chance.\n\nThis explains all \u2014 I am writing, after about 13 years\nexperience without any hostile ruler yet. The Chief, who\none of the children, those who were attending to play at home,\nand the others are afraid of him, for he has been seen in anger\nmany regards. The whole situation is anything, with an addition\ntherein you can read between the lines. We\nare unable to secure one letter or store from the Indians.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs. Anne McNeil.\nFeb. 21/21\n\nMrs A.J. Macmillan,\n\nDear Madam:\n\nOwing to Mr Boyd's absence in Western U.S., I was not able to order store supplies. I asked Father Maclean for permission, but he did not wish to interfere as Mr Boyd had given the first order.\n\nMr Boyd phoned me yesterday to order a new stove. This should arrive within a week.\n\nThe letter for D.D. Maclean is here. I am returning the 3\u00a2 by mail.\n\nYours truly,\nJ.H. Macdonald\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to report that I visited the Indian Day School at Whycocomagh Reserve on the 17th instant and found the teacher, Mrs. Annie McNeil, present, but no pupils in attendance - not one.\n\nThe school room was in excellent condition, being comfortably warm, with good ventilation, and clean as the proverbial new pin. It was quite evident that the janitor, Stephen Christmas, must be doing his duties effectively, as the teacher admitted.\n\nI asked Mrs. McNeil if there was any special reason for the non-attendance of pupils on that favourable occasion - the weather being very fine - and she informed me that there was none which did not apply every day for some time past, namely, the refusal of the Indians to send their children to school for the purpose of discrediting the value of her services, with a view to her dismissal. She did not think that their attitude was at all justified, as she had always endeavoured to conscientiously discharge her duties as teacher.\n\nI then interviewed some of the principal men of the Whycocomagh band about the situation, and they stated by way of complaint that they had several good reasons for keeping their children out of school, namely:\n\n1. The teacher had developed an untidiness in her personal appearance, due to negligence of attire, which they considered objectionable, as giving children a poor example of cleanliness and neatness in dress - qualities that are expected to be cultivated and improved in school under the teacher's care and direction.\n\n2. The teacher had been in the habit of insulting their children in school by actions of a grossly indecent character.\n\n3. The teacher had otherwise acted improperly in the presence of her pupils, which was a cause of scandal to them.\n\nWith regard to the first statement, I regret to say that my personal observations rather tend to corroborate it; as to the others, I submit that the only way to determine whether there is any truth in them or not is by making formal inquiry under oath into the situation. But, at any rate, there is no doubt in my mind that Mrs. McNeil has outlived her usefulness as teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 1, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo furnishing a report, as requested, regarding educational matters on the Whycocomagh Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the Indian parents refuse to send their children to school under the charge of the present teacher and also in view of the other reasons stated by you, the Department agrees with you that Mrs. McNeil has outlived her usefulness as teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian Bay School.\n\nIn a recent letter received from her she states that, owing to not having received the support which she thought she was entitled to from the Agent and yourself, she was withdrawing from this school, and it may be that she vacated the position at the end of the March quarter. If not, you may inform her that her services are no longer required, and, if it is impossible to obtain another teacher, the school will have to remain closed for the present. Mrs. McNeil should prepare and forward a return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., covering the period up to the time when she leaves the work, in order that payment of the salary due her can be made.\n\nYou might take this matter up with Mr. Agent McLennan with a view to obtaining the services of another teacher, and the Department will be pleased to be informed as to the date on which Mrs. McNeil gives up her duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Inspector was requested to take this matter up with you with a view to obtaining the services of another teacher.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of January 19th, last, the outside amount that can be allowed for salary for a qualified teacher will be $600.00 per annum. It is hoped that you will be able to nominate a teacher for this school at an early date, and the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.

You were paid for 21 days in the September quarter, or, 21/200 of your yearly salary of $500.00.\n\nUpon the receipt of a return, you will be paid for the number of days you teach during the present month. The salary of a teacher in the day schools is only paid by quarterly instalments in the case where the teacher remains during the full school year, namely, from September to the end of the following June.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nJohn A. Gillis,\nTeacher,\nWhycocomagh Indian School\nWhycocomagh, C. B.\nN. S.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst. No. 108167-3 with reference to the amount of salary paid me for the quarter ending September 30th last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I am still of the opinion that I am entitled to the balance unpaid for the following reasons\u2014Preparations for duty at the school here on Monday Oct. 4th 1910, Mr. Sept. Boyd was here at the time; and as the school building was in the hands of the Indians, and capable for repair, I could not open for teaching until the month of October. I have paid my first quarterly instalment in January 1910, receiving $427.50 being at the rate of $250.00 for the school year. I received three increases in salary, the last at the rate of $500.00 for the second year which was the June quarter in 1911. By the above you can readily see, that I completed seven years continuous service at the end of the September quarter of this year.\n\nThe amount of salary received by me for the school year was as follows: March quarter 1910, $125.00; March quarter 1911, $125.00; June quarter 1910, $125.00; September quarter 1910, $500.00; Total $427.50 leaving a balance unpaid of $72.50, which I think you will find, in view of the length of service from the beginning.\n\nI do not wish to make a claim that I do not think that I am fairly entitled to, but I feel from the explanation I have given that you will take into consideration the position I have, having the school here hundreds of dollars more of them when done, and a good deal of it private means that I had to call on from time to time, to help out until such a point in the benefit of the Indians as all the separate people who occupy the same and will kindly be called upon for the information.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Dept. & Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Canada\nOttawa, November 7, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo, in further reference to the amount of salary paid for the period you taught the Whyocomagh Day School, during the quarter ended September 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as already informed, you have been paid the full amount due for your services to that date.\n\nEach school year begins at the ending of the summer holidays - usually during the first week in September and terminates on June 30th, in the following year and comprises 200 teaching days.\n\nYou began duties at this school October 4, 1909, at a salary of $350.00 per annum. You were paid three quarterly instalments of $87.50 each, to June 30, 1910, the end of the first year you taught in this school. Since that time, to June 30, 1916, a period of six years, you received six full years salary. You began the present school year after the summer holidays and taught 21 days in the September quarter, for which you received 21/200 of your yearly salary of $500.00. You resigned as teacher of this school, to take effect the 31st of October, and upon receipt of a return, showing the number of days taught during the past month, you will be\n\nJohn Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhyocomagh Indian School\nWhyocomagh, C. B.\nN. S.\npaid the amount due.\n\nYour successor has been appointed to begin duties as soon as you leave, and, if he teaches the remainder of the school year till June 30, 1917, the balance of the amount provided by parliamentary appropriation for the salary of the teacher at this school will be required to pay for such services.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary\nSir, I beg to bring before you what I consider to be unfair treatment by the department. I was appointed teacher of the Mo-Mac School at Whyecoomagh N.S., in September 1909, my duties to begin Oct. 1st of that year at a salary of $350.00 per annum. I reported for duty on Monday Oct. 4th, found the school building in the hands of the carpenters and painters, for repairs and school did not open until Oct. 11th. The 18th day of January 1910 I received a cheque from the department for my first quarterly salary, for the sum of $62.50. My letter of appointment did not specify as to the number of teaching days in the school year nor the number of hours to be taught each day. I enquired of Mr. Capt. Boyd, and Rev. Agent Mr. Pearson and they both informed me that in the absence of regulations I was to follow the usage in the public schools, which I did. I received two increases in salary, and in 1911 I was granted the maximum amount namely $500.00 beginning with the April quarter of that year. In July 1911 I was paid $125.00. The school closed for the summer holidays July 12th and opened September 1st. On the close of the July quarter, namely Sept. 30th, I sent in my report and in Oct. I received my quarter by cheque $125.00. This continued up to September of the present year. I made my report as usual and also sent my resignation to the department the same to take effect Oct. 3rd. About the 18th of Oct. I received a cheque for $52.50, I did not think anything about it as I felt it was a mistake so I wrote\nThe Salary etc.\n\nI wrote making inquiries. I received a reply from Mr. Stewart paying that inasmuch as I had resigned, I was only entitled to pay rent for the twenty-one days taught in September and rent for the July quarter as heretofore, that the school year closed with the beginning of the July quarter, that the school year was two hundred days which would make my salary at the rate of $2.50 per day, I wrote a reply stating that I had always understood that my salary was for the school year not a daily wage, and that since such as my services began in Oct. 1911 that I had completed seven years continuous service in Oct. 1916, and that therefore I was entitled to seven years salary. I never had any intimation heretofore that I was to be paid by the day I had always received the full amount of salary at the end of each quarter, and could not understand why an exception should be made. I received another reply from Mr. Stewart and from what I could glean from it his contention was that I was paid six years salary up to the July quarter of this year and that if I was paid a full there would not be any money left to pay any successor. Despairing of getting a satisfactory explanation or a settlement I turned the matter over to Mr. MacKenzie Esq., and he advised me to lay the matter before you personally and that he was writing you in the meantime.\n\nI am yet convinced that the sum of $72.50 due me for the July quarter of 1916, as I had always received the full amount heretofore. I acted on the square with the department.\nRe: Salary\n\ndepartment Square due notice of any intention to resign. I could have waited until I received my salary and could then walk out with let or hindrance, this I would not do so now. I am taking the liberty of placing my case in your hands and I am credibly informed that your sense of fairness will see the justice of my contention.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Millis\n434 George St.,\nSydney, N.S.\n\nA. Macdonald Scott Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nOttawa, Dec 30 1914\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the letter from Mr. J. A. Gillis, late teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian School, in regard to a balance of salary claimed by him for the September quarter last, I beg to say that, as Mr. Gillis has already been informed, he was paid for the actual time he taught during that quarter. The Indian day school regulations provide as follows:\n\n\"In computing salaries for broken periods, teachers will be paid in the proportion that the number of days they taught bears to the total number of teaching days in the year.\n\nSalaries of teachers will be payable quarterly upon receipt of returns; but where a teacher is engaged to take charge of a school, duties to commence after the summer holidays, payment for the September quarter will be made as provided for in the case of broken periods in the previous paragraphs; and at the end of the year, or when services expire if before the end of a year, the necessary adjustment...\"\nadjustment will be made and all arrears, if any paid.\n\nAll teachers will be required to give at least one month's notice of their intention to resign.\"\n\nWhen sending in his return for the September quarter, 1916, Mr. Gillis notified the Department of his intended resignation on the 31st proximo and upon receipt of a return showing the number of days he taught during the month of October a cheque will be sent for the amount due him.\n\nThere were 21 teaching days in that month and if he taught that number he is entitled to receive $52.50. This added to the amount he has already received would make $105.00, which would leave out of the $500.00 provided for the salary of the teacher of this school, $395.00. There would still be 158 teaching days in the year and it would take exactly this balance to pay his successor's salary for the balance of the year. If Mr. Gillis is paid anything more than he is entitled to it would make a shortage in the appropriation for this school.\n\nMr. Gillis is, however, correct in his statement that had he not given notice when sending in his September\nhe September quarter return him would have received his full quarter's salary, as he was an old teacher.\n\nAs no one has yet succeeded him, it is a question for the Department to decide whether they will allow Mr. Gillis anything further. He has had charge of this school for seven years and from reports received gave satisfaction.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nMr. Scott is of opinion that we ought as a retiring solicitor allow Mr. Gillis the full salary for the third quarter. It should be pointed out that this is a matter of grace.\n\n[Signature]\nProvince of Nova Scotia\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFor Quarter ended Sep. 30th 1916.\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| John A.

The bonus cheque (No. 2351) Oct. 8th is in fifteen dollars. Now I taught twenty-one days and there was a public holiday, Sept. 5th Labor Day, besides making twenty-two days. Taking this rate I find that it takes twenty-two days to make up $150.00 the total bonus. I may be wrong but I thought the total was the authorized teaching days in the\nSchool year was 200 days\nThe salary cheque was No. 1701\nof same date is $52.50\nTaking 200 days as the full term\nbonus for 23 days should be $6.50\nnot $4.50; and the salary cheque\nshould be $55.00 not $52.50\n\nSo you see that if I am\nright in taking 200 days\nas the full term, I am short\nbetween the two cheques, $4.00\nthat is if I am entitled to pay\nfor the holiday.\n\nPlease write soon and\nexplain how the cheque figures have\nbeen found.\n\nYours very respectfully,\nAngus W. Macdonald\nTeacher\nOTTAWA, October 19th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the salary and bonus paid you for the September quarter, last, as teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you taught 21 days in that quarter, for which you were paid 21/200ths of your yearly salary of $500, or $52.50. You also received the bonus for one month. The bonus to teachers of Indian Day Schools, amounting to $150 per annum for the present fiscal year ending March 31st, next, is paid on a monthly basis for the ten teaching months, or $15.00 per month. A teacher, in order to draw the full yearly salary, is required to teach 200 days, and if you remain and teach this number of days to June 30th, next, the end of the school year, you will receive your full yearly salary.\n\nA copy of the Indian Day School Regulations is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

W. Chisholm, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. W. Chisholm,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 26th July, 1911.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find copies of correspondence with regard to a claim made by Mr. Alex. Chisholm, who was contractor for the erection of the day school building on the Whycoomagh Reserve. Mr. Chisholm made a claim for extras which has never been allowed by the Department. A perusal of the enclosed correspondence and memoranda, which are, of course, for your own information alone, will place you in possession of the facts. Unfortunately it is not possible to send you a copy of the specifications of this building, but it is thought that they may be in the possession of the present Agent, Rev. D. McPherson. I have to request that at some convenient time, when visiting the Whycoomagh Reserve, you will take this matter up, investigate the claim, and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLain\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.J. Boyd Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bougnois, N.S.\nHouse of Commons\nOttawa July 29/11\n\nDear Mr. Wilson,\n\nSome days ago I had occasion to meet you & Mr. Scott\u2014a claim which Mr. Christie has against your Dept. for extra work done on a school he built at\u2014whereas originally you agreed to ask the Auditor Agent\u2014Mr. Angus Boyd of Ross Brougham to look into the claim & report to you. I find by letter received from Mr. Boyd that he has not been able to act in the matter. Would you then be requested him to take this up immediately & promptly advise.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.W. Christie\nOttawa, 1st August, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the claim for extras made by Mr. Alex. Chisholm who was contractor for the erection of the day school building on the Whyccomagh Reserve. The Department desires to amend the instructions therein contained to the effect that you will at once visit the Whyccomagh Reserve, take up this matter, investigate the claim and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, 1st August, 1911.\n\nDear Mr. Chisholm,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo relative to the claim for extras made by Mr. Alex. Chisholm who was contractor for the erection of the day school building on the Whyccomagh Reserve, and in reply to say that Supt. A. J. Boyd was written to on the 26th July in regard to this matter and requested when visiting the reserve to investigate this claim. In view of your request that he take the matter up immediately he is being again written to today and instructed to visit the reserve at once, investigate Mr. Chisholm's claim and report to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.W. Chisholm, Esq.,\nBelle Cote, N.S.\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT.\n\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S., 8th August, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 26th ultimo and the 1st inst., No. 103167-5A, I have to state that it is simply impossible for me to judge of the merits of Mr. Alex. Chisholm's claim for extras in connection with the construction of the school house at Whycecomagh Reserve, unless I can procure the plans and specifications on which the contract for the building was based. I am applying for these to Revd. D. McPherson, Glendale, N.S., the Indian Agent for that reserve, and if he can produce them, I will proceed at once to look into the matter and report the result of my investigation to you.\n\nBut in the absence of such plans and specifications, I fail to see how I can possibly determine whether Mr. Chisholm made a necessary expenditure for labour and material beyond what his contract called for, or whether he simply fulfilled its conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 1st inst., No. 103167-5A, I beg to report that I visited Whycecemagh, N.S., as soon after the receipt of your instructions as other official business engaging my attention at the time would permit; but in the absence of any plan or specifications, I could form no correct judgment of the merits of Mr. Chisholm's claim for extras.\n\nSince my return from Whycecemagh, I received the original specifications, but no plan, from the agent, Revd. D. McPherson, Glendale, N.S.; and with these before me, after a personal interview with Mr. Chisholm, which I propose having seen, I hope to be able to furnish the Department with reliable information regarding this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\nWith reference to the subject of your letter of the 26th July last, No.103167-5A, I beg to say that, until an opportunity should present itself for a personal interview with Mr. Alex. Chisholm, who was contractor for the erection of a school house on Whyccomagh Indian Reserve some ten years ago, it was not my intention to report with regard to his claims for extras. But having obtained from the present Agent, Revd. D. McPherson, the official specifications for the building, which I find considerably at variance with the views, implied or expressed, of Mr. Chisholm in the case, and having also looked into the matter while at Whyccomagh on a recent occasion, I desire now to state as follows:\n\n1.- At the date the building was erected, the cost of finishing the interior with wood such as Mr. Chisholm furnished, would be about the same as if finished with plaster.\n\n2 & 4.- The specifications do not mention particularly anything about paint; but they call for the erection of \"a good, plain, substantial building, complete in every respect\"; and, to my mind, a new building without paint would be very incomplete in one essential respect. Considering the conditions above quoted, I think it must have been well understood by Mr. Chisholm that painting the exterior of the building was part and parcel of his contract.\n\n3.- I could not discover whether galvanized nails were used or not. If they were, it would make a difference of about $3.00 in the cost of construction.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n5.- The double doors put in by the contractor were evidently of a cheap kind, but may have cost a couple of more dollars than if the two large single doors mentioned in the specifications had been furnished.\n\n6.- Since my appointment as superintendent, I had what must have been Mr. Chisholm's Belfry taken down and rebuilt at a cost of about $8.00. Therefore, I cannot see how he could claim $40 extra for the original article; because the specifications called for a belfry at any rate, and I should say one was provided, which was not an improvement on that described in the specifications.\n\n7.- If the cheque covering the final payment on Mr. Chisholm's contract was made payable to himself, I do not think he should look for anything more from the Department on that score. But if it was made payable to the late Agent, Father McIsaac, and he retained $20 of it until he should inspect the building, I think this claim is fairly defensible, and should be paid, providing Mr. Chisholm can satisfy the Department that he has never received the amount. I need not observe that Father McIsaac represented the Department, and any omission on his part cannot be chargeable to Mr. Chisholm.\n\nThe specifications called for plaster under the wainscoting. I do not think any was used, and that would be an advantage to the contractor.\n\nAgain, according to the specifications there were \"4 iron ventilators to be placed in the outer walls; 2 on each side of the building\". These ventilators seem to have been overlooked. There are none in the building; and this omission was also to the contractor's advantage.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Chisholm is entitled to nothing for extras.\nextras; but, as already stated, I think that possibly he has a right to the $20, which he claims as the unpaid balance of his contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nCLOSED\n\nPLEASE SEE\n\nVOL 2\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6051)\n\nFile 259-1, part 1\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - General Administration. 1899 - 1921\n\nFile 259-3, part 1\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - Teachers Salaries - 1912 - 1934, 1944 - 1946\n\nFile 259-5, part 1\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1910 - 1912\n\nFile 259-5, part 2\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1929 - 1935\n\nFile 259-5, part 3\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1936 - 1941\n\nFile 259-5, part 4\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1941, 1946 - 1948\n\nFile 259-8, part 1\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - Teachers' Residence - Establishment - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1911 - 1914\n\nFile 259-8, part 2\nInverness - Whycocomagh School - Teachers' Residence - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1940, 1945\n| Terms | Description                                      |\n|-------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1929  | Christmas treat for pupils & students             |\n|       | Reserve School                                   |\n| 100   | 15 lbs. 20 # candy                              |\n\nO.M.

He states that the roof requires certain repairs and the outside walls should be painted. He also recommends that the playground be plowed and levelled.\n\nI shall be pleased if, at your early convenience, you will forward a report regarding the Inspector's suggestions, stating what work, if any, you would recommend be carried out in placing the teacher's dwelling in good condition and in levelling the playground. The cost of any work recommended by you should be stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. J.

This would cost probably $125.00 and I think is too expensive for the funds available this year. Again, as work of this kind should be done in the early Summer months, there is a twofold reason why it should not be done this year. I would suggest that this be given consideration when preparing next year's estimates.\n\nAs regards repairs to the house and painting, I would strongly recommend that the painting be done now, while the staging for repairs is in position and thus save the expense of erecting a staging a second time. It will also be necessary to scrape the walls before painting.\n\nTherefore, to reshingle one side of the roof, the porch, and paint the whole house I would recommend that an expenditure of $225.00 be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the repairs, improvements, etc., required to the teacher's residence and school grounds at the Whycocomagh Indian Day School.\n\nIn connection with the repairs required to the teacher's residence and the painting of same, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $225 in reshingling one side of the roof and the porch, and painting the house. Either you or the local Indian Agent should arrange for the purchase of all materials required and for the labour. You should see that all costs are kept as low as possible, having in view the carrying out of satisfactory work. This work should be completed at an early date, and, when finished to the satisfaction of yourself or the local Indian Agent, accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure in the purchase of the materials and for the labour.\n\nRelative to the improvement of the school grounds, I have to say that this work will have to stand over until next year, at which time you could again draw the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nG. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1930.\n\nSir:-\n\nI return herewith one copy of your voucher No. 728 for $37.40 in favour of Mr. John K.

Accounts covering the cost should not reach the Department until after the 31st of March, when our appropriation for the next fiscal year is available.

Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and I should be pleased if you could arrange to have the account for the expenditure incurred in exchanging the stove forwarded after the 1st of April, next, when funds for the next fiscal year will be available. The new stove should be installed in the school at a time when it will not interfere with the regular classroom work, and when the work has been completed to the satisfaction of the Indian Agent or yourself, an account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, which should show the cost of the new stove, less the amount allowed for the stove traded in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I beg to report, that on the expectation that this work would be done this year, shrubs and flowering plants were ordered last fall through the Rural Education Department at Truro by Mr. A. MacDonald, teacher, who was then acting Indian Agent. These shrubs and plants were planted by the school children before school closed in June under the direction of Prof. L.A. Dewolfe, Director of Rural Education.\n\nI have pointed out to Mr. MacDonald that he should have had authority from the Department before ordering these shrubs and that his action was rather presumptuous. He admits his error but explains that by ordering at that time we could get a better price on the lot and be sure of delivery.\n\nIn time they will certainly improve the appearance of the school grounds.

Of course the average attendance is less than that number but the seating capacity is only 36. There is room for five more desks which would make room for ten extra pupils.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend the purchase of four new desks and one end seat similar to the type of desk already in the school. You will remember that this matter was given consideration last year but it was decided to wait until there would be funds available. Would you kindly authorize the purchase of these desks please.

You may place an order with one of the firms on your list to supply the five extra desks required. You should first ascertain the type of desk at present in use and also the size of the extra ones required. This information, you should supply to the firm with whom you place the order. This firm can, no doubt, arrange to obtain the desks required and have same delivered at the school. After the desks have been obtained, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J.

The schools at which this lunch was supplied to the pupils were as follows:\n\nEskasoni, Indian Cove (Pictou Landing)\nSydney, Afton,\nWhysecomagh, Salmon River.\n\nThe supplies for the lunch should be of the same type and approximately in the same quantities as last year. You may inform the various agents, arrange with them to purchase the articles and have the teachers start the serving of the lunch from the middle of November, next. They may continue serving lunch to the pupils at these schools until the end of April, 1932. All expenses in connection with the purchase of the supplies required should be kept as low as possible. Itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred in this connection for each school, separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

It would deter such acts of vandalism in future, and it would be the only sure means of finding out who is doing this. Awaiting your action in the matter I remain yours sincerely\n\nA.B. Mac Neil\nAgent\nOttawa, September 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, informing the Department of the damage incurred to the windows of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you should arrange for the purchase and installation of the number of panes of glass required in replacing the glass broken by vandals. After this work has been completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, showing in detail the number of panes of glass purchased and the cost of same, also the cost of the labour in installing the glass. The number of hours employed and the rate per hour paid in installing the glass should be stated.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who broke the windows. It is considered, however, that the Indian constable should endeavour to ascertain the guilty party, and the necessary action should then be taken to obtain a conviction. You should see the constable as soon as possible and have him attend to this matter, giving him any assistance you can in locating and convicting the guilty party. Please inform the Department later of the result of any action taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. C. MacNeil, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nGlendale, N.S.\n\nSept. 5th, 1932\n\nThe Secty.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to ask for authority to purchase for the Indian Day School, Whyecoomagh, N.S., 10 panes of glass and three padlocks. The glass in the school was broken by vandals during the recent vacation and the padlocks are required, one for the school, one for the coal shed and one for the school lunch closet as the ones now in use are old and not in proper working order. An amount of about three dollars will be required for putty and glazing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. A. C. Mac Neil\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 12, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, in further reference to the damaged windows at the Whycocomagh Indian Day School, and, in reply, would refer you to our letter of the 7th instant, authorizing you to arrange for the purchase and installation of a number of panes of glass.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and installation of the padlocks required for the school, coal shed and lunch room closet. While serviceable padlocks should be obtained, they should be as cheap as possible. After the above supplies have been obtained, please forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. A. G. MacNeill,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nGlendale, N.S.\n\nSept. 7th, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nSir,\n\nMay I ask please if the school-lunch, as given to the children of the Whycocomagh School during the past few years be authorized to start from October 1st. I have consulted both the Teacher and the Medical Doctor regarding this matter and they informed me that the lunch and cod liver-oil as supplied by the Dept. gave excellent results from every point of view. So many of the children are from tuberculous families and as the oil and lunch is given regular in school I consider it even better than if left to the parents to do so. The Teacher told me that many of the children did not like to take the oil and that he had received letters from their parents instructing him to discontinue giving it, but after he had forced them to take it in small doses at first, they soon were willing and anxious to take it.\n\nPlease send a supply of cod-liver-oil, and authorize the school lunch to commence on October 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Mac Neil\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 15, 1932.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRev. A. G. MacNeil, Indian Agent, Glendale, N.S., requests that a supply of cod liver oil be furnished for the use of the pupils at the Whycocomagh Indian Day School during the coming winter. He states that many of the children are from tubercular families. I would suggest that the same quantity as was given last year be again furnished.\nOttawa, September 15, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the serving of a lunch to the pupils of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School as from October 1st, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of milk from time to time. Last year, ten cents per quart was paid, but it is considered that it should be obtained at much less cost this year. You may also purchase the quantity of sugar, cheese and biscuits necessary. Approximately 30 pounds sugar, 70 pounds cheese and 120 pounds biscuits were supplied last year. The teacher should keep an accurate account of the milk supplied each month and hand same to you. You should then prepare a voucher, in triplicate, for the amount due, to which should be attached the statement of the teacher, which should also be certified by him. Our funds this year are extremely limited, and the Department will rely on you to see that all costs for the food for the lunch are kept to the lowest possible point. The teacher may start the serving of the lunch from October 1st, next, and continue same until the end of March, following.\n\nYou will be advised later regarding the supplying of cod liver oil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

McNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nGlendale, W.S.\n\nSept. 21st, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived your letter No.53-2-5 of the 15th inst., authorising the serving of a lunch for the pupils of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School and I have informed the teacher of your instructions regarding the keeping of an accurate account of the supplies issued, etc.\n\nRegarding the purchase of milk and the price of same, I have made enquiries and find that the regular price paid in Whycocomagh and the neighbouring locality is ten cents per quart, and even at that the supply that can be obtained nearby is limited. However, I have arranged to have milk supplied during October at the rate of eight cents per quart, with the understanding that should the price of butter increase after that month, further arrangements regarding the price of milk will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In view of the fact that I have much faith in the supplying of the school lunch and its benefit to both children and parents, I recommend that the requested authority be given.

You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the supplies that will be absolutely necessary for the purpose. These supplies should be of the same type as previously obtained, and itemized accounts in triplicate, covering the cost should be secured.

However, when the cows are put to pasture, thereby lessening the cost of production and the supply is larger than at present, I am informed that milk can be supplied at a lower price.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nMarch 31, 1933\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nJ.

As the cocoa cannot be prepared without milk, am I to understand that biscuits alone will be served during the months of November and March or that milk may be served as an additional part of the lunch during December, January and February? If biscuits and hot cocoa (prepared with milk) would be served during the whole authorized time, I do not consider that it would be necessary to serve additional milk at any time.\n\nI am aware that the appropriation has been reduced and my reason for asking for this information is to assure that I will cause no error through misunderstanding of your authority, however I would recommend that the hot cocoa be served throughout the authorized time and that cannot be prepared without milk.\n\nYour early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 3, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the midday meal for the pupils of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase the sugar, biscuits, cocoa, and milk required for the cocoa, for the period November 1, 1933, to March 31, 1934.

When giving me this requisition, Mr. MacDonald gave the following reason for asking for 8 window panes.\n\nHe informed me that on opening school last Monday morning, he found 8 window panes broken and the floor of the school covered with broken glass and stones, and is of the firm opinion that the windows were broken by vandals throwing stones at them. This was done during the Summer holidays while the teacher was absent from the Reserve as there were none broken at the end of last term. Before cleaning and sweeping the floor, the teacher had Mr. Levi Poulett, Constable, and Truant Officer, also William B. Young, Jenitor for the school, witness the condition of the place and the broken windows.\n\nI am instructing Constable Poulett to try and find out who the vandals were but have little hopes that he can find out. I am also posting up a notice regarding damage to Government property at the school.\n\nIn the meantime the glass is required as also is putty and the services of someone to do the glazing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. C. MacNeil\nAgent.\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that you may replace the 8 window panes that were broken at the Whycocomagh Indian Day School. Upon receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate, the Department will pay for the glass, putty and the glazier's services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. V. A. C. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N. S.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nWycocomagh, N.S.,\nSept. 18, 1934.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI wish to recommend that a new school building containing two class rooms be built for the WYCOMAGH INDIAN RESERVE. And also recommend that in the meantime the present building be renovated, and thoroughly cleaned inside and out and repainted inside as well as out.\n\nMy reason for the above recommendation is that the pupils are very much overcrowded. There is an enrollment of fifty-one pupils. The day I visited the school thirty-five pupils were present and every seat was occupied, in some cases three children were in one seat. The school is very dirty, the paints smoke stained and the woodwork very dirty. The stove and windows were broken but arrangements are being made to have these replaced.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMary L. Macleod, R.N.\nPublic Health Nurse.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nThe change as recommended above is long overdue. I certainly approve of it. M.G. Macleod, M.D.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the recommendation of Miss Murdoch re the overcrowding of the Wycocomagh School I need only refer to my previous correspondence regarding this matter.\n\nAs you are aware the Wycocomagh Reserve is the largest in the Maritime Provinces, with more than forty families settled there, and to date there is but one class room, and the number of children attending school increasing annually.\n\nI would heartily recommend that this matter be given favorable consideration and the various other matters as brought to your attention by Miss Murdoch be approved of.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent for Inverness County.\nOttawa, September 29, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the recommendation of Miss Murdoch, Public Health Nurse, that an extra classroom be provided to accommodate the Indian children of school age on the Whycocomagh Indian Reserve and, also, that the present classroom be renovated and thoroughly cleaned and repainted.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds to favourably consider authorizing an addition to the present school building nor for the erection of a new school with two classrooms. Neither will we have funds to provide for any outside painting of the building.\n\nI would request, however, that you forward an estimate of the cost of having the interior of the present school building thoroughly cleaned and repainted. At the same time, you should state how long you consider it would take to have this work done and whether it would be necessary to close the school for the purpose. When we have full information as to the cost involved in cleaning and painting the interior of the school, favourable consideration will be given to authorizing having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

A.C. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nWindale, N.S.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe stove used for heating the Whycocomagh Indian Day School is badly burned out, and I consider that it is not safe to use it this Winter.\n\nEarly last Spring, its condition became so bad and the smoke from it made the interior of the School so dirty that I had to use a small stove taken from my residence.\n\nAs the cold weather will soon be here, I consider it best to report this matter without further delay.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nAlexander Macdonald,\nTeacher\nIndian Day School,\nWhycocomagh, C.B., N.S.\nGlendale, N.S.\n\nSept. 24th, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from Alexander MacDonald, Teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School, regarding the condition of the stove used for heating the building.\n\nSome time ago, while visiting the above named School, I saw the stove referred to and I am sure that it would not be safe to continue its use as one side of it is burnt and has a large hole in it. I also saw the stove which Mr. MacDonald has used after the other one became unfit for use and although the teacher told me that he was willing to leave it there even if it was his own personal property, it is not in very good condition and is far too small to heat the building.\n\nI have made enquiries and find that a stove called \"Red Cloud\" No. 14 would be suitable and the cost would be about $25.00, possibly less, and would recommend that one be purchased and installed as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 2, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian Day School, regarding the condition of the stove at present in use and requesting that a new one be supplied.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and delivery at the school of a new stove. It is noted that you recommend a stove called \"Red Cloud\", No. 14, which would be suitable and cost approximately $25.00, possibly less. You should arrange for the purchase and installation of the stove at an early date. Should any new stove pipe be required, you may also purchase same. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. C.

As the painter could not give an exact estimate of the time he would take to do the job (between 7 and 8 days he thought) with a helper he could not give a rate of wages per hour but will take the job on contact, which is the lowest offer I received, for the amounts above stated.\n\nI would suggest that the work be done during the Christmas holidays so that school will not have to be closed as it will be impossible to to the work with school open. Again it could be done part by part by working on Saturdays, which would also be suitable.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 22, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, submitting an estimate of the cost of cleaning and repairing the interior of the Whyccomagh Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have this work carried out during the coming Christmas holidays. It is noted you can have it done by a local Indian, who is an experienced painter. You should arrange for the purchase of the paint, oil, cleaning materials, etc., from a firm on the approved list. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials\u2014which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should also forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, for the amount due for the labour.\n\nIt is understood that the price quoted by you for material and labour\u2014viz., $63.75\u2014will include two coats of paint of good quality.

This fence was put up before I became Indian Agent and during my recent visit to Whycocomagh, I noted that the fence was down in places and the posts too rotten to hold the wire. Some of the posts are sound but many have fallen during the winter and new ones are required.\n\nThe fence surrounding the lot of the Teacher's Residence also requires a little repairing.\n\nThe barn on the Teacher's residence, Whycocomagh Reserve has two rotted sills and also some decayed woodwork and planks about the doors, windows etc. If this is not attended to as soon as possible, a greater amount of expense will be required to put the building in safe condition. It also requires painting but I would not suggest that this be done this year as the other repairs are more urgent.\n\nSome repairs to the doors and door casings of the Indian Day School at Malagawatch Reserve are urgently required. The interior of this school also requires painting.\n\nI would recommend that $60.00 be authorized for repairing the school fences and barn on Whycocomagh Reserve, and $8.00 for repairing the doors etc. on the Malagawatch School. If the Malagawatch school is to be repainted inside, about $40.00 will be required for material and labour. I would also say that all the above work be done by Indian labour as they can do it and so many are unemployed.\n\nA. C. Mac Neill\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 10, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter regarding the wire fence surrounding the Whycocomagh Indian Day School, please let me know the approximate cost of having this fence repaired.\n\nRegarding the barn near the teacher's residence, you might state the cost of the material required to repair this building. If this barn is used wholly by the teacher, the Department considers that, if we supply the material, the teacher should do the work himself during the summer holidays without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Teacher interviewed me regarding any action he may take to prevent a repetition of this destroying property this year and said that if material for shutters was furnished, he would make and install them free of charge, providing all concerned would be satisfied with his work.\n\nMy records show that the breaking of the said windows caused an expenditure of $5.30 last year and also that a few years previous, a less amount for a like purpose was incurred.\n\nSeven shutters are required and I recommend that $1.50 each, a total of $10.50 be authorized for this purpose and that Mr. MacDonald make and install them free as he has offered. Planed lumber and hardware will be required and I feel sure that MacDonald can build the shutters satisfactory.\n\nAs the end of the school year is near, I would suggest that this expenditure be authorized as soon as possible so that the windows may be made secure when the holidays begin.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Mac Neil\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 22, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, stating the action you advise be taken to protect the windows of the Whyccoomagh Indian Day School building from damage during the summer holiday period.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $10.50 in having shutters made and installed on the windows. It is noted that the teacher will make the shutters and install them free, if the material is supplied. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the quantity of plain lumber and hardware required, obtaining accounts, in triplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nI wish to refer to official letter of the 10th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the wire fence around the school and also to the fence surrounding the lot of the teacher's residence. Please state the cost of the material and labour required in repairing these fences, when consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYou should also state the cost of the material required in repairing the barn near the teacher's residence. I would request that you state for what purpose this barn is used. Does the teacher keep any stock or carry out any farming operations? In any event, if he requires the barn, he should be responsible for carrying out any labour in making the repairs.\n\nRev. A. C. MacNeill,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\n\nA. F.

C. MacNeil\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 28, 1935.\n\nRev.

You should also have them disinfected and placed in a good, sanitary condition. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I wish to state\nthat I visited Whycocomagh yesterday and inspected the fences surrounding\nthe school and Teacher's residence.\n\nThe wire of the fences is quite serviceable but many posts are decayed\nand the wire requires re-stretching. I would estimate that an expenditure of\n$18.00 for new posts, labour and the rental of a stretcher will put both\nfences in good condition.\n\nRegarding the barn, two sills are decayed and also parts of the windows,\ndoors and floor. However, if one sill was installed this Summer and the other\nrepairs made, the second sill would not be required for possibly a couple of\nyears, and the building would be in a condition so that it would not sink in\nthe ground or go out of shape. The barn is used to keep the Teacher's stock,\nand also to house my own team when in Whycocomagh on Winter visits. It is\nalso used to store any Government implements or supplies which may be on\nhand from time to time. The Teacher told me that he is quite willing to do\nany work he can do in repairing the building but I know that the placing of\nthe sill requires an experienced man. I would estimate that an expenditure\nof $30.00 for the purchase of material and the labour of an experienced\ncarpenter, with the Teacher giving all the help possible, would put the barn\nin such a condition that it would be safe from further damage and in a fair\ncondition for many years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. C. Mac Neil\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 4, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of the repairs required to the fence surrounding the Whyccoomagh Indian Day School and also to the barn.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging to have the repairs required made to the fence. It is noted that a number of new posts will be required and that the wire should be re-stretched. The cost of the material and labour should be kept within your estimate, viz., $18.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $30 in supplying the materials and labour required in repairing the barn. It is noted that if one sill is installed and minor repairs made, the building would be placed in a condition that would be serviceable for a few years. It is noted that the teacher is willing to do as much of the work as possible. It is thought that Indian labour could be employed to assist him in making the repairs to the barn and also in repairing the fence.\n\nYou should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should also forward vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified, for the labour employed. It should be definitely stated the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid. It is expected that you will keep all costs in carrying out the work as low as possible.\n\nI would request that you will have the work which has been authorized at this school carried out during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sir:\n\nThe Department recently received from you a voucher in favour of Mrs. Wm. Googoo, Whycocomagh, N.S. This voucher read: \"Milk for school lunch, Whycocomagh Indian Day School, during the month of March, 1936 - 21 quarts @ 10\u00a2 .. $2.10\".\n\nA cheque was issued in favour of Mrs. Wm. Googoo and sent to Whycocomagh, as directed by your voucher, but has been returned. For your information, I enclose the envelope in which the cheque was sent, and you will note the notation on this envelope by the postmaster at Whycocomagh.\n\nIf the payment should have been made to Mrs. Michael Googoo it will be necessary for you to forward another voucher in her favour, as the only procedure the Department could adopt was to deposit the cheque issued in favour of Mrs. Wm. Googoo and returned by the postmaster at Whycocomagh.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. G.

As this was due to Mrs. Michael Googoo, the cheque has been returned to you, there being no Mrs. William Googoo there. The Teacher states that he might have made an error in writing the name \"William\" instead of \"Michael\" and again it is possible that I have made the same error in making out the vouchers.\n\nHowever, the payment for milk for the school-lunch for March, amounting to $2.10 is due MRS. MICHAEL GOOGOO, and I am informing her that she will receive payment in due time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nBANK RECEIPT No.\n\nAmt. 2/10\n\nDate...

He also states that the floor of the school requires re-oiling.\n\nI believe his statements, knowing that all local schools are cleaned and scrubbed (walls and ceiling) annually and the Springtime is best suited for the purpose.

MCGILL.\n\nWhycocomagh Indian Day School (Inverness Co.).\n\nTeacher: Mr. Alexander MacDonald.\n\nThis school building is in a fair state of repair. The seats in the school all need some repairs, tightening up, etc. One of the Indians there could do this work.\n\nAn out house is required, at a cost of $15. The teacher will do the necessary work.\n\nThe teacher asked that some interior painting be done in his residence, and the steps in front of the house need repairing. Mr. MacDonald informed me that he would do the work if the Department would supply the material, which we figured would cost about $40. The total expenditure for repairing the seats, building out house and painting and repairs to the teacher's residence would be about $65.\n\nI was very much impressed with Mr. MacDonald. As Rev. Father Angus MacNeil, the Agent, lives 22 miles from the school, the duties of agent fall, to a great extent, on the teacher. He has been with the Department now for fourteen years, and takes a great interest in his work, not only in the school but also in the Indians. I had a meeting with the Band at the school, and I noted at the meeting that the Indians certainly looked to Mr. MacDonald for guidance.\n\nI trust the expenditure above referred to will be authorized.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nReverend Sir,-\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to the Whycocomagh Indian Day School, Mr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, recommends an expenditure not exceeding $65.00 for repairing the seats in the school and erecting a new toilet, also painting and repairs to the teacher's residence. He states that the teacher is prepared to do most of the work without cost to the Department. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the necessary materials from firms on the approved list. The total expenditure should not exceed $65.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hody.\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. C. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.

MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N. S.\nExtract from Inspector Fraser's report on the Whydacomagh Day School dated March 9, 1936:\n\nStove should be jacketed with sheet-metal to facilitate even warmth and circulation of air.\n\nToilets need repairs and addition of doors.\n\nThe school should be repainted this year both inside and out. It is out of harmony with most of our schools in regard to colours used and moreover is in need of repainting.\n\nThe interior of the school is at present painted light blue. All, or almost all, our Inverness County schools are painted in about the following colour scheme:\n\nWainscot -- medium brown, or stained natural wood.\nWalls -- very light buff.\nCeiling -- cream.\n\nIf your department insists on blue, then repainting in this colour should be done; but I recommend the colours described. Blue is a cold and depressing colour for classrooms, especially when unrelieved by any other colour.\n\nThe exterior of the school is in the worst possible colour for our beautiful landscape -- dull grey. The school should be painted in a combination of very light colours, probably straw trimmed with white or brown; buff with white; or white with green.\n\nThe playground is entirely without equipment. Two strong teeters and a three-swing outfit would be enjoyed and appreciated.\n\n(Sgd.) D. C.

MacDonald, Merchant of Whycocomagh to procure them as soon as possible.\n\nThe Teacher states that the rest of the stove was in good condition and that he would install the replacement parts himself, so to assure that there would be no case of fire, I gave the order without waiting for your authority or instructions, as the parts cannot be obtained locally and must be procured from Sackville, New Brunswick. The parts are; 1 fire pot and one top ring cover, which should cost only a few dollars.\n\nKindly let me have your authority for this expenditure which I, as well as the Teacher, considered very urgent.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1939.\n\nExD.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 27th instant the Department approves the action you have taken in purchasing necessary parts for the stove at the Whycocomagh Indian day school.

Letter 53-2-5 dated May 8th, 1939.\n\nNOTE: In giving my estimate of costs (as per my previous letter) I made an error in the price of the round posts, saying that 12 posts @ 10\u00a2 was $1.20 instead of $2.40. On that account this statement and voucher is slightly more than what I previously asked for. I regret the error which you may see on reading my letter, please.\n\nTOTAL: $26.25\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\nR. 4620\n\nVoucher No.: Date:\n\nMay 30th 1939 Agent\nTo the Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nI would urge that the interior of the school be painted in the very near future. Window blinds are also needed. A cheerful, bright classroom with proper wall decoration would certainly produce better results. It would then be a proper home to each child during the six hours in which the classroom is the child's home.\n\nI also wish to make application for the daily school lunch.\n\nThank you,\n\nTo the Secretary.\n\nSir,\n\nHerewith Requisition and Application for your information and action as deemed advisable.\n\nA.C. Mac Neil Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 19, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the letter from the teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian day school you may authorize her to serve a light midday lunch during the period November 1, 1939, to April 30, 1940. The monthly cost of the supplies must not exceed the amount expended last year.\n\nIf new window blinds are needed in the school you may secure them.\n\nIn connection with the painting of the interior of the school please let me know the cost of material and labour. You should also advise if Indians can be employed to do the work or if it will be necessary to secure white labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. C. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N. S.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have already made application for the serving of the \"hot lunch\" in the Whyecoomagh Indian Day School. Pending a reply, I beg to ask for the articles listed on the requisition\u2014 if the request for the school lunch is to be granted. It begins November 15th.\n\nMay I once more call to your attention the fact that the interior of the school is badly in need of paint. A bright, cheerful room is a necessity in making the children health-conscious. A clean, cheerful atmosphere in the school\u2014which is the Indian child's home for six hours daily\u2014might influence a great deal his home life.\n\nIn the small amount of class-room decoration which I have already accomplished, I find the children very interested and willing helpers. I don't think I exaggerate the effects of a bright, homelike, comfortable class-room on these children.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

The walls are begrimed and dark, and the schoolroom is thus certainly not inducive to healthful school living. A covered water container, individual drinking cups, towels, tooth brushes and powder, window blinds are also needs which should be attended to at once.\n\nW.G.

The figures in were require 5 gal of cream paint, 1 gal of light brown, 1 gal of oil, 1 gal of turpentine.\n\nHe came to the mark for $20.00. However, in order not to interfere with school, I suggest it be done during the Christmas holidays.\n\nPrices of Paint are as follows:\n- Waterings 1st Grade $2.50 per gal.\n- At the Co-op Stores, same high grade $3.00 per gal. No estimate as to use of turpentine but I can get best figures on that.\n\nYours sincerely,\nA. L. Macneil Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 17, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent letter you may arrange for the interior decorating of the Whyccoomagh Indian day school.

Would you be kind enough to ask for a similar expenditure for this year?\n\nThank you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM. Cassie Mac Neil\nTo the Dept. of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from the teacher at Whiskeyknob Reserve school requesting a grant again this year for a treat for the Indian children.\n\nI might add that tomorrow night we are putting on a concert for the children - and having a Christmas tree. This is something new for the children at Whiskeyknob Reserve. I am told that she is having a difficult time trying to get them to learn their little recitations, etc., but believes she will succeed. I am expected to attend and I am very anxious to note the improvement made in this instance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.C.

In former years, $8.00 for the Wyoming school and $4.00 for the Malagawatch school was authorized. Please let me know if this is authorized this year or if there are any other arrangements made, so I may inform the teachers of the school accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOffice of the Indian Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant regarding a Christmas treat for the Indian children attending the Whyeocomagh and Malagawatch Schools it is considered that the teacher should be able to arrange a concert a week or so before Christmas and either charge a small admission fee or take up a collection. By so doing sufficient funds should be raised to provide a Christmas treat for the pupils attending the school. In addition it should have a tendency to make the Indian parents realize that they have some obligations with regard to the education of their children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

We have recently received two accounts for supplies purchased for the month of November. The total amount for midday meal supplies charged in these two accounts is $56.08. From the vouchers it would appear that this amount was for the Whycoomagh School only. Is this correct or was this amount used at both schools? In either case it is a much larger amount than is usually supplied. It was never the intention that anything approaching a full meal should be served. It is our desire that a small quantity of food or hot drink should be served to supplement whatever the children may bring with them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. A.C. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nHerewith Mr. Morris' report on the Whycocomagh Agency, Oct 15- Oct. 26\n\nSCHOOL - is an old building in very poor condition. The roof was leaking badly in many places. The agent was instructed to purchase the required number of rolls of ready-roofing and engage an Indian to put it on. This was the most economical repair that could be made - keeping in mind that the school will be abandoned in the next two or three years. Authority was also given to have the walls and ceiling washed. The toilets were in a dirty condition. The agent was instructed to have them attended to immediately.\n\nMiss Mary MacKenzie, the teacher, appears to be a bright, intelligent person. Thirty-two children were in attendance. There were not enough desks to accommodate this number and it was necessary to have three children use one desk. Mr. MacKenzie is arranging to provide a few extra desks which he obtained from the Shubenacadie School. The children on the whole were clean and neat, and appeared to be well fed and well dressed.\n\nTEACHER'S RESIDENCE - is a fairly good building, but as it has not been occupied for several years a great deal of damage has been done to it. There are many panes of glass broken. The back entrance has been damaged. Mr. William B. Young, Indian, who was the Postmaster at Whycocomagh, offered $100.00 for the teacher's residence (see Mr. Phelan's letter of October 16, File 53-2-d). Since Mr. Young made the offer he died suddenly on a potato picking trip to Maine. His family, however, are still interested in the purchase of the residence. I would strongly recommend that their offer be not accepted. If this Indian family purchased the building then they would not readily agree to move to Eskasoni when a new house would be available - possibly in the course of the next two years. Further, the fact that we would sell the building to an Indian might leave the impression that we do not intend to carry out the centralization scheme of the Cape Breton Indians completely. I would recommend that the residence be dismantled by a competent Indian carpenter on the reserve - the lumber, doors and windows, salvaged - and moved to Eskasoni by departmental truck. We are in urgent need of good seasoned finishing material. The cost of this work would, of course, be paid from Welfare funds. The agent should be advised to dismantle the building as recommended.\nOttawa, January 25, 1946.\n\nP. B. Holman, Esq., Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, CAPE BRETON, Nova Scotia,\n\nRe: Teacher's Residence,\nEskasoni Reserve\n\nYou are instructed to have the teacher's residence on the Wyeconagh Reserve carefully dismantled, and salvage all material such as doors, door frames, window frames and sash, flooring, sheathing, bricks, etc. The material will then be trucked to the Eskasoni Reserve to be used in the construction of the store and residence to be built near the headquarters next summer. It is just possible that some of the salvaged material would not be suitable in the construction of the store - undoubtedly it could be used in the construction of Indian homes.\n\nAt the time of your visit to Ottawa you suggested that it might be wise not to dismantle the building during the winter time as the material might be stolen. It will be left to you to decide when the work should commence. The cost of the labour will be paid from Welfare Vote. If there are Indians on the Wyeconagh Reserve who are carpenters, and are trustworthy, then the work should be done by them - if not you have authority to use men from the Eskasoni Reserve.\n\nJ. E.

Will you please let me have a memo. with regard to this.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, December 1, 1911.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIt is not our practice to supply teacher's residences unless for some reason it is difficult to find board or residence within reasonable distance of the school. It should be possible to obtain a house in Whycocomagh village, which is not far from the reserve. Mr. Gillies, who is the school teacher there now, has taken a great interest in the Indians and his presence on the reserve I believe to have been beneficial. It was reported to me that he has rented an Indian house on the reserve. If it would serve the purpose of keeping him or some other good man on the reserve constantly I would feel inclined to recommend the putting up of a house sometime, at some future time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. A.\nDecember 28, 1911.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your conversation here a short time ago, regarding the erection of a teacher's residence on the Whycocomagh Indian reserve, N. S., I beg to say that the practice of the Department is not to supply teachers' residences unless it is difficult to find suitable accommodation within reasonable distance of the school. The Department is of opinion that it should be possible to obtain a house in Whycocomagh village, which is not very far from the reserve. At any rate, it is a matter that the Department will bear in mind, and, if found necessary, would incline towards a favourable view of the suggestion made.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nT. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, &c.,\nInverness, N. S.\nOttawa, May 21, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in reference to the erection of a teacher's residence on the Whycocomagh Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn A Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhycocomagh Indian Reserve,\nWhycocomagh, O.B.\nOttawa, May 30, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. John A Gillis, teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian School, has written the Department in reference to the erection of a teacher's residence. I beg to refer to this letter, which is turned out hereunder. As Mr. Gillis's services as teacher are very satisfactory I am of opinion that we should try to erect here this summer a residence similar to the one for which the contract is now being let at Middle River. The building at Middle River is costing $1450.00 and I presume it could be built for about the same figure at Whycocomagh. Although no special provision has been made in the estimates for this building the General School Vote will stand the expenditure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, 31st May 1912\n\nMr. MacFarlane\n\nTo quote for Estimates 1913-14\n\nJ.H.P.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nJune\n\nOttawa, May 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 21st ultimo I beg to say that the Department cannot undertake the erection of a teacher's residence at Whycoomagh this summer. A sum of money for this purpose will, however, be placed in the estimates for next year and should the grant be allowed by Parliament this work may be undertaken next year, provided conditions remain such as to warrant the Department in putting up a residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn A Gillis, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhycoomagh Indian Reserve,\nWhycoomagh, C.B.\nWhynacomaig, Q.B., June 12th, 1912.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter with reference\n\nSir, being a teacher's residence on the reserve here for which\n\nI am thank you. If I could get a house to rent here\n\nwould not put the Department any trouble. The house\n\noccupied at present and its only one we had in belonging\n\nto an Indian and is little better than a camp as the rain,\n\nsnows, and hail can enter through the chinks in the wall.\n\nIn fact it is so cold that we nearly froze & death last\n\nwinter. Again thanking you for your kind servant,\n\nJohn O'Neil,\n\nIndian Teacher.\n\nJ.W. McCann Esq.,\nActing Deputy & Capt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Canada.\nWhipacoming, G.B., June 12th 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter with reference to building a teacher's residence on the reserve here for which I beg to thank you. If I could get a house to rent here I would not put the department to any trouble. The house I occupy at present and the only one we had in belonging to an Indian and is little better than a camp as the rain, snow, and hail can enter through the chinks in the wall. In fact it is so cold that we nearly freeze to death each night. Again thanking you sincerely, I am,\n\nJohn A. Willis,\nIndian Teacher.\n\nJ.S. McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy & Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Canada.\nInverness, N.S., October 25th, 1912\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly let me know if it is the intention of the Department to erect a dwelling house for the teacher at the Whyccoomagh, Indian Reserve. I understand that a dwelling has been erected for the teacher at Nynanza, Victoria County. The Whyccoomagh school, if I am correctly informed, has a larger attendance than that at Nynanza, the labors of the teacher are more arduous, and conditions generally warrant the erection of a dwelling for the Whyccoomagh teacher. If it is decided to build, would you kindly inform me as to the date when the work will be done, and will it be done by contract or by days labor.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSCHOOLS BRANCH\nJCT 29 1912\nOttawa, October 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant asking if it is the intention of the Department to erect a dwelling house for the teacher on the Whycocomagh Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. John A. Gillis, teacher of this school, was informed that the Department could not undertake the erection of a teacher's residence for him this summer, but that a sum of money would be placed in the estimates for next year for this purpose and, if allowed by parliament, the work might be undertaken next year, provided conditions remain such as to warrant the Department in putting up a residence. The department will be prepared to carry out this arrangement if the conditions continue to be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThos. Gallant, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nInverness, N.S.\nThe Accounts Branch,\n\nIf the Estimates as submitted to Parliament for 1913-14 contain the item for the Agent's house at Why-cocomagh as originally prepared by the Department, it may be just as well to look into the matter of getting the material ready during the winter, in case it should be decided to erect the building by day labour.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 8th instant, I beg to say that $1450.00 has been provided in the Supplementary Estimates for the erection of a teacher's residence at Whycocomagh. This is the amount which the teacher's house at Middle River cost, where the building was constructed under contract. I think that we should let a contract for the house required at Whycocomagh, and it is reasonable to suppose that it can be erected for the same money as at Middle River. As the season is now far advanced, it would seem necessary to allow the matter to stand until the early spring and then call for tenders for the work.\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nOttawa, November 15th 1912.\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt., General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would respectfully urge the importance for having provisions made in this year's estimates for the construction of a residence for the teacher at the Indian section at the Whycocomagh Reserve. I would recommend that the residence be built on the same model as that constructed last year at Nyjansza in Victoria Co., N.S.,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Schools Branch]\nOttawa, February 19, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the erection of the teacher's residence on the Whyccoomagh Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department hopes to be able to undertake this work during the coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Advise agent of action taken.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nCharge D. of I.A.\nWhycocomagh, C.B., July 20th.\n\nSir,- I beg to call your attention to enclosed plan of first floor of teacher's residence at Whycocomagh, as at present laid out. There is a large room in the front that is practically useless as a bedroom, as it is open to the stairway, thereby having no privacy. If the partition wall marked (A) was extended to B with a door in the centre, and the door marked D placed at A then it would make two rooms and communicating. This would enable us to use the large room as a guest chamber. Light enough could be had from a window 20 x 20 placed about midway the stair and the light in the basement for the hall. The distance from A to B is fifteen feet with the ceiling eight feet high which makes 240 sq ft under plastering, Studwork and laths being also extra. Instead of a closet in the dining room there should be a door communicating with the living room so that a person could enter the dining room without going through the kitchen as at present. A large amount of extra space is wasted by not having a door in the wall back of the stairway. The place under the stairs could be used as a storeroom for trunks etc.\n\nI talked the matter over with Mr. Poirier and he agrees to make the few changes required to secure the extra comfort for twenty-five dollars ($25).\n\nI trust you will see fit to bring the above to the notice of the Department at an early day so that if allowed Mr. Poirier can get the extra material required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn A. Hillis\n\nA.P. Boyd, Esq.,\nCameo,\nRichmond Co.,\nC.B.\n\n(over)\nMEMO.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter, which speaks for itself; and I quite agree with Mr. Gillis that the alterations he suggests are altogether desirable. The \"guest chamber\" he refers to is one that I should like to occupy myself occasionally. It would be useful for the Agent also.\n\nThe arrangement by which the dining room can be entered only by going through the kitchen is certainly objectionable and ought to be changed. There should be direct communication between the living room and the dining room; and I strongly recommend a change in the plan with that object in view.\n\nAgain, there is no provision in the plan for properly lighting the hall, which, I think, constitutes a serious defect. A narrow window over the front door will not give sufficient light, and, therefore, a \"half-sash\" should also be inserted in the wall of the house near the head of the stairs.\n\nI hope the Department will consent to the alterations in the plan of the building, as suggested, especially as the cost of making them will involve only the small extra amount of $25, and the improvement will be worth more than the expenditure, in point of convenience and otherwise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMcLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 9, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., with enclosure from Mr. Gillis teacher of the Whyocomagh Indian School, in which he asks for some minor changes in the plan of the teachers residence which is being erected there at present.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may authorize these changes at a cost of $25.00, and advise the Inspector Mr. Albert E.

The Contractor graded out three feet from the wall as required by the specifications, but on account of it being a side hill location it did not raise the grade sufficient to keep the water from backing up and undermining the foundation wall. An extra expenditure of $25.00 would be I think sufficient to cut away the hill about forty feet back and make it possible to divert the water that accumulates in the spring into the hollow at the back.\n\nYour Obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

B. Waters\nWhynocomagh C.B. Sept. 28th 13.\n\nSir, On page 10 \"Specifications for teachers residence at Whynocomagh\" there is a clause relating to how the windows should be adjusted, which to my mind is not very clear. One would be led to infer from reading the clause that it requires the upper parts to be hung with pack weights as is usually the case to permit of proper ventilation. The upper parts in the window as now adjusted are stationary, that is they are a strip of board about two inches wide, driven under the lower side of each, and extending to the window sill held in place with nails. Needless to say these will not be any means of lowering the upper part to get rid of the impure air in the rooms. Opening the lower part will permit the ingress of fresh air but that will only drive the hot and foul air in the rooms to the upper portion of the house a thing to try avoid that will make it very unhealthy. The only way to remedy this as the work is now so far advanced would be to use the Window holders such as is used on steam cars. It would be an easy matter to fit the brass ratchet pieces to the side of the frames and putting the thumb piece on the lower part of the sill. An arrangement like this on both sides would materially help the ventilation problem.\n\nYours obedient servant\n\nJohn A. Gilling\n\nA. J. Boyd Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nCanaus,\nC.B.,\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit for your consideration the subject dealt with by Mr. Gillis, Indian teacher, Whycocomagh, N.S., in his letter to me of the 23rd inst., which I enclose herewith.\n\nIt is, no doubt, very important to have the proper ventilation of the teacher's residence in question attended to before the building is completed; and if Mr. Poirrier, the contractor, is undertaking to ignore the specifications in any particular, he should be checked at once by the person appointed to supervise the work of construction. I have not a copy of the specifications, and, therefore, am not in a position to know what they call for with regard to ventilation, but, at any rate, it would appear from what Mr. Gillis states that they are not at all explicit on that point.\n\nAs the building is nearing completion, it seems to me necessary to give this matter prompt attention, and I think the Department's decision in the case should be communicated directly to its building inspector at Whycocomagh.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAstd. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 3, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that the upper sashes in the windows in the teacher's residence at Whycoomagh have not been made to raise and lower on pulleys as provided for in the specifications.\n\nThe Department will expect you to see that these windows are constructed according to the specifications. Be good enough to report with regard to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. B. Waters, Esq.,\nWhycoomagh, O.B.\nOttawa, October 3, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with enclosure from the teacher of the Waytocomagh School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the specifications for the teacher's residence provide for box windows with the necessary hanging styles and the inspector is being written to and informed that the top sash of the windows should be made to raise and lower on pulleys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I may say also that I had come to realize myself that she had hardly received fair value for her property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

Waters\nDear Sir:\n\nThe teacher's residence at Whycongannah was completed on the 21st Oct. The inspector examined the work on that date and found everything satisfactory. He told me he would notify the department that the building was completed and he told me he would mail that day but I did not hear from the department as yet and as the insurance is up on the 25th this month I would like to hear from them before that date as should anything happen to the building after that date and before I get my check I may have some trouble to get paid.\n\nP.S. I wrote to tell John A.

He did the work well, and, I regret, without profit to himself.\n\nPlease give the matter your kind attention, and oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nD. C.

MacDonald) brought to my notice the condition of the teacher's residence as a recent storm had torn shingles off a large part of the roof and damaged the remaining part. The rain now comes through the roof and although the teacher made temporary repairs, unless the roof is repaired as soon as possible, the rain will ruin the interior of the building. When I was there, the teacher had cans and other dishes to catch the rain that came through the roof.\n\nThe same storm which damaged the roof of the house (as well as many buildings in Whycocomagh) also damaged the roof of the barn. In each case, it was only one side of each building that was damaged. The roof of the barn is beyond repairing as far as shingles is concerned and I would strongly recommend that it, although the building is not now used by the teacher, be also reshingled. I have made a rough estimate of the cost and consider that about $100.00 is required to reshingle the roofs, purchase the required nails and pay for labour.\n\nShingles can be procured by having the Indians get logs and have them sawn into shingles by William Young who has a sawmill on the Reserve, so that in this manner the funds would mostly remain with the Indians. I strongly recommend that, for the sake of the buildings, this be authorized as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. C. MacNeil\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant you may arrange for the shingling of the teacher's residence at the Whycocomagh Indian Day School. It is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that all the work will be done by Indians.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to pay any amount for reroofing the barn. It is noted that this building is not used and consequently there is no reason why any expense should be incurred in connection with it. I believe it would be advisable to have the building torn down and those Indians who do the work should be given the lumber for repairing their houses or other buildings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. C. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N. S.\nGlendale, N.S.\nJune 20th, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 53-2-8, dated May 21st, authorizing shingling of the teacher's residence at the Whyocomagh Indian Day School. The work will be completed in the near future as Indians are employed at it now.\n\nIt is noted that the Department is not prepared to pay for reshingling the roof of the barn, especially as it is not now used and recommend that it be torn down and let the Indians who do the work have the lumber for building repairs etc. I have discussed the matter with Mr. MacDonald (the teacher at Whyocomagh) and we considered that it would be a pity to have the building torn down as so much of the material would be unfit for further use. Mr. MacDonald told me that he would make further consideration and yesterday he came to see me and said that Mr. William Young, an Indian who owns a sawmill and lives near the barn says that, if he is given the building for his own use and as his property, he will saw lumber for the Indians (from their own logs) to the amount of $35.00. I consider this a better method as Mr. Young will repair the barn at his own expense and those who require sawing of lumber for their buildings will fare of better then by using the second-hand lumber obtained by tearing the building down. I recommend this.\n\nW.C. Mac Neil\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 2, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the barn at the Whycocomagh Indian Day School.\n\nProvided you are satisfied that William Young will give $35.00 in value to the Indians, in view of the fact that the Department is allowing him the use of the barn, your suggestion is approved. The only phase of the matter that is not quite clear to me is, - where will the Indians secure the logs which Young will cut for them? I believe it is only his intention to do the actual cutting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend A. C. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N. S.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Teacher's residence, Whyccoomagh Reserve, N.S.\n\nI attach herewith a letter received from William B. Young, an Indian of Whyccoomagh Reserve, N.S., explaining the present condition of the teacher's residence on that reserve and offering to purchase it from the Department.\n\nOn receipt of his letter, I asked him what amount he was willing to pay for it and in reply he stated that he was prepared to pay One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) cash.\n\nHis statements regarding the condition of the house is correct and while I am of the opinion that his offer of $100.00 is low for the amount of material which is still serviceable, especially on the interior of the building, I feel that this is about all he can afford to pay. The building has not been occupied by a teacher since 1943 and it is quite possible that it will not be used for its original purpose in the future as it is very badly in need of repairs and unsuitable for anyone to live in, in its present condition. If it is the intention of the Department to dispose of this building, as part of the centralization plan, I recommend that Mr. Young's offer be accepted.\n\nF.B. McKinnon, Indian Agent.\nI wish to make application again for the teacher's residence here, on the grounds that within another year, it will be a total loss. If in doubt come and see it for yourself. Animals are living in it. This year all the windows are smashed, the ceiling inside smashed and above all the roof is gone. That is, the rain pours in, running inside. The exterior is all right, so there is a chance yet to put it in shape but if left another year it will be a total loss. But I don't want this for nothing; however, I would like to get it at a reasonable price. I find that my house is too small so I have a large family, adding to this, my son has returned from the seminary, I might say they we shall have to sleep in the same room. For the past couple of years teachers have not occupied this house. I trust you will forward to the Dept my request with your strong recommendation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour faithfully,\n\nWm. B.

McKinnon, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Agency, Province of Nova Scotia, has received an offer of $100.00 for the building formerly used as a teacher's residence on the Whycocomagh Reserve.\n\nThis building is stated to be in very bad condition and the offer mentioned above has been received from an Indian who intends to tear it down and use the lumber.\n\nAs the Indians on this reserve are gradually moving over to the new reserve at Eskasoni, a teacher's residence is not required.

This is quite a serious matter to him. He had the impression at first that he would draw the provincial grant just the same as if he were teaching in any other school in the province. His grant would be about $80.\n\nHave you a regulation register for the school? If so please forward one as he is at present keeping record of school on an old provincial register.\n\nCan white children be allowed to attend this school and if so on what arrangement?\n\nI also enclose Bills for Stationery for store books etc. supplied to school. The teacher advises me that they will shortly want other books, pens, ink, and flat rulers.\n\nYours &c.,\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\n[Stamp]\n\nChief Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL TEACHER.\n\nTHE LETTER WAS SENT\n\nOTTAWA 5th January 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the Shubenacadie Indian School; and in reply I have to say:\n\n1st. That by an arrangement made with the Provincial Gov't, most all Indian Schools in Nova Scotia are placed under the supervision of the Provincial County School Inspector, who visits such schools semi-annually and reports the result of their inspection to the Department through their Governors, which may probably meet the requirements and entitle the teacher to the Provincial Grant.\n\n2nd. With regard to the question of allowing white children to attend this school I have to say that the Department will not object to their attending provided the number taken will not interfere with the teaching of the Indian pupils, and the Department would be glad to be informed of the terms upon which you think they should be admitted.\n\nRequisitions for school material required should be made out by the teacher and forwarded to you for transmission to the Department on the forms enclosed herewith. The Department would like you to\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\ncheck such Requisitions and see that no articles are asked for which are not required by the Programme of Studies on the back of the Register which is also transmitted herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the School at Indian Brook, I have to ask for information regarding County Grant or money which became payable at the end of the School year.\n\nThe teacher has succeeded in obtaining the half-yearly provincial grant to which he was entitled but to enable him to do so, the Inspector found it necessary to levy the Trustees of the white schools in that vicinity upon the half-yearly returns\u2014there being no board of Trustees for the Indian School.\n\nThe Trustees did it in this case to enable the teacher to draw the grant but if it is a necessity it may in future cause trouble as another board of Trustees might not be fit to do so.\n\nYou will understand that teachers are entitled to and draw this provincial grant when teaching according to their grade and the school sections have nothing whatever to do with it but with the County Grant it is different, it being a grant paid from the County funds to the Trustees of the different school sections in proportion to the average of attendance made by each school to be used for any school purpose to which the said trustees find necessary to apply it and is of course applied with sectional money to the payment of teachers salaries and other expenses of schools. This paid over by County Treasurers to Trustees on certificate of inspection as to attendance which certificate is I believe made by the Inspector from annual returns signed by the Trustees.\n\nAs I have already stated there is no board of Trustees for the Indian School. Therefore no one to sign returns and receive this County grant as provided by law.\nThe questions that present themselves to my mind are:\n\n1. Who is to receive the County grant?\n2. Who is to sign the returns to entitle the trustees to draw the provincial grant, and to entitle the Section or rather the Indian School to the County grant, in case the trustees of the White School decline (at any time) to sign?\n3. Can I not act in place of Board of Trustees for the Indian School and if so what steps must be taken to have the Inspector and provincial boards accept my signature to returns in lieu of board of Trustees?\n\nI leave the honour to be so\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames Cass\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Sup't Gen'l of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant relative to the claim of the Indians of the Indian School at Indian Brook, Shubenacadie, to share in the Provincial and County Roads and bridges, I have to say that the Department has no means of knowing how much grants are to be obtained, and although it has no objection to his share, in the present state of the fund, it would be justified in laying any claim thereon.\n\nIf white pupils are attending the school as was suggested in your letter of the 26th July, there would be no difficulty in his receiving the amount he is entitled to, and he should state the number of such pupils on his next return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant relative to the claim of the Board of the Indian School at Indian Rock, Shubenacadie, to share in the Provincial and County Councils and what steps should be taken so that he may receive the same, I beg to say that the Board has no means of knowing how such grants can be obtained, and although it has no objection to his sharing in the same if he so felt, feel that it would be justified in his not doing so.\n\nIf other pupils are attending the school as was suggested in our last of the 29th July there should be no difficulty in his receiving the amount he is entitled to, and he should state the number of such pupils on his next return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\n\nIndian Affairs,\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSir,\n\nThe teachers at Indian Brook Reserve asks for instructions as to when holidays should commence and end in Summer Season in Indian Schools.\n\nHe also asks for pamphlet or Indian School laws or general directions if any is printed.\n\nCould teacher commence School three weeks earlier than usual and take that time in Sept and October?\n\nYours Obdly Servt\n\nJames Gare\nInd agt\n\nThe Dep Sup Ind Org Ind Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo, and in reply to the enquiries contained therein I beg to say that the rule of the Department with regard to holidays is that all the teachers of Indian schools should adapt the periods for vacation to the times when the Indians with their families leave the Reserve for the purpose of hunting, fishing or berry-picking etc., provided they engage in such pursuits and if they do not, vacations may be at the usual time they are taken by the teachers of Public Schools. The whole number of holidays taken during the year must not exceed 45 days exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays. Immediately before the teacher closes the school for vacation he should inform you of the fact in writing and also when the school is re-opened. The Department would like you to see that this Regulation is strictly complied with.\n\nRegulations governing Indian Schools are in course of preparation and when printed a copy will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt :Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJan: Cass, Esq:\nIndian Agent\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE TRUSTEES\n\nOf Section, No. Term ended July 5, 1893.\n\nAmount from County School Fund to which this Section is entitled is in full $2765.\n\nComposed of the following items:\n\n1. In respect of services rendered by Teacher for 157 days.................$1748\n2. In respect of the average number of Pupils as compared with the average number in attendance in all the Schools of County (or District)......................$1017\n\nTotal as above...........$2765\n\nThis sum the Treasurer has been directed to pay to the Trustees on their written order on being presented with the Inspector's Certificate that your section has complied with the law in relation to furnishing complete School Returns, and is entitled to draw its allotment of the County School Fund.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\n\n*This Memorandum is to be preserved by the Trustees.*\nSir,\n\nEnclose Looms & Cash Twenty Seven Dollars and Sixty Five Cents being part of County Grant to our Indian School and for Means for Instructing Enrolled Indians.\n\nAs you will notice this is a grand deal to erect School in this Province in proportion to the number of days attendance.\n\nTo obtain this Grant it is necessary for the Trustees of each Section to make Returns to the County Inspector and Certify the Same.\n\nOur School is unfortunately situated in the midst of a Board of Trustees and to obtain this Grant I had to get the Trustees of this Section in which the Indian School is situated to sign such returns and the Inspector readily accepted the same, as though they were regular trustees of the School and gave the full payment.\n\nBut you must see that the School is in a peculiar position in this respect because at the end of the next year the Board of Trustees may not be willing to sign a little bit more, and in fact it was difficult to get the late Board to sign as they see the grant to Schools being proportionately divided among all schools the Indians held to Indian Schools leads to a reduction of amounts received by them.\n\nIn this connection although the Indians promised the School supplied with wood they have claimed that the supplies the School with fuel and I am afraid they will not be able to do so. And for this reason I was anxious to secure this Grant in case we find it necessary to supply them with fuel.\n\nPlease advise me in this matter.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nNo. 2897\n\nOriginal, for the Depositor.\n\nBank of Montreal,\n\n$21.65\n\nReceived from J.

I have not told Mr. Baro that I have written and you need not mention it to him; if you please as he is friendly, but just say 'hey the teacher the bo. Money or give me a note to him to get it.' Or perhaps there are other Indian schools in this province, or not too far off that may want a teacher. I told the Sisters that I would pay them something if they signed returns which I intended to send them out of this, and if I don't do it and they do not sign again no bounty. Money or Provincial Money will be paid next year. Please let me have a favourable answer soon. It is somewhat hard to get the Indians to get the wood for fires at the school which Mr. Gass says they must do.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRobert J. Logan.\n\nIndian Reserve\nTo Mr. Logan,\nDecember 3rd, 1885\n\nTo the Dept. of Ind. Affairs Gentlemen:\n\nYou will probably think this letter out of place, nonetheless I risk to write hoping for a favourable division from you.\n\nWhen I agreed with Mr. Gass Ind. Agt. to teach, I mentioned salary from section when I had last taught, but said I will work the school in with the other public schools and draw the Provincial Grant (paid to teachers according to their grades), and the County Grant (paid to teachers, you are aware); these monies added to the $240 from the Govt. just willing the salary to between $300 & $400. Mr. Gass replied \"Get what you can besides what we are paying you from Ind. Dept.\"\n\nThe teacher at Cow Bay runs her school\nThat way, as she told me before I came here, drawing these grants and so helping the school along. Of course, I got $75 Provincial Money a year, or my bonus when teaching a public school, but I stipulated with Mr. Bass for the County Money which is about $28 for what time I taught last year from 17th Nov. to the 6th July or the summer holidays. Mr. Bass got an order from my trustees and drew this money and told me he had to ask the Ind. Dept., what way he would lay it out or what he would do with it. Perhaps this was right but I have felt very much disappointed. There would not have been one cent of this money drawn had I not had the school connected with the adjoining school section of East Indian Road, adjacent\n\nand talked and followed up their trustees and with hard work got them to sign papers so it was possible to draw this money.\n\nIt would be some incentive to try and work the school up and keep it together if this money were allowed as expected, for the money drawn is in proportion to day taught average attendance etc. I had the Inspector for the County visit and inspect the school\u2014wrote to him about it myself. It is a real pleasure to have Col. W. Roscoe M.A. visit the school. He is a real gentleman. He expressed himself pleased with the school. I am learning the dialect as I go along, have got a number of words and phrases already, and the Indians say that I\nMEMORANDUM in reference to the application of Mr Robert J Logan, teacher of the Shubanacadie Indian School, for the sum of $27.50, the amount granted to this school by the County School Fund, and which has been received by the Department and placed to the credit of the Band.\n\nThe undersigned begs to say that under the Regulations governing schools in Nova Scotia Mr Logan, the teacher of this school, would appear to be entitled to this grant, and he therefore recommends that the same be paid him.\n\n[Signature]\n\n15.1.96\nOTTAWA 17th January 1896\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 5th November last, I beg to say that a Cheque for the sum of $27.50 granted to the Shubenacadie Indian School by the County School Fund of Nova Scotia, has been forwarded to Mr Robert J.

I am, however, to say that the Department regrets that our dissatisfaction should exist because of this matter, as it is pleased to learn from various sources that Mr. Logan is very successful in his work, and it considers that it would be a very great pity were it to lose his services on account of clerical interference.\n\nThe Department would have no objection to the priest giving religious instruction personally at stated periods.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nJames Cass, Esq.:\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOttawa.\n\nJuly 27th, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of 9th May last, regarding religious instruction at the Shubenacadie School, I beg to say that as all the Indians of Nova Scotia are returned as Roman Catholics they are entitled to have teachers of their own faith, and as Mr. Logan who has successfully carried on this school is now stated to be a Protestant the Department does not think that it would be advisable to re-engage him for that school, much as it would like to retain his services.

Mr. Scott's approval - it is found upon closer search that there is not a Protestant School in the Maritime Provinces.\n\nHayter Viers\nShubenacadie, July 30th, 1894\n\nJames Gass Esq\nIndian Agent\n\nSir,\n\nI hardly know what to say in your communication respecting my dismissal as teacher to the Indians here. You know you had hard work to get a suitable person to take charge of the school; very few caring for such a situation.\n\nI was, I may say, fooled into accepting it, thinking it might be a permanent job. Being a man of family having a wife and six children to support, I hoped to keep the place a few years; accordingly I brought my family and household stuff over forty miles at a considerable expense, as you know, hired a house and settled down to work; now, because I am a Protestant, up it all goes.\n\nI have been on good terms with both the Indians and their priest and I never attempted to instil any Protestant ideas, whatever I may have said I was sure was not contrary to the R. Catholic creed and in accordance with moral morality.\n\nI hope, therefore, that you may influence the Department to reconsider the matter and unless there may be very strong objection by the R. Priest or Indians I may be instructed to resume work again soon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRobert J. Logan\nChub-wa-ka-du Aug 3rd 1896\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your July 28th no 120076 I enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. B. Regan the teacher.\n\nI very much regret the circumstances and feel it will not be an easy matter to replace Mr. Regan and on his account I particularly regret it as it is certainly a hardship to him to be thus summarily dismissed from his employment after having taken it and removing here with his family that he might be able to live at his whole funds in this country. However, we succeeded in getting the school and with a fair measure of success and at this late date it will now be impossible for him to secure a school for the next year.\n\nWhen we started the Indian School here and were looking for a teacher I applied to the priest asking if he knew of a teacher whom he could recommend and he could not name anyone in fact he thought it useless to try and have the school and now after he has not promised any assistance with the school and we have made a success of it without his assistance I cannot suppose that he would take any objection to the teacher on account of his being a protestant unless he had some well founded cause of complaint and was able to substitute a better man as teacher. As I have stated the decision will be a hardship to Mr. Regan and I will be pleased to have your further instructions before I positively dismiss him.\n\nFrom,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames [Last Name]\nShubenacadie Aug 17/96\n\nSchools in the province reopen on\nthe 25th inst.\nPlease advise me whether or not\nMrs Logan shall reopen the School at\nthis Reserve or to be dismissed.\nI do not know of any other teacher\nto take charge of the School.\n\nJames Shaw\n191\n\nThe Deputy Sect'ry of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant, I have to say that as you are unable to secure another teacher to reopen the Shubenacadie School after the summer holidays you may re-engage Mr. Logan, but the Department would like you to make some arrangement with the priest for religious instruction or some arrangement as to Mr. Logan teaching the pupils their catechism.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJames Cass, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMEMORANDUM: for the Acting Sect.-Genl.

Since he kept the boys away from school they send them over and down about the house that if the scholars go down for water or play them at races or something his right hand backguard them. This must not go on. The other Indians want me to draw up a petition to send up to government asking that I be kept there in the school for five years yet.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRobert J. Lyon\n\nRe:\n\nKeep quiet about this.\n\nA. Wallace Esq.,\nIndian Agent\n\nSir,\n\nI have had some trouble lately in connection with one Indian at the reservation in connection with the school; and as it has not been the first or second time, I thought it proper to seek the Department for advice with regard to him.\n\nThe fellow's name is Stephen Maloney. He lives close to the school and has sent two boys, Frank and Stephen, pretty regularly to the school and they have done quite well.\n\nOld Stephen, as you know, was once chief over a year ago, but the most of those on the reserve do not accept him as such, and called for another election; this makes Stephen very bitter and jealous, thinking he threatens to shoot others who don't like him.\nOne day I called his boy Frank back to his seat for not leaving the room in a proper manner and he kept him and the other one home for a time and sent some others off home who were coming to the school. Another time he came over to the school house before school time because he thought that Mr. Donald's school was complaining about his boys fighting. This time nothing and getting along altogether disagreeable. Frank makes the trouble he learns well and I could manage him easily but the old Red won't be reasonable. Frank wants to fight whenever he can make it out whenever he can get a weaker one to put upon. He has been fighting and carrying on a good deal lately and some were keeping children home. One girl has been kept home nearly the whole winter on account of Frank as I have been told. This girl told at home that Frank was acting unusually with another little girl at the school; this I can scarcely believe as I was present most of the time when they were attacked and the little ones as well as the older ones can tell or state the truth.\n\nHowever, one day lately I observed Frank imposing on young Mr. Donald and I called him in, took him by the collar, slightly shook him, and told him he must keep quiet charging him to leave Mr. Donald's house going home. As soon as they got on the road he pushed the boy about and fought with him until they got to Maloney's road. Next morning I called Frank up and administered three or four cuts of the rod to his legs with a small rod.\n\nOld Sliper promptly kept them home and came out to the road for a row with me talked of fight somewhat, but kept off a good distance. One Indian, Philip Henry, told me he was down to Wolfe to procure my dismissed dog. As he is a rather bad Indian throwing things about when drunk, I want\nEnclosed you will please find a letter to me from Mr Logan the Teacher at the Indian School here, which will explain itself. I have done all I can in way of persuasion with the Indians mentioned in Mr Logan's letter, and after making investigation I am sorry to say that things went as stated by Mr Logan.\n\nThis is the first time Stephen Maloney has been complained of to me as being the worse of them. I have long known him as one of the troublesome spirits on the reservation.\n\nI allow know him to be guilty of indiscretions not mentioned by Mr L. whereof he was a white man would get him into trouble.\n\nMr Logan is a gentleman respected by all his acquaintance here and one whose word can be relied on to the fullest extent and none until now has he complained.\n\nAnd I believe he has won his way into the affections of the Indians of the reservation unlike most of the other Indians could do anything to have him kept they would do so willingly.\n\nPlease inform me what my duty is in this case and oblige you humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nShubuwaoodi April 18th 1877\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing a letter from the teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian school complaining of the conduct of an Indian named Stephen Maloney; and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like you to warn Maloney must cease. This it renders him liable to prosecution, but as the Department does not wish to proceed to extremities, it trusts that this warning will have the desired effect. If not he will be prosecuted.\n\nCareful watch should be kept in order to secure, if possible, the conviction of parties supplying liquor to Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq:\nIndian Agent\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nthe bad conduct of one of the Indians in this reservation some time since to the Agent here. It was this way; A boy named Frank Maloney was making a bother at the school fighting. I remonstrated with him to little purpose than threat and finally used the rod (two other cuts over the backs of the legs) and the father took him out of school. He met me a couple of days after and was saying talking about fight they say he is a fighter but he kept his distance and I was not anxious to try my hands on him at the same time felt quite safe. The other Indians thought I would not stick it the house over night alone again.\nI did stay however but kept a little firewood against any surprise or mischief in the night. He never came to bother me but has been doing his best to get the priest to the school to see him in getting me dismissed. Father Young is a sensible man and knows it is a little difficult to get a teacher to go among the Indians here; he also knows that I am working and doing what I can for the little fellows and have acquired considerable of the language which is very helpful and although we are of different churches yet he is very friendly and don't hate to Maloney. What I want to say is that if Maloney is not stopped at this threatened withdrawal from the Reserve a something of the kind, that after a time others of the tribe may follow his example and very much injure the school. This is one of the Micmac Centres in Nova Scotia, there being a chapel and a school house and the Indians say (I have heard several remark it) \"A great lot more Indians would dwell there only for Maloney.\" One fellow said to me not long ago, \"Every one of them is frightened of him,\" and I believe it.\n\nNow, lieutenant, I am satisfied to stay and work the school if you are... But will you kindly stop this fellow's mouth. If he is let go on and succeed against me he will not be very long before he tries the same on some one else and discipline will be a thing of the past.\n\nYours very truly\n\nRobert J. Logan\nTeacher\nOTTAWA 10th August 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have to call your attention to official letter of the 29th April last in which you were requested to warn Stephen Maloney, an Indian of Shubanacadie, that he must cease creating a disturbance at the Shubanacadie school, as such conduct renders him liable to prosecution.\n\nA letter has since been received from the teacher, Mr Logan, renewing his complaints regarding Maloney's conduct. The Department would like to be informed what action you have taken in the matter of the complaints referred to, as Maloney's misconduct must be put a stop to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ D McLEAN\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq:\nIndian Agent\nShubanacadie, N.S.\nOTTAWA 10th Augst 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo complaining of the conduct of Stephen Maloney, an Indian of Shubanaacdie who is, you state, interfering with your duties as teacher of the Indian school; and in reply I beg to say that Mr Agent Wallace will be instructed to warn Maloney that any further interference or threats on his part will lead to his being prosecuted for breach of the peace.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

Rev Mr Young of Eyful called on R J Logan (teacher of Shubenacadie School) and stated to him that Stephen Maloney had had a conference with Archbishop O'Brien, endeavouring through him to get Mr Logan removed and have his place filled with a catholic teacher, and came with him a petition signed by Indians of the reservation to that effect\u2014or so he claimed\u2014but on Mr Young's inquiries into the matter he informed Mr Logan he had ascertained that signature on that petition was either forged or there was a misunderstanding as some denied having signed the petition.\n\nThe Rev Guttenman then stated to Mr Logan that he had a conference with his superior, Archbishop O'Brien and informed him that he had every reason to believe that the action of Stephen Maloney in this matter was wholly owing to his account of his boy having been disciplined by Mr Logan some time ago.\n\nHe also stated he had even a letter from Archbishop O'Brien to Chief Hall asking that he assist in every way to protect Mr Logan and render any assistance which lay in his power to carry out good order in the school. This because the Rev Mr Young has given him satisfactory report concerning Mr Logan and that he recently was giving good satisfactory report without any reports etc.\n\nIn conclusion of the above Mr Logan has requested me that I inform the Department concerning these matters and respectfully submit.\nSubmit these matters for your consideration.\n\nadvises at the same time that some action be taken to prevent further trouble of this kind.\n\nStates as his reasons for making this request:\n\nthat children be left alone naturally Baloney eventually would intermingle into the other Indians minds mischief which would culminate in trouble in the school and materially affect the new too small attendance at that institution.\n\nI am in your most obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nIndiannary\nSudbury N.S.\nOTTAWA 1st September 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the third ultimo; with further reference to the complaints made by Stephen Valoney against Mr. J.

If you will grant me this, I promise you I will not again ask an increase while you are pleased to retain me in your service as teacher in an Indian school.\n\nI think I have given pretty good satisfaction during the time I have been here. The Indians and others who have visited us expressed themselves pleased.\n\nOne cannot get regular attendance at all, but I have some reading the French Royal Reader very well, writing a little in a good hand and in fair English, adding, subtracting, and multiplying vulgar fractions, making out Bills &c. This in three years and a fraction is not bad.\n\nIt is not an easy job altogether; a great deal of patience, firmness, coolness &c is required, they are so excitable. Once in a while I hear of some old man threatening to shoot me if I use the rod slightly. One fellow asked me about a book that his boy was blamed for cutting a short time ago and kept his jackknife in his hand and talked very much, not allowing me to explain. I don't do any fighting or boxing but used to like a little boxing in my young days and I feel quite safe here.\n\nTry and allow me this small request and I shall be most grateful.\n\nYour respectfully,\n\nRobert J. Logan\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, making application for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Shubenacadie school; and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your length of service and the good results obtained by you, the Department will consent to increase your salary to $300 from the 1st of July next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nRobert J. Logan, Esq.,\nTeacher Indian school,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nTo the Deptt. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI would like to have better attendance at the school. I spoke some time ago to the clergymen who officiate at the chapel here about it, but he seemed to think it all right just as it was.\n\nHe said \"I spoke to one of the women about sending her children to the school, and she answered I haven't clothes fit to send them to school in; have nothing for them to eat in.\" The Native Young, thinks it is of not much use to say much to them about it; the fact is he don't care whether they come to school or not. I like to get all the showing up, the teaching, on these things, the directions that you can give me. I will offer a suggestion; would it not be right to impress upon Agent Wallace, quite forcibly, that he must do all he can to better the attendance at school by talking to the Indians and others. If you think it would do good (I think it might) tell him please, that he must see to it, not mentioning I had anything to insist it. Inspector Rossie was in on the 19th inst., and there was not much of a showing, only six boys present and most of them in first grade. Will you be so kind as to send me an account of his report? I would like to see it. I guess he would find no fault with anything but the attendance. I do not know whether it would be of any use to write further. Let it go. Yours, a net. [signature]\n\nW. E. Henry, Enfield, N.S.\n\nI mean to try all I can in visiting, and talking to better affairs. If one bear, or enough to keep order, he insults some of them. If you really do not punish, but just threaten a little sometimes, they will get them back upward down the school. Some time ago, Malony, a kind of a chief, took his out of\nschool because I would not allow his boy to fight. I first used persuasion with the boy but he would fight with a smaller boy, punching him continuously; then I threatened him with the rod, he allowed and said to the other that his father was chief, and that he would fight as much as he liked. I punished him with the rod, and let the two boys be, he has not sent them since, although a little girl has attended some.\n\nA book was cut with a knife this last winter and the job was blamed on a boy. I did not take the word of the pupils about it, but merely said \"If I knew who cut the book I would beat him for he deserves it.\" The boy went home and said that he had been blamed for cutting a book and the teacher said he was going to beat him. The father of the boy, Mr. Donald replied that if the teacher beat his boy, if he could not beat him with his hands he would put a bullet through him. Mr. Donald sent his boy up to town to school, for a time, but he is about here now, not attending school. I have heard that the Bow Bay school, Halifax Co., N.S. is to be closed on account of there being no pupil there to attend it. When the boys were in prison, the priest wrote up that he wanted very much to leave the R.C. catechism & taught to the Indian children, thinking to have me dismissed and a R.C. put in my place. I agreed to have a class in the Catechism and teach it at noon 15 minutes. If you do not wish clergymen coming in here and about taking charge as Mr. Young did once having acted & will you send an order printed to that effect so I might show it if you think it right.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nRobert J. Logan\n\nP.S. No one reported Mr. Donald as having acted very badly with me here last winter, threatening to shoot me and taking his boy out of the school house and sending him away to town school for tuition, and the Department is beating or killing him to put up a bear. Please may Wallace order him to send his boy to this school, and behave himself when you are so kind to him.\nOTTAWA, 27th June, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the attendance at the Shubenacadie school; and in reply I beg to say that all Agents in the eastern provinces have received instructions to enforce the Departmental regulations requiring the compulsory education of Indians children when necessary after the summer holidays.\n\nThe Department cannot comply with your request to be furnished with a copy of Mr Public School Inspector Ross's report on your school, as such reports are considered as confidential.

I would also like it, but I am afraid we shall be disappointed, if we expect a much better attendance this summer.\n\nThere are, we may say, six families on this reserve now; but before the end of the present week, there may not be that many.\n\nThere are eight children of school age in the place at present. Five of these are pretty well grown, over twelve and up to fifteen years. The old ones find these big ones useful to run and beg milk or gather mayflowers to sell.\n\nI walk around among them and do what I can to get them out and succeed in a measure. They are poor and improvident, the children are very often hungry; in cold weather their clothing and shoes are so poor that they do not protect them from the frost.\n\nThis reserve is five miles, or three-fourths from a railway and they do not like to travel over these five miles of dirt\u2014they do not care how far it is in the car\u2014so they incline to get near the Railway and leave this place doubly.\n\nI think the principal thing that keeps them here at all is the church\u2014they have a pretty good one here\u2014\nThey like to sing and pray; and perhaps it does them good; most likely they would be much more wicked without it.\n\nThey would not agree to find the money for the school, and after you granted pray to get that, the young fellows would stay home if I asked them to help at it. Then I took to calling it all myself, merely asking them to carry it in still they don't attend well.\n\nThey talk sometimes and say that they ought to have a Catholic to teach them; they had Catholic teachers at Cow Bay near Dartmouth and the school went down for all that. The Indians did not find it a real easy place to live in.\n\nI think it somewhat of a problem to solve; the un-enlightenment, civilizing making farmers and useful citizens of the Micmacs. We will keep on trying, but they will never be as much for use as common, I am afraid.\n\nPerhaps, if you would send John Noel, the chief here, a letter telling him that he must do his best to have the people send their children to school or you would have another man put in his place; it might have a good effect. Tell him that if he worked well in this way so that he would be kept in the chief office a long time. He is as good a man as they can get.\n\nWill you please do this and oblige.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nRobert J. Logan\nTeacher\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSlubenaacade, Nants co.,\nMay 2nd,\n1902\n\nDear Sir: In answer to your correspondence in regard to the school at Indian Brook reserve, I may say that I have talked the matter over with Mr. Logan the teacher & enclose a letter from him the contents of which I quite agree with and in which he explains the case more fully than I could do.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Agent.\n\nSCHOOL.\nOTTAWA, 12th May, 1902\n\nChief,\n\nThe Department regrets to see that the attendance at the Shubenacadie Indian school is not what it should be and it would like you to use your influence with the members of the Band to induce them to send their children to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nChief John Noah,\nIndian Brook Reserve\nShubenacadie,\nN.S.\nTo the Deptt. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Canada\n\nIndian Reserves,\nShubenacadie,\nMarch 15th, 1903\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I ask a favour of you? I have heard you say, \"Take away, but we want permission to sell.\" Will it be this way? I have been teaching somewhere between twenty and thirty years nearly\u2014twelve in White schools and over eight years in this Indian school. I am married, and have been raising a family of six\u2014three girls and three boys\u2014educating them as well as possible under the circumstances, so that one girl is teaching, and the second has a B certificate, hoping to get a C this summer. Two girls and a boy are attending school steadily. My two eldest boys are working at farming. I don't think that I am an old man, but I will be fifty-eight next summer, and no money ahead; could not save any. There are two or three hundred acres of crown land near the reserve, which if I had, I might with the help of my boys make a home, where I could live out my days. The local government granted me 100 acres, now if you would be pleased to grant me 200 acres or even 100 acres as the Lord justifies, I would have enough area for a small farm. It would be easy to arrange with the crown lands office at Halifax about it. They charge 40 cents per acre for such land as this. It has very little wood on it that would make lumber or shingles. Is it practicable? It would repay my heart. Help to follow out. And for you, your petition will be in duty bound, forever grateful.\n\nYou most humble and obedient servant,\n\nRobert J. Logan\n\nP.S. I want this land for a home, not to sell.\nOTTAWA, 19th February, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant asking that the Department recognize your services as teacher by giving you a grant of land; and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot see its way to complying with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary\n\nR.J. Logan, Esq.\nTeacher of Indian School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nStubenacade, Hants Co.\nJune 1st 1903\n\n243705\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nSir, I wish to inform you that the school on the Indian Reserve is closed at this time as no attendance. The teacher goes to the school every day the children went very irregular and have now stopped all together. I must say it is almost impossible to get them to attend & it does seem like an useless expenditure awaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge Wallace\n\nTo the Dept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 6th June, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Agent Wallace calls the Department's attention to the very unsatisfactory condition of the Shubenacadie school where the attendance has been very irregular for some time and at the date of his report had stopped altogether. The average at this school has been less than 4 for the past two years. About a year ago Chief Noel was asked to use his influence with the members of the Band to induce them to send their children to school. No results seem to have followed this appeal and it is a question whether it would not be better to close the school at the end of the current quarter. It might, however, be given another chance for, say, six months on the condition that if a marked improvement does not take place by the Christmas holidays the school will then be finally closed.\n\nThere are about 17 of school age on the Xxxxxxx roll, half of whom are transients, while the census return shows about 20 children who could attend.\n\nFor many years before the opening of the school in '94 the Indians were making constant appeals for the education of their children. The Department put up a new schoolhouse at a cost of\n$600.00 and their present teacher was appointed on the opening of the school and has been there ever since.\n\nWhat is wanted here is the enforcement of the Regulations. The Public School Inspector's last report suggests that all children of school age be compelled to attend and says that the teacher is doing as well as he can under the circumstances. I would therefore suggest that the regulations be enforced after the holidays and if this does not have the desired effect that the school be closed at Christmas; and that the teacher and the Indians be so informed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 6/03\nOTTAWA, 6th June, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant reporting that the Shubenacadie school is at present closed for want of attendance; and in reply I beg to inform you that you should notify the Indians and the teacher that when this school re-opens after the summer holidays the Regulations for the compulsory attendance of the children will be enforced and the Department will hold you responsible for carrying out these instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nAlonza Wallace, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nThis certificate states that the School on Indian Reserve, Shubenacadie, was closed by my order from the fifth day of April 1903 to the seventeenth day of April 1903 on account of Epidemic of Whooping Cough.\n\nE.M. Lea M.D.\nIndian School\nSt. John's, N.S.\nSept. 1st, 1905\n\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYou have seen by the return that there is a small attendance at this school for some time. There are only eight families that have now paid the term fees, with seven or eight skeletons of school age attending so irregularly that this is only an average of three more or less.\n\nThe Indians here do not take to farming; there is only one who is at all interested in it. They make their living mostly by basket making, handiwork, and sewing. I do not think that the settlement will increase, nor the school be any better.\n\nIt was quite unhealthy for a time when there were from a dozen to half a dozen attending, now it is difficult to see five days without a pupil.\n\nThey are no better off now, and I am obliged to work when I cannot get pupils in any way they request. We don't want a Catholic to teach our children.\n\nI have been nearly 12 years teaching in this school, and as it is getting so small I thought I would make a proposition to you; let me close the school at the end of the quarter, pay me for the time I have served, and give me expenses, as a kind of pension to help me out. Then after a couple of years if they want the school started again open up again with a Catholic teacher and see if it will be any better. This would ease me down and save the Department a few hundred dollars. What do you say further? You know what is best. I will continue on as I have been doing, if you say so; but I think what I have suggested would be the best for all concerned.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRobert J. Logan\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 18th September, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Robert J. Logan, teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian school, intimates his willingness to resign if the Department will allow him a year's salary. I may say in connection with this offer on Mr Logan's part that he has been in charge of this school for over ten years and that through no fault of his the school has been going from bad to worse as regards attendance until last year the average had dwindled down to about three. The Agent was written to a couple of years ago and instructed to notify the Indians and the teacher when the school re-opened after the summer holidays that the regulations for compulsory attendance would be enforced and that the Department would hold him responsible for carrying out these instructions. The school is doing no good and should be closed, as it is only wasting money keeping it open. It is for the Department to say whether it will grant Mr Logan any gratuity or not.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nFor Mr. Macdonald,\nPoveshell.\nOTTAWA, 20th September 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant stating that you are willing to resign your position as teacher of the Shubenacadie school if the Department will allow you one year's salary; and in reply I beg to say that it cannot accept your offer, as no provision is made for gratuities for teachers of Indian schools.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that the school should be closed and it has decided to discontinue it after the close of the December quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRobert J. Logan, Esq.\nTeacher of Indian School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOTTAWA, 20th September, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that in view of the fact that the attendance at the Shubenacadie Indian school has been steadily decreasing for some time, the Department has decided to close it at the end of December quarter next, and Mr. R.J. Logan, the teacher, has been advised accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nExtract from \"Remarks\" of teacher on the Sept. quarter return of the Shubenacadie School\n\nIf the Department sees fit to close this school, the teacher would accept another Indian school with a salary of $400.00 per annum.\n\nRobert J. Logan\nTeacher\nShubenacadie Indian School\nOTTAWA, October 11th\u20141905.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to remarks made by you on the September quarter's return for the Shubenacadie School in which you express your willingness to assist another Indian School, should the Department see fit to close the one now under your charge, I beg to say that, as you are all aware, the Indians in the Lower Provinces are Roman Catholics, and they are entitled to have a teacher of their own faith; and as you are a Presbyterian, the Department regrets that it does not see how you could be appointed to any of these schools in these Provinces.\n\nThere is a vacancy at Eskasoni school and our Agent, the Rev. A. Cameron, of Christmas Island, C.P., has been authorized to engage the services of a teacher for the place, and there would be no objection to your making application for the position, provided you explained the fact of your being a Presbyterian to him; but, in any event, the salary would only be at the rate of $300.00 per annum as that is all that is paid voted by Parliament for the purpose. Your present school will have to be closed, as you were already advised, at the end of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.J. Logan, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Reserve,\nShubenacadie, N.S.,\n282830 Oct. 12, 1905\n\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Can.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI thank you for allowing this\nthis school to be continued until the end of\nthe year.\n\nLet not our most excellent gov-\nernment be angry if I ask of your charity\na great favour.\n\nI think there will be rather a\nbetter attendance through the winter than there\nhas been of late; will you not say continue\non until the end of June next?\n\nAll the other schools that pay anything for\nteachers and I will be out in the cold.\n\nI will have a better chance with that.\n\nPlease hear me in this. I will ask no more.\nBy so doing you will greatly oblige.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nR. Ferguson.\nOttawa, 25th October, 1905.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., in which you state that there is a prospect of better attendance during the winter months at the Shubenacadie School and asking that you be allowed to keep it till the 30th June next, and in reply I beg to say that your request will be granted on the distinct understanding that the School must close then. Mr. Agent Wallace will be informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nR. J. Logan, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nOttawa, 25th October, 1905.\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to Departmental letter of the 20th September last I beg to say that Mr. Logan, Teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian School, has asked as a favour that he be allowed to carry on the School till the 30th June next, and, as there is a prospect of the attendance improving slightly during the winter months, the Department has consented to accede to his wishes on the distinct understanding that the School will be finally closed on the 30th June next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nGentlemen:\n\nI thought by the talk of some Indians here at the end of last year that we would have a better attendance during the present half-year; but I was very much mistaken. There seem only eight who could attend but about 3-4 per school day but the greater part of the time we are not there. You said \"The school will be closed at the end of the June quarter.\" It is not worth while running it any longer. Their chief John Noel is one great hindrance to the school. Indians listen to their chief no matter what kind of a fellow he may be; and this old blockhead always talks against the English school. He knows little English himself and can't teach it, and tells the Indians that it is no use to learn it. A number of these Indians now say it would be better to have the Mission teacher, Mission prayers and hymns etc. They are very prone around. Not only the chiefs, the great men, but in a word to encourage them to attend; the fact is, I can do it all myself and so don't trouble yourself. Perhaps if they all would try it might be the same but I think they could help. Anyhow you may expect a very small census for this next.\n\nIs there any other position among the Indians that a man like me might be of use? say looking after their lands, inspecting reserves with regard to sanitation. If you think of anything please let me know.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nR.J. Logan.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ult., reporting on the unsatisfactory condition of the Indian school at Shubenacadie under your charge, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets for your sake that the attendance has fallen off to such an extent as to compel it to close the school on June 30, next, but it knows of no position that could be offered you in its service after the school closes.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Hogan, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nIndian Affairs July 6 1905\n\nReferring to your letter of October 25th 1905 no 120.090 I would say that the school was closed at the time mentioned and I have written the usual quarterly return. I may say also that Mr Logan has not as yet given me the key of the school but an adult will be sent from here next if any further action be necessary or any removal of books or other school property be advisable please inform me.\n\nI am in your obedient servant,\n\nAlonzo Wallace\nAgent for Indians\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., and in reply I beg to say that you should make an inventory of all school supplies handed over to you by the teacher of the Shubenacadie school and forward the same to the Department. Instructions will then be given you as to what disposition is to be made of them.\n\nYou should keep the key of the building in your possession, and the doors should be protected, so that they cannot be broken in. The windows, also, should be boarded up, to prevent the lights from being broken. As the school-house is in your neighborhood, you will be able to visit it occasionally, to see that no damage is being done to the property.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nShubenacadie,\n\nJuly 1806\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI thank you very much for kindness to me during the time that I have worked in the school here.\n\nBefore engaging to teach the Indians, I taught a number of years in the public schools of this province and the local government made me a gift of 100 acres of crown land, on which I have built a house, boarding and shingling it, but have not been able to finish it inside. The lot was covered with wood some of which I have had cut and have started farming.\nPhane brought up a family of six\u2014three sons and three daughters; two of them are married (one daughter, the eldest, taught school for a time). Stanley, the second girl, is teaching; the third, 18 yrs., is thinking of it but don't like the idea much. My youngest, Frank, I think would make a scholar if I could only send and keep him to school.\n\nHe is 12 yrs. Stanley, my second son has 240 acres of wood land adjoining mine and works mostly at home. I owe $100 to my friend nearly so which I am anxious to pay soon.\n\nWe live over a mile from anyone else but we don't feel lonesome. We have a Dominion organ and all the girls can play pretty well.\nI am trying farm work and also fishing but not yet tried altogether two or more, not being accustomed to it and not altogether young.\n\nI wrote to the Agent at Eskasoni once about that school, but as he was a friend and they actually Protestant he did not answer.\n\nIs there no place up N.W. where I might train the building kids for a time? Try and give us a job.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.J. Logan\nOttawa, August 1, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th inst., and in reply I beg to say that, while the Department regrets the circumstances over which you had no control necessitated the closing of the school which was under your charge for several years, it knows of no vacancy at present in any of its schools.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Logan, Esq.,\nShuonoadie, N.S.\nStubenacahi\n\nMay 25, 1907\n\nGentlemen:\n\nHow would it do to start up the Indian school again? The school building is good and there is some supplies there. There was a week's wood when I left. (They may have stolen the most of it by this time though.)\n\nThey might start in better now if we would open up. I would go on for the same salary as I was receiving.\n\nIf you do not wish to open this school just now, is there another in the Mar. province that you could appoint me to? Or is there anything else worth while that I could do for you. I would like to work for you again. I have had a slight attack of rheumatism these few days and ought to come...\nI want to say a few words about the Indian meadows here.\n\nAlthough it is not lawful to let cattle run at large here, yet they are let go to make their living on other people's wild meadows sometimes, breaking fences and destroying the crops.\n\nThe Indian meadows are eaten down by these cattle every summer until they are hardly worth cutting. Then is built a pound built near these meadows in spring, and if the Indians are told to drive the cattle off the meadows to this pound once or twice I think it would teach the whites a lesson and they would keep them from in future. I wrote the above in confidence you heard about it before but nothing has been done although you wrote to Mr. Wallen to see about it, I think.\n\nYour truly,\n\nR. F. Logan\nOttawa, June 5, 1907.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult., and in reply to that portion in which you suggest the re-opening of the Shubenacadie school I beg to say that enquiries will be made into the matter and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Logan, Esq.,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOttawa, June 5, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. R. J. Logan, formerly teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian day school, has written the Department suggesting that the school be re-opened. He thinks that the children might attend better now.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you in this matter, which should state the number of children of school age on the reserve and whether, in your opinion, there is a probability of a better attendance than before the school was closed last year.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nG.G. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nAlonso Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSt. Thomas July 14, 1907\n\nIn answer to your letter of June 6th requesting correspondence from Mr. R. L. Lay concerning the advisability of reopening of the school. I have to inform you that I do not think there is any better prospect for attendance than when the school was closed as there has been no children of school age moved in since.\n\nI have also to inform you that shortly after the above mentioned communication was received from Mr. Lay, he was taken seriously ill over sickness resulting in his death.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nAlta.\nDear Sir,\n\nAt Indian Road Shubenacadie we have one of the Best School-houses built by the Govt- in this Country.\n\nIdle, No Teacher,\n\nJ.C.,\nDAY SCHOOLS, NOVA SCOTIA\n\nShubecacadia, Hants County, (Indian Brook)\n\nThis school has been closed for some years for want of a suitable place for a teacher to board. Mr Superintendent Boyd in his report on the Nova Scotia schools, recommends that a teachers residence be put up and the school building repaired. He is not able to say what the repairs will cost but will find out later on.\n\nThe last census return gives the number of children of school age as twenty four.\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT.\n\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S., 20th October, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Indians of Shubenacadie are anxious to have their school in operation again, and for that purpose have applied to me through their chief, Noel Alex. McDonald, for a teacher.\n\nI cannot say at present how many children of school going age are on the Shubenacadie Reserve, but hope to be able to provide the information soon, as I expect to visit the place about the 25th inst. Until then, I cannot advise the Department as to whether a teacher should be engaged or not.\n\nHowever, I am aware that it will be necessary to make an expenditure of about $50 in repairs to the school house there before it can be occupied with comfort; and should the Department decide upon reopening the school, I would recommend the appointment, in the beginning, of a person to keep the school-room clean and in proper order, to make fires when necessary, etc.\n\nI shall be glad to learn the Department's pleasure in the matter of repairs, and to receive from it any suggestions that may assist me in arriving at a proper conclusion with regard to reopening the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

The Department will be pleased to have a further report from you on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 120090/1, I beg to report that I visited the Indian settlement at Shubenacadie, N.S., on the 8th inst. and took a census of the children of the place, finding 14 of school going age\u2014that is, between the ages of 5 and 15 years.\n\nTheir parents seemed very anxious to have the school in operation again, and I believe that an average attendance of 8 might be confidently expected, if it should be re-opened; because the majority of the children are too young to be otherwise engaged than attending school, and they reside permanently on the reserve. Besides, the school house is centrally located, and is only a short distance from the most remote families in the settlement.\n\nNear the school is a teacher's residence, which is rather small\u2014about 10x14 ft.\u2014and much in need of repairs. I would suggest making a small addition to the back end of it in the form of a lean-to for a bedroom, which with necessary repairs to make the building comfortable, would cost about $65. There are Indians on the Reserve who can do this work.\n\nI would recommend getting the school in readiness and hiring a teacher for the beginning of the Jany. quarter, on the distinct understanding with the Indians that the school should not be kept open for any extended period, in the absence of a satisfactory average attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department.\nOttawa, December 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department is prepared to temporarily re-open the Shubenacadie school, continuance to depend on the attendance. You may, therefore, have the repairs mentioned by you done by the Indians and you may take steps to secure the services of a teacher. As the attendance must necessarily be low the Department is not prepared to pay a large salary, but it is thought that you might secure the services of a teacher for a salary of $300.00 to $350.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, December 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to re-open the Shubenacadie School and Mr. Superintendent Boyd has been given instructions with regard to certain repairs that are needed and asked to submit the name of a teacher. The Department will expect you to interest yourself in the work of the school and co-operate with the teacher.

McLean.\n\nCharge to Dept. of I.A.\nOttawa, February 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm the following telegram sent you yesterday:- \"May engage teachers for Bear River and Shubenacadie Schools. Report fully as to qualifications, experience and salary agreed upon.\"\n\nThe Department will await the information asked for therein at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT\n\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S., 28th February, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nHaving reference to your telegram of the 22nd inst., and letter of the following date, No.120090/1, I beg to state that Martin Edward Grumley, West Indian Road, Shubenacadie, N.S., the young man whom I interviewed about taking charge of the Indian school at Shubenacadie, is a person of irreproachable character, holding a Second Class Scholarship obtained at the provincial examinations held for teachers in Nova Scotia, July, 1909. Last year he graduated from St. Mary's Academy in Halifax, and this year he has taken up the study of medicine.\n\nThe person I had in view for Bear River Indian school is Mr. D. McK. Gillis, a resident of the town of Antigonish, N.S. He holds a First Class teacher's License, and has an experience of thirty years as teacher in the schools of this Province. I cannot say at this writing whether he will accept the school or not, and this remark applies to Mr. Grumley also.\n\nThe salary agreed upon in each case is at the rate of $350 per annum. Put in this connection I think I had better advise the Department that unless the salaries of Indian teachers are materially increased, it cannot expect to engage, and to retain, the services of competent people any longer. Under existing conditions in this country, it is not reasonable to expect otherwise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to the qualifications of the teachers whose services you are trying to secure for the Shubenacadie and Bear River Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, provided these gentlemen will not accept the positions at the salary offered by you, you are authorized to increase the initial salary to $400.00 per annum. In Mr. Grumley's case a further condition is that it is his intention to continue at the work for at least a reasonable length of time. If he is only to use the position to enable him to secure funds to go on with his medical course the Department would not pay more than the amount offered by you, $350.00 per annum, and in any event would prefer to secure the services of someone who would be likely to continue in the teaching profession.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, April 16, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nOn March 5th, last, the Department approved of the appointment of Mr. Martin Grumley as teacher of the Shubenacadie School, which was re-opened.\n\nThe Department desires you to give the teacher every assistance in your power in the conduct of this school and wishes to have from you monthly reports on the forms provided, a supply of which is being sent you. The salary agreed upon between the teacher and Mr. Superintendent Boyd was $350.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent,\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S., Sept. 14th., 1912.\n\nSir,-\n\nMr. Martin E. Grumley has sent me his resignation as teacher of the Indian school at Shubenacadie Reserve, N.S., to take effect the 1st. of October. Shall I look for a teacher to succeed him? I think the school should be kept in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 20, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant advising the Department that Mr. Martin Grunley has resigned his position as teacher of the Shubenacadie school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this resignation is accepted. You will be good enough to endeavour to secure the services of a suitable successor. Any applications received should be forwarded to the Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, November 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of the 26th of September last, in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Shubenacadie School and to ask what action, if any, has been taken by you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent,\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S., 16th Nov., 1912.\n\nAnswering your letter of the 13th inst., just to hand, I beg to say that, outside of advertising in the press, I have done all I reasonably could to get a teacher for the Shubenacadie school, but have failed. I am still on the search for one, but the prospect is not promising.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the school is not in operation, as the pupils belonging to it are intelligent, and were making good progress under Mr. Bradley's tuition.\n\nShubenacadie Reserve is such an out-of-the-way, lonesome place that no white person cares to go there and remain for any length of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa November 30, 1912.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr Pedley,\n\nMr Superintendent Boyd writes the Department that he has done all he reasonably could, outside of advertising, to obtain a teacher for the Shubenacadie school but without avail. Shubenacadie is an out of the way place. It would be a pity not to re-open the school as there are 18 children of school age, all of whom were enrolled when the school closed 30th September last. It might be worth while to advertise for a teacher to take charge after the Christmas holidays. If so in what papers should the advertisement be placed, and what salary would the Department pay? The last teacher received $350 but I do not think that any one could be had for less than $400. In February last Superintendent Boyd advised the Department that unless the salaries of Indian teachers are materially increased it could not expect to engage and retain the services of competent people any longer. Mr Gourley, the last teacher, would not remain on for $350.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin B.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\u2014\nAs requested in your letter of the 10th ultimo, I beg to advise the Department that Miss Mary E. Ahern began her duties as teacher of the Indian school at Shubenacadie on the 4th inst. I was present at the time, and think that all concerned may be congratulated on having secured the services of a very good teacher. But I'm afraid she will not like the situation, and, therefore, may not be disposed to hold her position for any length of time.\n\nShe could not get a boarding house, and, consequently, is obliged to shift for herself as best she can by living alone in the small building near the school provided by the Department for a teacher's residence. In order to encourage her to remain, I promised that the building would be made comfortable, and that she would be provided with free fuel. Under these conditions, she decided to do her best and keep the school, unless the situation should become intolerable.\n\nI engaged Simon Basque, Indian, to furnish the school house and the teacher's residence with\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nwith fuel, and to act as janitor of the school, his duties in the latter capacity being to scrub the school room once a week, to sweep it and dust the seats and desks every day, and to make a fire in the school at eight o'clock every morning when necessary, so as to have the place warm and comfortable on arrival of teacher and pupils an hour later. For all these services, I agreed to pay him $70 for the school year, which I think is reasonable. At any rate, that is the best arrangement I could make, and I hope the Department may be able to confirm it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, February 25, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant advising the Department that Miss Mary E. Ahern began her duties as teacher of the Shubenacadie school on the 4th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that Miss Ahern will remain in the position and, provided she will consent to do so, is quite willing to incur some expenditure in providing furnishings for the building used as a residence. You might submit a list of the furnishings that you consider necessary, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe Department approves of your action in appointing Simon Basque to provide firewood and attend to the janitor work for the sum of $70.00 per year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

She has not formally tendered her resignation, but I expect her to do so at an early date.\n\nMeantime I enclose herewith, for your consideration, applications from duly qualified teachers for the school. I do not know what Miss Phillips' religious belief is, but have taken steps to ascertain it.

I might say that there is a vacancy at Sydney for a Roman Catholic teacher. One of these applicants might be willing to take that position. The Department has no application, whatever, for the Sydney school, and if either of these teachers will not take it, you might make enquiries with a view to finding some one who will take the work there.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nA.J.

Shortt, Brookfield, N.S., from school officials under whom she taught the past two terms. The other applicant for the position of teacher of the Indian school at Shubenacadie, N.S., Miss Janet Philips, Green Bank, N.S., is not eligible, not being a Roman Catholic.\n\nMiss Shortt is, therefore, the only available applicant, and I would advise the Department to accept her application without delay, because she may be offered another school and may accept it. She appears to have given good satisfaction where she has already been employed as a school teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 15, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your communication of the 11th inst., I beg to say that Miss Mary A. Shortt may be engaged as teacher at the Shubenacadie School at a salary of $400.00 per annum.\n\nKindly advise the Indian Agent and give Miss Shortt such instructions as you may see fit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nB.C.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Miss Mary E. Ahern's resignation of her position as teacher of the Indian school at Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nThe statement she thought proper to make with regard to liquor used by the Indians does not give, in my opinion, a proper idea of the facts. Being of a highly nervous temperament, she is easily excited, and was very much disturbed on several occasions at night by the rowdyism of people on the public road, which passes very close to the teacher's residence at Shubenacadie Reserve. She believes that these people were Indians, but I am persuaded they were roistering lumbermen going to and from their camps located a few miles from the Reserve. These experiences seem to have impressed her so seriously, and so unfavourably, that she could not make up her mind to resume charge of the school at Shubenacadie after vacation.\n\nNow, Miss Ahern is a good teacher of large experience, and having reference to the second paragraph of your letter of the 5th inst., I recommend\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nrecommend her for appointment as teacher of the Indian school at Sydney. She would live in the city and be among the Indians during school hours only. There would be nothing for her to fear through rowdyism on the part of anyone. Should the Department not think proper to give Miss Ahern this school, I dare say it will not be difficult to find another teacher for it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nI am nearly well now and will be ready for work in September.\n\nI take this opportunity of thanking you for your generosity in paying me my full salary. I did not expect it.\n\nYours respectfully and gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo:\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is with regret that I submit to you my resignation of the\nChristian Reserve School,\netc., etc., etc.\n\nI liked the children\nand was very happy\nin my School.\n\nBut, on account\nof the amount of\nliquor used by the\nIndians, it is no\nplace for a woman.\n\nI made efforts\nbefore the vacation,\nto secure a trading\nstore among white\npeople, but was not\nsuccessful, although\nI offered to pay $600\nper week.\n\nI should like to\nremain in your\nservice a while\nlonger, if I could\nhave a School\nroom a while\ndifferent.\n\nI am accustomed\nto having charge of\nlarge schools in the\nOttawa, August 19, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing Miss Ahern's resignation as teacher of the Shubenacadie School.\n\nWith regard to your suggestion that she be sent to Sydney I may say that the Department has already made an appointment to fill this vacancy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The latter went camping in Guysborough County last July and neglected his duties during the September quarter, which made it necessary to appoint someone in his place.

Should the bonus now payable to teachers at the rate of $150.00 per annum be continued during the next fiscal year, this will also be allowed. The Department has no information as to whether this bonus will be continued, or not, as it will depend upon the action taken by Parliament at its present session.

There was an average attendance of but 5 at this time. The school has remained closed, due to our inability to secure the services of a teacher. W. R. Campbell, Esq., Provincial Inspector of Schools, has intimated to the Department that he can at this time secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. I have written to Mr. Agent Wallace, asking for his recommendation in connection with the re-opening of this school.\n\nWould you be good enough to give me your opinion as to the advisability of commencing operations at this point again. Is it your experience that the Indians will avail themselves of the school facilities and that there will be an attendance that will warrant expenditure?

I am writing to Mr. Agent Wallace, at Shubenacadie, and asking for his recommendation concerning the re-opening of this school. When an answer has been received, you will be informed as to our wishes in the matter. The salary allowed for this school is $500.00 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nConcerning house furnishings, I will be in a position to answer your query after having heard from our agent at this point.

Cameron, Esq., Inspector of Schools, in which he informs us that he has been successful in securing the services of a teacher for the Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\n\nYou will remember that this school was closed at the end of the Junt quarter, 1920, and at that time there was an enrolment of 9 with an average attendance of 5. There was difficulty in connection with securing a teacher, and the school has not been re-opened since.\n\nI am writing for your recommendation in connection with the re-opening of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. If you feel that there are enough children of school age in the vicinity, who would attend regularly, to warrant the engaging of this teacher recommended by Mr. Inspector Campbell, the Department is prepared to commence operations again at this school. If your recommendation is to re-open I would be grateful for information concerning equipment for the classroom and house furnishings for the teacher's residence at this point. Your early attention to this matter is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.

S., leaves me in doubt as to the advisability of reopening it now. Under present circumstances, I do not think the attendance of pupils would be even as large as it was in the past. I have reason to believe that the number of children of school age at this point is less than when the school closed last year.\n\nI understand that Miss Jessie Scott, teacher of the Indian Day School at Millbrook, Colchester County, N. S., intends to vacate her position at the end of the present quarter, in which case, it would be more in the interest of Indian Education to appoint, as her successor, the person Mr. Campbell, Provincial inspector of Schools, has in view. I am writing Miss Scott to ascertain whether she has decided to resign her position or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nHussel T.

I have noted that you are in doubt as to the advisability of commencing operations at this point.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that Mr. Agent Wallace has informed the Department that he recommends the reopening of the Shubenacadie Indian Day school. He claims there are 18 children of school age, ready to attend, and that the parents are anxious that they resume their studies as soon as possible. He states that he has canvassed the settlement concerning this matter, and was encouraged to believe that the children would make a good showing in the matter of attendance.\n\nIn view of the conflicting reports from our representatives in the field, the Department is now in doubt as to the advisability of commencing operations at this school. I would be grateful for an immediate reply to this letter, and your recommendation again, in the light of Mr. Agent Wallace's statements. Your early attention is requested.\n\nConcerning the second portion of your letter, I have to inform you that Miss Jessie M. Scott has resigned and that Mr. Agent Kennedy has been asked to suggest a properly qualified successor. I will keep in mind your suggestion that Mr. Inspector Campbell's nomination might be available for the Millbrook Indian Day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The Department today received a communication from Mr. Superintendent Boyd, advising that upon your recommendation efforts be made to re-open this school.\n\nYou will please get in touch with Mr. Inspector Campbell, with a view to the engaging of Miss Ruby Anthony of Kennetcook, Hants Co., N.S. The salary allowed is $500 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nInform the Department immediately as to what classroom equipment is necessary, and if any repairs have to be made to the school building and residence. If there is no wood for fuel, you will please make temporary arrangements for a supply, until such time as you can call for tenders for the fuel for the winter.\n\nWhen you are convinced that Miss Anthony is reporting for work, and when you are aware of the date of the reopening, to ensure the initial success at this school, you would do well to go among the Indians and inform them that it is necessary that they send their children regularly to school. I might inform you that, if the attendance does not keep up at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, the Department will seriously consider closing it again.\n\nI am writing to Miss Anthony, of Kennetcook, direct, asking her to get in touch with you if she is desirous of accepting the position in question.

Campbell, Esq., Provincial Inspector of Schools, has intimated to the Department your willingness to accept the position of teacher at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\n\nThe salary allowed is at the rate of $500 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law. At present there is a bonus of $15 per teaching month, offered to those in charge of Indian day schools.\n\nWould you get in touch with Mr. Alonzo Wallace, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N. S., regarding the probable date of the re-opening of this school, and accept any intimation from him concerning the commencement of your work. He is our representative in the field, and you will receive instructions from him. You will requisition to Mr. Wallace for anything that is desired in the way of classroom equipment or repairs to the school and teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Father Sweet called at my office today on his return from Re-Resurrection and informed me that as there was no school on account of there being no teacher he would first to recommend Mrs. Andrew King for the position of teacher. He informs me that Mrs. King has the qualifications and besides is a catholic which fits the \"act\" requires. I have therefore to request that this matter be taken under consideration and that I be informed respecting your wishes.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\nGeorge Wallace\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, September 8, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 31st ultimo concerning the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, informing the Department that Miss Ruby Anthony has not taken charge again for the coming academic year. The Department cannot understand why this matter was not brought to our attention before, as no communications have been received from either the retiring teacher or yourself. I have noted your recommendation that Mrs. Andrew King be appointed to the position of teacher, and that her qualifications are satisfactory.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that, in view of Rev. Father Sweet's recommendation, the Department will approve of Mrs. King's appointment to the position of teacher, at a salary of $500.00 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law. At present, and until the end of March, 1923, there is a bonus of $15.00 per teaching month offered to those in charge of Indian day schools.\n\nIf any classroom equipment is necessary, or any repairs required to the school building, you should inform the Department immediately. As you were informed in official communication of December 29th last, it would be well to go among the Indians and inform them that it is necessary to send their children to school regularly. If the attendance does not warrant a continued operation, the Shubenacadie Indian Day School will have to be closed.\n\nNo time should be lost in making arrangements to have the school opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie,\nN.S.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOTTAWA, September 11th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nOn August 31st, last, you wrote the Department recommending that Mrs. Andrew King be appointed as teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. In official letter of the 6th instant, the Department approved of this appointment, being under the impression that Miss Anthony did not intend to return.\n\nIt is noted that in a letter dated the 5th instant, you forwarded a requisition for supplies for this school, and that this requisition was signed by Miss Anthony. The Department is not now aware which of the above mentioned ladies is in charge of this school, and I would be pleased if you would advise at once the name of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferris,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlonzo Wallace, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept. 8th 1922 in reference to the teacher of the Indian school.

I was and am of the recommendation of Rev. Father Sweet that she might come to Horicon to teach at the Indian School.\n\nI wish to say in connection with this matter that before leaving you about Miss Anthony had returned and was again in charge of the school and when I took the matter up with Father Sweet he recommended that Miss Anthony be allowed to complete her term, but would recommend that Miss King be employed to succeed Miss Anthony as Miss King is a Catholic which the laws allow and Miss Anthony is not.\n\nThis is the most satisfactory news of the pupils as also that of Father Sweet.\n\nMiss King has informed me by letter that she is prepared to make application\nSir,\n\nfor the school and is willing to assume charge as soon as the matter is settled at the relay mentioned in yours of 11 Sept last.\n\nYour humble servant,\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the application of Mrs. Andrew King for the position of teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as Miss Anthony has resumed duties as teacher, it is considered she should remain in charge during the present school year. If, however, at any time she desires to give up the work, or if her services are not satisfactory, the appointment of Miss King to succeed her will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $500 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mrs. King of the approval being granted for her appointment, and instruct her to take up duties when the school re-opens after the present Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

During the present fiscal year, ending March 31st, bonus is allowed teachers at the rate of $15.00 per month for the ten teaching months in the year. The amount that will be paid during the next fiscal year, beginning April 1st next, has not yet been determined, but in all probability it will be the same as is being paid during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The fact that this authority is granted does not create a precedent for the submission of requests for the performance of dental work on behalf of other Indians.

[Signature]\n\nApril\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter of Oct 9/1929 #51-1-1, I visited the Indian Reserve and made an inventory of the articles belonging to the Department. Copy of which I am enclosing.\n\nI communicated further Monday as to whether he could use any of the articles and he informed me that he did not think they would be of any use to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nOttawa, December 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing an inventory of the various articles of school material on hand in the school building and teacher's residence at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted that you have not stated the number of school desks on hand, and I shall be pleased if you will furnish this information. You should state whether they are single or double desks, as well as their condition. It is also noted that there is a teacher's desk in good condition. Please state if there is a teacher's chair.\n\nRegarding the other supplies, they should all be stored in the school building and the building securely fastened, in order to prevent these furnishings being stolen. When the Department can place any of these materials you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie,\nN. S.\nSir,\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Shubenacadie Agency I learned that it is the intention of the Department to close the Day School now operating at that place on Dec. 20.\n\nIn consideration of the fact that the Residential School will not be ready to admit Pupils until about Jan. 15th or Feb. 1st both Agent Lawlor and Myself would like to have the time extended a couple of months which would be Feb. 28th, by that time we would know whether there will be accommodation at the Residential School for all the Pupils now attending the Day School or not.\n\nAgent Lawlor has recommended this course to me and under the circumstances I believe this is the better plan so I would recommend that the above mentioned Day School be kept in operation until Feb. 28th.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your ruling at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, recommending that the Shubenacadie Indian Day School be continued in operation until the end of February, next, in order to ascertain whether there will be accommodation at the new Indian Residential School for all the pupils who are now attending the day school. In reply I have to say, in view of your recommendation, the Department will approve of the day school being continued in operation until the end of February, next. I shall be pleased if you will inform both Mr. Agent Lawlor and the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Maxner, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWindsor, N. S.\nSir,\n\nRegarding your letter Dec 12 #57-1-1\n\nI would say that there are 10 chairs in the School House. These are very old style chairs, will seat two people, they are defaced and in bad condition as far as appearance goes.\n\nIn reference to the teacher chair, your may use it in case a common selection chair is not available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

King, who has been employed as Teacher at the Day School at Shubenacadie for several years, but whose services are no longer required as the pupils of that School are all to be admitted to the Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. MacKenzie\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 24, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the retiring allowance for Mrs. A. King, who was employed as teacher at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that she will be allowed two months' retiring leave, at the same rate of salary as she received while employed as teacher, and a cheque for $130, being the amount due for that period, will be sent her as soon as funds are available from our appropriation for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We considered that both Dr. MacInnis and yourself were fully aware that those children on the Shubenacadie Reserve who are physically fit should attend the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.

At that point there are some twenty children of school age and no school facilities. However, the building still stands, but no teacher has been employed for a number of years.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department to give the Indian children some education the Millbrook school should be enlarged and that at Shubenacadie repaired and a teacher employed.\n\nWill you please favour me with your advice in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.)

Purdy, Esq., M.P.\n\nWe called up Mr. Robb, the Agent, and arranged a time to talk the matter over.\n\nAs for the results of the discussion, we feel that Mr. Robb is in favor of opening the day school at the Reserve. He feels this way about it, because the Residential School was established by the Department to take care of orphan children, and these children on the Reserve are not orphans. Again, with a day school there, he feels that they would be satisfied. All of which to me, is, in the first instance not true, and the second is sheer nonsense.\n\nFrom what we can learn, it appears that Mr. Purdy and Mr. Robb went out to the Reserve. In conversation with Mr. Ben Knockwood, who is known by Mr. Purdy, because, he, Knockwood, worked for Mr. Purdy in the lumber business, the complaint of the Indians was opened. Mr. Purdy went to Mr. Knockwood's house, but Mr. Robb did not accompany him. From that we believe that Mr. Purdy would be voicing the opinion of Ben Knockwood, concerning the school.\n\nAs for Mr. Ben Knockwood, he has one boy, between thirteen and fourteen years old, and came to this reserve only a few years ago, certainly at a time when the boy was over school age. Yet we feel that the boy was never at school, even before coming to this reserve. Some years ago we spoke to Mr. Knockwood about the boy coming to the school, but the excuse was that the boy was needed at home to help the mother, and that he was being educated there. There is not much to be said to any Indian when he puts up an argument of that kind.\nAt the present time we have twelve children from the Reserve, and last week we discharged Henry Knockwood, on the request of the Agent, because the father fell on the ice and was injured, and it was felt that the boy who will be sixteen years of age next August, was wanted at home. The youngest member of the family will probably take his place in September.\n\nWe had two of the older girls from the Shubenacadie Reserve, who are here now, make out a list of the children of school age, and the parents of same who are at the Reserve. The total comes to fifteen, the majority of them six, seven, and eight years old. We cannot be certain whether or not this list is absolutely correct.\n\nParents | Children\n---|---\nMr. & Mrs. Peter Gloade | Peter Gloade, age 8\n| May Gloade, age 7\nMr. & Mrs. J. Paul | Frances Paul, age 6\nMr. & Mrs. Ernest Howe | Freddie Howe, age 6\n| Marie Howe, age 7\nMr. & Mrs. Stephen Maloney | Peter Maloney, age 6\nMr. & Mrs. William Marr | Faustine Marr, age 6\nMr. & Mrs. Charles Francis | Frank Francis, age 13\nMr. & Mrs. Ben Knockwood | Urban Knockwood, age 13\nMr. & Mrs. William Sack | Margaret Sack, age 6\nMr. & Mrs. Stephen Knockwood | Genevieve Knockwood, age 7\nMr. & Mrs. William Paul | Violet Paul, age 7\nMr. & Mrs. Martin Sack | Libby Sack, age 8\n| Annie Sack, age 9\nMr. & Mrs. John Knockwood | Louis Knockwood, age 6\n\nLooking over the list we think we can say which ones are really opposed to sending their children here, and also the reason.\n\nMartin Sack's two girls -- We had two other girls of this family a few years ago, Jean and Catherine. At the close of the school year, Jean was sixteen years of age, and therefore eligible for discharge. Catherine went home at the same time for vacation. When vacation time was over all the children from that Reserve came back to school except Catherine. You would not remember it but there was quite a time getting her back. Finally she did\narrive back, and later was discharged. Because regulations were followed, the Indian did not like it, and has not forgotten.\n\nPeter Gloade's two children -- a boy, and a girl. We have had three of that family here. One was discharged when she reached sixteen, and the other two did not return from vacation. The mother is all right but we cannot say the same for the father. He was one of the henchmen of a former Agent who gave us a merry time.\n\nBen Knockwood, mentioned previously, and Stephen Knockwood, we do not know. The others are all young married men, and unless we are very much mistaken, would and will send their children to this school. But as long as we have politicians and the Agent dangling the prospect of a day school at the Reserve, in order to please the older men, then it is only a matter of time until the older men exert their influence on the younger. It is not so many years ago that the ones from this Reserve sent a signed petition to the Department stating that if they would send their children to the Residential School, then we in turn would allow them home every weekend. This letter was sent to the Department with the apparent approval of the Agent at the time.\n\nTo our knowledge, Mr. Purdy has been at the Residential School once. And the question at the time was not how much we were trying to do for the Indian, but who should obtain certain work that was contemplated at the time by the Government. If we are not mistaken, it was concerning the tender for painting the outside of the window sashes. We think it would have been the fair thing for Mr. Purdy to learn the other side of the question, why some of the children of the Shubenacadie Reserve are not at the school here.\n\nTo get back to our conversation with Mr. Robb, the Agent. Within a month of closing date, we send notice to every Agent who had children here being discharged on July 1st. At the same time we request that if they have any new ones to come in September, to have the application forms filled in soon, and sent\nto the Department. We have done the same with Mr. Robb. By the fact that we were told that some of the ones on the Reserve who had been at the school, were no good, we could not help but feel that at least we have not a supporter of the school in the person of the Agent. We are not disappointed in that, because he is entitled to his own opinion, but at the same time, the arguments used, do not, to us, make sense. For if he would think about it, he would know that from among a hundred and sixty children, who are not chosen for their goodness, brains, and ambition, we are bound to have some good, some average, and certainly some bad. No matter how much you try to do with the latter you cannot have much success. Some people expect that we can take any kind of child, and apparently, run him through a mould, and after a few years produce a model that is well nigh perfect. After centuries of civilization, we have not done it with the white man, and it certainly cannot be expected that it could be done with the Indian in a space of a few years.\n\nThe parents of the children here come and visit them quite often. We do not claim that they are all satisfied, because we never expect to see any Indian say that he is completely satisfied, but we have no complaints that amount to anything.\n\nEnough of this prattle. If Mr. Robb wants the children of this Reserve to attend the Residential School, all he has to do, as far as we are concerned, is to let us know just about how many we can expect on September 1st, and we will try to have accommodations. But he cannot expect that he can let the matter rest until the first of September, and then call up and expect us to find places for any number of children, for we try to take them in the order that the applications come from the Agents of the three Provinces.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 4, 1939.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe - Operation of Indian Day School at Shubenacadie Reserve, Nova Scotia\n\nI wish to reply to Mr. Pratt's memorandum dated January 18, with respect to the re-opening of the Indian Day School at the Shubenacadie Reserve.\n\nIn response to instructions sent forward from this Branch, Father Mackey, Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School, and Mr. J. S. Robb, Indian Agent, met a few days ago and discussed very fully, it would appear, the best ways and means of providing educational facilities for the children of school age on the Shubenacadie reserve. Father Mackey, in his reply to the Department dated January 30, states:\n\n\"From the results of this discussion I feel that Mr. Robb is in favour of opening the day school at the reserve. He feels that the residential school was established by the Department to take care of orphan children and that these children on the Shubenacadie reserve are not orphans.

A letter similar to the one sent to you was directed to Reverend Father Mackey.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Father Mackey, in which he states that \"If Mr. Robb wants the children of this reserve to attend the residential school, all he has to do so far as we are concerned is to let us know just how many pupils we can expect on September first and we will try to have accommodation.

It has occurred to me that it might be sound policy to provide Indian day school facilities for the pupils of Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick who may be at the moment enrolled at the residential school and in this way open up accommodation for the children of the Shubenacadie reserve. By adopting this policy we would save the transportation costs of children who come from a distance. In any event I am submitting the Principal's statement to you for any comment or recommendation you may care to forward.\n\nIn view of the fact that this matter has been referred to us from the office of the Minister, I should appreciate your dealing with it as promptly as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Hoy, Esq.\nDept Welfare Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe School\n\nI was surprised at Father Macchio's statement last June he informed me he was discharging two pupils from the school and could take two in their place. Something wrong somewhere.\n\nIn looking over your report regarding the schools there are 80 Res. schools in the Dominion 9040 pupils only 87 in Grade IX I can't understand this. Are the Indians getting the education they should? These schools have been running for more than 100 years I think. I don't find the Indians stupid. They learn other things readily for the same time frame. Taking 25 Father Macchio claimed they should\nHave Manual Training in the schools for the boys? His answer: \"What! Would he make a box and break it up?\" If that is his idea of manual training we'll know why the boys are stupid when they come away from that school. I'm not sure if I'll agree with what he does. The poor school is not an asset to this district but an expense to the Indians of this Reserve. I talked this matter over with the Indians and think if all the children could learn and be admitted to the school things would look better but they feel slighted. The way things are now, they have a hard feeling towards Father Macnie and don't think he likes them very well. Father Brown made a statement in the Church out there that there should be a school on that Reserve and demanded that they send more children to the poor school. I could see a better feeling right away do you think so? I am\nDrying barrel is a good opening school on the Reserve at this present time. The work is scarce and I don't think the Indians would be able to catch and feed their children properly without school without assistance. I explained that to them. I raised 9 children not one of but passed the IX grade and up to B.A. 20 I feel that there should be some Indians better fitted to go out in the world to earn for themselves and families. Father Maurice says we should plan for 3 or 4 girls. They are not going to be the Bread winner. An they can only marry an Indian so back to the Reserve.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. A. Robb,\nAgent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 1, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in which you again refer to the Shubenacadie Indian residential school.\n\nThe Chief of the Training Division expects to visit Shubenacadie at the end of May at which time he will meet you and discuss fully the educational situation on the Shubenacadie Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

If, however, there are at Shubenacadie 20 children who cannot secure accommodation at the residential school, the claims of this reserve for a day school will be carefully and sympathetically reviewed. The officials of the Indian Affairs Branch are communicating with the Indian agent and with the Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School in respect to the matter.\"\n\nThe attached further letter from Mr. Purdy is now received.

The Indian agent appeared to favour the re-opening of the Indian day school on the reserve, while the principal of the residential school considered that the re-opening of the school was unnecessary. In view of this condition, it was decided to have Mr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, thoroughly investigate the matter this year.

Purdy, Esq., M.P.,\nPoveshell,\nNova Scotia.\n\nRAH\nOttawa,\nJune 19, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nAccompanied by Indian Agent Robb I visited the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve on June 4, 1939. The Indians had been advised of my visit by the Agent and I was greeted by practically the entire Band -- men, women and children. As it was a fine day a meeting was held on the lawn outside the church.\n\nThe Shubenacadie Reserve consists of 1750 acres. The land appears suitable for farming but only a few of the Indians had cultivated gardens. The Reserve is located between 4 and 5 miles from the village of Shubenacadie. As you know the Shubenacadie residential school is just outside the village.\n\nCHILDREN\n\nAt the present time there are 14 children 7 years of age and over on this Reserve who have not yet attended school. In addition there are 8 children who are between 6 and 7. This makes a total of 22 children over 6 years of age.\n\nThere are approximately 20 children under 6 years of age.\n\nThere are 10 children ranging in age from 8 to 14 who are attending the Shubenacadie Indian residential school.\nARGUMENTS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A DAY SCHOOL\n\nSeveral of the Indian men and women expressed the opinion that a day school should be established. They stated that they wanted to have their children at home. One of the leaders of the discussion was an Indian named Ben Rockwood who has one boy 15 years of age who has never attended any school. I asked him the reason why the boy had never been sent to school and he stated that owing to his wife's ill health he had to keep the boy at home to look after his mother. Many of the Indians stated that they would be prepared to provide clothing for their children if they were attending a day school on the Reserve. Unless conditions materially improve it is difficult to see how they could do this as the Indian Agent informed me that work was extremely scarce and that as a result practically all the Indians living on the Reserve are in receipt of relief at the present time.\n\nIn private conversation with some of the Indians following the meeting it was evident that all of them were not in favour of re-opening the day school on the Reserve but they did not so express themselves while the meeting was being held. The six or seven who spoke at the meeting stated that they wanted the day school re-opened.\n\nBUILDING\n\nThe day school on this Reserve was closed in 1930. For the past three or four years the building has been used as a residence by an Indian woman. This building is approximately 15 feet wide by 20 feet long. It has a good hardwood floor and the roof appeared to be in good condition. The Indian woman who has been using the building has erected two or three temporary partitions. In the event of this day school being re-opened on the Reserve it would be necessary to tear down these partitions. The interior would probably\nhave to be painted. There is a small upstairs in this building which has been uncompleted but possibly could be made into a room for the teacher's living quarters. New toilets would have to be erected and new desks would have to be purchased.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIt is extremely difficult for me to decide whether or not a day school should be opened. From the figures given above it appears evident that there are sufficient children for a day school. At the same time to re-open the school would involve considerable immediate expenditure and in addition the Department would likely have to provide clothing and a generous midday meal in view of the fact that the parents are not able to provide these necessities.\n\nMany of the children over 7 years of age who have not yet attended school could have entered the Shubenacadie residential school if the parents had been sufficiently interested to apply for their admission.\n\nThe Principal of the Shubenacadie residential school advised me that owing to the discharge of a number of children at the end of June he would be in a position to provide accommodation for the 14 children on the Shubenacadie Reserve who are of school age; namely, over 7 years.\n\nUp to the present the Shubenacadie residential school has had no difficulty in maintaining its full quota of pupils and even if a day school is established on the Shubenacadie Reserve I do not think it will prevent the Shubenacadie residential school from having its full pupilage.\n\nIn the event of its being decided to open the day school I recommend that the Agent be directed to have the repairs to the building made by those at present in receipt of relief. This would reduce the expenditure required to put this building into condition to be used as a school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPhilip Philom Esq\nChief Indian Department\nOttawa Can\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter regarding school at Pessac\nwe will have the necessary affairs made\nwork will be done by the Indians and myself\nthe Indians are about to come together\ninside will make them fit.

Robb\nAgent\nOttawa, August 11, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Training Division advise me that they propose re-opening the school on the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve on September 1st in a house which was formerly used as a schoolhouse. I understand that there is an Indian family living in this house and it will be necessary to have them removed. I would be pleased if you would make such arrangements as may be necessary to effect this removal at once.\n\nIf there is no suitable house on the Reserve in which they could stay permanently, I would be pleased if you would forward us requisitions in triplicate on Form 37\u00bd covering requirements necessary to build a house for this family. When an official of this Branch visited your Agency some time ago he reported that there was a large quantity of logs on the Reserve. It is just possible that this house could be made of logs and the only material required to be purchased would be doors, windows, roofing and flooring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. S.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Anna King,\nWellington Station,\nHalifax Co., N.S.\nOttawa, May 17, 1948.\n\nMy dear Archbishop McNally:\n\nYou will be interested to learn that provision has been made, in our departmental appropriations of this year, for the construction of Indian day schools and teachers' residences at the Eskasoni and Shubenacadie Indian reserves.\n\nIt is our intention to construct a 4 room school, a residence for the Sisters who will be placed in charge of the classroom work and a residence for the principal on each reserve. We are now in a position to call for tenders for the construction of these buildings, and it is our hope that work will start at an early date.\n\nI am of the opinion that the success of our Indian welfare program in Nova Scotia will depend, to a very large extent, on the courses of study provided at the schools, coupled with a worthwhile adult educational program, organized and carried forward under the direction of the principals. I can see little reason why the social and economic structure on these reserves should not be, in a very basic sense, co-operative. I have in mind groups of adults, organized for the study of social and economic questions. There should be, also, opportunities for co-operative bulk purchasing and the co-operative sale or disposal of farm and handicraft products. This program, if it is to be successful, will require almost constant direction. Progress at the outset is sure to be slow and the tasks involved, somewhat discouraging. I am naturally anxious, therefore, to secure the services of a young priest with a certain amount of training along the lines I have suggested and a man of unusual missionary enthusiasm.\n\nMost Rev. J. T. McNally, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Halifax,\nHalifax, N.S.\nenthusiasm. It may be at this particular time exceedingly difficult to secure the services of such a man, but I feel - and I am sure you will agree with me - that it would be better to delay the appointment for a time rather than appoint a man who had not the training and temperament necessary for the position. It is just possible that you have in mind a young man with special training for the principalship of the Shubenacadie school. If you have not, it is possible that there may be available a young priest who would be prepared to take a special course of training for this work. Such courses of study are, I understand, provided at the St. Francis Xavier University.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you and, through you, the priests of your diocese, for the measure of co-operation extended to us in carrying out the policy of centralization at Shubenacadie. The assistance rendered by the priests, many of whom have been until now our part-time agents, has been very deeply appreciated by the officials of the department and by myself.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRAH\nShubenacadie, N.S. June 17/43.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Res., OTTAWA.\n\nThe Sisters of Charity are asking whether it will be necessary for them to have the staff, for the school which you propose to build this summer, ready this fall. Their appointments for the following year are made annually on the 15th day of August and they are in doubt as to whether or not this staff should be appointed this coming August.\n\nThey would appreciate greatly, if convenient to you, seeing the plans of the school and the teachers' residence before the tenders are let.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 24, 1943.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to making arrangements with the Sisters of Charity for teachers for the new day school on the Shubenacadie Reserve.\n\nI regret that at the present time I am unable to give you any definite date on which this school will be ready for occupation.\n\nWe have planned to build a school, a residence for the Sisters and a residence for the Principal. However, the plans are not yet completed and in addition I understand that there may be some difficulty in obtaining materials. As a result, it looks now as if the erection of the building would not commence for several weeks. This would mean that it would not be ready for occupation before January 1 next and probably a date subsequent to that. As stated above, I regret this delay, but from the contents of this letter you will realize that it is due to circumstances beyond our control.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nShubenacadie N.S. Oct. 22-43.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Res., Ottawa.\n\nRe Teacher, Ind. Day School, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nDoubtlessly you are well aware that both industry and the services have absorbed too many of our teachers. Consequently there are very few available anywhere and none locally. I happened to know of a woman who taught for a number of years in the Bear River Indian Day School and who was at present unemployed. Her name is Miss Agatha McGinty and I have arranged for her to come and look the situation over.\n\nBefore contacting this woman I talked the matter over with Rev. Fr. Mackie and for a while we entertained the possibility of securing one of the Sister's of Charity to substitute. Due to the difficulty of transportation during autumn and winter this idea had to be abandoned. An effort was made to find one locally who could perhaps walk or drive to and from work. As there were none available I was forced to look farther afield.\n\nIf Miss McGinty will accept the position and if her application is favorably received in your office, there may be some difficulty procuring a boarding house for her. The nearest white family would be almost two miles away and served by a very unsatisfactory road. We have here a small, bungalow type house, nearing completion. If Miss McGinty will not board with an Indian family and if she remains the only available teacher, I am afraid it will be necessary to rush this house to completion and place her there. This may necessitate the procuring of some furnishings such as household goods etc. However this is not known definitely at present. If this is necessary I desire authorization to purchase an absolute minimum of requirements. These articles could be used for destitute Indian families when no longer needed.\n\nP.T.O.\nI will report more fully at a later date. Kindly advise as quickly as convenient if this suggestion meets with your approval.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nInd. Agt.\nOttawa,\nNovember 9, 1943.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI desire to refer to official letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the appointment of Miss McGinty as teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. We have just received your voucher No. 721 covering the cost of furnishings for a residence for Miss McGinty and I, therefore, presume that she has begun duties, although you have not yet officially advised us to that effect. I enclose the necessary forms which you should have her complete and return.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Indian Agent Rice's report on the Shubenacadie Indian Agency for the period October, 1943, to January, 1944, inclusive.\n\nTwo months after the opening of school here we were unfortunate enough to lose our teacher. She was an Indian girl and maintained at all times a very good school, commanding discipline and respect. The County School Inspector gave her a very good recommendation and was also sorry to see her go. Our new teacher taught on the Bear River Reserve a number of years ago but has not done much work of this nature since. She is trying hard to do her best and give satisfaction by brushing up with correspondence courses from an institution in this province whose purpose is to help the rural teacher. Unfortunately she felt unable to teach a girl in Grade 8 and it was necessary for me to apply for permission to send her to a convent school for the balance of this year. I had to admire her stand on the question as she preferred to resign immediately rather than waste any part of the pupil's year knowing that she could not help her. I would have accepted her resignation but the shortage of teachers is very acute in this province and the facilities on this reserve are not the most inviting.\nFebruary 25, 1944\n\nMr. A. R. Arneil,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that you are planning to open the Shubenacadie Reserve in September, 1945, but are hoping to be in readiness for teachers this coming September.\n\nIf that is so, and if you are depending upon our Community to take up this work, may I ask\n\n(1) for a proposed agreement\nand (2) for answers to the following questions:\n\n(a) Number of teachers needed for September, 1944?\n(b) Salary for each teacher?\n(c) Their place of residence from September, 1944, until the buildings at the Reserve are completed?\n(d) Arrangement for their daily transportation to and from the Reserve?\n\nAwaiting a reply at your earliest convenience, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMother M. Louise\nOttawa,\nMarch 21, 1944.\n\nDear Mother Louise:\n\nYour letter of February 25 addressed to Mr. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies, has been referred to me for attention.\n\nIt is our intention to make another endeavour to have the new school on the Shubenacadie Reserve erected this summer, but at the present time I am not in a position to state definitely if construction will proceed.\n\nIn the event of the school being erected, we would like to secure two fully-qualified Sisters to take charge of the school for the academic year 1944-45. Pending the erection of a teachers' residence, arrangements could be made to have these Sisters live at the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nThe question of transporting the teachers from the residential school to the reserve has not yet been considered, but I feel that it would not be difficult to make the necessary arrangements. Regarding the salary for each teacher, I should appreciate your stating what amount you would consider should be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Mother M. Louise,\nMother House,\nSisters of Charity,\nMount Saint Vincent,\nHalifax, N.S.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMISS M A MCGINTY DAY SCHOOL TEACHER HAS RESIGNED AND CLOSED SCHOOL MARCH 20 THIS ACTION NECESSARY DUE TO STATE OF HER HEALTH I AM ENDEAVOURING TO LOCATE ANOTHER TO REOPEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.\n\nH C RICE INDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1944.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have your telegram of the 22nd instant, advising that Miss M.A. McGinty has given up duties at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. A cheque for the period she taught the school during the month of March will be forwarded to you in order that you can deliver it to her.\n\nI trust that you will be successful in obtaining another teacher. Please let me know when you have done so.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Day School, No. 260.\n\nPlease note that the teacher, Miss M.A. McGinty, gave up duties effective March 21, 1944, and no further payment of salary should be made to her after that date. The cheque for the period she taught the school during the month of March should be issued in her favour and forwarded to Mr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Res., Ottawa.\n\nThis will confirm my telegram of even date advising your office that Miss M. A. McGinty, teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School has resigned her position. The last day school was opened was on March 20th.\n\nHer sudden action was due to illness of chest and throat which has persisted for some time and which greatly impaired her efficiency in the school room.\n\nI feel that her action was necessary and after interviewing her I readily gave my consent. I have had correspondence with an experienced teacher who taught a number of years in the west in what she called \"Foreign Schools.\" She holds teaching licenses in both Nova Scotia and Manitoba and I think she will be available.\n\nPlease send the necessary forms for completion if and when a substitute is found.\n\nH. C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1944.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, in further reference to the resignation of the teacher of the Shubenacadie Day School. It is noted that you are hopeful of securing another teacher in the near future. I enclose the necessary forms which you will have on hand in the event of your securing a teacher.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAt the Doyle farm we have approximately 350 cords of fuel wood cut from the newly purchased Dodd land. This wood is at present being sawed and split into stove and furnace wood and close to two hundred cords of it should be sold. This matter was brought to the attention of Mr. Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies and was approved by him. It will be recalled that fire passed through this property necessitating the immediate removal of all scorched wood, regardless of whether it was hard or soft, fuel or logs, as long as it was worth salvaging. Practically everything damaged came out this winter and all logging operations ceased on March 14th. I have hired a local wood-cutting outfit and as soon as possible after the cessation of logging we started to cut up this wood. This was one week from the day we moved out of the woods, the delay being caused by the depth of the snow which covered the greater portion of the wood. Due to the injury to this wood at the time of the fire such a large amount cannot remain piled for eventual use. I suggest keeping only what is necessary for the old and destitute of this and Truro reserve plus next year's requirements of both Day Schools. The balance, as stated previously, should be sold as soon as possible. I think for the good of the community in and around Shubenacadie this wood should be sold to individual buyers rather than to a wood dealer. It will have to be borne in mind that the wood was blackened by the fire and that it is of a mixed variety approximately half hard and half soft. These factors will lower its sale price somewhat but I will get the best possible prices for it and keep within selling prices. I have contacted the W.P.T.B. in Truro re the possibility of procuring the one dollar per cord subsidy paid to wood dealers and if successful will have this to compensate for the lower sale price. I would appreciate having your approval of this proposed sale as it appears to be the practical thing in this case.\n\nWe have at the mill approximately four hundred thousand feet of timber. I believe it is a better grade than last year's cut and all but twenty thousand came from the Dodd\nland. This will be sawed and were it not for the frost which threw our mill out of line we would be at it now. It is a big cut and I believe it will require almost three months to cut it. We plan to start as soon as possible. I might mention that we have left over from last year about 200 M. f.b.m. in mostly two inch. Should a school be built here this summer there is not likely to be any shortage of lumber. From the Dodd land purchased for five hundred dollars we have taken close to four hundred thousand feet of good Timber, well over four hundred cords of wood and left standing about 50 M of fire-free timber and 250 cords of good wood.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nOttawa, February 25, 1944.\n\nDR. MC GILL\n\nOn February 17th at Truro, Nova Scotia, a meeting was held with the Nova Scotia Agents, H.C. Rice, Shubenacadie, and J.A. Maclean, Eskasoni, to discuss the various phases of their agency activities and their work during the past year and to prepare and lay plans for the current year's programme.\n\nWhile at Shubenacadie reserve consideration was given to the possibility of our erecting a four-room school.\n\nI found that it was possible to get the services of two or more fully qualified teachers from the Order of the Sisters of Charity should a school be erected, and that they could reside at the residential school. Transportation could be provided daily from the residential to the day school, a distance of about four miles each way.\n\nW. S. Arneil.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nREPORT ON SHUBENACADIE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH APRIL, 1944.\n\nOn March 20th Miss McGinty who had been engaged on this reserve as teacher in the Day School since November 5-43 abruptly resigned due to ill health. She contracted a cold in early winter and its persistence worried her. She feared too the possibility of T.B. contacts and abruptly ceased duties, and asked to be allowed to return to her home. At first I planned to hold her until a replacement could be found but after an interview I sent her home immediately. She appeared to be nervous and slightly hysterical and in that condition was of absolutely no use in a schoolroom. Luckily I had heard from Agent MacLean of Eskasoni of a teacher seeking employment and I wired for her posthaste. She arrived on March 28th and re-opened the school the day following. She is a middle aged woman of experience and undoubted ability and energy. Already she has won the respect of both parents and children. She is firm and on entering the classroom it is quite evident that she has done this work before. She was quite disappointed in her salary cheque for the month of April. I had told her that the bonus would be $18.42 and apparently she had not become accustomed to the drastic income tax deductions. I trust some satisfactory adjustment can be made as I do not favour the prospects of looking for another teacher this time of year. In fact a replacement is practically impossible to obtain and if she leaves the school will have to remain closed for the balance of the term.\n\nH.C.

The construction of this building has only commenced within the last week and I do not expect it will be ready for occupation before December. As soon as the building is ready we would like to open it, as there are approximately 50 children to attend the school. If possible, we would like to have two Sisters for January 1, 1945.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMother M. Evaristus,\nSisters of Charity,\nMount Saint Vincent,\nHalifax, N.S.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: New Shubenacadie Reserve\n\nI spent September 8 and 9 with the Indian Agent on this reserve. At the present time there are approximately 300 Indians residing on the reserve. Forty houses have been completed and of these eight were built during the current year. Five more cellars were being dug and this means that five more houses will be completed before the winter. A recent census of the reserve indicated that there are 107 children under the age of sixteen. Of course, all of these are not of school age at the present time. A visit to the day school which we are operating on the reserve until the new building is finished showed the names of 48 pupils on the register. As a result the old day school is extremely crowded and, pending the completion of the new building, it may be necessary to have the younger children come for half a day and the older children for the other half day.\n\nThe erection of the new building is proceeding rather slowly. At the time of my visit on September 9 the foundation had been completed and it was hoped that the work would progress more quickly so that the walls would be erected and the roof on before the cold weather started. At the time I visited the reserve the well digger had not yet struck suitable water, although I phoned Mr. Buck today and was informed that suitable water had been secured at a depth of 327 feet.\n\nAt the present time we are still operating schools on the Afton Reserve, Indian Cove Reserve and Millbrook Reserve. The Afton Reserve is just outside the town of Antigonish and Indian agent Rice states that very few of the Indians residing here wish to move to the new reserve, as they can obtain work in Antigonish. The Indian Cove School is situated near Pictou Landing and the Millbrook School is located a short distance from Truro. In both cases the Indians are very reluctant to move to the new reserve for the same reason as I stated in regard to the Afton Reserve. I recommend that the Principal's residence and the teachers' residence be erected next year. As soon as the school is finished the other buildings will be required and they should be provided at the earliest possible date.\n\nOn September 5 in Halifax I interviewed the Mother Superior of the Sisters of Charity. This is the same Order as we have in the Shubenacadie Residential School. They are willing to provide whatever number of qualified teachers we require. However, they have made all their appointments for the current academic year and, in view of\nthe delay in erecting the building, it will not be possible for them to provide any Sisters until the academic year 1945-46. I pointed out that in addition to teaching the school it would be expected that the Sisters would take an active interest in home makers' clubs on the reserve. The Mother Superior promised that they would do this and to assist us in this regard they would arrange to send one Sister who has had considerable experience in social service work. As you know, the salaries of teachers have been considerably increased in the white schools in Nova Scotia this year. It was agreed with the Mother Superior that the following salary rate would be suitable: $1200 a year for the principal and $1000 a year for each assistant.\n\nThis Order not only provides qualified teachers for schools, but also has a number of Sisters who are qualified nurses. One of their activities is the operation of a big hospital in Halifax. In the event of a nursing station being established on the new Shubenacadie Reserve, I feel very definitely that one of the Sisters should be employed. This would mean that both the teaching services and the nursing services would be in charge of the same Order and would no doubt give us beneficial results.\n\nAt the present time, as you are aware, considerable employment is being given to the Indians in the erection of the new houses. I also noted that several had cultivated gardens during the past summer. A separate report is being submitted regarding the lumber which is at present surplus to requirements.\n\nBoth the Indian Agent and the clerk seem to be fully conversant with their duties and apparently are working hard to get everything into good shape.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 27, 1945.\n\nMr. H. C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding Mrs. Mary E. McNeil, teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. I was not aware of any regulation requiring that teachers be notified before the end of March. We do not come under provincial regulations, and when teachers are appointed they are notified that only one month's notice is necessary on either side.\n\nHowever, the situation is that the contractor has stopped work and will not resume the erection of the building until some time in April. I hope that he will have the building ready for September, and of course, in that event, we will employ the Sisters. We might have some difficulty in obtaining them, because at the rate construction proceeds it is doubtful if we will have the residence ready for them by September first, although we have provided the funds for the purpose in the appropriation for 1945-46. However, it was understood a year or so ago that they could probably stay at the Shubenacadie Residential School until their own residence was finished. I realize this letter is rather vague, but as regards the time when the buildings will be completed we are as much in the dark as you are.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs,\nDepartment, Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: New School.\n\nI would like to get some information regarding teachers for the new school. The school and the continual controversy over teachers has given us all a great big headache.\n\nWe better, right now, come to an understanding regarding teachers for the school re. 1945-1946.\n\nI told Mr. Rice this morning I intend to come back to teach here next year.\n\nI was given to understand that you want the \"Sisters\" to come and teach in the new school. In fact I heard this a million times since I came here last year. May I ask you the reason why?\n\nYou know the rule regarding teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nNo teacher can be dismissed or discharged if the work in the class-room is satisfactory.\n\nMy work since I came here has been more than satisfactory.\n\nYou got a wonderful report from Mr. Campbell, the Inspector of Schools, regarding my work, still you had the idea you could bring in Sisters and Indians day teachers for no reason whatever. You can bring them in tomorrow if you wish but you will have to pay me a year's salary. We had so many false reports coming in from your department that we don't know whether we are coming or going.\n\nFr. Brown told me that the Sisters can't come here to teach until their Convent is built. This is something that has not been explained to you before. It would be impossible for them to board at the Residential School and drive back and forth as the roads are blocked to car traffic and even horse traffic for days at a time. When we came from church last Sunday the taxi left us a mile outside the reserve. The car couldn't get through the mud. We have snow-drifts, flood, mud, etc., here.\nMr. Rice and Father Ross visited me this morning and we talked the whole time over. The Indians want me to stay on here and they would like to have another day teacher, until such time as the convent could be built. They are willing and ready to build a two room cottage for the teacher, the same as mine. That would simplify things for everybody.\n\nI hold B. Diploma, honors for physical culture. Under the \"Strathcona Trust\" rule, I am to draw government grant every six months when I teach physical culture in any school. Mr. Campbell told me to ask you to send me forms, sign them, and return them to you. He said I couldn't draw any grant until I get registered. I also teach sewing, mending, cooking, etc. I did the work of two teachers since I came in here last year, so I hope your letter, or I should say your answer, will ease our headaches. The school won't be ready for another six months anyway. Could you please tell me when and where are civil service exams held, and I hope you will pardon this lengthy document.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Mary J. Mac Neil.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, July 13, 1945.\n\nReverend and dear Mother:\n\nOn September 5, 1944, the Chief of the Training Division interviewed you in connection with securing members of your Order to staff the new school being erected on the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve. As you are aware, this reserve is approximately 5 miles from the village of Shubenacadie, N.S., where the Indian Residential School is located.\n\nOwing to circumstances beyond our control, the program for the buildings proposed on the Shubenacadie Reserve has not progressed as rapidly as we had hoped. However, the school will be completed by September 1, 1945, and, if at all possible, we would like to secure members of your Order to operate it for the academic year 1945-46. As understood at the time of Mr. Phelan's visit, salary will be allowed the Principal at the rate of $1,200.00 a year and the assistants at $1,000.00 a year, each. Present indications are that we would require for 1945-46 a principal and three assistants. It was further understood last fall that, in addition to teaching the school, the Branch would expect the Sisters to take an active interest in Homemakers' Clubs on the reserve. To do this effectively requires a Sister who has had experience in social service work. Last fall you stated that you felt it would be possible to supply the services of such a Sister.\n\nWe have been unable to arrange for the\n\nThe Mother Superior,\nSisters of Charity,\nMt. St. Vincent,\nHalifax, N.S.\nerection of a teachers' residence, but in conversation last fall with the Principal of the Shubenacadie School, I obtained the impression that it would be possible for one year at least to have the Sisters teaching in the day school on the reserve live at the residential school and drive out to the reserve each day. On first consideration this arrangement may present some difficulties, but the Department will be willing to co-operate in arranging transportation.\n\nWe are extremely anxious to have the Sisters in charge of the new school as soon as it is ready and I am hopeful that you will find it possible to advise me that you are in a position to supply the staff mentioned above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nMother House of the Sisters of Charity\nMount Saint Vincent\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\n\nJuly 21, 1945\n\nMr. R.W. Hoy\nDirector...Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your recent communication regarding the school on the Shubenacadie Reserve, I am pleased to state that we shall be in readiness to supply under the stated conditions, the four sisters as requested.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMother M.F. Evansius\nOttawa, July 28th, 1945.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI understand from the Surveys and Engineering Branch that the Shubenacadie School will be completed by September 1st.\n\nConsequently we wrote the Mother Superior of the Sisters of Charity on July 13th requesting them to have available the services of a Principal and three assistants. While we have been unable to arrange for the erection of the teacher's residence it is understood that for one year at least to have the Sisters teaching in the day school on the reserve live at the residential school and drive out to the reserve each day. I am now in receipt of a letter from Mother Evaristus stating that the services of the four sisters will be available for the coming academic year.\n\nIt is our understanding that one of the teachers will be able to take an active interest in Homemakers' Clubs on the Reserve.\n\nYou should therefore inform Mrs. Mary E. MacNeil that her services will not be required at this school for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nThere are vacancies in some of the Indian schools in the Eskasoni Agency. If she is desirous of obtaining an Indian school you might suggest to her that she write to Mr. F.B. McKinnon, Acting Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, Nova Scotia.\nPlease let me know as soon as possible the number of school desks that are required for the classroom. School desks are made in three sizes, large, medium and small and you should state the number of each size that you consider we should supply. If you give us this information at once, I think that we can arrange to have the desks in the school by September 1st. It is our intention to supply chair desks so that the activity program may be carried out. We will also secure four teacher's desks. You should let me know any other articles that you consider will be needed and if you could purchase these locally you might let me know what the approximate cost would be.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Departmental Letter, July 28, 1945, File 5I-I-I, New Day School.\n\nWith reference to your letter concerning the above, I might say it does not look to me that, with the help they are using at the present time, the School will be ready by the first of September. The Mother General was up today and inspected same. She was very much disappointed especially regarding accommodations for the Sisters, there being no running water, no outside toilets and you will probably receive a report from her on the matter.\n\nI have informed Mrs. Mary E. MacNeil that her services will not be required on this Reserve but have asked her to take over the Indian School at Millbrook.\n\nWith regard to desks for the new Day School, the following will be required:\n\n- 30 Small\n- 40 Large\n- 30 Medium\n\nAlso 4 teacher's desks and 8 chairs. I might say that I cannot seem to get a price on these locally at this late date.\n\nH. C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nAugust 4, 1945\n\nMr. R. W. Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince my letter to you on July 21 in which we promised to send, as requested, Sisters to the Indian Reserve, I have visited the Reservation at Shubenacadie to examine conditions there.\n\nThe school has class-rooms that are spacious, well-lighted, and airy, and when finally equipped, will have all that is needed for the pupils. Yet, no provision has been made for the teachers' comfort; their noon-day meal must be taken in the school where there is no convenience either for preparing it or for taking it in any privacy. There is no room where the Sisters might keep their outdoor wraps, their school books, etc., and you know the Indian propensity for appropriating things.\n\nThere is no running water on the premises. I understand a well has been dug, but the water is unfit for drinking. Since water must be brought from a distance of at least two miles, it will take some time to remedy this inconvenience. No toilet facilities are provided for the teachers; evidently they are expected to use the outdoor toilets provided for the Indian children.\n\nThe transportation has its own difficulties. Snow in winter, and mud in the spring, will very likely make the roads impassible at times, and always in winter there would be the danger of being storm-stayed at the Reserve.\n\nYou will, I believe, recognize the situation as a serious problem for us. We do not wish to go back on our promise to you, but all things considered, it does not seem advisable for us to take over the school until the teachers' residence is ready.\n\nMr. Rice, with whom I talked over the matter, understands these difficulties. He tells me there is an Indian woman on the Reserve, a former pupil of the residential school, who has written Provincial examinations and attended Normal School. This woman would, he says, be willing to look after the children during the coming year.\n\nI shall appreciate it very much if you will let me hear from you very soon if some arrangement can be made for the year 1945-1946 which will not necessitate our sending the Sisters yet.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nMother General\nOttawa, August 8, 1945.\n\nDear Mother Evaristus:\n\nI discussed the contents of your letter of the 4th instant with the Director.\n\nIn view of the difficulties that you mention, the Department will endeavour to make other arrangements for the operation of this school for the academic year 1945-46. Consequently, it will not be necessary for the Sisters to take charge of the school.\n\nWe are still hopeful that the residence for the Sisters will be built next year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Mother M. Evaristus,\nMother General,\nSisters of Charity,\nMount Saint Vincent,\nHalifax, N.S.\nOttawa, August 8, 1945.\n\nMr. H. C. Rice, Indian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, in connection with the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. I have also received a letter from Mother Evaristus, pointing out the difficulties that would likely occur if the Sisters took charge of the school for the academic year 1945-46. I have discussed her letter with the Director today and we are advising her that we will endeavour to make other arrangements for 1945-46. Consequently, the Sisters will not be in charge of the school for the coming academic year.\n\nMr. Hoey feels that Mrs. Mary E. MacNeill, who taught the Shubenacadie Day School last year, should be retained for the academic year 1945-46 and not sent to Millbrook. He also believes that if it is possible another teacher should be secured. This would make two teachers for the coming academic year. While I realize that this arrangement will not be ideal, it is the best that we can think of at the present time.\n\nIn her letter Mother Evaristus states that there is an Indian woman on the reserve whose services might be secured. Possibly she could serve as assistant to Mrs. MacNeill. Please let me have your views regarding the above suggestions.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, Ontario  \nAugust 13, 1945\n\nDear General Chisholm:\n\nI have a copy of a letter that you handed me which you had received from the Canadian Nurses Association, Montreal, asking regarding \"Opportunities for Nurses\". The Indian Affairs Branch has, at present, fifteen hospitals with a total bed capacity of 550 beds and is in the process of taking over and opening three more hospitals with a combined bed capacity of 700 beds.\n\nThere are positions for nurses vacant in all these institutions.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch also has a field nursing staff of about fifteen nurses, and in the next year or so will require at least 70.\n\nOur basic salary is $80 a month, plus cost of living bonus which is at present $18.42, plus full maintenance. Nurses with adequate training in Public Health are offered $1260 per annum, plus cost of living bonus, plus full maintenance. Matron's salaries are in accordance with Civil Service classifications.\n\nI should appreciate your forwarding this information to Miss Hall so that it could be included in the data being prepared by the Canadian Nurses Association.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. H. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.  \nActing Superintendent of Medical Services\nOttawa, August 30th, 1945.\n\nMemorandum\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Day School, No. 260\n\nThe staff at this school for the academic year 1945-46 will be as follows:\n\n1. Mrs. Mary Mary MacNeil - salary $80.00 a teaching month plus bonus effective September 1st, 1945. She was in our employ last year and no additional forms are required for her.\n\n2. Mrs. Elsie Basque - $75.00 a teaching month effective September 1st, 1945. The usual forms are being obtained for her and will be sent to you as soon as received.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of appointment.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1945.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, in which you stated that you have secured the services of Mrs. Mary MacNeil and Mrs. Elsie Basque as teachers of the Shubenacadie Day School for the academic year 1945-46. Salary will be allowed Mrs. MacNeil at the rate of $80.00 a teaching month plus bonus and Mrs. Basque at the rate of $75.00 a teaching month plus bonus effective September 1st, 1945.\n\nAs Mrs. MacNeil was in our employ last year no additional forms are required for her.\n\nHowever, we will require forms for Mrs. Basque and I enclose these. You should have her complete and return these as soon as possible. I presume that Mrs. Basque is an Indian. If so, that fact should be stated as she would not be liable for Income Tax. I am under the impression that Mrs. MacNeil will be considered as Principal.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nEncl:\nOttawa, 15th October, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIt has been decided to allow a salary of $95.00 a teaching month each, plus bonus, to Mrs. Mary MacNeil and Mrs. Elsie Basque, teachers of the above mentioned school. The salary at this rate is effective 1st November, 1945.\n\nMrs. Elsie Basque is an Indian teaching on her home reserve and consequently is not liable to Income Tax.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\nHalifax Mail\nDec. 27 1945\n\nIndian Reserve School\u2014Shown above is the new school on the Indian reserve at Shubenacadie. Opened last fall, the school has four classrooms, Domestic Science, Sewing, vocational training and cooking rooms. About 165 pupils attend the school. Major D. A. MacDonald was the contractor.\nWith regard to the new School, which is finally completed, excepting installation of registers for the floors and these have not arrived from the manufacturers as yet. This has been a long drawn out process\u2014about fifteen months constructing the building. I feel however that MacDonald, the Contractor, has done a real good job and that nothing has been slighted in any way. We certainly have a nice building and it is a great credit to the Reserve. Throughout the job, most of the work was done by two men and Indians from the Reserve supplied the remainder of the help. This building will require a lot of attention, both inside and outside and I attend to burn wood in the furnace for this year, as there is plenty on hand, with only two classrooms to be heated. I have recommended Joseph Rose, the only competent Indian I have, for the job. He lives near the School and I have recommended his salary at the rate of $50.00 per month. Although this might seem rather high, yet the building will require someone to look after it day and night and considering circumstances, I do not think this rate to be unreasonable. I am waiting Departmental instruction on this matter. As I had to hire two teachers at the beginning of the school term, expecting that the new building would be ready, it has been necessary to have two sessions each day in the old school, one in the morning for the higher grades and another in the afternoon for the lower grades. Because there was not room in the old school, this has been necessary. Immediately the seats, desks and chairs arrive I intend to open two rooms of the new school as this will be sufficient for this year and will be as far for heat. Mr Rose of the Engineering Service was here for two weeks, surveying out the water line from the Spring Brook to the Reserve. He found abundance of water and an analysis showed it to be in first class condition. He also inspected the new School and found it to his entire satisfaction. While construction of the building since last Christmas, has taken up quite a lot of my time, due to the fact that there was no Engineer here, Mr Rose' favourable comments made me feel that time I had spent on it had been well worthwhile.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nThere was considerable uncertainty at the beginning of the school term with regard to the hiring of teachers. It was generally understood that the Sisters would be taking over at the new School on the Reserve here. With this in mind, I intended to have Mrs. MacNeil, who had taught last year on this Reserve, placed as teacher at Millbrook. However when it became known that the Sisters would not be able to take over the new School, I was advised by the Department to retain Mrs. MacNeil and in addition, to if possible, obtain the services of another teacher. I was able to engage Mrs. Elsie Basque to teach with Mrs. MacNeil on the Reserve here, but it meant there was no teacher at Millbrook. After advertising in the papers, the result was I received six or seven applications and from these I selected one who seemed best qualified, Miss Mary B. Cameron, who is, I feel doing a very good job and I am quite satisfied with her work.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nWe finally managed to move into our new School the first of November. Two classrooms only are in use and these have been kept warm quite easily by burning wood. Because the remainder of the School has been closed off, it has been possible to heat the two rooms fairly easily. However I feel sure that when the time arrives and we have four teachers, we will have to use coal for a few months in place of wood. I had some gravel spread around on the School grounds, but there is still considerable work to be done in order to make the playgrounds attractive. In the Spring I will endeavour to get some crushed rock which will make it much drier and should show a much greater improvement. The children are all watched carefully regarding their school attendance and in case of absentees, the Constable is notified and a full explanation is required from the parents. We had Mr. Ross from the Survey and Engineering Branch, checking on the new School and surveying out the proposed waterline.\n\nH.C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 13th, 1947.\n\nReverend and Dear Mother:\n\nYou will recall that Mr. Phelan of this Branch interviewed you in September, 1944 with reference to providing qualified teachers for the day school at Shubenacadie Reserve.\n\nAs you are probably aware, the day school was completed last year but the residence for the Sisters is still under construction.

It now depends upon the personnel to put forth their very best efforts. I feel certain that you will co-operate with me along the following lines:\n\n(a) You should be on the Reserve every day when the school is in operation during the academic year.\n\n(b) You should consult the teaching Sisters each school day with a view to assisting them in any manner that will promote the efficiency of the work and especially in cases of enforcing discipline among the boys.\n\n(c) Establish organized play among the boys by promoting athletic events suitable to the season of the year. In this regard I may say that the Department is prepared to supply reasonable quantities of footballs, basketballs, volley ball equipment, playground balls, and playground bats. It is very important that Indian children should be taught the value of organized play. Physical exercises should be encouraged and every possible endeavour made to promote good sportsmanship in the playing of games. It is understood, of course, that you will supervise all athletic activities.\n(d) Debates and concerts should also be organized, especially during the winter months.\n\nA special monthly report form has been prepared and the necessary copies of this form have been forwarded to Indian Agent Rice to whom a copy of this letter is also being sent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It is noted that you did not make any comments under headings 15 and 16.\n\nWe are particularly interested in learning of social gatherings or athletic events that have been held as a result of the encouragement given by yourself.\n\nPlease make reference to these on future reports.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. H. Boudreau,\nPrincipal,\nShubenacadie Indian Day School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nJune 5, 1948.\n\nMr. H. G. Rice,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nShubenacadie Indian Day School.\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nWould you please interview Mr. G. R. Sutherland, Inspector of Industrial Arts, Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia, concerning a manual training teacher for the Shubenacadie Indian Day School and the Shubenacadie Residential School. You will recall our discussion with regard to the hiring of such a teacher when it was decided that he would be employed part time at both these schools.\n\nSuch a teacher would be required to hold a teaching certificate in Industrial Arts, and would be entitled to classification as a Grade 4 teacher under our salary schedule. This calls for a salary range of from $1,600.00 to $2,520.00 a year.\n\nYou will find complete details of this salary schedule in the June issue of the Bulletin, which will be sent to you shortly. However, you should not delay in contacting Mr. Sutherland. The Director of Vocational Education, in Halifax, has already written to Mr. Sutherland about this position. I attach application forms, in the event that Mr. Sutherland can put you in touch with any teachers who might be available for this position.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard P. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMODERN INDIAN SCHOOL AT SHUBIE; TRIBAL TRADITIONS PRESERVED\n\nBetter homes, better religious and school facilities and a general improvement in health are profits reaped by Micmac Indian population of Nova Scotia mainland from inauguration several years ago of a centralization plan by the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nThe scheme, designed to improve living standards of the Micmac population in the province, is based on establishment of two reservations, one on the mainland and one on Cape Breton Island, and discontinue the system of over 20 reservations scattered throughout Nova Scotia.\n\nPrior to the centralization plan, each reservation was served by a part-time agent, medical care was far from what it should be, school facilities were mediocre and living standards failed to reach the highest standard possible.\n\nUnder centralization, each of the two large reservations will have a full-time agent, a resident nurse, better homes and education possibilities and in a short time, a resident doctor.\n\nNew School\n\nAt Shubenacadie, where the mainland reservation is located, many new homes, some equipped with electricity and running water, have been erected. Influx of Micmacs continued steadily and made better teaching facilities necessary and as a result a modern four-room school was erected, with space for a manual training department. New roads were built and the land cleared, and after a saw mill had been erected, logs were sawn into lumber and shingles. At present there is no provision for a high school, but students who wish higher education will be assisted by the Indian Affairs Department.\n\nThe attendant nurse is Miss Hazel McDonald, R.N. Housed in the same building containing the agent's office and the medical room is a fully equipped community store. Here handicrafts for which Micmacs are famous, can be exchanged for every-day necessities.\n\nFollowing tradition, Shubenacadie is governed by a chief, with Steve Knockwood, re-elected for the second time, at present occupying this important post. Councillors associated with him are Simon Nevens, John Francis, Charles W. Francis and Henry Sack.\n\nFive years ago when centralization started the population at Shubenacadie was approximately 50 people. Today it numbers about 550.\nPRINCIPAL'S REPORT ON INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nfor month ending May 1940\n\n1. Name of School: Shubenacadie Indian Day School\n2.

You are aware of the situation here and the various problems that we are endeavouring to overcome. I would strongly recommend that this request be given favourable consideration.\n\nRev. Fr.

In addition to this medical-dental clinic, it is essential to get some idea of the food pattern of these children and this can best be done with the aid of the teachers and the nurse by the nutritionists from here who will visit at a separate time from the medical clinic.\n\nTherefore I propose that two of our research nutritionists should visit the Day School for a period of about ten days for the purpose of obtaining a week's diet record beginning after the Easter holidays. Miss Suzanne Saint Hilaire will be in charge because she has already been at the Residential School and, I guess, has seen the Day School. She will be assisted by Miss Dorothea Tripp. They will plan to arrive on Sunday, April 24th, or Monday, the 25th and will let you know directly of any assistance required in this regard.\n\nThe chief purpose for writing you at this time is to point out the great advantage to these girls if they could live on the Reserve. Naturally, they would be glad to pay for their lodging and to fit into what accommodation was available. Would you please inquire from the teachers or from the nurse whether this can be arranged and advise me at your convenience.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you shortly, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.

There is quite a bit of room left for expansion which does not promise to be very rapid. There is a good Domestic Science room and a handy Manual Training shop. Mr. Brown, the manual training instructor met me at the school. With the principal, the agent, Mr. Brown and myself discussed the proposed set-up. I believe Mr. Brown understands the Department's aims in manual training. Mechanical tools are not desirable for the present. Our pupils are too young yet to handle such machines. It would be advantageous, however, to have a grindstone and a variety saw to help the teacher prepare the material for instruction. A complete set of hand tools will be necessary for both the Day School and the Residential School, as neither of them have any woodworking equipment. A requisition has been submitted and after some changes will be submitted for approval.\n\nIt was interesting to note that the Day School pupils participated in the Music Festival that took place at Schubenacadie and according to reports have figured advantageously.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.

I enclose a copy of the Indian Day School Regulations, which will inform you of the method adopted by the Department in the payment of teachers' salaries. There are two hundred teaching days in the year and if you remain in the service of the Department and teach that number of days to June 30th, next, you will receive your full yearly salary, $400.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nMiss Mary A.

Asked him to make an estimate of the cost of a Frame building which the Indians would follow. A Frame Building Boarded Chingled with 6 Windows 1 Door 1 Chimney 16 Seats 1 Desk and painted outside the probable Cost of which would be about $275. The Indians think they can not get out the Log so that they would be fit to paint or finish but they say they would get out the frame of the building where would make the Frame building Cost $24. They said the Builders says the Frame building would cost less when finished than Log one and the Indians had very poor frame I think it would last them too much to put a Log one and they say would do without having it finished inside for a time.\n\nYours etc.\nJames G.

Also, for getting the Indians to clean the school house. I was in reality four days, but only charged for two, as I thought the bill quite large enough.\n\nHoping this explanation is clear\n\nI am Yours truly,\n\nMartin Gurney\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent,\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S., 21st March, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., enclosing labour bill amounting to $20.80, for taking down the old flue in the Indian school house at Shubenacadie and building a new one.\n\nThe expenditure incurred is a surprise to me, and, I think, excessive. At any rate, before paying the bill, the Department will certainly require an explanation as to why it was necessary to employ a man and team three days in the work of building a flue requiring only 350 bricks. Again, Thomas McDonald took down the old flue, and Simon Basque built the new one, with Henry Sack as his assistant, carrying bricks and mortar. What was Isaac Sack doing during the 2\u00bd days he was employed? Kindly explain.\n\nI presume your own charge in the matter was for the time occupied in coming to Shubenacadie to communicate by wire, and afterwards, in purchasing materials for the flue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMr. Martin E.

I could only give her such information as I possessed, and that may be read in the preceding paragraph.\n\nMiss Shortt feels aggrieved that the matter has been apparently neglected; and I think it my duty now to inform the Department that there is danger of losing the services of one of the best teachers in its employ in Nova Scotia, if final action be not taken in this case at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

I understand that Mr. Superintendent Boyd made certain recommendations regarding this past year but there was nothing done. I consider the following as being absolutely necessary and should be done before the school re-opens in September. The inside of the building refinished, as it is now it is very cold. The building should be shingled; this has not been done since it was built 21 years ago. The building has never been painted and should be painted inside and out. A wood house is badly needed as at present the wood gets wet as there is no shelter. A closet is required in the School to keep books, papers etc. in. A new Blackboard is urgently needed also a large Globe and map of the Dominion. The seats are in a disgraceful condition and new ones will have to be provided. I would suggest having a carpenter go over the building and report just what is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW. G. Foote\nSuperintendent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, July 17, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant stating that certain repairs are absolutely necessary for the Shubenacadie School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may, as you suggest, have a carpenter go over this building and report just what is necessary. In his report he should give a detailed estimate of the cost of the necessary repairs. Kindly advise the Department of the dimensions of the blackboard required and also of the sizes of the seats needed and the number of each size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 19th ultimo, I beg to say that the teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian school is quite correct in stating that the building needs shingling and painting. She might have stated also that her school room is very uncomfortable and should be improved. I made a note of these requirements when I visited the school on a tour of inspection recently.\n\nThe interior of the building was never completed, having received but one rough coat of plaster, and I would recommend that a second, or finishing coat be included in such repairs as may be decided upon. The windows also should be cased, and new seats and desks for the pupils furnished.\n\nIt is difficult to make a close estimate of the probable cost of repairs and improvements in this case, because the building may be in worse condition than outside appearances indicate, but I submit the following figures:\n\n- 10 M. Shingles, @ 3.50, $35.00\n- 60 lbs.

I would recommend that the building be straightened into shape and a concrete wall 2 ft in height 8 inches at bottom and 1 inch at top be built under building also 3 Piers under center of building. This would do away with the wavering of building. The ceiling is of wood and is full of knot holes and very much shrinken. I would recommend that this be covered with Beaver Board and painted. The plastering runs down to the floor without any base board for protection and is considerable broken.\nI would recommend that school room be varnished to bottom of windows about 3 ft in height. A new floor is also required as the old one is worn through and would have to be replaced in at least another year.

Lawton\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada.\nMr. P. B. Lawlor  \nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nMy dear Mr. Lawlor:\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to the Indian Reserve near Shubenacadie, I found the water supply most unsatisfactory. The water which I saw was very bad, some times fills me, that after heavy rains, it cannot be used for drinking purposes.\n\nLast summer the Dept. authorized the agent for Cumberland Reserve to have a well sunk for the purpose of supplying good water on this Reserve. A similar well, with a pump, would be one way of remedying condition on Indian Brook Reserve.\n\nThe school also should be supplied with a tank or some such container for water. Individual cups are also a necessity, particularly where there are prospect cases of tuberculosis. Mrs. King would be willing to see that the children brush their teeth, if they are supplied with toothbrushes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. T. MacDonalds, Agent\n\nBrook Village  \nInverness Co.  \nN.S.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find a letter from Miss C. T. McDonald, R. N., in which she advises me that she has found the water supply at the Indian Reserve unsatisfactory and recommends that a well be supplied to remedy this. Also that the school be supplied with a water tank and individual drinking cups, also tooth-brushes be furnished the children.\n\nI would say that I can procure a tank for $6.00. Drinking mugs from 20\u00a2 to 25\u00a2. Tooth brushes from 35\u00a2 to 50\u00a2.\n\nIn reference to the water supply would say that the following families, the Glodas, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Rubs Paul, Simon Faqque, Mrs. King and the school get their water from a brook or a hole dug in a swamp. In summer the swamp dries up, also the water in the brook gets very low and at such time it is not very good for drinking purposes. Again after big rains when the brook is flooded, the water is muddy and unfit for use. During the winter months this brook which is away below the level of the road makes it very difficult, on account of ice conditions, for the people to carry the water from same.\n\nI would fully recommend that the well be dug near the school house with a pump attached to same as I think this quite necessary. I cannot give you an estimate of what this work would cost as I do not know how far one would have to sink to get the water. Just roughly, I think they would probably get water at a distance of 20 or 25 feet.\n\nIf the above request meets with your approval, kindly send me the necessary authority and I will have the articles asked for for the school procured as soon as possible and the well dug at the first convenient opportunity and think I can get Indian labor for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Fowler\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, December 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Miss MacDonald, travelling nurse for the Province of Nova Scotia, relative to the water supply at the Shubenacadie Indian School and Reserve, and recommending that a well be dug.\n\nIn reply I have to request that you will state whether you would advise that the work of sinking a well be carried out during the present winter or whether you would advise that it remain over until next spring. You should also state how you would propose having the work done, whether by day labour or not. You might state the cost per foot in digging the well, also the approximate cost of supplying a pump. If this well is dug, it should be located near the school building in order that the teacher and caretaker of the school could have oversight of same and see that the pump is not damaged. When we have further information from you as requested, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work of sinking the well carried out.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a covered tank for the drinking water for the use of the pupils, and also for the purchase of graniteware drinking cups for the pupils' use. Please instruct the teacher that she should take care that each pupil uses his or her own drinking cup. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the tank and drinking cups.\n\nWe are forwarding to you 18 tooth brushes for the use of the children, and when you receive same you should hand them to the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th inst.,\n\nNo. 51-1-5 in reference to having a well dug on the Indian Reserve, I would advise that the work of digging this well be left remaining over until next Spring when I will take the matter up further with you and give you all particulars regarding cost per foot in digging, pump, etc., and whether I can have the work done by day labor or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.B. [Signature]\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, January 8th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant relative to the digging of a well on the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve to provide a water supply for the Indian School and Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you recommend that the digging of this well be left until next spring, when you will further report in the matter giving particulars as to the cost, etc. You should keep this matter in mind and, when considered timely, you should furnish a report as to how you would recommend that the work be done, and the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. McRee agrees to dig a well with an inside wall eight feet, supplying the necessary stone and build the concrete cover at the rate of four dollars ($4) per foot. The Concrete amounting to three tons or a cost of $30 per box to be furnished here.\n\nThe pump for the well will cost fifteen dollars ($15).\n\nIf this meets with your approval, kindly send me the necessary authority and I will have this matter attended to this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nD.B.

He states that the present stove is useless, and the wood not as good as it should be. He also states that, on the day he visited the school, the teacher was not able to keep the children warm in the schoolroom, and took them into her own dwelling, where the school work was conducted.\n\nIf you consider that a new stove is required, you may arrange for the purchase of same. You should obtain a stove of a type suitable to properly heat the building. Please obtain competitive prices, if possible, from a number of dealers, and make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. Should any stove pipe be required, you may also arrange for the purchase of same. If you make this purchase, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. While a serviceable stove should be obtained, it should be purchased as cheaply as possible.\n\nRelative to the wood, it is noted that ten cords of hardwood were supplied in January, last, and stored in the woodshed. Please state whether you consider this quantity is sufficient to complete the present winter's requirements, and if any further supply would be required for next winter's use, and, if so, when you would recommend that the same be obtained. I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the matter of having a sufficient quantity of dry wood on hand for the balance of this winter and for next winter's use. You should also state what action you have taken regarding the purchase of a stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Lawlor,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie,\nN.S.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nI am taking it upon myself to write you to see if there cannot be something done in the way of putting up a shed that would do for a cow and horse. Ever since I came here (1923) I have been paying out for first one stable and then another only to move at the owner's pleasure. Now the last one I had rented has been sold and the owner wants the building. You may imagine how pleasant it is to go on in this way.\n\nNow I cannot afford to put up\na shed too do I want to sell my house and car. We do without either of them would be very hard in a place like this. As I have every intention of remaining here for a time yet (unless the unforeseen happens) I am writing just to see what can be done. I think about a large building I think about 12' x 15', and say 18 ft high would fit fine for car and house and some hay. If the Lord will buy the material I shall have the work done at my own expense.\n\nAs I must have my house and car's hay are stored by March 25th. I hope you will answer as soon as possible.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss A. [Last Name]\nOttawa, March 5, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that a grant be allowed you to assist in the erection of a shed to provide accommodation for a cow and horse owned by you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has never provided a grant towards the erection of a stable for the accommodation of livestock which is the property of the teacher. It is, therefore, regretted that it will not be possible to accede to your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. A. King,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMarch 25th\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of March 1927 #51-15 in reference to the storewood at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, I found the store in fair condition, with the exception of a small crack in the side, which an expenditure of fifty cents for fire clay will remedy. The store is giving satisfaction and serves the school from any ordinary winter day.\n\nThe pipe has never been abused for some considerable time and needs to be replaced with new pipe and wire, acquire 12 yards of pipe and 3 elbows and wire for hanging pipe in safe condition.\n\nThe wood is green hardwood of the finest quality. The windows require five panes 26 x 14 glass, and a minor quantity of putty to secure same.\n\nI would recommend that the above materials be obtained and a reliable man be sent out to the school to put the pipe up properly for the store, put in the floor and fix the window and door so it can be properly secured.\n\nI believe against the teacher's residence and find both doors destroyed or broken in the front and back doors, also the wooden platform on the front damaged and the platform at the rear destroyed and buried down over the bank at the rear of the house, also the cellar drain in bad condition, being plugged up and water in the cellar. The damaged platforms and door locks were caused by the work of persons unknown on Halloween night.\n\nI cannot give an accurate estimate of what are the materials and work for above mentioned, but would estimate approximately Twenty-Five Dollars would cover same.\n\nIn reference again for the wood supply for the school, I would recommend that authority be given me to purchase this wood on a basis of ten cents per cubic foot.\nAt\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202619\u2026\u2026\n\nThe cords for the year, buying part dry wood during the summer months and part green wood in the early part of the coming winter so I think it would be more economical and give more heating satisfaction in the School Room.\n\nThe teacher informed me, they will be able to manage comfortably for the balance of this School term with the present condition of the store and wood.\n\nIf the above meets with your approval, kindly send me, the necessary authority and I will have the work attended to as promptly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nD.B. Cowley\nAgent-\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the stove, fuel supply and repairs, etc., required at the school and teacher's residence at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\n\nRelative to the stove, it is noted that at a small cost the same can be put in a satisfactory condition. The quantity of stove pipe required is also noted. You may purchase the number of lengths of pipe, elbows and wire required and have this new pipe installed, and the stove repaired. You may also purchase the number of panes of window glass of the size required and the quantity of putty necessary to install same.\n\nYou may also purchase a strong padlock, with key, and have same installed on the woodshed.\n\nWith reference to the teacher's residence, you may have locks installed on the front and rear doors, also the wooden platforms at the front and rear of the building repaired and placed in good condition. The cellar drain should be cleaned out. We note that the cost of these repairs will be approximately $25. You should purchase the materials required in making the above repairs, and you may engage the services of a competent man to do all of the work mentioned above. When this work has been done to your satisfaction, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the materials and for the labour in having the work done. It is expected that you will keep the expense down to the lowest possible point.\n\nWith reference to the wood supply for the use of the school, you may purchase this wood on the basis of 10 cords for the year, buying part dry wood during the summer months and part green wood in the early part of next winter.

[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nSir:\n\nOn my last visit to the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, I found that the side walls of the school house are badly in need of repair.\n\nThe plaster is cracked and peeling from the walls. I would request that a competent man be employed to repair these walls and that they be given a coat of paint to make them clean and improve their appearance.\n\nThe approximate cost of same would be about twenty-five dollars.\n\nIf this meets with your approval, kindly send me the necessary authority and we will have some attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO.B. Fowler\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you, that I have had the School House stove repaired and the platform repaired and locks renewed on the Teachers Residence.\n\nI have to advise you in reference to the Cellar Drain, that the present drain is useless so far as keeping the Cellar clean from water is concerned, and that it is necessary to dig a new drain.\n\nThe Back Walls under the house are also in bad condition and eventually will tumble down. I would have these walls pointed and repaired and they would last for a time and save the expense of putting New Walls under them at the present time.\n\nThis work including the materials would cost approximately twenty dollars.\n\nI would advise that the work be done and if same must wait your approval, kindly send me the necessary authority and I will have same started to be promptly and possible.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nCanada\nOttawa, May 4th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, informing the Department that the side walls of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School building are badly in need of repair and that the plaster is cracked and falling from the walls. In reply I beg to say that you may engage the services of a competent man to repair these walls, and they may be given a coat of muresco. We note that you estimate the approximate cost of having this work done to be about $25. If possible, this amount should not be exceeded.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date regarding the repairs required to the back walls under the house. You may arrange to have these walls pointed and repaired. We note that you estimate the cost of this work, including material, to be approximately $20.\n\nIf the above repairs would interfere with the classroom work, it might be advisable to wait until the summer holidays to have the work done. The Department will, however, leave this matter in your hands to have the repairs carried out when considered advisable by yourself.\n\nWhen the above authorized work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find vouchers in favor of D. B. Lawlor, with itemized receipted accounts attached hereto for plastering, murescuing and cleaning the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, as per your instructions.\n\nIn reference to same, would say that the cost of same exceeded the estimate given you from the fact that the plasterer, after quoting the price I submitted you, refused to do the work and I had to engage these men to do same.\n\nAfter finishing the walls, the ceiling looked so badly in need of cleaning that I had this done and then also had the men give the school house a thorough scrubbing and cleaning, which I trust will meet with your full approval.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nD.B.

There is, however, a teacher's desk in good condition at Shubenacadie, and we are requesting Mr. Agent Lawlor to arrange to have this desk shipped to you at Richibucto, N.B., and to prepay the shipping charges.

My reason for not replying sooner was that the Captain of the band was absent and I could do nothing without him.\n\nI have spoken to the Chief Captain and one more leading man of the tribe and they now wish to have a frame building for a School Room. They have agreed to put up the bare frame if they could get it covered in and finished. They say that all their other buildings are frame, including a snug chapel which they have. They would also like to have a frame School House.\n\nRemain Yours\n\nJames Pase\nIndian Agent\n2561\n\nJames Gair, Esq.\nIndian Agent\nChibougamau\nN.S.\n\nNovember 6th\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26 ultimo, I have the honor to inform you that you will be informed of what size the proposed school house should be and give an estimate of the cost of completing the same with full details.\n\nI have also to inquire whether logs could not be obtained from the Reserve for the walls of the proposed building and the labor of the Indians in getting out and flatter the same utilized.\n\nA very neat building might be erected of logs properly flattened and afterwards painted which would be less than half the cost of a frame building.\nRespected Sir,\n\nIn reference to a School Building for the Indians I have say that I have asked a Builder what he thought about the matter. Asked him to make an Estimate of the Cost of a Frame Building which the Job was followed by a Frame Building Boarded Chingled with 6 Windows 1 Door 1 Chimney 16 Seats 1 Desk and painted outside the probable Cost of which would be about \u00a3275.\n\nThe Indians think they cannot get out the Log so that they would be fit to Count or much but they say they would get out the frame of the building where would make the frame building cost \u00a34 less and the Builder says the frame building would cost less when finished than log one and the Indians have very poor Game I think it would not be much to put a Log one and they say would do without having it finished inside for a time.\n23611\nJames Grey Esq\nBritish Agent\nNubemacodie\n\nNov. 25th '80\n\nI reply to your letter of the 15th instant, I have not been able to request that you will give me more minute specifications of the precise object of which you state the probable cost would be about 27500 dollars, owing to the question of having the same constructed being properly considered.

If there is any question about the food supplies, Mr. Amos shall do so in the matter, so I do not consider the matter himself worth any amount that he may expend. He is a good mechanic, a reliable man and can furnish food supplies.

As you will see the lowest bid is $297.00. I have not yet awarded the contract to the party as I wish further information on the subject.\n\nThe Indians promise to labor the frame prepared by them for the contractor but in case they should fail to provide the frame shall be provided at cost of Department.\n\nAs it is impossible to get good Cedar Posts here I can Hemlock be used instead. Hugh & Co. Parties have mentioned the quality to me and myself know that Hemlock is generally used in this part of the Country. The Posts cannot now be sent before spring but the party selected that it can have every thing ready to go on with.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo __________________________\n\nOttawa, ________________________\n\nTo Rev.

The building therefore did not proceed.\n\nI feel sure that Beamsfield will be able to give you at some later date an opinion that a School House would be a blessing to them. But I also believe that it is useless to depend on the Indians to provide the means or any part of building. I might modify the former specification in such a way as to reduce cost of building and invite tenders again if you see fit to instruct me to do so.\n\nRemain\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nJames Ross\nIndian Agent\n\nTo the Dep.

Indian Affairs\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 189\u2014\n\nOn the 27th inst., referred to in the letter to him of the 27th July 1883, I asked to report what had been done in the matter. In his reply of the 10th inst., he states that he cannot find a letter dated July 12th, 1873. He makes a mistake, hope it was 1883. He states that the Indians were to get out and provide the frame for the building, but that they refused to do so although urged by him. The building will not therefore proceed. He states also that a school is necessary, but that it is useless to depend on the Indians to provide any part of the building. He states also that the former specifications might be amended in such way as to reduce the cost of the building. Fresh tenders be invited. I recommend that he be requested to forward the Specifications for examination in this respect.\n\nJohn M[?]\n\nPOOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nApproved\n\nOttawa, Feb 20th 1893\n\nWith ref. to Agent Cass' letter of the 17th instant relative to the erection of a school house at Shubenacadie I beg to report that some correspondence in the office of Mr. Cass was instructed on the 18th inst. to invite tenders for its erection subject to specifications imposed by him in that letter. He was informed at the same time that he must not exceed the sum of $300.00 which was to be paid for this purpose. On the 28th inst. that year he forwarded tenders of that of Mr. Joshua Sinclair for $294.00 was accepted by Mr. Cass who was informed on the 12th Dec. that year a bond enclosed for execution by the contractor. On the 7th July 1883 Mr. Cass was requested to state what had been done in the matter but no reply was received.\n\nAn application has recently been made by Mr. Chief & other members of the Band at this place for a School House.

D. H. Sup't Gen'l Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMemorandum\n14th June 1893\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nThe specifications submitted by Agent Cass for the proposed building at Sherbrooke are quite sufficient. A cheap building, suitable for a small country school-house is very well described.\n\nMr. Cass states he thinks the building can be erected for $300 to $350 and that possibly the tenders may come below this. The building with desks complete as described would under ordinary circumstances cost $350, but in Nova Scotia, where I am informed, labour and materials are cheap it is quite possible that the building may be erected for $300.\n\nSam Browne\n\n(No provision is made for a wood shed, stove pipe and water-closet, and fencing\u2014the sum voted is not sufficient\u2014I suppose a small sum might be placed in the Estimates for this purpose.)\nJames Gass Esq\nIndian Agent\nThiboumouche\nN.S.\n\nMarch 15th 93\n\nSir,\n\nI have to add the letter of your letter of the 8th inst.\nEnclosing specifications for the erection of a School House\nwith Indenture Booklet\nand asking to be allowed to call\nfor tenders for the erection thereof\non top.

Again, Thomas McDonald took down the old flue, and Simon Basque built the new one, with Henry Sack as his assistant, carrying bricks and mortar. What was Isaac Sack doing during the 2\u00bd days he was employed? Kindly explain.\n\nI presume your own charge in the matter was for the time occupied in coming to Shubenacadie to communicate by wire, and afterwards, in purchasing materials for the flue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMr. Martin E.

I could only give her such information as I possessed, and that may be read in the preceding paragraph.\n\nMiss Shortt feels aggrieved that the matter has been apparently neglected; and I think it my duty now to inform the Department that there is danger of losing the services of one of the best teachers in its employ in Nova Scotia, if final action be not taken in this case at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

I understand that Mr. Superintendent Beyd made certain recommendations regarding this past year but there was nothing done. I consider the following as being absolutely necessary and should be done before the school re-opens in September. The inside of the building refinished, as it is now it is very cold. The building should be shingled; this has not been done since it was built 21 years ago. The building has never been painted and should be painted inside and out. A wood house is badly needed as at present the wood gets wet as there is no shelter. A closet is required in the School to keep books, papers etc.\n\nA new Blackboard is urgently needed also a large Globe and map of the Dominion. The seats are in a disgraceful condition and new ones will have to be provided. I would suggest having a carpenter go over the building and report just what is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. G.

In his report he should give a detailed estimate of the cost of the necessary repairs. Kindly advise the Department of the dimensions of the blackboard required and also of the sizes of the seats needed and the number of each size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

S.\n\nBuilding needs shingling and painting.\n\nSgd. Mary A. Shortt\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, February 19, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian School, in her report for the year ended December 31st, last, states that the building needs shingling and painting.\n\nKindly state whether you consider this necessary and, if so, be good enough to submit a detailed estimate of the probable cost of having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 19th ultimo, I beg to say that the teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian school is quite correct in stating that the building needs shingling and painting. She might have stated also that her school room is very uncomfortable and should be improved. I made a note of these requirements when I visited the school on a tour of inspection recently.\n\nThe interior of the building was never completed, having received but one rough coat of plaster, and I would recommend that a second, or finishing coat be included in such repairs as may be decided upon. The windows also should be cased, and new seats and desks for the pupils furnished.\n\nIt is difficult to make a close estimate of the probable cost of repairs and improvements in this case, because the building may be in worse condition than outside appearances indicate, but I submit the following figures:\n\n- 10 M. Shingles @ 3.50, $35.00\n- 60 lbs. Nails .05, 3.00\n- Plastering 100 sq. yds. of surface, including cost of material, 15.00\n- Removing old shingles, 5.00\n- Laying new shingles, 12.00\n- Casing windows, including cost of material, 6.00\n- Glazing windows, 5.00\n- 6 seats and desks @ 3.50, 21.00\n- 6 gns. Paint, 2.50, 15.00\n- Work of painting, 10.00\n- Unforeseen, 13.00\n\n$140.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSize\n\n26' x 18' x 12' feet\nerected - 1894\n\n1 class room\n16' x 19' x 11' feet\nOttawa, May 22, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you obtain estimates necessary for the repairing of Shubenacadie Indian School from qualified persons in the vicinity.\n\nThe estimates to be in accordance with the attached specifications and is to have all of the work necessary to complete the building. The estimates to be submitted as soon as possible so that the work may be completed during the Summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn Asst.

A new floor is also required as the old one is worn through and would have to be replaced in at least another year.

I would recommend that the building be straightened into shape and a concrete wall 2 ft in height 8 inches at bottom and 10 inches at top be built under building also 3 piers under center of building. This would do away with the tendency of banking with holes the bottom of building. The ceiling is of wood and is full of knot holes and very much shrunk. I would recommend that this be covered with Beaver Board and painted. The plastering runs down to the floor without end base board for protection and is considerable broken.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 22, I humbly submit Mr. Baddell's estimate of cost of repair by the bedroll. It may be further stated that he has had a consultation with Inspector Boyd and the Inspector of Schools Mr. Campbell who in addition to the said repair would advise hardwood to be used instead of pine in the floor which would be about $15.00 additional.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\n[Stamp: DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS ARCHITECT]\nOttawa, 16th June, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in reference to repairs for the Shubenacadie Indian School with estimate enclosed for doing the work and in reply to inform you that the estimate of J.B.

Lawton\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nMr. P. B. Lawlor  \nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nMy dear Mr. Lawlor:\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to the Indian Reserve near Shubenacadie, I found the water supply most unsatisfactory. The water which I saw was very bad, and Mr. King tells me that after heavy rains it cannot be used for drinking purposes.\n\nLast summer the Dept. authorized the digging for a well on the Reserve, but a well sunk for the purpose of supplying water on this Reserve\u2014a similar well with a pump\u2014would be one way of remedying conditions on Indian Brook Reserve.\n\nThe school also should be supplied with a tank or some such container for water. Individual cups are also a necessity, particularly where there are suspected cases of tuberculosis.\n\nMr. King would be willing to see that the children brush their teeth, if they are supplied with toothbrushes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. T. Macdonald, P.E.I.\n\nBrook Village  \nInverness Co.  \nN.S.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find a letter from Miss C. T. McDonald, R. N., in which she advises me that she has found the water supply at the Indian Reserve unsatisfactory and recommends that a well be supplied to remedy this. Also that the school be supplied with a water tank and individual drinking cups, also tooth-brushes be furnished the children.\n\nI would say that I can procure a tank for $6.00. Drinking mugs from 20\u00a2 to 25\u00a2. Tooth brushes from 35\u00a2 to 50\u00a2.\n\nIn reference to the water supply would say that the following families, the Glodes, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Rubs Paul, Simon Paque, Mrs. King and the school get their water from a brook or a hole dug in a swamp. In summer the swamp dries up, also the water in the brook gets very low and at such time it is not very good for drinking purposes. Again after big rains when the brook is flooded, the water is muddy and unfit for use. During the winter months this brook which is away below the level of the road makes it very difficult, on account of ice conditions, for the people to carry the water from same.\n\nI would fully recommend that the well be dug near the school house with a pump attached to same as I think this quite necessary. I cannot give you an estimate of what this work would cost as I do not know how far one would have to sink to get the water. Just roughly, I think they would probably get water at a distance of 20 or 25 feet.\n\nIf the above request meets with your approval, kindly send me the necessary authority and I will have the articles asked for for the school procured as soon as possible and the well dug at the first convenient opportunity and think I can get Indian labor for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, December 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Miss MacDonald, travelling nurse for the Province of Nova Scotia, relative to the water supply at the Shubenacadie Indian School and Reserve, and recommending that a well be dug.\n\nIn reply I have to request that you will state whether you would advise that the work of sinking a well be carried out during the present winter or whether you would advise that it remain over until next spring. You should also state how you would propose having the work done, whether by day labour or not. You might state the cost per foot in digging the well, also the approximate cost of supplying a pump. If this well is dug, it should be located near the school building in order that the teacher and caretaker of the school could have oversight of same and see that the pump is not damaged. When we have further information from you as requested, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work of sinking the well carried out.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a covered tank for the drinking water for the use of the pupils, and also for the purchase of graniteware drinking cups for the pupils' use. Please instruct the teacher that she should take care that each pupil uses his or her own drinking cup. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the tank and drinking cups.\n\nWe are forwarding to you 15 tooth brushes for the use of the children, and when you receive same you should hand them to the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th inst., No. 51-1-5 in reference to having a well dug on the Indian Reserve, I would advise that the work of digging this well be left remaining over until next Spring when I will take the matter up further with you and give you all particulars regarding cost per foot in digging, pump, etc., and whether I can have the work done by day labor or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, January 8th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant relative to the digging of a well on the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve to provide a water supply for the Indian School and Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you recommend that the digging of this well be left until next spring, when you will further report in the matter giving particulars as to the cost, etc. You should keep this matter in mind and, when considered timely, you should furnish a report as to how you would recommend that the work be done, and the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Fowler\nAgent.\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find vouchers in favour Thompson & Fowler for goods supplied the Shubenacadie Indian Day School as per your instructions Letter January 5th 1927 # 51-1-4.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.B. Fowler\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR STAPLETON\non the Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\nReport dated January 25th, 1927.\n\nOriginal on File 51-1-6\n\n\"Would recommend a new stove, and a supply of dry wood to be delivered and piled in the woodshed in the Summer. The present stove is useless and the wood not so good as should be.\"\n\n\"The day I visited her was cold. She was not able to keep the children warm in the schoolroom and so took them to her own dwelling, where the work of the school was conducted.\"\nOttawa, March 1st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, recommends that a new stove be supplied, and also that a supply of dry wood be delivered and piled in the woodshed in the summer. He states that the present stove is useless, and the wood not as good as it should be. He also states that, on the day he visited the school, the teacher was not able to keep the children warm in the schoolroom, and took them into her own dwelling, where the school work was conducted.\n\nIf you consider that a new stove is required, you may arrange for the purchase of same. You should obtain a stove of a type suitable to properly heat the building. Please obtain competitive prices, if possible, from a number of dealers, and make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. Should any stove pipe be required, you may also arrange for the purchase of same. If you make this purchase, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. While a serviceable stove should be obtained, it should be purchased as cheaply as possible.\n\nRelative to the wood, it is noted that ten cords of hardwood were supplied in January, last, and stored in the woodshed. Please state whether you consider this quantity is sufficient to complete the present winter's requirements, and if any further supply would be required for next winter's use, and, if so, when you would recommend that the same be obtained. I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the matter of having a sufficient quantity of dry wood on hand for the balance of this winter and for next winter's use. You should also state what action you have taken regarding the purchase of a stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Lawlor,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie,\nN.S.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nI am taking it upon myself to write you to see if there cannot be something done in the way of putting up a shed that would do for a cow and horse. Ever since I came here (1923) I have been paying rent for first one stable and then another only to move at the owner's pleasure. Now the last one I had rented has been sold and the owner wants the building. You may imagine how pleasant it is to go on in this way.\n\nNow I cannot afford to put up\na shed nor do I want to sell my horse and cow. If I do neither of either of them would be very hard in a place like this. As I have every intention of remaining here for a time yet (unless the Sunfish happens), I am writing you to see what can be done. I don't want a large building. I think about 12' x 15', and say 10' high would be fine for cow and horse, and some hay. If the Lord will buy the material, I can have the work done at my own expense.\n\nAs I must have my house and cow & hay are stored by March 25th. I hope you will answer as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you,\n\nMrs. A. King\nOttawa, March 5, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that a grant be allowed you to assist in the erection of a shed to provide accommodation for a cow and horse owned by you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has never provided a grant towards the erection of a stable for the accommodation of livestock which is the property of the teacher. It is, therefore, regretted that it will not be possible to accede to your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. A. King,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMarch 25th\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter March 1st #57-1-5 in reference to the store wood at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, I found the store in fair condition, with the exception of a small crack in the side, which an expenditure of fifty cents for fire clay will remedy. The store is giving satisfaction and warms the School Room at any ordinary winter day.\n\nThe pipe has never been abused for some considerable time and needs to be replaced with new pipe and wire. Approx. 12 Lids of Pipe and 3 Elbows and wire for staying pipe in safe condition.\n\nThe wood is green hardwood of the finest quality. The windows require five panes 4' x 4' glass, and a minor quantity of putty to match same.\n\nThe wood shed requires a strong padlock to stop pilfering of wood. I would recommend that the above materials be obtained and a reliable man be sent out to the school to put the pipe up properly, fix the store, put in the glass and fix the warped door so it can be properly secured.\n\nI also examine the teacher's residence and find both doors destroyed or broken in the front and back door, also the wooden platform in the front damaged and the platform at the rear destroyed and buried down over the bank at the rear of the house, also the cellar drain in bad condition, being plugged up and water into cellar. The damaged platforms and door locks were caused by the work of parties unknown on Shubenacadie River.\n\nI cannot give an accurate estimate of what are the materials and work for above mentioned, but would estimate approximately Twenty-Five Dollars would cover same.\n\nIn reference again for the wood supply for the school, I would recommend that authority be given me to purchase this wood on a basis of ten\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAt...........................................\n\n...........................................19....\n\nten cords for the year, buying part dry wood during the Summer months and part green wood in the early part of the coming winter so I think it would be more economic and give more heating satisfaction in the School Room.\n\nThe brother informed me, they will be able to manage comfortably for the balance of this School term with the present condition of the store and wood.\n\nIf the above meets with your approval, kindly send me, the necessary authority and I will have the work attended to as promptly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nD.B. Cowley\nAgent-\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the stove, fuel supply and repairs, etc., required at the school and teacher's residence at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School.\n\nRelative to the stove, it is noted that at a small cost the same can be put in a satisfactory condition. The quantity of stove pipe required is also noted. You may purchase the number of lengths of pipe, elbows and wire required and have this new pipe installed, and the stove repaired. You may also purchase the number of panes of window glass of the size required and the quantity of putty necessary to install same.\n\nYou may also purchase a strong padlock, with key, and have same installed on the woodshed.\n\nWith reference to the teacher's residence, you may have locks installed on the front and rear doors, also the wooden platforms at the front and rear of the building repaired and placed in good condition. The cellar drain should be cleaned out. We note that the cost of these repairs will be approximately $25. You should purchase the materials required in making the above repairs, and you may engage the services of a competent man to do all of the work mentioned above. When this work has been done to your satisfaction, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the materials and for the labour in having the work done. It is expected that you will keep the expense down to the lowest possible point.\n\nWith reference to the wood supply for the use of the school, you may purchase this wood on the basis of 10 cords for the year, buying part dry wood during the summer months and part green wood in the early part of next winter. You should obtain competitive prices, if possible, for the supplying of the wood, and the purchase should be made from the person quoting the lowest price. Vouchers should be forwarded in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Knowles\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nSir:\n\nOf my last visit to the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, I found that the side walls of the school house are badly in need of repair. The plaster is cracked and peeling from the walls. I would request that a competent man be employed to repair these walls and that they be given a coat of paint to make them clean and improve their appearance. The approximate cost of same would be about Twenty Five Dollars.\n\nIf this meets with your approval, kindly send me the necessary authority and we will have some attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.B. Fowler\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you, that I have had the School House stove cleaned and the platform repaired and locks renewed on the Teacher's Residence.\n\nI have to advise you in reference to the Cellar Drain, that the present drain is useless so far as keeping the Cellar clean from water is concerned, and that it is necessary to dig a new drain.\n\nThe Brick Walls under the house are also in bad condition and eventually will tumble down. I could have these walls pointed and repaired and they would last for a time and save the expense of putting New Walls under the house at the present time.\n\nThis work including the materials would cost approximately Twenty dollars.\n\nI would advise that the work be done and if same meets your approval, kindly send me the necessary authority and I will have same started to be promptly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nO.B. Fowler\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nOttawa, May 4th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, informing the Department that the side walls of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School building are badly in need of repair and that the plaster is cracked and falling from the walls. In reply I beg to say that you may engage the services of a competent man to repair these walls, and they may be given a coat of muresco. We note that you estimate the approximate cost of having this work done to be about $25. If possible, this amount should not be exceeded.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date regarding the repairs required to the back walls under the house. You may arrange to have these walls pointed and repaired. We note that you estimate the cost of this work, including material, to be approximately $20.\n\nIf the above repairs would interfere with the classroom work, it might be advisable to wait until the summer holidays to have the work done. The Department will, however, leave this matter in your hands to have the repairs carried out when considered advisable by yourself.\n\nWhen the above authorized work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. H. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSir:-\n\nEnclosed please find vouchers in favor of D. B. Lawlor, with itemized receipted accounts attached hereto for plastering, murescoing and cleaning the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, as per your instructions.\n\nIn reference to same, would say that the cost of same exceeded the estimate given you from the fact that the plasterer, after quoting the price I submitted you, refused to do the work and I had to engage these men to do same.\n\nAfter finishing the walls, the ceiling looked so badly in need of cleaning that I had this done and then also had the men give the school house a thorough scrubbing and cleaning, which I trust will meet with your full approval.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nD.B. Lawlor\nAgent\n\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI return herewith the accounts which you submitted for repairs to the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. I have had them attached to proper voucher forms for your signature. You will note that the $4.00 which you have charged for livery hire has been attached to a separate voucher as it is not considered chargeable to Indian Education, but is charged against Agent's Travelling Expenses.\n\nKindly sign the vouchers and return them to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

King, teacher of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, regarding the furnishings in the teacher's residence. She desires to purchase this furniture should it not be required after the school closes at the end of the present month.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish the Department as soon as possible with an inventory of the furniture and any supplies in the residence which are the property of this Department. You should also state whether you would recommend that these furnishings be sold and the value you place on each item. We are informing Mrs. King that the matter has been referred to you.

February 25th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you already know, the Teachers Residence at Shubenacadie is to vacated on February 25th.\n\nIndian Agent Mr. D.B. Lawlor of that place has recommended that Joe Howe Jr., who has recently married a widow woman, be allowed to live in this house, provided that the Department has no other plan in view.\n\nMr. Lawlor reports that Mr. Howe is willing to pay a small sum for the house, but I think the Department should keep the house as their property and allow Howe the use of it while he resides at Shubenacadie.\n\nI recommend that Agent Lawlor be authorized to allow Joe Howe Jr. to dwell in this house until further notice.\n\nThere are two children in the above mentioned family.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

As these furnishings will not be further required, the Department will approve of your arranging for their sale to Mrs. King, the former teacher, providing she will take the lot and pay for same at time of delivery to her. We note you estimate the value of the furnishings to be approximately $28.25 and, if you consider this to be a fair price, you may dispose of same at that figure. You should forward the amount received direct to the Department for credit of the Receiver General.\n\nMr. Maxner recommends that Joe Howe, Jr., be permitted to occupy the teacher's house during the time he resides at Shubenacadie, and the Department will have no objection to his living in the house provided he takes proper care of same and that no damage is occasioned by himself or his family. The Department is not prepared to authorize the sale of this house at the present time.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector Maxner that you have been authorized to arrange for the sale of the furniture and to permit Joe Howe to have the use of the house during the pleasure of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Please state whether they are double or single desks and, if possible, the name of the manufacturer.\n\nWe are opening a new school on a reserve in the Province of New Brunswick, and it is thought that if any of the desks that were in use at the Shubenacadie School are serviceable they could be used in this new school. You should also state whether there is a teacher's desk and chair on hand and the condition of same. Your early reply is requested giving full information regarding the desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. B.

They were made by some local carpenter about 35 years ago. The material is spruce and they are more or less deformed and are nailed solidly to the floor.\n\nThe teacher's desk is in good condition size length 42 inches width 28 inches height 36 inches. The teacher's chair is just an ordinary skeleton chair and damaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nD.B. Fowler\nAgent\n\nJ.W. Murray Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWindsor\nNova Scotia\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing letter received this morning from Agent Lawlor of Shubenacadie. I presume you wrote to Mr. Lawlor asking for information re school desks, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.W. Marner\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 16th instant relative to the proposed Indian Island Indian Day School, I have to inform you that you may arrange to have temporary desks or tables built locally for this school. This equipment should be of a type that will be satisfactory until such time as it is ascertained whether the work at this point will be a success or not. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and, after these desks have been built and placed in the residence which is being rented for school purposes, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThis Department recently closed an Indian day school at Shubenacadie, N.S., but we are informed by the local Agent, D. B. Lawlor, Windsor, N.S., that the pupils' desks are in very poor condition and are not worth shipping for use in the proposed Indian Island School. There is, however, a teacher's desk in good condition at Shubenacadie, and we are requesting Mr. Agent Lawlor to arrange to have this desk shipped to you at Richibucto, N.B., and to prepay the shipping charges. There is no teacher's chair, and you may arrange for the purchase of an inexpensive chair for the teacher's use. When the teacher's desk arrives at Richibucto, you should arrange to have it taken to the Indian Island School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, June 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Maxner has forwarded your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the condition of the desks that are on hand at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. It is noted that these desks are more or less defaced and in an unserviceable condition. It is thought that they are not worth shipping to the proposed new Indian day school which is being opened in New Brunswick.\n\nRelative to the teacher's desk, it is noted that this is in good condition, and I have to request that you will arrange to have same shipped by freight, charges prepaid, addressed to Mr. Charles Hudson, Indian Agent, Richibucto, N.B. Please prepay the freight charges, and obtain a receipt for same. This you should attach to a voucher form, in duplicate, for the amount of the freight charged prepaid by you, and send to the Department, when a refund will be made you for the cost of the freight. We are informing Mr. Agent Hudson that this teacher's desk is being shipped to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nD. B.

S.\nShubenacadie N.S.\nMay 8th 1933\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No 51-1-5 April 25, 1933 regarding teacher's residence at former Shubenacadie Indians' Day School. This house is occupied at the present time by two Indian families.\n\nThis is good house, but is badly in need of repairs.\n\nTherefore I have made investigation and found that it will cost about twenty-five dollars $25.00 for repairs.\n\nThis includes labor at the rate of $4.00 per hour and material and hardware.\n\nThere may be a few other repairs which I did not see; after we tear the shingles off.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nAllison Macdonald\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRegarding correspondence hereunder relative to repairs required to the building formerly used as a teacher's residence at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, I have to say that, since the opening of the residential school, this building has not been required for school purposes. As it is now occupied by two Indian families, the repairs, as recommended by the Indian Agent, if carried out, should not form a charge against the Appropriation for Indian Education. It is not likely that this building will again be required as a teacher's residence, as the school has been permanently closed. Therefore, any expenditure in connection with the up-keep of the building, while occupied by Indians, should be paid from the Appropriation for Relief.\n\nThe Secretary:\nI would suggest that Mr. Parker be requested to look into this matter when he visits this Agency.\n\nMay 5, 1933\n\n[Signature]\n\n6/5/33\n| Acct No. | Clerk | Account Forwarded |\n|----------|-------|------------------|\n| Jan 23   |       | 600               |\n|          |       | 500               |\n|          |       | 100               |\n|          |       | 100               |\n|          |       | 49                |\n\nTotal: $2178\n\nFor Silver River Account\n\n41\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 506\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1936 | To Mr. Edward Kerr | $21.78 |\n\nTotal: $21.78\nOttawa, July 8, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to re-open the day school on the Shubenacadie reserve. You should, therefore, immediately notify the occupant of the school that she must vacate the building in order that you can arrange for removing the partitions and placing the building in proper condition for a classroom.\n\nWhen I met you in Shubenacadie, you definitely stated that in the event of the day school being opened the Indians would do the necessary work without cost to the Department.\n\nIt will be necessary to erect two new toilets. You should therefore let me know at once what materials are required for these toilets and also what materials will be required for repairing the school.\n\nThe Department will depend on you to make this building as habitable as possible.\n\nArrangements will be made to purchase new desks. You will be notified when they reach Shubenacadie and you should arrange to have them taken to the reserve and placed in the school.\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention, in order that the school may be opened on September 5.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.
