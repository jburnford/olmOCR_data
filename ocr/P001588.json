The diary of Louis Riel. 2. The minute book and Orders in Council of the insurgent council. 3. The correspondence of Louis Riel.\n\nBy Order.\n\nJ. A.

W.\u2014INTRODUCING DEPUTATION, &c.\u2014DECLARING NORTH-WEST IN A STATE OF REBELLION, AND PRAYING RIEL TO RETURN.\n\nSt. Louis de Langevin, 18th May, 1884.\n\nLouis Riel, Esq.\n\nDear Cousin,\u2014This deputation sent to you I hope will not surprise you; you must expect conflicts, treated as the people of the North-West are by the Government, and you must know better than we do what is taking place in this part of the country. In the first place, I will not speak to you about all the acts of injustice and of the way the Government is treating us, and also the Indians; you know that better than we do.\n\nI shall speak to you of the uneasiness felt by everyone\u2014everyone, French and English; I must not speak of the Indians, who are not the least to be feared; for my part I have always looked after them. The movement has been going on for four months, meeting after meeting; we wanted to unite the French and the English, not an easy thing to do at first sight. You know the English, they wanted to rebel at once; we wanted to bring them round to you. As to the English half-breeds, they have a great confidence in you, and they are numerous. They greatly regret that in the matter of 1870 they were against you. They are now the most eager of all.\n\nHence, my dear cousin, we may say that the part of the North-West in which we are living is Manitoba before the troubles, with the difference that there are more people, that they understand things better, and that they are more determined; you will form an idea as to the conditions upon which the people base their claims, for the reason that there are many people in the North-West whom the Government have recognized less than Indians; and yet it is these poor half-breeds who have always defended the North-West at the price of their blood and their sacrifices for a country which is stirring up the whole world today. They have been petitioning for the last ten years. I suppose the Government have looked upon the matter as\nmere child's play; despite formal documents and Acts of Parliament as a guarantee, the whole matter has been a farce; the honor of Parliament and of the Government has been trampled under foot when justice was to be done to the poor half-breeds.\n\nMy dear cousin, I think the solemn moment has come. For my part, I have closely watched the people of the North-West, as well as the Indians, and the one cry resounds from all; it is a spark over a barrel of powder. It is late, but it is the time now more than ever, for we have right and justice on our side. Do not imagine that you will begin the work when you get here; I tell you it is all done, the thing is decided; it is your presence that is needed. It will, in truth, be a great event in the North-West; you have no idea how great your influence is, even amongst the Indians. I know that you do not like the men much, but I am certain it will be the grandest demonstration that has ever taken place, and the English are speaking about it already.\n\nNow, my dear cousin, the closest union exists between the French and English and the Indians, and we have good generals to foster it. I may tell you that Mr. Lepine has a hand in the matter; and I need not speak of Mr. Gabriel Dumont, the delegate, you will learn the truth from him; you may believe him, he is a prudent and intelligent man. He was an old leader on the plains and has great influence with the half-breeds; he will inform you as to everything that is going on. My dear cousin, you have perhaps thought it strange that we did not send other men. I answer that a better choice was not possible than Dumont. As to Michel Dumas, you perhaps know him, he is well instructed in English and French. The others you can take just as they are, they are influential men, the chief man is M. Dumont; as to the English party, he is their choice. He is a most intelligent and devoted man, you may depend upon it. You will see by the documents that they have all their provisions; as to means, they are on hand and in abundance. Dear friend, you desire, of course, to be avenged, and not merely for vengeance sake, for that would be wrong; but this wretched Government has so abused its power and been so faithless to all its promises. No doubt had they done what they promised, you would have remained in your country and defended your people; but your banishment involved that of your whole people, and where is the half-breed who does not feel the blow of your banishment and is not ready to defend you to the last drop of his blood? The whole race is calling for you!\n\nI conclude, my dear cousin, by commending to you myself and your race and country you have so faithfully served, with the conviction that you will make a supreme effort, with the protection of the God of all Nations and of all Glory, for which history will award you, rank with the greatest heroes of this age. And you will most certainly come to the help of an unhappy race, which is being treated with contempt, and which its enemies are striving to extirpate,\u2014the poor half-breed people.\n\nWith sincere good wishes,\n\nN. C. W.\n\nExcuse my orthography.\n\nLETTER FROM T. Z.\u2014NO ADDRESS\u2014EVIDENTLY TO MR. RIEL re AFFAIRS IN NORTH-WEST.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nSAINT LOUIS DE LANGEVIN, 20th May, 1884.\n\nMY DEAR FRIEND.\u2014I am pleased to have an opportunity today of writing you a few lines. Being unable to forget the old links that united us closely of old, and enabled us to enjoy sweet leisure and so many delightful hours together, I would fain remind you of them all once more and revive them, if that were possible. I need not attempt to express to you the warm sentiments of my heart, you know them of old; they are still the same. They are equally sincere as in the past, and, I venture to say, more warm and heartfelt as time goes by. I desire, today, to give you a clear proof of this by telling you of the sedition news now stirring up the North-West.\nThis province has an arbitrary government which is harassing the poor half-breed people out of its very existence. Their most sacred rights are completely ignored. They are treated like slaves, and degraded as though they deserved the utmost contempt. But all these things have long been known to you. For this reason, the North-West Territory is, as it were, on a volcano just about to burst forth in eruption. The excitement is almost universal. Men's minds are everywhere excited. Since the month of March last public meetings have, time and again, been held. Eloquent and stirring addresses have been delivered. The French and English half-breeds are now united, the latter, especially, seeming to be more excited than the first named. We are all one party in support of the justice of our despised rights. It looks as though a real sedition were on the point of breaking out. All are crying out against injustice, demanding fair play and urging the granting of our rights. Mr. Charles Nolin, himself, one of our warmest champions, has declared, again and again, that in every part of the North-West, which he has visited, the half-breeds are prepared to rise to a man in vindication of their just claims. The cry in favor of the good cause is, therefore, universal. Now that all is settled unanimously by all parties, we need a head, a chief. No one of us feels himself qualified to undertake the task of making so great a protest against despotic authority. We all turn our eyes towards you, in whom our dearest hopes and deepest trust are centered, all except a few pretentious individuals of Prince Albert, who would fain be thought something above the common herd and who are afraid of being led by you. We elect you as our chief. We all cry out to you to come to our assistance, knowing that you alone are able to defend us. Not only do the half-breeds in general beseech you to listen to their prayer, but the people of the other races, who do not know you, beg us to express the same wishes on their behalf. Be good enough, therefore, to give a cordial reception to the delegation sent to you. Those who constitute it are all men who enjoy our confidence. There is, perhaps, one of them as to whom you may have some suspicion. Mr. Michel Dumas seems so devoted to our cause that he has won our confidence on this occasion. Mr. Louis Schmidt was at first to have gone in his place; but he was tempted and finally won over by a chance of making money. He got a situation in the Land Office which gives him $60.00 per month; this made him decline the honor of enjoying your presence. The two chief delegates are Mr. Gabriel Dumont and Mr. Isbister. They are appointed to make known to you our just claims. They will submit them for your approval or otherwise, and will abide by your decision. In any case, they are to bring you back to us and satisfy our eager longing to have you in our midst. If not, we beg you to state to our delegates why you cannot undertake the long journey, so that we may give to those who may be against you the sound reasons preventing your coming. Do not be uneasy as to the travelling expenses (should you decide to come), you will have nothing to fear in that respect, at least such is my opinion, though the delegation may not mention it.\n\nI have nothing further of interest to mention at this critical moment. I have now but to offer you the affectionate greetings of all who know you and who loudly proclaim themselves your subjects, and the friendly wishes of all my family.\n\nWith a cordial grasp of the hand I heartily subscribe myself your tender friend.\n\nT. L.\n\nP.S.\u2014I have still many things to say if I could write myself, but being unable to do so, as you know, I shall reserve the narrative until you come.\n\nREPORT re AGITATION FROM JACKSON TO RIEL.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 23rd July, 1884.\n\nDear Mr. Riel,\u2014I sent the reports off in good shape by mail last night. We telegraphed to Free Press to have your speech wired (about 1,000 words). I made a copy for the Mail and retained the original, in case they should wire us today. I met Mr. Beatty. Mr. Isbister introduced me, as he was starting for Carrot rive.\nand sent with him two letters, one to a prominent Conservative, the other to a Liberal, that they might act in unison. Without rousing any personal prejudice, I described the great benefits which you had conferred upon us, so I think they will not look a gift horse in the mouth, but suspend their judgment for the present and set to work. I invited them to make out their requirements and choose a delegate to Executive Committee, sending document and name to me. Mr. Beatty will set all going smoothly and then set out for his new home in Stony Creek District, where he will consolidate a strong North-West party. Beatty is the man who objected to my condoning Deacon's interference. You will remember, a good solid man.\n\nTo-day, I shall finish up work in town, and to-morrow start for the Lower States, &c. I will try and get out to your place toward end of week. Please be working up the petition into shape, and we will get it in neat form before the committee is called to endorse or alter it, as they see fit. I have received the Dominion Register, and the Consolidated Acts of Manitoba; will bring them out with me. There is a big work for us while the petition is waiting an answer, but I think we will be ready for a stiff campaign when the answer does come. A number of trimmers are waiting to see if the current in your favor will last. By the time they are satisfied it will be too late for them to bother us much, if disposed to do so.\n\nT. J. Agnew proposed to Macilse that the Conservatives should take counsel together, and adopt your platform under their party name. If they do so, they will be snared by their own subtlety. Men who are willing to betray their country for party ends are going to learn that it is a speedy form of political suicide. Just imagine their thinking that they understand our policy. What a mess they would soon make of it.\n\nMacilse is going to put his ideas into shape and hand them in to me.\n\nI settled matters, commercial and political, with J. F. Betts, shook hands with him, and cordially asked him to show his brain power in our work. He was somewhat astonished, I think, by my change of front, but I hope will shortly gather himself together and wire in.\n\nJ. O. Davis is thinking their mercantile as just out; also other merchants. I set Joe Knowles to work on the solution of the statistical problem, and I think he will do good work for us. I have seen Barker and other mechanics in regard to the effect of the Government's policy on trade. There is no necessity for awaiting statistics, of course, before drawing up the petition. That is a very simple matter, and could be done without any returns at all, in fact, for he who runs may read the numbers under which we labor. At the same time, I have circulated the fullest invitation for every man to hand in his list. The town may possibly not elect its delegates in time for our drawing up the petition, but they have been invited to do so, and I will try and bring a good man with me on their behalf. I shall be just as well pleased if they reserve their strength for the statistical work, and we will not be ready for that till Knowles and I have come to a focus. He has a good head for that kind of business. A clear, concise, logical petition will strengthen our hands more than a month of speechifying. Any bungling work will earn for us the contempt of the business men. I have got on a friendly footing with Owen E. Hughes,* and will cautiously try and induce him to give us his ideas. He is a shrewd businessman. I may write up a reassuring explanation of our work in a manner to disarm prejudice, and put it in the Times for the benefit of our home audience. I am in good health, except a slight cold, and enjoy good rest, and hope that you, also, are in good shape. We will not get much respite till after the petition, but we can rest calm and peaceful as to the result, while the enemies of our God are lying on their beds devising evil things against themselves. Clarke, Sproule & Co. have gone up to Battleford. They will inevitably prepare the good men to receive our doctrine, for they will associate with the oppressors of the people. The idea of sending an apostle in a quiet way up the run is suggesting itself to the minds of many, and I let it work. Providence knows the right man for the right work, and there is no use dictating to Him. Macilse wrote privately to Blake asking him not to stop at L. Clarke's, and Blake wrote back that his health would not permit him to visit the-\nNorth-West this summer. Your visit may cause him to change his plans, but I can keep posted through Maclese, who has kept up a correspondence with him since 1882.\n\nFisher is my lieutenant among the young men of the place, and keeps me posted as to the enemy's movements in that quarter. I think Deacon, who is a Methodist, has seen Mr. Parker, but Mr. Parker is too sound on principle to be lost to us. Mr. McWilliam, the Presbyterian minister, who has hitherto been a Liberal, stated last night at supper table that \"he has yet to learn what our grievances are.\"\n\nIt is the misfortune of clergymen that they see only one side of a man's character, and Mr. Sproule is a prominent pillar of the Presbyterian church.\n\nYet Mr. McWilliam is too good a man I think to be blinded for any length of time. I will leave him to form his opinion from events, and our petition may enlighten him as to our grievances.\n\nIt is Mr. Elliott's opinion that Mr. Jackson is too clever and lacks tact. My past line of action justifies that opinion, and it is perhaps as well that they are so well satisfied with a false key.\n\nDr. Porter's wife is a niece of Donald A. Smith, who is a close friend of Swanson's, and invests his money for him. These circumstances have their significance, but I believe their good hearts will carry them through. \"The smoking flax He will not quench.\"\n\nClark, the druggist, is apparently trying to serve God and Mammon. Let us pray that the best may prevail. The influence of an unprincipled friend is a terrible snare to a young man, especially one of keen intellect.\n\nThe Free Press has just wired for Riel's speech in full. I am going up with Ab. Parker after dinner. I have a great affection for Ab. I believe him to be a good, honest soul. I have got the prices paid to Hudson Bay Company contrasted with prices paid ordinarily for supplies, a valuable document; also the answer of the Secretary of State (Chaplean) to Norquay anent Manitoba demands.\n\nIf any of our friends think I am not getting through business fast enough, please reassure them. You know me and my work, and an element of discontent is dangerous to the cause. I think I see our way clear to raising all the funds we want.\n\nI think I have stated everything at present. I miss you very much, but it is as well that I learn to keep a close direct hold on the Father's hand.\n\nYour friend,\n\nWILL JACKSON.\n\nI can't find my seal; all right; yet the enemy will only use it to their own destruction, if they do intercept it.\n\n22nd March, 1884.\u2014Swearing Secretoy.\n\n(Translated.)\n\nWe, the undersigned, solemnly swear before God that we will keep the secret of this meeting held at Abraham Montour's this 22nd day of March, A.D. 1884, that is to say, all that shall be and has been decided thereat, and in general all the decisions thereof.\n\nAlexandre + Arcan,\nmark.\n\nPierre + Garepy,\nmark.\n\nBaptiste + Pruneau,\nmark.\n\nPascal + Montam,\nmark.\n\nGabriel + Dumont,\nmark.\n\nIsidore + Dumont,\nmark.\n\nAbraham + B\u00e9langer,\nmark.\n\nEmmanuel + Champagne,\nmark.\n\nBaptiste + Parentean,\nmark.\n\nBaptiste + Boucher,\nmark.\nT. E. JACKSON TO RIEL, RE AGITATION.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 2nd August, 1884.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014The Opposition are endeavoring to excite the prejudices of those who are \"on the fence,\" by making capital out of the visit of Big Bear and Lucky Man, insinuating that you are encouraging an Indian outbreak. Will you please send me a private letter, which I can make public to those whom it is advisable to reassure, stating the facts of the case.\n\nI hear that D. H. Macdonald telegraphed to P\u00e8re Andr\u00e9 to-day, or a day or two ago, stating that Sir John A. Macdonald had written to Dewdney, telling him that as soon as the Minister of the Interior (D. L. McPherson) returns from England, that he will look into the half-breed grievances, and I understand that P\u00e8re Andr\u00e9 is advising the people he influences to be satisfied with this assurance; I regret this, and trust the reverend p\u00e8re will change his mind, or lose his influence. The promise of big things from the Government may infuse life into the Opposition, but comparatively few will be influenced. A favorable feeling toward the movement is growing every day among the mass of the people. Hoping to hear from you very soon,\n\nI have the honor to remain yours very truly,\n\nT. E. JACKSON.\n\nMR. LOUIS RIEL.\n\nLETTER FROM RIEL'S COUNCIL TO ENGLISH HALF-BREEDS ASKING THEIR CO-OPERATION.\n\nST. ANTOINE, 21st March, 1885.\n\nTo the English Half-breeds of Red Deer Hill, St. Catharines and St. Paul:\n\nDear Brothers in Jesus Christ,\u2014The Ottawa Government has been maliciously ignoring the rights of the original half-breeds during fifteen years. The petitions which have been sent to that Government on that matter and concerning the grievances which our classes have against its policy are not listened to; moreover, the Dominion has taken the high handed way of answering peaceable complaints by dispatching and reinforcing their Mounted Police. The avowed purpose being to confirm in the Saskatchewan their Government spoliation and usurpation of the rights and liberties of all classes of men, except their resident oppressors, the Hudson's Bay Company and land speculators, by threatening our liberty and our lives. The\naboriginal half-breeds are determined to save their rights or to perish at once. They are supported with no doubtful energy by a large number of abler half-breeds, who have come to the Saskatchewan less as emigrants than as proscripts from Manitoba. Those of the emigrants who have been long enough in this country to realize that Ottawa does not intend to govern the North-West so much as to plunder it, are in sympathy with the movement. Let us all be firm in the support of right, humane and courageous, if in him to fight just and equitable in our views, thus God and man will be with us, and we will be successful.\n\nDear Brothers, in the council of the French Canadian half-breeds, now under arms at St. Anthony and in the Saskatchewan, have been most happy to receive your friendly communications through your Messrs. Scott, Ross and William D., sympathies for the stand which we are compelled to take. * * * The fact that your delegation and ours have crossed each other, affords convincing proof that our feelings are mutual.\n\nJustice commands to take up arms.\n\nSigned by Councillors, Secretary, &c.\n\nLOUIS \"DAVID\" RIEL, Exovede.\n\nMEETING AT ST. CATHERINES\u2014RESOLUTIONS RE OUTBREAK.\n\nAt a public meeting held within St. Catherine's church on the evening of the 22nd March, 1885.\n\nRev. Mr. Matheson was appointed chairman, and Mr. Wm. Craig secretary to the meeting.\n\nThe chairman having stated that his object in calling the meeting was to ascertain the mind of the inhabitants and promote the interests of peace at the present crisis.\n\nA lengthened discussion ensued, after which, on the motion of Mr. Wm. Craig, seconded by Mr. Wm. Hodgson, it was unanimously resolved:\n\n1st. That the members of this meeting continue to sympathise as they have always done with the French half-breeds in their desire to obtain their legal rights by all constitutional means.\n\n2nd. That they don't approve of the resort to arms or the raising of the Indians, and wish to remain neutral.\n\n3rd. That a copy of this minute be despatched without delay to the officer in charge at Carlton, and another to Mr. Riel.\n\nSigned on behalf of the residents of St. Catherines,\n\nE MATHESON, Chairman.\nWM. CRAIG, Secretary.\n\nThe meeting appoint Messrs. Inkster and Hodgson also to sign on behalf of the whole meeting.\n\nGEORGE INKSTER,\nWM. HODGSON.\n\nThe undersigned concur in the above resolution on behalf of meeting at St. Catherines.\n\nCHARLES ADAMS,\nANDREW SPENCER,\nANDREW PETERSON.\n\nLETTER FROM ADAMS AND PRITCHARD, ENCLOSING RESOLUTIONS.\n\nSir,\u2014Enclosed you will find resolutions, passed by a mass meeting, in our neighborhood. But we think a great deal depends on the wisdom and humanity of those at the head of affairs on either side.\n\nMay God give you wisdom to order things aright.\n\nCHAS. ADAMS, Chairman.\nJ. F. PRITCHARD Secretary.\nMEETING AT ST. ANDREW'S\u2014RESOLUTIONS RE OUTBREAK.\n\nAt a mass meeting held in St. Andrew's school house, Monday, 23rd March, instant, to discuss the present critical situation,\n\nMr. C. Adams was called to the chair, and Rev. Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Stanfield, joint secretaries, the following resolutions were unanimously carried:\n\nProposed by Mr. Alex. McKay, seconded by Mr. Chas. G. Bird, sen., and unanimously resolved\u2014\n\n1st. That while heartily sympathizing with the French in their endeavors constitutionally to get redress of their many grievances, we cannot endorse their present attitude in taking up arms for that purpose, and we hereby beg of them not to shed blood.\n\n2nd. That the opinion of this meeting is that, had the Government been just with the settlers, this disturbance would never have been.\n\n3rd. And further, had the influential citizens of Prince Albert joined the movement, instead of ignoring it, had they advised the Government instead of exciting it against the people, it is the opinion of this meeting that the Government would have settled all grievances long ere this.\n\n4th. That we, the English, half-breed and Canadian settlers, while advocating peace and remaining completely neutral as resorting to arms, do not for one moment lose sight of our grievances, and will henceforth use all lawful means for the redress of the same.\n\n5th. That a copy of these resolutions be sent to Major Crozier, and one to Mr. Riel.\n\nSigned on behalf of the settlers of St. Andrews, Red Deer Hill and surrounding country.\n\nJ. F. PRITCHARD, Secretary.\nALEX. STANSFIELD,\nRODERICK COOK,\nANDREW SPENCE.\n\nCHAS. ADAMS, Chairman.\nGEO. GLAISTER,\nTHOMAS MCCORRISTER,\nW. HODGSON.\n\nRIEL TO ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLE OF PRINCE ALBERT,\nRE UNITING IN ACTION.\n\nMISSION OF THE SACRED HEART, 29th March, 1885.\n\nNOTES.\u2014If the police could be isolated from the people at Prince Albert, we would make them surrender easily. I think we could keep them as hostage until we join them, without endorsing or taking up arms, if you feel too much repugnance to do it; but send us delegates to meet ours; we will discuss the condition of our entering into confederation as a province.\n\nThe emigrants, as well as the natives, have a clear case against the Hudson's Bay Company. Do not strengthen her monstrous monopoly by helping along her shrewd, miserable scheme, at the present crisis. If you leave the Hudson's Bay Company and the mounted police, you will see how far we will go to uproot her influence from the Saskatchewan.\n\nLet us unite in those interests which are common to the English and French half-breeds and to the emigrants, and we will celebrate in peace and in success the 24th of May.\n\nBut if we cannot unite, the struggle will grow. Indians will come in from all quarters, and many people will cross this line early this spring, and perhaps our difficulties will end in an American fourth of July.\n\nLOUIS \"DAVID\" RIEL, Exovede.\nS. G. CROZIER TO MACKAY GIVING A TELEGRAM TO BE FORWARDED IN CIPHER.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 30th March, 1885.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Telegraph the following cipher in my name to the Commissioner.\n\nRiel warned all settlers from farms, or would be forced to join him, or be shot, gave them forty-eight hours' notice. People flocking in. Irvine appointed me supply officer. Send flour, bacon to Troy, send 2,000 sacks flour via Calgary to Edmonton, and 4,000 lbs. bacon, if safe. Steamer from here will be sent up to bring it down. Carlton burned to the ground, have saved all furs and bulk of provisions, lot of goods destroyed. Population all in arms. Police here; tell my people I am safe; just got our dead in from Duck Lake, nine in all. Will wire every opportunity, provisions for further transport already at G. Lake.\n\nS. G. CROZIER.\n\nWm.

MONKMAN, RE TREATMENT OF THE SIOUX INDIANS AND HALF-BREEDS, &c.\n\nBATOCH\u00c9, 2nd April, 1885.\n\nDear Brother,\u2014Will you receive all Indians from Beardy's band and see about rations for them?\n\nWe are receiving, today, all the Sioux from Round Plain, and the half-breeds, and we shall be strong enough, and we are afraid to run short of rations, so we expect that you will treat them kindly and keep them under your order, and give rations to every one, and to his family as long as he or they will be under your control at the fort.\n\nLend them horses and cattle, if possible, to help them to get to Carlton.\n\nTake courage, and we would advise the keeping of guards on top of the hills.\n\nBelieve us, dear brother, your brothers in Jesus Christ.\n\nFor the Council.\n\nPH.

We have fault to find with you gentlemen, members of the council. We find drunken men on every side along the river. It seems to us it is the duty of all of you to see to this matter. It seems to us that you are inactive. What grieves us is to see you on the other hand quarrelling amongst yourselves and giving trouble to those who act right. From the way you are acting we fear greatly that you will dishearten many amongst us. The best course to take is to come to a clear understanding amongst yourselves, once for all. We promised to keep temperance in times of the hardest struggle, and now that things do not look quite so bad as they were we want to fall back! We rely on you to set matters right.\n\nYours truly,\n\nNAPOLEON NAULT,\nJOSEPH DELORME,\nPATRICE TOUROND,\nBAPTISTE OUDELETTE,\nPATRICE FLURIE.\nPROMISE OF NEUTRALITY &c., FROM V.

FOURMOND, O.M.I.\n\nLETTER FROM THE WIFE OF GEORGE NESS TO LOUIS RIEL PRAYING FOR THE RELEASE OF HER HUSBAND.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nSt. Antoine, March, 1885.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Excuse me for troubling you like this, but you are the only person in whom I trust to have pity on me, who am so deserving of pity, left alone as I am with my three little children who are very young, no near neighbour to help me to take care of our little animals, and, also, you have arrested my husband when he was trying to get something for his little family. Oh! believe me, it is I who am the cause of your having taken him. The day before I told him and begged him to go and sell his horse to get provisions, and also several things of which we are greatly in want, such as shoes and clothing for my children. Thus, dear Sir, having great confidence in your devotion to the half breeds, I thought I would appeal to your charity to give me a little of what I need. Ah! Sir, were it not for the help of the grace of God, our common Father, I should die of loneliness and grief at being separated from my husband, who is so good. But may the holy will of God be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Dear Sir, oh, how happy I should be to see him, only to speak to him. No one but you can grant me that blessing.\n\nOh! I am sure that for the love of his children and me he would listen to me if I spoke to him. But, I repeat, I have not had the happiness of speaking with him since I told him to sell his horse. Your words, dear Sir, have remained imprinted in my heart. Yes, while I live I never shall forget the time you entered our house. But George is a half-breed, and I never can believe that my race will be cruel enough to kill my husband or keep him long a prisoner. Now, if he promises not to meddle, let him come and do his work, for I am in a position that I have need of him, I am not strong enough to work.\n\nAdieu, dear Sir, I will pray for you with all my heart.\n\nTHE WIFE OF GEORGE NESS.\n\nP.S.\u2014Excuse me, I am short of paper.\n\nMr. Louis Riel.\n\nCut Knife Hill, 29th April, 1885.\n\nI want to hear news of the progress of God's work. If any events have occurred since your messengers came away let me know of it. Tell me the date when the Americans will reach the Canadian Pacific Railway. Tell me all the news that you have heard from all places where your work is in progress. Big Bear has finished his work. He has taken Fort Pitt. \"If you want me to come to you let me know at once,\" he said and I sent for him at once. I will be four days on the road. Those who have gone to see him will sleep twice on the road. They took twenty prisoners including...\nthe master of Fort Pitt. They killed eleven men including the agent; two priests and six white men. We are camped on the creek just below Cat Knife Hill waiting for Big Bear. The Blackfeet have killed sixty police at the Elbow. A half-breed who interpreted for the police having survived the fight, though wounded, brought this news. Here we have killed six white men. We have not taken the barracks yet, but that is the only entire building in Battleford. All the cattle and horses in the vicinity we have taken. We have lost one man, a Nez Perc\u00e9 killed, he being alone, and one wounded. Some soldiers have come from Swift Current but I don't know their number. We have here guns and rifles of all sorts but ammunition for them is short. If it be possible send us ammunition of various kind. We are weak only for the want of that. You sent word that you would come to Battleford when you have finished your work at Duck Lake. We wait still for you, as we are unable to take the Fort without help. If you send us news send only one messenger. We are impatient to reach you. It would encourage us much to see you and make us work more heartily. Up to the present everything has gone well with us but we are constantly expecting the soldiers to visit us here. We trust that God will be as kind to us in the future as he has been in the past. We, the undersigned, send greeting to you all.\n\nPOUNDMAKER,\nCOPINOW-WAY-WIN,\nMUSSINASS,\nMETAYWAYIS,\nPEEYAYCHEW.\n\nMr. LOUIS RIEL:\n\nWhen this reaches you send us news immediately as we are anxious to hear the news.\n\nIf you send us news send as many men as possible.\n\nA true and certified copy.\n\nCHAS.

Batoche.\n\nThe French half-breeds have taken up arms in masse. Not one of our people is against us. Tell our relatives the Indians to be ready to come to our help, if needed. Take all the ammunition of the company.\n\nTo the English Half-breeds of Red Deer Hills, St. Catherines and St. Paul:\n\nDear Brothers in Jesus Christ,\u2014The Ottawa Government has been maliciously ignoring the rights of the original half-breeds during fifteen years. The petitions\nwhich have been sent to him on that matter and concerning the grievances which all classes have against its policy are not listened to; moreover, the Dominion has taken the high-handed way of answering peaceable complaints by reinforcing their mounted police, the avowed purpose being to confirm in the Saskatchewan their Government spoliation and usurpation of the rights and liberties of all classes of men, except these assistant oppressors, the Hudson's Bay Company and land speculators. They are supported with, no doubt, full energy by a large number of other half breeds who have come to the Saskatchewan less as emigrants than as proscripts from Manitoba. Those of the emigrants who have been long enough in this county to realize that Ottawa does not intend to govern the North-West so much as to plunder it, are in sympathy with the movement. Let us all be firm in the support of right; humane and courageous, if we have to fight, just and equitable in our views, thus God and men will be with us and it will be successful.\n\nDear Brothers, in the council of the French Canadian half-breeds now under arms at St. Anthony and in the Saskatchewan has been most happy to receive your friendly communication through your Messrs. Scott, Ross and William Paquin.\n\nThe fact your delegation and ours have crossed each other, affords convincing proof that our feelings are mutual. Justice commands to take up arms.\n\nPierre Paranteau, chairman,\nGab. Dumont,\nMoise Ouellette,\nAlbert Monkman,\nBte. Paranteau,\nNorbert Delorme,\nMaxime Lepine,\nDavid Tourond.\n\nCh. Nolin,\nBte. Boyer,\nDonald Ross,\nAmb. Jobin,\nPierre Henry,\nDamase Carri\u00e8re,\nBte. Boucher,\n\nPH. GARNOT, Secretary.\nLOUIS \"DAVID\" RIEL, Exovede.\n\nSt. Anthony, 21st March, 1885.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nCOPY OF A LETTER TO ENGLISH AND FRENCH HALF-BREEDS AT LAKE QU'APPELLE.\n\nTo our brothers the English and French half-breeds of Lake Qu'Appelle and vicinity:\n\nDear Relations and Friends,\u2014If you have not already heard, you shall hear the reasons which lead us to take up arms. You know that of old your fathers, at the risk of their lives, defended this country, which was theirs and which is ours.\n\nThe Ottawa Government took possession of our country fifteen years ago, they make a mockery of our rights and offend against the law of God by inflicting upon us endless injustice. The officials commit every species of crime; and the mounted police are the scandal of the world by their foul language and evil conduct. So corrupt are they, that our wives and our daughters are no longer safe in the neighborhood. The laws of decency are to them a mere matter of jest.\n\nO my friends, we must at all times trust in God; but today the measure of evil is full to overflowing, and we have special need to commend ourselves to our Lord. You will perhaps see things as we see them. Our country is stolen from us, and then it is so badly governed that, if we let things go on, it will soon be impossible to save ourselves.\n\nThe English half-breeds of the Saskatchewan are undoubtedly with us. The Indians are crossing to us and joining us on all sides.\n\nPurchase all the munitions you can. You can go to the other side of the line, if necessary, for them. Be ready. Do not listen to the offers the Ottawa Government will make to you; their offers are the offers of robbers. Sign neither papers nor petitions. Trust in God and in the circumstances which Providence is now bringing about on the Saskatchewan. We shall not forget you. If promises are\nmade to you, say that the time for promises is past. We have reached a point when we must have proof for everything. Pray; be good; keep the commandments of God and you shall want for nothing.\n\nRESOLUTION IN FAVOR OF ANNEXATION TO UNITED STATES.\n\nResolved,\u2014That when England gave this country to the Hudson Bay Company, two hundred years ago, the North-West belonged to France, as history shows it. And when the Treaty of Paris ceded Canada to England, no mention of any kind was made of the North-West.\n\nAs the American-English colonies helped England to conquer Canada, they ought to have a share of the conquest, and that share ought to be the North-West, since, commercially and politically, the United States government have done more for England than ever England did; we ought to have annexation. Against England and Rome. Manitoba, French Canadian.\n\nRESOLUTION EXPRESSING FRIENDSHIP TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES, AND DOUBT AS TO ENGLAND'S OWNERSHIP OF THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.\n\nResolved:\u2014\n\n1. That our union is, and will always be, most respectful towards the American Government, their policy, their interest, and towards the territories government of Montana as well.\n\n2. That our union will carefully avoid causing any difficulty whatever to the United States.\n\nAnd will not conflict in any way with the constitution and laws of the Government. It is doubtful whether England really owns the North-West. Because the first act of government that any law ever accomplished over that North-West was to give it as a prey to the sordid monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company 200 years ago.\n\nHer second act of government of any importance over that country was to give it in 1870 as a prey to the Canadian.\n\nOur union is, and always will be, most respectful towards the American.\n\nRIEL'S ANSWER TO INVITATION TO COME TO SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nGentlemen,\u2014The goodwill you manifest towards me, and with which I know you to be animated for me, fill me with joy and do me great honor. Your voice is more than friendly; it is the voice of loving fellow-countrymen. Your voice which speaks to me is a sweet voice and very tender. It is not merely the voice of loving compatriots I hear when I listen to you, I say, but it seems to me the voice of my country itself. Yes, I tell you, it is the very voice of my country. You are, you say, delighted to see me once more; and you prove it to me. Believe me, I also am happy. What a joy for me to grasp your hands once more, and to embrace you. You are good enough to mention what I have done for Manitoba. It is true, I did my best to secure its happiness. But if I succeeded, it was because I had in you the support of friends, firm, generous, brave and independent; and whatsoever my place in history may be, I shall owe my reputation, under God, to you French Canadian half-breeds. You did not abandon me in my time of peril, and it was my duty to stand firm before every obstacle in order to help you. Though small in respect to numbers, the French-Canadian half-breed people have made a noble struggle. I am happy to see them at rest and enjoying prosperity; and let me congratulate you on your increase and the vigor you have acquired in the short space of ten years. I thank you for the flattering and delicate terms in which you invite me to live with you. It would most assuredly be very pleasant for me to spend my days in the midst of fellow-countrymen so grateful as you are. The love I have for my native land is strong enough to keep me here, but my adopted country has taken hold of\nmy heart, and I have promised to devote myself to it. I belong to it so long as I live. It knows that I love you, that I do not forget you; it approves of the legitimate, loyal and rightful love I bear to my native land. The more liberal my adopted country is towards me, the more am I bound to honor and to love it; and inasmuch as that country supports and is in favor of all that is lawful, loyal, just and reasonable, it will certainly permit me to give free scope to the love I have for you.\n\nRESOLUTIONS IN RE SENDING A DELEGATION TO LOUIS RIEL IN UNITED STATES.\n\n3. That the French and English natives of the North-West (those that have not participated in the Manitoba Lands Grant) want free patent for the land they possess and occupy at the present date, without any prejudice to any more grants to which they are entitled for the extinction of their Indian title to the lands of the North-West.\n\n4. That the natives, French and English, protest against the dues and charges on timber and forests until their rights within mentioned be recognized and granted by the Dominion Government.\n\n5. That the management of the Indians such as Indian agencies, instructorships or other offices for the benefit of the Indians in the North-West Territories be entrusted to natives, as they are more familiar with the habits, character and wants of those Indians, and to prevent any regrettable occurrences as have happened in the past.\n\n6. That the French and English natives of the North-West having never recognized any right to the lands of the North-West, assumed by the Hudson Bay Company or by the Dominion Government, claim an exclusive right to these lands along with the Indians.\n\n7. We the French and English natives of the North-West, knowing that Louis Riel has made a bargain with the Government of Canada, in 1870, which said bargain is contained mostly in what is known as the \"Manitoba Act,\" and this meeting not knowing the contents of said \"Manitoba Act,\" we have thought it advisable that a delegation be sent to said Louis Riel, and have his assistance to bring all the matters referred to in the above resolutions in a proper shape and form before the Government of Canada, so that our just demands be granted.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nRIEL'S ADVICE ON MOVEMENTS OF DEFENCE.\n\n22nd April, 1885.\n\nTo avoid, as much as possible, weakening our strong points on both sides of the river here, let a certain number of men be detached to watch the movements of Middleton's camp beyond Tourond's coulee. On the other side of the river also, let a certain number of men be detached to watch the movements of the mounted police. For my own part, with all the respect I have for the views of the council and the desires of the army, I wish, nevertheless, that no attack be made against the police now, because: 1st. The spirit which is good enough to guide me, has said to me: \"Not far from here;\" 2nd. Because that same spirit has told me that it would be good to bind the prisoners, which shows me that we should need all our men here. 3rd. Because that good spirit has said to me: \"By dint of hard blows, strive to defend every inch of ground,\" which also gives me to understand that we need all our forces here. 4th. Because it has been said to me: \"Let Gabriel Dumont pay attention.\" Now, this attention required from my uncle Gabriel applies not only to his wound, but makes me fear that, with his eager courage and his inattention to his personal safety in battle, he may expose himself too much and meet with some grievous mishap. If anything happened to Dumont, it would not only be a misfortune for his friends, but an irreparable loss for the future and for the whole people. If my uncle Gabriel were cured of his wound, I should be more willing to see him\nstart on an expedition of this kind. If we get reinforcements, I might change my opinion, I think, to a certain extent. Under present circumstances, I know, I understand, that it would be of great benefit to us to go and attack and harass the mounted police on the other side of the river, at Clark's Crossing; but that would weaken us here, and I fear that, meantime, from Prince Albert or elsewhere, some encounter may occur, in which we shall need all our strength.\n\nRespectfully, and in the frankest spirit of friendship, I offer these considerations to the attentions of the \"Exovidat,\" so that they may weigh my reasons. What I wish is, that my reasons be examined, but be convinced, Sirs and dear brothers in Jesus Christ, that when you have examined what I now submit to you, if you adopt a course contrary to my views, I shall look upon it as an expression of the permission of God, and I will help you, with all my strength, to carry out your views as though they were my own, to the greater glory of God.\n\nROLLS.\n\n| No. 1 COMPANY. | Alexandre Montour | 5 |\n|---------------|-------------------|---|\n| Isidore Dumont, Captain (R.I.P.) | Charles Faignant | 6 |\n| Nap.

LEPINE ON THE BATTLE OF 12TH APRIL.\n\nI corroborate the report of Mr. Dumont up to the moment of the departure of Mr. Riel, for Mr. Riel left it to the choice of the people, whether he was to go away or to stay. The answer he received was to go and assist the women and children. About half past eight in the morning, I started to get something to eat at the house of the widow Tourond, and about nine o'clock we left, Pierre Henry, Isidore Dumas and I, to come to the coul\u00e9e. Our people made signs to us that the police were coming. Then we took up our position to wait for them, and we had hardly taken our places when shots were heard at the other end. As soon as we heard the shots we rushed to that side. When we got there our people were already all scattered and the battle had commenced. Not long after I saw that Jerome Henry was wounded, and we then took up a position in the coul\u00e9e nearly on the bank, and I spent nearly the whole day there. The time seemed so long that I thought it was already evening, but on looking at my watch I saw it was only noon. Before noon we heard shots all around us; but we heard shots also from the direction of Tourond's, showing that there were still some of our people in that direction. In the afternoon we heard no more shots there, and I thought that our people on that side were all dead. Near us and towards Mrs. Tourond's we heard shouts, and I think it was Gabriel Damont and his people who were there. I know that Alexis Gervais was there, for I saw him come from that direction, and then we saw that we were surrounded, for we saw men on all sides; we then heard the bugle to the right of our position and we heard the soldiers coming in the wood of the coul\u00e9e, for we heard the branches breaking, and there were others along the wood to the left; and we heard voices speaking all around us and in front on the prairie, and then I thought we were lost. And when they came into the wood we heard dreadful firing on every side. It was then between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. After that they retreated, and it seemed to me that the volleys were less frequent; and about five o'clock all was quiet for a good while, only a few sentinels seemed to be stationed at intervals watching us. During that period we thought they were getting ready to come and take us. After that we said to one another, we must try anyhow and kill one each if they come, and we must each of us fire a good shot. And Charles-Trottier counted the men there, and out of one hundred and sixty that we were at the beginning there remained but fifty.\nfour. I do not know whether he counted the wounded. And then we consulted as to how we were to get away and decided to wait until night and then to run the risk of breaking our way out. But we knew that many of us must be killed in that undertaking. And then we also thought of our wounded and it seemed to me that the only assistance I could leave them was the crucifix I had held in my hand all the day, but when I spoke of that no person answered me; and we were praying all that time, and I had the crucifix and I said: \"We shall commend ourselves to God and pray that we may have perfect contrition, so that if we die we may save our souls.\" And then I prayed; for I thought we were about to die and I had doubts as to the justice of our cause. And I thought all our people were dead and that our small party were all that remained. But Delorme did me good when he said to me: \"We must pray to God to take us out of this.\" And almost immediately they again commenced firing\u2014not many rifle shots, but four cannon shots\u2014and two or three out of the four seemed to me to burst over our heads. And all day the balls seemed to fall like hail. And after these four cannon shots all became more quiet, and we heard a man from among the police shout to us, speaking in the Cree tongue. He said, \"his name is Borie,\" and, it seemed to me, \"that we must be hungry;\" and he asked to be allowed to visit us. He also asked us to tell him how many we were. And some of the others answered him, but I do not remember what they said to him. But they would not let him come. I was inclined to let him come, and felt tempted to tell him to come, but I thought it better to say nothing for fear of making a mistake and being blamed afterwards. It occurred to me that while he was with us the police would not fire, and meantime night would set in and we should be able to get away. But almost immediately afterwards our people came up and the soldiers fled and did not fire again, and we came away.\n\nWe prayed all the day, and I think prayer did more than the bullets. Often when the soldiers appeared on the hillocks our people fired and that made them fall back and others came to remove them.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nREPORT ON THE BATTLE OF THE 24th APRIL, 1885.\n\nReport (but not sure) of the Battle fought at Gen. Middleton's Camp, 24th April, 1885.\n\nWe attacked them on the march at Tourand's Coulee. We had taken possession of the coulee. We attacked them in front and they made a strong resistance, but gained little ground. We had but one wounded of our people, Jerome Henry, a Cree, and two Sioux. The battle lasted three hours, that is from 9 a.m. till noon. They were about 200, and there were 18 tents on the other side of the river. They have a ferry boat, the Clark's Crossing scow, with them. We think they crossed some 50 men. We hold our position and intend to attack them again during the night. We think there are 30 or 40 dead and wounded in the enemy's camp.\n\nAll the news we have received up to this time, 9.15 p.m.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nREPORT OF TROTTIER ON BATTLE OF 24th APRIL.\n\nI corroborate the report of M. Dumont. Up to the arrival of the first horseman I was there with Gabriel. Then I went down to the coul\u00e9e, signalling with my hand to our people, and calling out, \"run to the coul\u00e9e, run to the coul\u00e9e.\" Then we tied all our horses there, and we went up the hill on foot to fire, and we began to fire, I do not know how many shots. Suddenly I saw a Sioux killed quite close to me, then as the gun I was using was not good, I called out to another Sioux to take the gun of the dead Sioux, saying that I wanted to use it. He took the gun and lent it to me. It was a double gun with horn and shot-bag. We fired again, and, of a sudden, I saw Gabriel coming towards me (I saw him first on my right); he said he had no more cartridges; I gave him those I had, for I wanted to use the double gun,\nand I called out to the people, \"They want to pillage the coul\u00e9e; we must go down and take all the horses and prevent them.\" And I told a young man to take Gabriel's horse, and I took mine; and going down the coul\u00e9e I saw Gabriel, and he asked me where his horse was? I told him the young men were taking it away. It was the last time I saw Gabriel, and then I tied my horse in the wood and went up the hill on the south side, and firing began on both sides, and suddenly some one called out to me, \"There they are coming down the coul\u00e9e with their cannon!\" I looked and saw them coming down, and I shouted to the young men, \"Take courage, take courage and pray to God.\" Then they began firing at us with their cannon and rifles, and the balls fell like hail. It was about two in the afternoon, and I began shouting \"fire, fire,\" and when our men began firing I saw that the police fell, and I heard the cry, \"They are going to run,\" and I called out \"fire, fire,\" and shouted for joy, and when the soldiers retreated out of the coul\u00e9e, I asked the people where Gabriel was, but no one knew, and I asked continually where my children and nephews were, and I thought all our people had been killed except a few, for nobody answered me but two of my boys, and every time we stopped firing we prayed to God. Suddenly I heard a young man singing in French the song of the Bois Brul\u00e9, the song of the Falcon. That gave me courage. I kept shouting, \"courage, courage!\" Afterwards it began to rain and hail, and I said to the people, \"Don't fire now, we must wait until they come, and if they come near we'll fire altogether. It was about 5 o'clock in the evening, I called out, \"Where is Johnny?\" (my brother's boy), and I heard him answer about a hundred yards from us. Immediately after his answer they fired three cannon shots and some rifle shots in that direction. Some time afterwards I stood up and went to see all the people, and I said to them, \"my friends, we shall start away this evening, but before we leave this we must pray to God for our dead and our wounded, and also for ourselves, so that He may give us a way out of this,\" and I told them that \"as to the wounded, those who can walk we must not leave them, we shall carry them to the groves and cover them well, and we shall go away quietly all together.\" I then counted the men and found but 48, with the wounded, and I said to them, \"do not stir, I shall go and see my horse.\" He was only 40 or 50 rods from us. Then my nephew said to me, \"Uncle, come here, I want to speak to you.\" I answered, \"Do not stir, nephew, and do not fear; I will not leave you, I will go and see my horse, and then I will go to you.\" When I went to see my horse, my boy and another young Indian, followed me. I found my horse still standing and unhurt, but all the other horses around him were dead. It was then about sundown. My coat was on the saddle, and while I was untying it, I saw our people on the hill shouting joyfully. When they came up I shook hands with them, saying, \"We are only forty-eight, and I think many have been killed.\" As I spoke, I saw six of our people come out of another wood, bringing our number up to fifty-four. Then when our people had come, they wanted to follow them up, but I called out: \"Do not follow them, we have done enough for the present.\" They desisted and went to the battlefield to gather rifles and other things, and I said to them: \"We must try and find carts to take home the wounded this evening.\" And I found a cart and harness at Mrs. Tourond's house, and the men on foot started on in front, and the horsemen remained behind. I got a mattress from the house and put two wounded men in the cart; the other wounded were placed on a buck-board. I walked in front, leading the horse with a rope. When I had gone about two miles, a young man lent me his horse. He said he would lead the horse, as I was tired. I was very glad to get the horse. When we got together at Touronds' house, I found that there had not been many of our people killed; only four were missing. A man came and called out in Cree: \"What are you fellows doing there? Your people are all going?\" I said to our people: \"Let him talk away; don't answer him.\" Then he said: \"How many are you?\" I again told our men not to speak. He called out a third time, saying: \"You must be hungry, come and eat.\" I said to our people again: \"Do not speak.\" He spoke after the last cannon shots were fired.\n\nThere were not many of us in that wood, but God gave us a good road, and we reached the house in safety.\n(Translation.)\n\nREPORT OF GABRIEL DUMONT ON THE BATTLE OF 24TH APRIL.\n\nWhen we left this, we stopped near my place, to the rear. We said a decade of the rosary. Then we went on as far as Roger Goulet's.\n\nThere we killed a couple of cattle for food. After eating, we began to prepare to go to the enemy's camp. Mr. Champagne arrived. He said: \"We must wait a little and see what is to be done.\" He reported police coming from the direction of Little Mountain, on the Fourche Road. There he asked us for thirty men to come here. He asked Mr. Riel if he would come with them. Mr. Riel consented, asking for forty men. Nearly all the people wanted to come away. In the end some fifty came. After eating at Roger Goulet's, we sent the Sioux out as scouts. We then went on to Tourond's Coulee. We halted on the other side of the coul\u00e9e, upwards. I, myself, rode on further. I went out of the moonlight into a tuft of trees; I came back again, hearing nothing but the flute. When I got back to our people they were on their knees praying; I also knelt down. When they finished, our scouts had not come in. As it was nearly day I gave the order to leave the place; we set out, taking the road to the left in the groves of trees; we went as far as the first houses, McIntosh's. It was already day, and as I saw it was impossible to get at them during the night, I told our people my plan was to return. Then we returned back to a low spot. I then borrowed a horse in order to go with Napoleon Nault to see the enemy's camp and to try and induce them to follow us. We went to within about half a mile of the camp, which seemed to be disturbed. We came back then to our people. Then I ordered our people to start back again for Tourond's Coulee, saying: \"We shall wait for them there.\" We killed an ox for breakfast, and got hay for our cattle. Before eating, we sent Mr. Gilbert Brabant to see if the enemy were coming. After we had eaten he came in. He said that the cavalry were coming on in front. We saddled twenty-seven horses. Then we went down the coul\u00e9e and posted ourselves about half a mile from our people. There we waited some time. It was then between nine and ten in the morning. Sending out scouts on foot. Mr. Bte. Deschamps told us he saw a trooper passing alone and then some ten on the other side. Pierre Laverdure told us he had seen one also. We then mounted and prepared for a rush. While we were watching, one of them showed himself to me about 150 yards off. His horse turned sharp about and we rushed straight for him. Our men fired, as we started, two or three shots. I think they hit him at the first shot. He was no longer able to handle his horse; then I followed him and fired two shots at him. I turned then and made for the coul\u00e9e towards our people. There we began exchanging shots with the enemy. We tied our horses lower down than the point where most of our people were. There we exchanged fire again for a short time. I then went to a little grove in order to fire at them again. The police then came down at once alongside a wood. I began to fire. There were four or five of us, we were nearly all scattered. I then went up the coul\u00e9e and met some people coming down. They were nearly all Sioux. There I was told a Teton had been killed. I then went to the place where the bulk of our people were. I encouraged them, saying, \"God is strong.\" Then I went to the place where the Teton had been killed. I asked him, \"Are you dead?\" He answered me: \"No.\" I then went down the coul\u00e9e passing near our people and encouraging them all the time, when I came near Maxime Lepine, he said he was troubled as to what he ought to do. I thought it was on account of the crucifix he had in his hands; I said to him: \"Pray for the cause of our religion and for its glory.\" Just then I was told that Jerome Henry had been hit. Then someone called out to me that the police were going to charge; thereupon we made for a small hollow and drew back into shelter. There I remained a short time, Napoleon Nault called out to me: \"Mr. Dumont, I think the Indians and the Sioux are going to run; you had better go and stop them.\" As I saw many of our people who were in good heart, I answered: \"Yes, I'll follow them.\" When I got near the horses, I found a lot of the people there: Sioux, Crees and\nsome half-breeds, going up the coul\u00e9e ahead of the police in order to head them off. When I got to the hollow, I called out to them: \"Stay there.\" I tied my horse in the wood. We went up and stationed ourselves in the prairie, so that the police might not pillage the sides of the coul\u00e9e. There we fought for a long time. With some of the Sioux and some half-breeds there were about fifteen of us. We remained about three hours and a-half. We fired slowly, but with steady aim. Then I said to those who were with me: \"I will go and see our people\"; and an Indian said to me: \"Do not leave us; if you do, many of ours will run away.\" I held on for a while, and then said to them: \"Try and fight by yourselves for a while; I will go and see our people, and I promise to come back to you. When I hear my men shouting sturdily I know they are in good heart, because God is helping them.\" Then I went down the coul\u00e9e to the place where I had left the bulk of my people. There the police had already crossed the coul\u00e9e with a cannon. I went into the thick bush where the horses were tied. There, towards the middle of the bush where our people were, there was a clearing. Meantime the police were firing at me with the cannon and rifles. There I stopped, where there were large trees, thinking how I could serve them, for it was too great a risk for me. I turned back and went again to the little party I had left. They were still there. We held out for a short time longer. Then I said to them: \"We can do nothing for our people here; let us go higher up in the coul\u00e9e.\" We started out, following the coul\u00e9e. We went up a little higher than Donald Ross' house; we saw the Sioux who had fled in front. Then we took the groves towards the river, after crossing the road. We found two of our people mounted on one horse. Then we gave them a horse. All the Sioux were leaving us, and would not listen to us any longer. We stopped in the groves in sight of David Tourond's house. My people said to me: \"Go by yourself and see if we cannot get to our people.\" I went. As soon as the police saw me across the coul\u00e9e, they fired a cannon shot and rifles at me. Then I returned to see my people. When I got to them I said: \"The only way of rescuing our people is to stay here until night. We can go and eat at Calixte Tourond's, and then in the night, we shall attack. Then we went to the house, and food was prepared. Shortly before we began to eat, Mo\u00efse Ouellette and Philippe Gari\u00e9py joined us. Then I told them we intended to attack at night, and that I did not think many of ours would fall. Then we remained there. Mo\u00efse and Philippe told us that Mr. Riel was preventing the people from coming to our assistance; but their opinion was that Mr. Riel would not be able to prevent them. Then they said we ought to wait for our people who were coming. There were also some Sioux with us. Two of them started on horseback to see the fight, but they turned back and brought a wounded mare with them. The Sioux, Mad Ball, told me then that it was impossible to go there. Philippe told me the same thing, saying it was useless to go. I said to them again: \"We shall not go in daylight, but at night.\" Then Mo\u00efse Ouellette said: \"We must wait for our people yet; they will come.\" We waited a short time, and I said to them: \"Let us talk the matter over,\" and, thereupon, we decided to return to meet our people, and we set out. We met Mr. Boucher a little beyond Roger Goulet's, with \u00c9douard Dumont. They told us they were quite sure our people would come. We went on our way without stopping. Then we met our people coming to our assistance. Then we turned back, going slowly, in order not to tire our horses. Then I said: \"Let us put the carts in front, and tell them to move on quickly.\" I took my position in the rear, in order to command them all. Meantime it was raining heavily, and I said: \"We shall stop at Calixte Tourmond's and dry our guns.\" Afterwards we set out again. Some of our men wanted to hang back, and I ordered them to advance. When we got near the coul\u00e9e, I left my party, in order to go on in front. There were people on the left side of the coul\u00e9e, and others on the right. I hastened, with an Indian, Yellow Blanket, to a spot where there were two horses tied. I said to him: \"Come down, nephew; let us each saddle a horse, so as to be ready sooner.\" He answered: \"Saddle them both, and I'll watch here for you. While I was saddling Pierre Parenteau's horse, Philippe Gari\u00e9py came up to us. I gave him the halter strap, saying: \"You take this one.\" Then I\ntied the other with the reins in the saddle, and started him off towards our people, who were behind us. On reaching them, we saw the police descending the other side of the coul\u00e9e to surround our people. The latter called out: \"They are going to charge.\" I turned my horse, and rode towards Tourond, following the cart road upwards. I followed the wood on the slope. I met our people, who were in the coul\u00e9e. Then I told them that it was the power of God that had saved their lives. Then I shook hands with them, and asked them if my brother Eli was alive? They answered, \"yes.\" I went up the hill saying: \"We must follow them.\" The men shouted out in reply: \"That's enough, don't go after them.\" Some of our people were ready to follow them, but I said to them; \"We have done enough, we must listen to our own men.\" Then I continued on up the hill to see the police\u2014I saw them going away in retreat. Then we went to the groves to look for bodies and rifles. We found nothing but the wheel marks of the carts in which the bodies had been removed. Then I returned to the coul\u00e9e where our people were. We determined not to leave any of our dead or wounded. We went to Tourond's house to warm ourselves, for we were cold. Then we went to Calixte Tourond's and got a waggon, with a cart and another small waggon to carry the dead and the wounded. Then I stopped all the horsemen, who wanted to return at once. I said to them: \"The people on foot will go on alone and we shall keep guard and wait for those who have gone for the dead and wounded.\" When they had brought them in I told them to start out with the carts in front. I remained all the time in the rear until we reached the place where I had met Mr. Boucher and Dumont. There I said to them: \"My friends, I am cold. I think my head will suffer.\" I asked them if they would let me go on in front? They said that a great many would follow me. I said: \"No, I will prevent them.\" Then I urged them not to separate, and I started away. When I got to the people in front, I said to them: \"Do not follow me.\" Five or six of them wanted to follow me, but I stopped my horse and said to them: \"Since you will not listen to me, you may go away by yourselves, I will stay with our people.\" Then Andr\u00e9 Letendre said: \"Go yourself, we shall stay.\" Thereupon I started Catching-up to some people on foot I told them I was going on in advance. On leaving the wood, I met eight or ten horsemen. Some of these came in with me, amongst others Napoleon Nantland Charles Trottier. When I got here, I found some men who had got in before us though I was not aware that they had left us. Then I went at once to the council house. After shaking hands with those who were there I asked for some hot tea. There was none to be had. I then returned to my own house. If there is anything incorrect in my report, I ask pardon of God, for it will not be by my fault.\n\n(True copy)\n\nPH.

GARNOT,\nSecretary for the Council.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nLETTER TO THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH HALF-BREEDS OF BATTLE RIVER, FORT PITTS AND VICINITY.\n\nOur good God has always taken care of the half-breeds. \"I have fed them many days in the desert.\" It was Providence that enriched our prairies with the buffalo, and the abundance with which our fathers were supplied was as wonderful as the heavenly manna. But we were not sufficiently grateful to God, our good Father, and that is the reason we allowed ourselves to fall into the hands of a Government which had no thought for us except to plunder us. Ah, had we understood what God did for us before Confederation, we should have been sorry to see it come about. The half-breeds of the North West would have insisted on conditions of a nature to preserve in behalf of our children that freedom, that possession of the soil, without which no one can be happy. But fifteen years of suffering, impoverishment and covert malignant persecution have opened our eyes, and the sight of the abyss of demoralization into which the Dominion is daily driving us deeper and deeper, has suddenly, by God's grace, stricken us with horror. And more terrified by the hell to which the mounted police and their Government are striving openly to lead us, than by their firearms, which, after all, can only kill our bodies, we have risen. The voice of conscience has given the alarm and cries out to us; \"justice commands you to take up arms.\" Dear relatives and friends we advise you to be on the alert. Be ready for anything. Take the Indians with you. Bring them together from all sides. Take all the ammunition you can, wherever it may be stored. Murmur, protest and threaten. Stir up the Indians, and also render the police of Fort Pitt and Battleford powerless. We pray to God to open the way to us to get up to you, and when we enter that way, as we hope to do, we will help you to take Battleford and Fort Pitt. Have confidence in Jesus Christ. Place yourselves under the protection of the Blessed Virgin. Implore help from St. Joseph, for he is powerful with God. Commend yourselves to the powerful intercession of St. John the Baptist, the glorious patron of the Canadians and the half-breeds. Be at peace with God; keep His commandments; we beseech Him to be with you all and to give you success. Strive to give speedily to the half-breeds and Indians at Fort Pitt the news we send you, and tell them to be sure to be ready for anything.\n\nL.\n(Translation.)\n\nLETTER\u2014MRS. SALOMON TO RIEL, COMPLAINING\u2014HOUSE SACKED BY INDIANS.\n\nSt. Antoine, 25th April, 1885.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014The Indians took possession of my house while I was away. They broke in the doors of the shed and took all the food I had in it. While I was away they did that, and in my presence they killed my hens. If you would kindly send me a cart to help me to remove what I have left, or if you could send me some guards to restrain them, I should be much obliged.\n\nMADAME SALOMON, V.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nA SCOUTING REPORT OF ALEX. CAGAN.\n\nReport of Mr. Alex. Cagan of Lake Muskeg, 26th April, 1885.\n\nI was at Pike Lake, and an Indian started out for Battle River. When he got there the Indians of that place were taking the contents of the stores. I state what the Indians told me. There was but one store near the Government fort which was not taken, but the Indians camped near that store. The next morning they set out to clean out all the stores, after breakfast. All the goods the Indians took they hauled to their camp as they took them. They started to take a camp which was on the other side of the river, but they arrived too late, for the Indians were already starting for the north side. I forgot to state that all the chiefs held a meeting before that, in order to ask the agent for ammunition for hunting. They asked quietly four times. The agent replied: \"I will not let you have any ammunition; live as you have been accustomed to live.\" Little Spruce said: \"Why? You promised to feed us. We asked you for this quietly in order to support our children; you are doing this to vex us. No one asked you to come here.\" Straw-man, another Indian, said: \"Yes, you shall soon see how we used to live in former times; we were great fools.\" And then they went away. The following day the agent and Peter Banatine took two sacks of flour and 50 lbs. of bacon to each chief. Straw-man said to Banatine: \"You are doing this to make fun of us and to vex us the more.\" The first they went to see was the farm instructor at Eagle Mountain where Red Pheasant is. The farmer fired first, but they made his shot go off in the air, and the son of Horned Bull, an Assiniboine, pierced him with an arrow, but Maringouin's son-in-law finished him with his tomahawk. An Assiniboine Indian named Yellow-Hair killed another farmer who had care of the cattle. They crushed his head also; these two events happened the same day. On the reserve of Chief \"Struck-in-the-back,\" Jos. McKay was the farmer, and they warned him that they did not want to do him harm, because they were too much accustomed to him, but they took everything there was there. Then they went to Straw-man's reserve. There was a farmer there, and before they spoke to him he tried to defend himself, but a Cree named Flowing-Leaf took the axe and gave him a blow on the cheek; the other turned round and yelled, but he gave him a second blow and finished him. Then some of them wanted to draw back, but their people sought to kill them. The Assiniboine wanted to kill the Crees who wished to draw back. He said to them: \"They have already killed one-half of us by hunger, you must not try to save them.\" In this way they all went together and no person would draw back. The name of the Indian who brought me that news is La Graine D'Origana. After that, I said to the Cree: \"Let us go and see about Battle River and the Lake Brocket people. And when we stopped on the other side of the river, after we got off our horses, they fired three times at us with their cannon. And when I saw that, there were some abandoned houses, and I told the Indians to burst open the doors and help themselves. The houses were well stocked with provisions and the Indians said: \"Riel is charitable, and that's why we have plenty to eat.\" A little way further down we helped\nourselves again, and I provided myself from the store of a trader of the company, taking everything there was. There was a barrel of powder. That one I was wrong in taking, for he is with you; but it was the company's property. And I started to come back this way; and after a day's journey my son and son-in-law turned back to get flour and pork at Battle River. If I had had certain news I would have made the Indians far more crazy. They wanted to start out again for a hunt in that direction. Then I came towards Muskeg Lake to the place where I met my brother. There on the day after my arrival, we broke up camp to go to the Mustawasis reserve, for they had no provisions. It was there I destroyed the pigs. When I was going to leave, my brother told me, he was not with the Government since he was with the half-breeds. He had not as yet meddled in the matter. \"But you see, he said, how I am in need of means. Many of the people are sick too.\" He further said: \"I am afraid of our people, the Crees, to go with the Government. We are but two brothers, and he was waiting for me to know what I would say to him. There is only one in whom I trust and that is God. If he wills that I should die of hunger, I shall die so.\" When the chief's people sent a runner to Lake La Pech\u00e9, the agent replied: \"Since he wants to go with the half-breeds, let the half-breed feed him. Why did he not come with you B\u00e9langers?\" He said that to the runner. I said to my brother: \"Neither have I meddled in the matter, but I do not want to hold back, for one of my boys is there; and if they want us they know what to do. Otherwise, I must be a coward, since my boy is there.\" I think they wanted to follow me at once, and I cannot go aside from that, and if you would be afraid, I also would be afraid. I have never had much affection for Canada and I have still less at present. I should still like to go away hunting, but if you think it better that I should be here I will not go; but there are a great many animals there. B\u00e9langer is between two fires; he is afraid to go to Prince Albert and he is afraid to come here. I heard from an Indian, Big Bear, that Tom Quinn went to give the freight in the camp and that they killed him there. And then some Canada people wanted to escape at the Little Fort and they killed eleven of them. They took everything from a mail carrier and let him go. When that man left Fort Pitt to bring the letters, he saw the Indians attacking Fort Battleford. And when he left there the same Assiniboines took him and took away his letters, and he fled to the Graine d'Orignal reserve and reached that camp, and I reached it in the morning after he left. And when I got there the horse came in hobbled. I think it was the same Assiniboines who took him. The mail carrier told the Indians that all the forts are taken by the half-breeds and Indians towards Edmonton. Straw-Man took 350 head of cattle, and two Indians took 40 horses. They have a lot of horses. They have 340 guns and much ammunition. My brother has eleven guns. I think they have no rifles; we have three. I gave them a little too much powder. Big Bear has all the Montagnais with him.\n\nTranslation:\n\nSCOUTING REPORT\u2014ALEX. PARENTEAU, BATOCH\u00c9.\n\nReport of Alexandre Parenteau, 30th April, 1885, written at Batoche.\n\nThe Indian camp is between the reserve of \"Man-who-was-struck-in-the-Back,\" and that of \"Straw-Man.\" I started from the Red Prairie Bend on Battle River. This is the tenth day since I started. Three Indians came and camped at my place. I asked them to tell me the truth, so that I might bring in reliable news. They answered that they had killed ten for certain, and that the first was the farmer of the Assiniboines, and that if I wanted to be convinced I need only look in the manure heap; that he was buried there. I told them I believed them. Alex. Salomon's pupil, with Smart, went to Winnipeg. The youth went on in advance with four other men and I saw them near the Indian camp. He had deserted. When he reached the camp the Indians took his horse and arms away from him. Then they asked him to tell the truth as to whether he had deserted to\ncome to the camp? He answered, \"yes.\" The Indians asked if he had seen any soldiers? He said, \"yes. I saw some between the river and the big grove. They said there were five hundred.\" It was they said that. When I left the grove the three Indians accompanied me as far as the end of the buttes. There we unharnessed in order to eat before parting. After going some distance I saw five horsemen and rushed towards them. When I got near they made sign to me to stop and I did not do so but kept on. And they began firing at me (it was twenty-five or thirty miles from Battle River) but I continued advancing upon them. They fired seven shots. They were lying on the ground in order to fire at me, and when they saw that I did not stop they mounted their horses and fled. When I got to the top of the hill I saw the camp. They were on horseback to chase me and I got away from there. In the spring I had left my horses in the grove and I went to look for them. I found them, and on the following day I left the place and camped beyond Eagle River in the buttes. Starting thence I unharnessed at Eagle River; then I camped at the spring. On reaching Pointe des Buttes de Sable I saw tracks of horses, the dung had not had time to dry. There were five of them. I did not see them and I do not think they saw me. They were going towards Clarke's Crossing. At the telegraph I saw thirty in the distance, and when I got there I counted the tracks. There I saw two blankets, one blue and one white. Nearer to me I saw one, he was alone and was flying as fast as he could go. I made for the river, got down the hills, and tethered my horses in some small maples. It is there I left my family. And when I left them I came and camped in the sand buttes a little way from the camp, and in the morning I got on top of a butte and saw Middleton's camp on this side of the river. Towards evening yesterday I left the place. I wanted to cross the road in the open in order to reach a grove. My wife became faint and we crouched down there. They did not see us. Thence I went to Mr. B\u00e9langer's.\n\n(This report is made under oath.)\n\nList of Killed.\n\nKilled on 26th March, 1885:\u2014Augustine Laframboise, he leaves a wife and two children; Isidore Dumont, he leaves a wife and some twelve children; J.

Is Arcand vs. Arcand case dropped? I think that that case must be looked into, as I think it will make a hard feeling on one part\u2014that feeling will be the means of some parties going back to their homes. As for my part, I don't wish to see any hard feeling on either side.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

You are the master. And that no horse be given without an order from the council, or the inspector of the guard, but when an alarm is given then an order is not necessary.\n\nM. D., for the Secretary.\n\nMr. Joseph Parenteau.\n10th April, 1885.\n\nNo. 2.\nRev. Father V\u00e9geville,\u2014The Council of the Provisional Government begs you to consider the interests of the French Canadian Metis with a more favorable eye; this you can do by declaring in writing that you will keep yourself at least perfectly neutral; that you will not withdraw from this place without the consent of the Provisional Government.\n\nGive in writing your word of honor that you will act in this way towards us; if you do not we will be compelled to treat you accordingly.\n\nPH. Garnot, Secretary of the Council.\n\nBatoche, 10th April, 1885.\n\nNo. 3.\nMy Very Dear Father Fourmand,\u2014I send a courier in your direction to carry to you the terrible news of the death of Fathers Fa\u00efard and Marchand, who were killed by the Indians at Frog Lake.\n\nYou will apply in their case the prayers required by our rules. The Indians have risen in every direction and are massacring the whites. Eleven persons were killed around Frog Lake. It is a war of extermination which has begun and it is our Metis who have caused this trouble, and who bear the responsibility of all the blood that has been and will be shed.\n\nMy dear father, we must save the sisters from the fate which threatens them, and find means to send them to Prince Albert. I am ignorant how you are situated, but things have an extremely dangerous look; but you seem to fear nothing, and rest in perfect serenity.\n\nConsider, then, if there is any danger in making the sisters leave for Prince Albert, and see if you cannot find some willing men to escort them as far as the forks of the road which comes from Carlton. They have nothing to fear on the part of the people of Prince Albert, who never go there except to cut hay. It is the Indians whom I dread.\n\nPrince Albert, 12th April, 1885.\n\nNo. 3.\nDear Brother,\u2014The exovedes in meeting decided that two or three men should be sent to Carlton, but they agree that you should not go yourself, they are of opinion that your presence here is necessary, although they are sure that you would be the best to go to Carlton. They really expect an attack at a very short period, and they know that your ability here will be of great necessity.\n\nScouts have been seen twice today already. We would also beg of you to keep a very close and good guard, because there might be danger on your side of the river. Sending you our best wishes, we remain your brother.\n\nFor the council,\n\nPH. Garnot, Secretary.\n\nTo Exovede Albert Monkman.\nSt. Anthony, 16th April, 1885.\nNo. 4.\n\nSir,\u2014You are requested to attend the Council meeting to-morrow, as we have urgent need of you and of all the absent members of the Council.\n\nYour very devoted,\n\nPH.

GARNOT, Secretary,\n\nBy Oct. REGNIER, Assistant.\n\nMr. ALEX. FISHER.\n\nST. ANTHONY, 18th April, 1886.\n\nNo. 7.\n\nWe have received and considered yours concerning the friendly and generous offer of Chesorpen. We thank our relative, the old soldier, for his offer of good services. The Exovidate are of opinion that Middleton and his troops ought not to be treated as ordinary. It would be better to watch well their moves, to let them come when they please,\u2014under the Almighty hand of Divine Providence\u2014and when they are near enough to strike and work until, with God's and Christ's help, we have conquered them. A complete success over Middleton we have to ask from our Lady the Blessed Virgin Mary, and let us aim at such a decisive success\u2014and considering the situation, we believe that it would be of great usefulness to send a party of d\u00e9couveurs to-night to watch the movement of Middleton, to-morrow morning, and during the whole day from your side of the river.\n\nProposed by Mr. Ross, seconded by Mr. Lepine, that a vote of thanks be voted to Mr. Monkman, for the creditable way in which he conducted himself in the command which he has across the river.\n\nPresent:\u2014Messrs Tourond, Jobin, Trottier, Henry, Carri\u00e8re, Boucher, Ross and Lepine.\n\nPH.

FATHER V\u00c9GREVILLE.\n\nDeposition of Mr. Gabriel Dumont.\u2014Having met Father V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville half a mile from here, he told me that the Indians were pillaging the goods of Madame Thibault, and that it was you people who were responsible for all that, because you invited the Indians, and that you would be held accountable for it. And on arriving at Duck Lake Madame Thibault came and asked me if I had ordered the Indians to take her hay.\n\nMr. Michel Dumas corroborates the deposition of Mr. Dumont in every particular.\n\nMr. Boucher.\u2014It appears that Father V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville told my son that all the people who had taken up arms in the movement were rebels and would find that it was their damnation, that he could not administer to them in their last moments. And I repeat this as being the most violent language that was uttered. Mr. Brennan, jr., was there, and the father ought to know that he sank down with weakness when hearing this spoken of.\n\nFor keeping the Father, Dam. Carri\u00e8re, G. Dumont, M. Lepine, C. Trottier, D. Ross, P. Henry, Bte. Boucher, M. Ouellette.\n\nProposed by Maximo Lepine, seconded by J. B. Boucher, if God so wills, if He has so decided in His eternal designs, we desire nothing better than to be His priests and to constitute, if such is His desire and His holy will, the new religious ministry of Jesus Christ. And we at once establish the living catholic apostolic and vital church of the new world. Confident that by doing so we are doing a thing which is pleasant to Him, we adopt for the line of our conduct the three admirable letters from the Archbishop Ignace Bourget to Louis \"David\" Riel, written on the 13th January, 1874, the 14th July, 1875, and the 2nd January, 1876.\n\nB\u00e9langer vs. Vandale for a Gun.\n\nMr. B\u00e9langer said he had commenced negotiations to trade a gun for a waggon with Pierre Vandale, and that he was to see the gun, and that if the gun pleased him he would take it, and that when he went to see the gun Vandale was not at home, and he went to see him at the house of his father-in-law, and had taken the gun, and that when the trouble began the nephew of Mr. B\u00e9langer had taken it, and that Mr. Vandale had taken it from him. Mr. Vermette said the same thing. Mr. Vandale said that his gun had not been paid for, that he was to have had the choice of three carts, and that he had only seen two, and that he had not received them. I went to see the carts before he took the gun. He gave me my choice between a cart and a bob-sleigh.\n\nIn answer to Mr. Riel\u2014I was wrong in telling him to go and see the gun.\n\nB\u00e9langer cross-examined by Mr. Riel.\n\nMr. Vermette repeats what he had said before.\n\nDecision of the Council\u2014Mr. Lepine: That the gun belongs to the B\u00e9langer. Mr. Boyer, Mr. Boucher, Mr. Delorme. Mr. Vandale give the gun to Mr. B\u00e9langer, and the Council decides to give the first gun at their disposal to Vandale.\n\nProposed by Mr. Boucher, seconded by Mr. Delorme, that the first gun at our disposal be given to Mr. Vandale.\nSUPPLEMENTARY RETURN\n\nTo an ORDER of the HOUSE OF COMMONS, dated the 4th March, 1886;\u2014For copies of all papers found in the Council room of the insurgents, or elsewhere at Batoche, especially including:\n\n1.

That there is great danger of a civil war\u2014an Indian war\u2014and all that that means.\n\n5th. That the French have rights and are determined men.\n\n6th. That there is no way of settling this disturbance but by treaty or war.\n\n7th. That the neutral party, the English half-breeds and Canadian settlers who wish to remain at peace, and their wives and families, do beg of the Government to treat with the settlers giving them their just rights and save the destruction of their families.\n\n8th. That we have come to this country in good faith that we would have our rights respected as British subjects.\n\n9th. That the Government has refused to treat with settlers till our party could bear it no longer, and will have their rights or die.\n\n10th. We therefore beg of the Government to do justice to the settlers, treat with them and save the effusion of blood.\n\nTHOMAS F.
