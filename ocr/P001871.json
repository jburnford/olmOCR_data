But few cases of any importance relating to these Acts have been decided, and fewer still have been reported, so that as yet we cannot be said to have any settled jurisprudence on the subject. Such cases as have been decided are referred to after the sections to which they particularly relate, and notes from a few Australian cases have been also introduced; but no attempt has been made to apply the decisions of other colonial courts to these statutes, the author considering it best to abstain as far as possible from making suggestions regarding interpretation, except where our Canadian courts or the practice of our Land Titles Offices have decided as to construction.\n\nAn Introductory Analysis of the Act has been given, considering under their proper heads the different subjects treated of in dispersed portions of the Acts, which it is hoped may assist in the examination and application of the provisions of the new laws that have so revolutionized generally accepted ideas of conveyancing.\n\nIn the compilation of this treatise the author has freely availed himself of much useful matter contained in Mr.\nThomas a'Beckett's work on the Transfer of Land Statute of Victoria, and Mr. Herbert C. Jones' work on the \"Torrens' System\" of Transfer of Land in Canada. To both these gentlemen this acknowledgment is due, and reference must still be had to their works for much valuable material which it has not been considered advisable to include in this manual, designed rather as a handy book of the Statutes than a dissertation upon their principles.\n\nThe author has not deemed it useful to enter into a discussion upon the merits and advantages of the system of registration of titles considered with reference to the indexing and transfer of real property. The merits of the new system have been admitted in Canada when it was practically applied by the Legislatures of British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario, as well as by the Dominion Parliament, through the enactment of statutes dealing with the subject in these Provinces and the North-West Territories. Similar systems are in operation in parts of Great Britain and Ireland and in most of the British Colonies and possessions in the Pacific; also in Turkey in Europe, in Prussia, in Hesse-Darmstadt and Zurich, and especially in the last-mentioned communities have the highest commendation from juridical writers. The author can but add his humble appreciation of the system, as being much preferable to mere registration of deeds. The Torrens' system is the most important of all modern land reforms, and, as was said by an eminent English writer, in the Fortnightly Review, April, 1885 (referring to Lord Cairns' Act, 1862), it deals a death blow to the old doctrine which depended on the theory that land was not to be dealt with freely, and renders real estate as negotiable as any other property.\n\nThose desiring to become better informed on the subject of land transfer and registration by title are referred to the following list of magazine articles and publications in addition to that above referred to:\nLand Reformers, by the Duke of Argyle, in *The Contemporary Review* of April, 1885;\nQuestion of Land, Rt.

Burnet Morris, London (1886).\nStatement on the Land Laws, by the Council of the Incorporated Law Society of London (1886).\n\nLand Transfer: published by order of the Bar Committee, London (1886).\n\nThe last three publications give a fair idea of the opinion of the English Bar upon the subject.\n\nAll the above-mentioned pamphlets and publications, some of which are even now difficult to procure, ought to be found on the shelves of every law library in Canada and the United States of America, in view of the fact that the system of Title Registration is destined very soon to supersede all other systems of Land Registration and Transfer at present in use. Owing to the absence of many of the most important writings from any of our Provincial libraries the author has, in a number of cases, been obliged to rely upon the notes and abstracts of others where the publications themselves ought to have been consulted had it been possible.\n\nThe Real Property Act of 1889 (Manitoba) combines the principles of registration of title with the provisions of the former statutes relating to the registration of instruments affecting titles to land, distinguishing them as the \"old system\" and the \"new system,\" the effect being to reduce the cost of bringing lands under the operation of the Torrens System; while leaving it optional with the owner to allow his property to remain subject to the old system of deed registration. The Statutes of the Province are about to be revised and consolidated, it has therefore not been deemed advisable to print the Acts respecting the registration of deeds and the duties of registrars of deeds with this manual, as they will no doubt be considerably revised and amended during the process of consolidation in order to decrease the friction that may be expected to arise from the joint administration of two systems so essentially differing from each other.\nIt has not been found practicable to give notes of any consequence with the text of the Territorial Act, but references have been made in all possible cases to the corresponding provisions of the Manitoba Statute which will answer the purpose of a table of concordance, and thus the rules and precedents established in the Land Titles Offices in Manitoba may be more readily applied in the North-West Territories. The side notes printed with the Territorial Act are not the same as those which appear in the authorised editions of the statute; this fact has been noted on the title page of Part III.\n\nAn acknowledgment is due to Mr. W. E. Macara, Inspector of Land Titles Offices for Manitoba, and to Mr. P. M. Barker, Inspector for the Territories, for their kind counsel and assistance during the compilation of this work.\n\nThe author cannot hope to have escaped error in entering upon so wide a field almost without any guidance from the reports, but he does hope that the comments and the references given may prove useful practice.\n\nNo. 8, London and Canadian Chambers,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, January, 1890.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\nPART I.\n\nIntroductory Analysis of the \"New System\" of Title Registration.\n\n| PAGE |\n|------|\n| OBJECTS OF \"NEW SYSTEM\" | 1 |\n| ADMINISTRATION OF NEW SYSTEM | 5 |\n| BRINGING LAND UNDER THE ACT | 8 |\n| REGISTERED TITLES | 12 |\n| TRANSFERS | 17 |\n| TRANSMISSIONS BY DEATH OR INSOLVENCY | 20 |\n| LEASES | 21 |\n| EASEMENTS | 23 |\n| MORTGAGES AND CHARGES | 23 |\n| POWERS OF ATTORNEY | 27 |\n| JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH | 28 |\n| CAVEATS | 31 |\n| RIGHTS OF CREDITORS AGAINST REGISTERED INTERESTS | 33 |\n| REMEDIES FOR LOSS OF RIGHTS | 34 |\n| THE TERRITORIAL ACT | 36 |\n\nPART II.\n\nTHE REAL PROPERTY ACT OF 1889; (MANITOBA STATUTE, 52 VICTORIA, CAP. 16) WITH NOTES THEREON AND FORMS | 39 |\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\nPART III.\nThe Territories Real Property Act; (Revised Statutes of Canada, cap. 51) as amended up to 31st December, 1889, with Notes thereon and References to the Manitoba Real Property Act of 1889 ........................................... 211\n\nAPPENDIX.\nManitoba Statute 53 Victoria, cap. 5, being an Act to Amend \"The Real Property Act of 1889,\" with Notes thereon and References to the Amended Statute ........................................... 291\n\nINDEX .................................................................................. 305\n## TABLE OF CASES.\n\n| Case Name                  | Page |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| Andrews v.

Firstly, certainty of title and facility of proof; and, secondly, simplicity in dealing with land brought under the operation of the statute. This first result is obtained under the \"New System\" (the term used in the Real Property Act of 1889 to distinguish the system of registration by title from the \"Old System\" of registration by deed) by issuing a Certificate of Title, which is a special document provided by the Act that has the effect of declaring by statutory authority that the person therein mentioned as being the registered owner of the specified estate, has an indefeasible title thereto as against all the world, (a) and consequently dispensing with the series of documents theretofore neces-\n\n(a) Secs. 64-67, 85, 133, 142, 143 and 147.\nsary as evidence of title shewing the changes in ownership from the original grant, and at each change giving rise to enquiry as to the validity of the conveyance, the expense and professional skill being of necessity increased with every link in the chain of title. Under the old system an unwilling purchaser might in most cases indefinitely multiply technical objections and eventually, after much tedious delay, have a perfectly safe-holding title rejected as unmarketable; and even if he failed in doing so, the investigation made on his behalf was never conclusive, and the same expense and annoyance might be repeated with additions on the occasion of every transaction respecting the land, going repeatedly over the same ground and causing much delay, for each solicitor called in to pass the title had to test every link in the chain of title for himself and assume the responsibility of passing it. Under the \"new system\" the Examiners of title in the Land Titles Office make one investigation final and conclusive, (b) and have special powers to facilitate their examination (c) into matters of title which greatly diminish the expense of an ordinary solicitor's investigation, and have also the great advantage under special provisions of the Act that although there may be technical defects in the title which would otherwise render it unmarketable, yet if the applicant can shew such a title as would secure him from ejectment, or what is known among lawyers as a \"safeholding\" title, (d) the defects are cured by the issue of a certificate of title, unless personal fraud or misrepresentation, in which the person named as registered owner in the existing certificate has knowingly participated, can be distinctly established. (e)\n\nIn cases where titles have become clouded or affected by claims or liens of a doubtful or irregular character, these can be at very small expense removed by estoppel\n\n(b) Secs. 43 and 44.\n(c) Secs. 49-57 and 108.\n(d) Sch. S, n. 3, s. 26.\n(e) Secs. 64 and 85.\nnotices specially provided by the Act, (f) which may be served on adverse claimants and their interests summarily and inexpensively disposed of.\n\nThe second aim of the Statute, simplicity in dealing with lands when once they have been made subject to its operation, is ensured by an essential uniformity enforced by the Statute, in all instruments of a similar class (g) according to short forms prescribed, but which may be modified by express stipulation (h) of the parties; and by the statutory provision suspending all change of proprietorship until registration has been effected. (i) Every regular instrument intended to affect lands, subject to the new system, when signed by the proprietor, and duly attested, is made effective as a direction to the registrar to make the necessary transfer or change, (j) but until duly registered no effect is given to the instrument in so far as the lands are concerned, it merely gives rise to rights between the parties, but no estate in the lands passes until registration has been duly effected by the proper public officer (k), and he can act only according to the provisions of the Statute. The title to the lands mentioned in the certificate being guaranteed as indefeasible by the Government, the warrantor is thus given the right of being made cognizant of every act by which, in any way, it is intended to be modified or affected. (l)\n\nAs a consequence of this necessary restriction placed upon the alienation of lands under the operation of the new system, the entry of any memorial respecting trusts is forbidden to be made in the register (m), and except in the case of personal fraud, no one can be affected by notice\n\n(f) Secs. 52 and 57.  \n(g) Sec. 71.  \n(h) Sec. 144.  \n(i) Sec. 74.  \n(j) Sec. 81  \n(k) Sec. 74.  \n(l) Sch.

(o) Trusts, however, are not abolished under the new system, they may exist as between the parties, and the trust deed may be deposited in the Land Titles Office for safe custody and reference, but the responsibility of enquiring as to trusts is shifted from the purchaser, and it now rests upon the beneficiary to take means to protect his interests against improper dealings by lodging a caveat, or by taking proceedings for the removal of the trustee. (p)\n\nThe system under which trusts are enforced by Courts of Equity has not been disturbed (q) nor has an attempt been made to prevent the enforcement of claims against actual or constructive trustees, but under the new system a person does not become a trustee merely because he holds trust property. The obligation has been made personal to the trustee himself, and the bona fide registered owner although a bare trustee has absolute title against the cestui que trust. (r) Power is reserved to the Registrar to prevent improper dealing with lands, (s) and in this way he may in suspicious cases prevent a breach of trust; the beneficiary may file a caveat to protect his rights, (t) but in the absence of fraud on the part of the purchaser he gets a good title upon registration under the new system, (u) although the transfer to him was in breach of trust:\n\n(n) Secs. 85, 133 and 143.  \n(o) Sec. 85.  \n(p) Secs. 86 and 113-117.  \n(q) Secs. 117, 123, 129.  \n(r) Secs. 64, 85, 117.  \n(s) Sec. 68 (5).  \n(t) Sec. 130.  \n(u) Secs. 64, 85, and 133.\nTHE ACT OF 1889.\n\nThe Manitoba Real Property Act of 1889 is the one with which this introduction is principally intended to deal, and, as will be seen, it is not merely a consolidation of the Real Property Act of 1885 and its amendments, but several additional amendments suggested by the practical operation of the former Acts have been made, as well as the necessary alterations to secure the harmonious working of the dual system now introduced. Provision is also made to secure the carrying on without interruption, or at least with as little interruption as possible, of cases pending under the Acts repealed, (v) and that dealings with land which had been brought under the operation of the repealed Acts might be continued in the district within which they might be included upon the establishment of the new offices, in the same manner as if they were lands subject to those provisions of the new law which the present Statute designates the \"New System.\"\n\nThe administration of the Acts in both Manitoba and the North-West Territories of Canada is effected through Land Titles Offices, established by the Government in Land Titles Districts, which districts are constituted by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in Manitoba; in the Territories they are defined by the Statute. The offices in Manitoba are included amongst those forming the Provincial civil service. (w)\n\nIn Manitoba, as each Land Titles District was constituted under the present Act, and Land Titles Offices established, the originals or copies of all registers, books, instruments and entries of instruments in the office of the Registrar-General at Winnipeg, were furnished to the offices for the\n\n(v) Secs. 10-19.  \n(w) Sec. 151.\ndistrict within which the lands affected were situated, to be thereafter dealt with as if they had been made and registered under the new Act; (x) the office of the Registrar-General ceased to exist on 30th October, 1889; (y) and the system became decentralized, each Land Titles Office having exclusive jurisdiction (z) within the district for which it had been established, except that where lands subject to the Act of 1885, either before or after the issue of a certificate of title, happened to be in a division for which no Land Titles District had been constituted, then, until it became included in some other district, all dealings affecting it were to be made in the Land Titles Office for Winnipeg, (a) where in the meantime all records affecting lands in unorganized districts remained on file.\n\nThe County Registry Offices for the registration of deeds, etc., ceased to exist, (b) and the Registrars of Deeds were relieved of their duties under the \"Lands Registration Act of Manitoba,\" so soon as the lands registration division was included in any Land Titles District constituted under the present Statute and all the records of the offices so abolished were transferred (c) to the proper Land Titles Office in a manner similar to that provided for the distribution by the Registrar-General of the archives of the old Land Titles Office at Winnipeg.\n\nEach Land Titles Office has at its head a District Registrar, (d) who, in addition to his powers under the Real Property Act, has also all the powers, and is required to perform all the duties of a registrar of deeds under the provisions of the \"Lands Registration Act of Manitoba;\" (e) he is assisted by deputies, examiners of titles, a draughts-\n\n(x) Sec. 10.  \n(y) Sec. 18.  \n(z) Sec. 35.  \n(a) Sec. 36.  \n(b) Sec. 14.  \n(c) Sec. 11.  \n(d) Sec. 5.  \n(e) Secs. 15-17\nman and clerks appointed for each district. (f) Every district Registrar or deputy district Registrar under the new system must be either a barrister or an attorney in the Courts of the Province of Manitoba. (g) There is also an \"Inspector\" for the Province, (h) which office is at present combined with that of the District Registrar for the Land Titles District of Winnipeg.\n\nIn the Territories (i) the Governor General of Canada in Council has the establishment of a Land Titles Office within each district, and the appointment of the \"Registrar\" to conduct the business of the office with such assistants and clerks as are necessary, and as the Governor in Council from time to time appoints, including a deputy to act in case of the death, illness, or absence from his office of the registrar. The qualification required of a Registrar is that he shall be a barrister or advocate of at least three years, standing in one of the provinces of Canada.\n\nThe officials both in Manitoba and the Territories are required to give security for the faithful performance of their duties, (j) they are prohibited from practicing as conveyancers, etc., and are indemnified for acts done in the discharge of the duties of their office. (k)\n\nThe Land Titles Offices in Manitoba are open to the public from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; (l) those in the Territories from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (m) The Manitoba offices are directed to open and close by standard time. (l)\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor in Council has the power to make rules, etc., under the Manitoba Act, (n) while the Governor General in Council exercises similar powers in the Territories.

(p) Practical experience has shewn that it might have been better to have made these provisions the subject of a special statute, and they have been and still are matters of considerable differences of opinion. These alterations of the law are noticed under the sections of the statute by which they have been effected; on reference to the notes some of the difficulties which they have created will become apparent.\n\nBRINGING LAND UNDER THE ACT.\n\nThe manner of bringing lands under the operation of the Act in Manitoba is similar to that provided by the Act of 1885, except that there is now no necessity of registering a certificate of the filing of the application to close any other office against registrations affecting the land sought to be made subject to the new system, both systems being combined under the same administration.\n\nThe District Registrar upon receipt of the application simply notes the filing upon the Abstract Book kept by him under the system of registration of deeds, and the filing of the application has at once the effect of preventing any further registrations under the old system affecting the lands therein mentioned. (a) No lands become subject to the new system until such an application has been filed, and no\n\n(p) Man. secs. 27-34, and T. secs. 5-17. (a) Sec. 42.\napplication can be filed for lands not included within the limits of some one of the Land Titles Districts. (b) All applications must, except in special cases, be in writing and signed by the owner of the estate or interest in the land or his duly constituted agent or attorney, (c) and should request the District Registrar to register the title under the new system. The nature of the estate or interest, its value, the description of the property, the deeds held by applicant, and the encumbrances, if any, which affect the land should be clearly stated, as well as adverse claims through occupation or otherwise if there are any of which the applicant may be aware. The substantial correctness of all the allegations in the application is also required to be proved (d) by the oath or affirmation of the applicant, or some person having a personal knowledge of the facts. The title is then examined by one of the official Examiners of titles, (e) and if favorably reported upon, after all defects have been removed, the District Registrar registers the title and issues a certificate to the person in whose name it has been registered, (f) The holder of a legal or equitable estate is entitled to have his title registered, and a certificate issued to him therefor. The owner of an equity of redemption may apply to have mortgaged lands registered, (g) and by such application the whole estate would be made subject to the new system. Applications may be made by parents, guardians or committees respecting the lands of infants, lunatics or persons of unsound mind; if there is no guardian or committee the District Registrar may appoint one to act in the case, and attorneys having authority to sell lands may apply to have them brought under the new\n\n(b) Sec. 35.  \n(c) Rules 2-7, Sch.

(h)\n\nIf the applicant or person acting on his behalf has power to convey the land he may in his application, or by a special request in writing filed afterwards and prior to registration of the title, direct the certificate of title to issue to some other person, and such a direction from the time it is filed vests all the applicant's estate or interest in the person so named, who may be registered as owner. (i) In such cases the signature of the applicant must be verified by the oath of a subscribing witness in the same manner as instruments intended for registration under the old system. (j) Applications may be withdrawn with the consent of all parties interested, and the evidence of title returned to the applicant or person appearing to the District Registrar to be entitled to them, but any person who has been compelled to file a caveat may on application to a Judge on summons in Chambers obtain compensation for any unreasonable expenses to which he may have been put on account of the application. (k) Applications may be rejected by the District Registrar, and in case of withdrawal or rejection the expense of re-opening the books of the old system for registrations affecting the property must be borne by the original applicant before he receives the rebate on fees paid. (l)\n\nShould a withdrawal or a rejection be made subsequent to the filing of a \"Direction,\" the effect of the re-opening of the books of the old system is to revest the lands in the person properly entitled to them, and the direction ceases to be notice of any claim to the lands by any of the parties thereto.

(n) Should it happen that the applicant or directee dies before the certificate of title has issued, it will nevertheless issue in his name, and the property will devolve as if it had issued prior to his death. (o)\n\nClouds may be removed from titles by means of estoppel notices which are given a special statutory effect, in addition to the effect of notice at common law, which bars any one personally served from setting up claims unless he acts promptly by filing a caveat, (p) or instituting proceedings to enforce his claims. Notices are served as in suits in Court, (q) but in cases where title is made through tax sale deeds substitutional service may in certain cases be allowed. (r)\n\nThe stricter rules of evidence as to title are relaxed in the investigation of titles so that the District Registrar and Examiners may pass titles for the purpose of registration under the new system with as much facility as a Judge proceeding under the Quieting Titles Act, equitable principles are observed, and in any matter of title they can examine witnesses and administer oaths and affirmations. (s)\n\nThe District Registrar has power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, on summons, which may be enforced by the Court of Queen's Bench in like manner, by the same proceedings and with\n\n(m) Sec. 49.  \n(n) Sec. 50.  \n(o) Sec. 51.  \n(p) Secs. 52, 147, Rule 23, Sch.

(t) Doubtful matters of law or fact may be referred by the District Registrar for the opinion of the Court or a Judge, (u) and uncertain or difficult questions of administration can be referred by him to a Judge in Chambers. (v) After the registration of title the deeds, instruments and evidence of title filed are retained in the Land Titles Office, but where deeds relate to other property than that brought under the new system, they may in the discretion of the District Registrar be returned upon office copies being made to remain of record with the application.\n\nREGISTERED TITLES.\n\nA Certificate of Title dates from the time of registration, that is, so soon as it has been engrossed in the register and the original for the owner marked with the distinguishing symbol indicating the folio and volume of the register in which it had been engrossed. (a) This date is mentioned in the Certificate and in all cases it is to be taken as the date of the certificate of title until an encumbrance is registered upon it under the new system, when the date of the memorial of the last registered encumbrance becomes the date (b) of the certificate; the certificate must be in the form prescribed by the Act, and sealed with the official seal, and the duplicate in the register must be preserved by the District Registrar for reference in his office. (c)\n\nAs the proprietor's interest is altered by dealings or other registrations affecting the land, memorials are made upon the duplicate, (d) which always shews the exact nature of the title of the registered owner, except in so far as it\n\n(t) Secs. 68 (1), (2), (3) and 124.

S.\n(a) Sec. 58. sec. 26.\nmay be affected by general liens resulting from the registration of judgments, Mechanics Liens and so forth, (e) or executions registered and kept in force under the Administration of Justice Act. (f) Every owner is entitled to have his estate or interest in land registered, and to receive a certificate for whatever may be his title or interest therein, (g) and if the proprietor be a minor or under any other legal disability, the age of the minor, or the nature of the disability to deal with his property must be stated on the face of the certificate. (h) Tenants in common may each receive separate certificates for their undivided shares, (i) and each may deal with his interest without the consent of the other.\n\nWhere an easement has been created affecting land under the new system, to be enjoyed together with other lands also under the new system, all the certificates must bear memorials of the easement so created or annexed to the lands. (j) Certificates of Title must also refer to any reservation of mines or minerals. (k)\n\nThe proprietor's title is not however enlarged by the issue of a Certificate of Title, as it is subject to certain implied qualifications (l) not specially mentioned. These are: 1. Reservations made in the Crown grant of the land; 2. All taxes; 3. Subsisting rights of way and easements; 4. Subsisting leases or agreements for a lease, not over three years, where the lessee is actually in occupation; 5. Judgments, decrees, orders and liens which may be registered after the date of the certificate, and without the necessity of a memorial being made upon it to indicate the alteration of interest thereby effected; 6. Public highways are always excluded; 7. Rights of expropriation vested in\n\n(e) Sec. 63 (e).\n(f) 52 Vic. c. 36, secs. 13-15.\n(g) Sec. 59.\n(h) Sec. 59.\n(i) Sec. 62.\n(j) Sec. 79.\n(k) Sec. 84.\n(l) Sec. 63.\ncorporations; 8. Certificates issued on first registration and others derived through the applicant owner, are void as against the rights of persons adversely in actual occupation, and entitled to the land or any part of it at the date of such first registration, provided such occupation is still continuing at the time of the issue of the subsequent certificate. (m)\n\nThe certificate issued to the proprietor and that preserved in the register are both original documents, but the one kept by the District Registrar bound up in the Register Book is called the duplicate. (n) The certificate is conclusive evidence in every court of law or equity that the registered owner has a valid title for the estate or interest therein described, and is sufficient to entitle him to a decree for specific performance against a person who may have contracted for the purchase of the land. (o) His title to the estate or interest is paramount (saving in the case of fraud and of the implied qualifications above mentioned) except as against a proprietor claiming the same land under a prior certificate of title, or through the holder of a prior certificate of title, and except where by mistake in describing the boundaries or parcels more land has been included than was intended, but this latter exception applies only when the holder of the certificate is neither a bona fide purchaser nor a mortgagee. (p) The certificate is an absolute bar and estoppel to any action of ejectment, or for the recovery of the land against the registered owner except under special circumstances, such as the exceptions just mentioned or in a case of default as mortgagor or lessee. (q)\n\nThe proprietor may be required to sign a receipt for his certificate or otherwise to furnish the district Registrar\n\n(m) Sec. 65.

(q) Secs. 67, 89, 103-107.\nwith his signature as a means of preventing fraud, (r) and in case of loss a provisional certificate of title may be issued in substitution of the one that is missing. (s) A proprietor holding certificates of title for several parcels of contiguous land on surrendering them for cancellation may, by request have one certificate issued for the whole of the lands, or if the lands are all in one certificate he may in a similar manner obtain several certificates, each for a portion of the land. (t) On a sale of part of the land a memorial of the transfer is endorsed on the certificate cancelling it as to the part sold, or it may be cancelled in full and a new certificate for the unsold portion issued to the owner, and in each case a new certificate of title is issued to the purchaser. Where all the land is transferred the old certificate is wholly cancelled and a new one issued to the purchaser who becomes registered owner. (u) On the loss of a certificate being satisfactorily accounted for its production may be dispensed with by the District Registrar on making a transfer; (v) and if it is held by a mortgagee or other person interested in the land he can compel its production for the purpose of allowing memorials to be made, (w) under the penalties imposed by the Act. (x) Old certificates may be cancelled and new ones substituted for them (y) when they have become illegible from accident or other cause.\n\nCertificates of title are never signed during the time the Land Titles Offices are open for the registration of instruments, (z) nor until a final search has been made for liens or charges against the lands to be registered after the closing of the office for registration purposes, (a) and thus the liability of issuing certificates before all proper memorials and entries have been made is avoided.\n\n(r) Rule 15, Sch.

They must contain the full names and additions of the parties, and with the exception of several specified official documents, they must be signed before a witness, who shall verify their execution in the manner required for the proof of instruments for registration under the old system. They are registered in the order of time in which they are presented for that purpose, and take priority accordingly. (b) They must substantially comply with the forms given in the Statute, on pain of rejection, as unfit for registration. (c)\n\nInstruments in accordance with the forms in use, or sufficient to pass an estate in lands not subject to the new system, may be admitted for registration by order of the inspector, in which case they shall be held to contain all such covenants as are implied in instruments of a like nature under the new system; and for the purpose of sale or foreclosure under any mortgage so registered proceedings may be taken as if the lands were not subject to the new system, at the option of the mortgagee. (d) When the witness to an instrument is dead or absent from the Province, it may be registered upon a Judge endorsing a certificate that he has been satisfied by proof adduced of its due execution. (e) Should several instruments signed by the same person purporting to affect the same estate or interest be presented at the same time for the purpose of registration, that instrument shall be registered which is presented by the person producing the certificate or other evidence of title.

(h) When so registered the instrument becomes part and parcel of the register for the purposes of the Act. (i) Here may be noted the principal difference in the effective nature of instruments under the new system, which do not become operative until registration; it is only after any such instrument has been so constructively embodied in the register, and stamped with the seal of the District Registrar, that it creates, transfers, surrenders or discharges the estate or interest therein mentioned. (j)\n\nNo instrument requiring endorsement on the certificate can be received or registered unless the certificate is produced or its production dispensed with, (k) and with every transfer or mortgage presented for registration a certificate from the treasurer of the municipality within which the lands affected are situated must be produced, (l) showing that the lands intended to be dealt with have not been sold for arrears of taxes under the provisions of the Municipal Act.\n\nTRANSFERS.\n\nTransfers of estates or interests in land under the new system may be made by the registered owner by endorsement on the certificate, mortgage, encumbrance or lease, (a)\n\n(g) Rule 10, Sch.

(c) Registration is effected by memorial on the certificate in the manner provided for the registration of instruments; (d) the existing certificate and the duplicate in the register are cancelled wholly or partially according as the transfer is of the whole or of part only of the interest of the transferrer, (e) a new certificate is made registering the transferee as owner of the land transferred, and the old certificate, if wholly cancelled, is retained by the District Registrar with the memorandum of transfer. If the certificate is only partially cancelled it may be returned to the owner after the memorial has been entered upon it, or if requested or expedient a new certificate for the unsold portion or any part thereof may be issued to him. (f) It is the Statute and not the instrument of transfer that effects the alienation; the legal estate does not pass until registration. (g) No seal is required on the transfer and words of limitation are not necessary; (h) no covenants need be expressed, but unless otherwise specified, (i) there is a covenant by the transferee implied as to the payment of subsisting charges on the land. (j) Until registered any instrument signed by a registered owner or others claiming through or under him purporting to pass an interest or estate in land, confers on the transferee or assignee and others claiming through or under him a right to be registered as owners of such estate or interest, and for the purpose of securing such registration in cases of difficulty the District Registrar is given power, on summary application, to make orders and cause notices to be served to the end that the person properly entitled thereto may be registered as owner,\n\n(b) Sec. 72, Sch.

(k) Upon registration of a transfer all the transferrer's estate or interest, as well as his rights and obligations, are transmitted to the transferee, and if it be of a mortgage or charge, the powers and right to sue pass to the transferee. (l) Persons acquiring estates or interests should be particular to obtain the production of the certificate of title and other instruments necessary to be endorsed with memorials of the registration and the alteration of interest thereby effected. (m) Husband and wife may validly make transfers to each other. (n)\n\nThe transferrer may exclude survivorship amongst joint trustees by inserting the words \"No survivorship\" in the transfer; and joint owners themselves may require the District Registrar to enter these words on their certificate of title. The effect in either case is to prevent any dealings with the lands unless all the joint proprietors are parties, or unless the sanction of the Court or a Judge be first obtained. (o) Before any directions are given, public notice may be required to be advertised, (p) after which the proper order may be made if necessary for the protection of those beneficially interested. (q) This inconvenient method of holding joint proprietorship will not likely be adopted except for the protection of cestui que trusts and for the tenure of land dedicated to public uses. Special proceedings are necessary to give effect to the transfer of lands sold for arrears of taxes after the period of redemption has expired.

(b) The executor or administrator of a deceased proprietor of lands, under the new system, must now first cause himself to be registered as owner, on making the necessary proof before the District Registrar, who makes an entry of the particulars in the register, cancels the existing certificate of title and issues a fresh one describing the new registered owner in his representative capacity as executor or administrator as the case may be; (c) his title then relates back and takes effect as from the death of the deceased owner and he holds the estate or interests of which he is so registered as owner upon the trusts, if any, and for the purposes to which the same is applicable under the provisions of the Real Property Act; (d) and the laws in force relating to the distribution of the estates of deceased persons; but for the purpose of dealing with lands under the new system he is deemed to hold them as absolute proprietor. (e) Where trust estates were held by a deceased owner jointly with other persons under the condition of \"No Survivorship\" the sanction of the Court is required before the register can be altered, (f) and when the personal representative is registered in the place of the deceased in such cases he holds subject to the same trusts and equities upon which the deceased held the same, but is deemed an absolute proprietor for the purpose of registrations under the new system while his name remains as owner on the Register. Upon cause shewn a\n\n(a) Secs. 27, 29 and 113.\n(b) Sec. 29.\n(c) Sec. 113.\n(d) Sec. 29.\n(e) Sec. 117.\n(f) Secs. 82, 83.\ntrustee may be removed and a new one registered as proprietor, on application to the Court. (g)\n\nMortgages, encumbrances and leases transmitted in consequence of the death of the deceased owner must have the particulars of the transmission noted upon them, and in such cases proofs are required to be produced to the District Registrar, and entries made upon the Register, Letters of Administration or Probate, noting the fact of the registration of the personal representative as owner in place of the deceased. (h)\n\nThe assignee or trustee of an insolvent proprietor is entitled to be registered as owner of the bankrupt's estates, and interests in lands under the new system, and to have a certificate of title issued to him; (i) he then holds as trustee for the creditors, and subject to the trusts, if any, on which the bankrupt proprietor held the lands, but for the purposes of registering dealings under the new system he has all the powers of an absolute owner. (j)\n\nLEASES.\n\nIt is only the registered owner who can lease lands after the certificate of title has issued under the new system, and if at the time there is a subsisting mortgage or encumbrance, no lease can bind the mortgagee or encumbrancee unless he has consented to its registration. (a) Implied covenants bind the lessee to pay the rent and taxes, and to keep and yield up the premises in repair, accidental damage by fire, lightning, storms, and reasonable wear and tear excepted. (b) The implied powers enable the landlord to\n\n(g) Sec. 117.  \n(h) Sec. 114.  \n(i) Sec. 115.  \n(j) Sec. 117.  \n(a) Sec. 87.  \n(b) Sec. 88.\nenter and view the state of repair, and to re-take possession for breach of covenants. (c) Short forms of special covenants are provided, which when used are construed as if the words of the corresponding full form had been inserted, (d) and all covenants, whether express or implied, may be modified by the introduction of express exceptions. (e) Leasehold estates may be mortgaged or charged, (f) and they may also be transferred, (g) in which case, unless otherwise expressed, a covenant is implied that the transferee will observe the covenants and indemnify the transferrer against liability in respect thereto. (h) The transferee becomes possessor of all the rights of the original lessee and subject to all liabilities to which he would have been bound had he been named in the original instrument as lessee. (i) A sub-lease does not appear to confer any right of registration (j) unless under some special circumstances an order might be obtained from the inspector, (k) and a sub-tenancy would have to depend upon an unregistered instrument and the possession of the sub-lessee; (l) who has also the right to protect his interests by caveat against dealings on the part of the original lessee. (m) Leaseholds may be transmitted by death or by insolvency, the personal representative or assignee being substituted as the registered owner, (n) with all his rights and obligations, (o) the old certificate being then cancelled and a new one issued. (p) When a lease expires by effluxion of time no entry in the register is necessary as evidence of its determination, but upon proof of lawful recovery of possession.\n\n(c) Sec. 89.  \n(d) Sec. 91.  \n(e) Secs. 91, 144.  \n(f) Sec. 96.  \n(g) Sec. 98.  \n(h) Sec. 80.  \n(i) Secs. 99, 145.  \n(j) Sec. 81.  \n(k) Sec. 77.  \n(l) Secs. 63, 65.  \n(m) Sec. 130.  \n(n) Sec. 114.  \n(o) Secs. 80, 117.  \n(p) Sec. 116.  \n(q) Sec. 90.\nsurrender, (r) or the refusal of an assignee to accept the lease, (s) the District Registrar is required to make proper entries which have the effect of causing the lease to determine. Such entry does not release the lessee from liability where the lessor has re-entered on account of breach of covenants, (t) nor does an entry of the assignee's refusal to accept a lease operate to the prejudice of actions commenced, or causes of action accrued in respect of any breach or non-observance of the covenants. (u) No surrender of a lease which has been mortgaged or charged (v) can be entered without the consent of the mortgagee or encumbrancee. (w)\n\nEASEMENTS.\n\nWhen easements over lands under the new system are created as annexed to, or to be used and enjoyed together with other lands also under the new system, entries are made on the certificates of title to all the lands affected. (a)\n\nLand under the new system may be subject to easements by implication or through expropriation, (b) and easements may be acquired by user and enjoyment (c) in the same manner as over any other land.\n\nMORTGAGES AND CHARGES.\n\nMortgages and encumbrances under the new system do not operate as conveyances of the estate, (a) but are\n\n(r) Sec. 92.  \n(s) Secs. 93, 94.  \n(t) Sec. 90.  \n(u) Sec. 116.  \n(v) Sec. 96.  \n(w) Sec. 92.  \n(a) Sec. 79.  \n(b) Sec. 63.  \n(c) Sec. 65.  \n(d) Sec. 97.\nhypothecs or real charges. The \"mortgage\" under the new system is intended to be a dealing similar to a mortgage under the general law to secure a loan, (b) except that it does not pass the legal estate charged or made security in favor of the mortgagee; (c) but the \"encumbrance,\" although the expression includes any charge or lien, (d) is intended to charge lands for the payment of an annuity; rent charge or sum of money in favor of the encumbrancee; (e) and although thus essentially different in character, yet there is such similarity in their usual incidents and results that they may be with propriety considered together.\n\nThe implied powers and liabilities, as regulated solely by the Statute, are analogous, but in mortgages short forms of covenant adapted to the ordinary relations of mortgagor and mortgagee, may be used to express the full forms (f) which are inapplicable in the case of encumbrances. They may be transferred (g) by endorsement, (h) or by a separate instrument. A separate instrument (i) or the form of endorsement provided may be used for the transfer of part of a mortgage or encumbrance, (j) and the part so transferred may be given priority over the remainder, or made to rank equally or its payment may be deferred, according to agreement expressed in the transfer. The rights and powers as well as the obligations, of all parties are preserved upon the transfer of mortgages and charges, (k) and it operates only upon registration.

(m)\n\nThe discharge of mortgages or encumbrances, either wholly or partially, is effected by an entry in the register, which can be made only upon the production of the instrument with a duly signed endorsement, evidencing the discharge, or by a separate instrument of discharge, duly executed by the mortgagor, or annuitant, as the case may be. (n) When a mortgagee is absent, and there is no person in the Province authorized to receive money accruing due, payment may be made to the Provincial Treasurer, and his receipt will be sufficient to procure the entry of discharge, the money without interest being paid over by the Provincial Treasurer, to the person entitled to receive it. (o) An encumbrance may likewise be discharged on proof of payment of all arrears, and that the annuitant is dead, or that the annuity has ceased according to the terms of the instrument by which it was created. (p)\n\nWhen estates or interests in lands are mortgaged or encumbered, they cannot be leased without the consent of the mortgagee or encumbrancee, (q) and no leasehold so affected can be surrendered without a similar consent. (r)\n\nThere is no provision for the registration of sub-mortgages, but a mortgage of a mortgage may be effected by a transfer, accompanied by an agreement as to the conditions of defeasance, converting it into a sub-mortgage, as between the transferrer and transferee protected by caveat, (s) or perhaps filed by order of the inspector, (t) or deposited as a declaration of trust.

(x)\n\nOn default being made under the terms of the mortgage or encumbrance, the mortgagee or encumbrancee, after the default has continued for one month, or such longer period as may be expressly limited, may give a written notice to perform the covenant, including if deemed proper a notice of his intention to apply for an order of foreclosure, of which notice a copy should be filed in the proper Land Titles Office. (y) Such notices should be given to the mortgagor, encumbrancer, and all other persons appearing to be interested in the lands, at the date when the notice is filed, and, unless otherwise expressly required by the conditions, set forth in the mortgage or encumbrance, he may forthwith enter and take the rents, issues and profits, (z) and after the default has continued for another month, he may sell the land, receive the purchase money and execute a transfer; (a) in the same way as power of sale may be exercised in cases under the general law, and upon registration of such transfer the land vests in the purchaser, who is entitled to a certificate of title free from such mortgage or encumbrance; or any mortgages or encumbrances registered subsequent thereto. (b)\n\nThe moneys realized by any such sale are applied, firstly, in payment of the expenses of the sale; secondly, in pay-\n\n(v) Secs. 68 (4), (6), (7); 109, 122.\n(w) Sec. 130.\n(x) Sec. 74.\n(y) Secs. 103, 106, 108, 131; Rule 23, Sch.

(a)\n\nForeclosure may be obtained after notice to all interested parties in the case of mortgages under the new system where default has continued for six months and an attempted sale by public auction has proved abortive. (c) Upon application for foreclosure, notices may be required to be advertised offering the lands for sale, and the District Registrar then appoints a time, after which the foreclosure order may issue unless in the interval the land be sold or the moneys paid. The entry of the foreclosure order in the register vests the land in the mortgagee or his transferee, who has proceeded to foreclosure, free from all rights or equity of redemption of the mortgagor or any persons interested under instruments over which the foreclosed mortgage had priority, and a fresh certificate of title is issued accordingly. (d) The old certificate of title must be surrendered for cancellation (e) or its production dispensed with; (f) to avoid trouble in such cases mortgaged certificates are impounded in the Land Titles Office from the time of the registration of the mortgage or encumbrance for the use of all persons interested.

(b)\n\nA form of power of attorney by a person who has been registered as owner is provided, which can be modified to suit circumstances, it must be entered in a special book for recording Powers of Attorney, and if the lands to be dealt with are specified an entry must also be made in the register. (c) A general form is also given, which can be made to apply to all lands under the new system, of which the principal may at any time, either before or after its date, become the registered owner. (d) Powers of attorney registered under the old system are made valid and available to the extent of the authorities given therein by the deposit of attested copies in the Land Titles Office. (e) Revocations of powers of attorney may be registered and notices given to the District Registrar of the death of the principal, which take effect only from the date of registration (f) as to instruments executed subsequently. Express authority would be required by the attorney to lease mortgaged lands. (g) All powers of attorney and revocations require attestation and should be verified by the subscribing witness. A power of attorney given for valuable consideration, or made irrevocable, should be protected by caveat.

(c) In matters relating to trusts the Court or a Judge has authority to make summary orders for the removal of trustees and assignees, and the appointment of other persons in their stead. (d) The Court of Queen's Bench may enforce a summons of the District Registrar; (e) and a Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench in Chambers may by summons or warrant enforce the production and surrender of instruments (f) required by the District Registrar for alteration or cancellation; (g) and may make orders respecting them, and for the commitment of persons refusing or neglecting to produce or surrender such instruments.

(r) While any suit or proceeding in Court is pending a certificate of lis pendens may be filed in the Land Titles Office, (s) which, until discharged, prevents dealings which might prejudice the rights of the person claiming interest in the suit, but no lis pendens can be filed without the order of a Judge, after a caveat relating to the same matter has lapsed or been withdrawn or discharged.

(b) Caveats of this description and those lodged by or on behalf of beneficiaries under a will or settlement, (c) are continuing caveats and do not lapse by mere effluxion of time, unless so stated in the order for its filing; (d) but must be disposed of by withdrawal or by order of the Court. (e) Every other caveat must state the names and additions of the person on whose behalf it is filed, and mention some place within Manitoba where notices and proceedings respecting it may be served; (f) it must be signed by the caveator, his attorney or agent, and supported by an affidavit or statutory declaration setting out the nature of the claim and the good faith of the claimant.

(a) After a caveat has lapsed or been withdrawn or discharged, a *lis pendens* under any proceeding in relation to the same matter cannot be filed without the authority of a Judge, (b) but the vacating of a certificate of *lis pendens* would not interfere with the subsequent filing of a caveat. Certificates of judgments, decrees or orders for the payment of money against a registered owner, both at common law and in equity, may be registered under the new system, and entered in the caveat book, and if they contain a specific description of lands, an entry is also made against them in the register.

(b) This fund is managed by the Provincial Government, (c) and is intended to assist (d) in the payment of damages, which may be recovered by any person sustaining loss or damage through any of the following causes: (e)\n\n1. Omissions, mistakes or misfeasances of officers acting under the provisions of the Act applicable to the new system. (f)\n\n2. Being deprived of an estate or interest in land through the bringing of the same under the new system, or the registration of some other person as owner.\n\n3.

This Act may be cited as \"The Real Property Act of 1889.\"\n\nThe Acts consolidated are 48 Vic. cap. 28, which\ncame into force on 1st July, 1885; 49 Vic. cap. 28,\nwhich came into force on 28th May, 1886; 50 Vic. c. 11,\nwhich came into force on 10th June, 1887; and 51 Vic.\ncaps. 21 and 22, which came into force on 18th May, 1888.\n\nCOMMENCEMENT.\n\n2. This Act shall come into force immediately on being assented to.\n\n(1) This Act shall be substituted for Chapter twenty-eight of Forty-eight Victoria, as applied to the present Land Titles Office at Winnipeg, except that the provisions of said Chapter twenty-eight constituting or affecting the said Land Titles Office at Winnipeg and its officers shall\nremain in force until such office is abolished under Section eighteen hereof. The Registrar-General until such abolition shall exercise all the powers conferred by this Act on District Registrars.\n\nThis section, with sections 18 and 152, are the clauses of the Act, which effect the repeal from the 5th of March, 1889, of the former Acts of 1885, 1886, 1887 and 1888, but in the Land Titles Office at Winnipeg, being the official designation applied to the office established for the whole Province under the Act of 1885, the repeal of these Acts was suspended so long as it continued, and the Registrar-General and all the officers appointed under the repealed Acts were required to act under them until the office was abolished by order of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council; the provisions of the new Act are in nearly all cases identical with the Acts which have been consolidated, and the second clause of this section gave the Registrar-General authority to use any new powers conferred upon District Registrars as auxiliary to those conferred upon him under the old Acts so long as he continued in office.\n\nSee note to sec. 4.\n\nINTERPRETATION.\n\n3. In this Act, and in all instruments purporting to be made or executed thereunder, unless the context otherwise requires:\u2014\n\n(1) The expressions \"Land\" and \"Lands\" shall extend to mean and include lands, messuages, tenements and hereditaments, corporeal and incorporeal, of every kind and description, whatever the estate or interest therein may be, and whether legal or equitable, together with all paths, passages, ways, watercourses, liberties, privileges, easements, mines, minerals and quarries appertaining thereto, and all trees and timber thereon and thereunder lying or being, unless any such are specially excepted;\n\nSee note to sec. 40 post.\n\nEasements in gross would not be included. Ex parte Johnson 5 W. W. and A. B. (L.) 55.\n\nThe meaning of \"land\" as defined here is more extensive than in the fourth section of the Victorian Transfer of Land\nStatute, which is as follows: \"The word 'land' shall include messuages, tenements and hereditaments, corporeal or incorporeal, and in every certificate of title, transfer and lease made under this Act such word shall also include all easements and appurtenances appertaining to the land therein described, or reputed to be part thereof or appurtenant thereto.\"\n\nUnder this section it was held that an easement appurtenant over land not under the statute could not be shewn on the certificate of title to the dominant tenement: Ex parte Cunningham, 3 V. L. R. (L.) 199. Nor could an easement appurtenant over land under the statute where the owner objected: Ex parte Bissel, 5 V. L. R. (L.) 53; although the contrary may be implied from the holding in Jones v. Park, 5 V. L. R. (L.) 167. It was queried in Ex parte Cunningham, ubi supra, whether an incorporeal hereditament could be the subject of a certificate of title.\n\nThe decision of the Supreme Court Ex parte Bissel has been ignored by the Office of Titles in Victoria for reasons referred to by the Commissioner of Titles (vide a'Becket's Transfer of Land, p. 76).\n\nSee also post secs. 59, 62, 63 and 84.\n\n(2) The expression \"owner\" shall extend to, mean and include any \"Owner,\" person or body corporate entitled to any freehold or other estate or interest in land, at law or in equity, in possession, in futurity, or expectancy;\n\n(3) The expression \"Transfer\" shall mean and include the passing of \"any estate or interest in land under this Act, whether for valuable consideration or otherwise;\n\nSee note to sec. 74 post.\n\n(4) The expression \"Mortgage\" shall mean and include any charge on \"Mortgage,\" land created for securing a debt or loan;\n\n(5) The expression \"Mortgagee\" shall mean and include the owner \"Mortgagee\" of a mortgage or the lender of money upon the security of any estate or interest in land;\n(6) The expression \"Mortgagor\" shall mean and include the owner of land or of any estate or interest in land pledged as security for a debt;\n\n(7) The expression \"Encumbrance\" shall mean and include any charge or lien on land;\n\nIt would include a mortgage or a lease where the context required.\n\n(8) The expression \"Encumbrancer\" shall mean and include the owner of any land or of any estate or interest in land subject to any encumbrance;\n\n(9) The expression \"Encumbrancee\" shall mean and include the owner of an encumbrance;\n\nSee note to sub-sec. (7) ante.\n\n(10) The expression \"Lunatic\" shall mean and include any person found by any competent tribunal or commission de lunatico inquirendo to be lunatic;\n\nCompare C. S. M. cap. 43, sec. 2.\n\n(11) The expression \"Person of unsound mind\" shall mean and include any person not an infant, who, not having been found to be a lunatic, has been found on like enquiry, to be incapable, from infirmity of mind, of managing his own affairs;\n\nSee note to preceding sub-section.\n\n(12) The expression \"Instrument\" shall mean and include any plan or document in writing relating to the transfer or other dealing with land or evidencing title thereto, or a duplicate thereof;\n\nUnder C. S. M. cap. 60, sec. 1, \"plan\" was not included in the meaning of the word \"instrument.\"\n\n(13) The expression \"Memorial\" shall mean and include a duplicate of any instrument as well as a memorial thereof;\n\n(14) The expression \"Valuator\" shall mean and include any person appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to value land under this Act;\n\nSee sec. 71 post.\n\n(15) The expression \"Court\" shall mean and include any Superior Court established in the Province of Manitoba;\nThat is, \"Her Majesty's Court of Queen's Bench for Manitoba.\" 48 Vic. cap. 15.\n\n(16) The expression \"Judge\" shall mean and include the Chief Judge, Justice and any judge of any Superior Court established in the Province of Manitoba;\n\nSee note to preceding section.\n\n(17) The expression \"Transmission,\" shall apply to change of ownership consequent upon lunacy, levy under execution, order of court or other act of law, or in virtue of any settlement, devise, or any legal succession in case of intestacy;\n\nSee note to sec. 63 post, as to fn. fa. and sec. 140 post as to duty chargeable on transmissions by will or intestacy or in bankruptcy.\n\nCompare secs. 123, 129 post and C. S. M. cap. 43.\n\n(18) The expression \"Grant\" shall mean and include any grant of \"Grant, Crown land, whether direct from Her Majesty or pursuant to the provisions of any statute;\n\n(19) Wherever the word \"Patent\" or \"Crown patent\" occurs in this Act the same shall include a memorial, exemplification or certified copy thereof from the Department of the Interior of Canada, or an official thereof, or of the Government of Canada, and such memorial, exemplification or certified copy purporting to be so given shall in all cases be accepted and be of the same effect as if the patent itself had been produced or deposited, and the production of such memorial, exemplification or certified copy shall be prima facie evidence of its execution.\n\nCompare 49 Vic. cap. 35; sec. 21, as to certified copies of instruments which make proof in Court.\n\nThe latter part of this sub-section is declaratory as to what shall be evidence of a grant in proceedings under this Act, and would apply to proceedings in Court under any of its provisions as well as to making proof on the investigation of a title.\n\nFor the general provisions as to evidence of title refer to sec. 56.\n\nSee also secs. 37, 38 and 39 post.\n\"Indorsed.\" (20) The expression \"Indorsed\" shall mean and include anything written upon any instrument or other document or in the margin thereof, or at the foot thereof;\n\n\"Possession.\" (21) The expression \"Possession\" when applied to persons claiming title to land, signifies also alternatively the reception of the rents and the profits thereof;\n\nCompare secs. 65-67 post.\n\nEffect of describing a person. (22) The describing any person as proprietor, transferrer, transferree, mortgagor, mortgagee, encumbrancer, encumbrancee, lessor or lessee, or as trustee, or as seised of or having any estate, or interest in any land, shall be deemed to include the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of such persons;\n\nCompare with sec. 86, which prohibits the entry of any notice of \"trusts.\"\n\nSee also sec. 28 and secs. 113-117.\n\nCertificate to corporation to include successors. (23) Every certificate or other instrument issued to or made in favor of a corporation, aggregate or sole, shall be deemed to extend to and include the successors of such corporation;\n\n\"Old system.\" (24) The expression \"Old System\" shall mean the system of registration provided by Chapter Sixty of the Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba and amendments;\n\n\"New system.\" (25) The expression \"New System\" shall mean the system of registration provided by this Act;\n\nMeaning and effect of words. (26) And generally, unless the contrary shall appear from the context, every word importing the singular number only shall extend to several persons or things; and every word importing the plural number shall apply to one person or thing; and every word importing the male sex only shall extend to a female, and shall include a body corporate, and whenever a form in the schedule hereto is directed to be used, such direction shall apply equally to any form to the like effect, or which for the same purpose may be authorized under the provisions of this Act, and any variation from such forms, not being a variation in matter or substance, shall not affect their validity or regularity, but they may be used with such alterations as the character of the parties or the circumstances of the case may render necessary.\n\nThe Schedules are printed following the sections in which they are referred to. See sec. 25 post.\n\nSee notes to secs. 77 and 144 post as to the use of forms.\nThis clause does not prevent the application of the general interpretation clause, C. S. M. cap. 1, sec. 7, to this Act or to instruments executed under it; e.g., sub-clause 10 of the general interpretation clauses in the Consolidated Statutes has the words \"and the converse,\" which are here (in sub-clause 26), omitted. By Rule of Practice No. 1 (Sch. S. sec. 26 post), the provisions of the above Act are made applicable to the construction of those rules so far as applicable, and they would also apply in all cases where they are not incompatible with this section.\n\nLAND TITLES OFFICES\u2014DISTRICT REGISTRARS.\n\n1. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may constitute such portions of the Province of Manitoba as may seem proper into Land Titles districts. In each of such districts, at such place as the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may appoint, there shall be an office to be called The Land Titles Office for (insert here the name of the district.)\n\nSee sec. 19.\n\nOn 25th July, 1889, an Order-in-Council came into force constituting the County of Brandon a Land Titles District under this Act by the name of \"The Land Titles District for Brandon,\" with an office in the city of Brandon to be called \"The Land Titles Office for Brandon,\" and on 31st October, 1889, the municipality of North Cypress was added to the Brandon District.\n\nOn 1st August, 1889, an Order-in-Council came into force constituting \"The Land Titles District for Portage La Prairie which, comprised on that date only the County of Portage La Prairie, but to which, on 15th August, 1889, the County of Westbourne was added\u2014the office being at the town of Portage La Prairie and called \"The Land Titles Office for Portage La Prairie.\"\n\nSubsequent Orders-in-Council have provided:\n\n1. That on and after the 9th day of October, 1889, the County of Beautiful Plains should be added to the Land Titles District for Portage La Prairie.\n2. That on and after the 23rd day of October, 1889, the Counties of Minnedosa and Riding Mountain should be added to the Land Titles District for Portage La Prairie.\n\n3. That on and after the 31st day of October, 1889, the County of Fairford and the municipalities of North Norfolk, Belcourt and Woodlands should be added to the Land Titles District for Portage La Prairie.\n\n4. That on and after the 5th day of November, 1889, the County of Russell should be added to said Land Titles District for Portage La Prairie.\n\nOn 31st October the Land Titles Office for Winnipeg was constituted and the Land Titles District of Winnipeg erected composed of the County of Selkirk, the City of Winnipeg, and the municipalities of St. Francois Xavier, South Norfolk and South Cypress.\n\nAnother Order-in-Council will come into force on 14th January, 1890, establishing a Land Titles District, composed of the Counties of Dufferin and Rock Lake, with its office at Morden.\n\n5. For each of the said districts the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council shall appoint an officer to be called the District-Registrar. No person shall be appointed a District-Registrar unless he is a barrister or attorney in the courts of the Province of Manitoba.\n\n6. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may appoint such examiners of titles, clerks and other officers as may be deemed advisable for each district, and may also appoint one or more inspectors, who shall have such powers and duties under this Act as may be assigned to him or them by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council. All officers and other persons appointed under this Act shall hold office during the pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.\n\n7. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may appoint a person to act as the deputy of any officer appointed by or under this Act, and such deputy shall be entitled to act in that capacity during the absence or illness of such officer, or in case of the death of such officer, until a successor is appointed; and such deputy while so acting shall have all the powers of the officer for whom he may be acting. Provided that\nthe Deputy of any officer must have the qualifications provided for by this Act for such officer.\n\nCompare sec. 15 post.\n\n8. Every District-Registrar, before he enters upon the execution of his office, shall take the oath of office and give security to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, under the Act of this Legislature passed in the 46th and 47th years of Her Majesty's reign, chapter 7, and be subject to said Act.\n\nSee Amendments by 51 Vic. c. 9, and 52 Vic. c. 3, ss. 4, 5.\n\n9. Each District-Registrar shall have a seal of office approved by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.\n\nSee note to sec. 74 as to sealing of instruments being necessary to give them effective force.\n\n10. The present Registrar-General or his successor appointed under the Real Property Act of 1885, shall, when so directed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, cause to be furnished to each of the District Registrars, appointed under this Act, the original or copies of all registers or entries of any instruments in the present Land Titles Office at Winnipeg affecting any lands in the district of such District-Registrars respectively, of indexes of names, and of all other books and also of all the documents or instruments affecting the said lands which may be on file in said office, (a) and the District-Registrars shall keep the same in their respective offices, and deal with them as if they were made or registered under this Act. (b)\n\n(a) See sec. 35, post.\n\n(b) Lands registered under the Act of 1885 and amendments would, upon the formation of a new district, in which they were included, become subject to the provisions of this Act, although the certificate of title was issued under the Act of 1885.\n\nSee sec. 16 and notes in pede.\n\n11. At such times and in such manner as the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may direct, all books, records, documents, plans and other papers now in the possession of Registrars appointed under the provisions of Chapter sixty of the Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba for the registration divisions included in each of the said districts constituted under the provisions of Section four of this Act, shall be transferred from the Transfer of books, etc., from Registration offices to Land Titles offices.\npossession of such Registrars and from the Registry Offices in which they are now deposited to the building erected or provided for the Land Titles Office for such district.\n\n12. The copy of the Plans of Survey of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the copy of the Register Book of the Hudson's Bay Company, referred to in \"The Hudson's Bay Company Land Register Act,\" shall remain for safe keeping in the Land Titles Office, at Winnipeg, and shall hereafter be under the charge and control of the District-Registrar, as part of the official books and instruments of the Land Titles Office at Winnipeg.\n\nThe copy of plans of survey, if ever made under the Hudson Bay Co. Land Register Act, have been apparently mislaid and no properly authenticated copy appears to have ever been on file in the registry offices for Winnipeg or for the County of Selkirk as provided by the Act. The Hudson Bay Co. survey extended from Lake Winnipeg up the Red River from St. Peters, on the east side to lot 208, and on the west side to lot 53 of the parish of St. Norbert, both inclusively; and westward along the Assinniboine from its junction with the Red to near the western limit of the parish of St. Francois Xavier.\n\nThe holdings were surveyed in narrow strips having usually a frontage on the rivers and a depth of about two miles.\n\nThe copy of the register is on file in the Land Titles Office at Winnipeg. It purports to be a register of lands allotted, sold or leased by the Hudson Bay Co. on both sides of the Red River from Lake Winnipeg southwards to about lots 53 and 208, as shewn on Plans of the Dominion Government Survey of the Parish of St. Norbert, and on both sides of the Assinniboine River from its confluence with the Red to the western limit of the Parish of St. Francois Xavier.\n\nThe following extract from an official report to the Department of the Interior by the late Chief Justice Wood on a case submitted to him under the Dominion Land's\nAct, may prove interesting and of some use in determining the value, as evidence, of entries in the Hudson Bay Co. Register:\n\n\"The first objection to the claim of L. is that the sale and transfer by A. V. to B. L. is not evidenced by writing under the hand of A. V., and the transaction is therefore void, and voidable especially as against the vendor and assignee in good faith and without notice.\"\n\n\"To this I answer that in law the sale and transfer, though verbal, is good to pass the title of A. V. to B. L. in the lands, for it was accompanied by a change of possession, and of the position of the parties in respect of the lands to such an extent that equity would intervene and declare the contract though verbal, valid and binding, and would order its specific performance; and what may be done equity looks upon as having been done, and under the first and rational principle lying at the foundation of this procedure, I think in the present case I must look upon the verbal contract between A. V. and B. L. as completely executed and that the estate and interest of V. in the lands passed to L. as fully as if a formal deed had been executed between the parties.\"\n\n\"The second objection is that no entry of this sale or transfer was made in the Land Register of the Hudson Bay Co. under the number of this lot, in that Register 538; but that according to that Register A. V., at the time G. bought and took a transfer of the one chain in width part of lot 538, stood in the Register as the owner of the lot, and therefore, giving the proper effect to the entries in the Register, A. V. must be considered as at that time owning the lot, as having a disposing power over the same, especially in so far as purchasers in good faith and without notice are concerned.\"\n\n\"This entire proposition is a mistake in all its parts. The Register of the Hudson Bay Co. may be valuable as a source\nof evidence relating to the transactions in respect of lands in the Red River settlement, but it cannot be relied on as giving a claim of title to lands, much less as declaring who at any given time was the true owner of any lands. If it were assumed to have such force and effect, no man's lands in the Red River settlement would be safe. As to tracing ownership in connection with the history of actual possession it may be, and sometimes is of service, but the entries were so irregularly made, and with such brevity, and in such general terms, and so frequently omitted to be made altogether, that it is not over-stating the fact when I say that, as containing a connected history of the changes and transfer of land, it is wholly unreliable, and to give it any such effect or construction would work disastrous consequences to land owners in the Red River Settlement, and would prove a 'snare and a delusion.' Fortunately the Legislature has never given to that Register the effect and potency contended for in the foregoing objection, and in my judgment it would be a great mistake for it ever to do so, and until the Legislature imposes upon me that necessity, I shall not put such a construction upon the Land Register of the Hudson Bay Co.\"\n\n\"In the present case the Register shews P. V., a witness in this investigation, and brother to A. V., to be the first or original owner, a grantee of the H. B. Co., of lot 538, the same as lot 117 (St. Norbert), and A. V. as his assignee or grantee (see Ex. D.) Whether or not there were intermediate owners between the brothers, I know not, the form of expression in the evidence of P. V. is open to suspicion that there were intermediate owners; however, as that fact was and is immaterial in the present case, it is of no consequence, as both parties claim under A. V., who, for the purposes of this investigation, must be considered as having been the true owner, at least at the time he made the sale and transfer to B. L., and gave him possession in 1868,\"\nwhoever may have been the prior owners, and the evidence of P. V., not the Register, is conclusive of this fact.\"\n\n\"The misconception of the effect of entries in the Register as to priority of estate of assignees, and grantees and bargainees of lands, was probably the ground of G. taking the conveyance he did of the one chain in question, for he must be assumed to have had notice of the claim of B. L., who was at the time and long prior thereto in actual possession and occupancy\u2014living and dwelling with his family in the house and on the premises, which was an ever-speaking notice to all the world, and prima facie declaration that he was the owner of the lands, but who, notwithstanding this notice given by actual possession, took a conveyance from a person out of possession, relying no doubt upon the effect of the register of the H. B. Co. as securing him in the transaction. It has no such effect. Mr. G. must be taken to have purchased with notice of the estate and interest of B. L., who was in actual possession of the lands at the time of purchase, and such possession without actual notice, or even actual notice of possession, is in law held to be good and effectual notice (Holmes & Benny, 8 DeG. M. & G. 580). The same result would be reached were we to apply the well known maxim Qui prior est tempore, potior est jure.\"\n\n\"B. L.'s purchase and transfer, which, though by verbal contract was made effectual by his executing the same and going into actual possession and occupancy, was, in point of time, prior to that of G.; and, assuming that G. bought in good faith and without actual notice, constructive notice he certainly had; which in such a case as this is as effective as actual notice, and that the equities of the parties were equal, still the title of B. L. must prevail over that of G., for it is prior in point of time.\"\n\nAs to the manner in which these entries were usually made and the object for which the Register was designed see McKenny v. Spence, Man. Rep. Temp. Wood, 11.\n13. In each of said Districts, at the place appointed as provided in section four hereof, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may procure a site and cause a suitable fire-proof building to be erected thereon or may purchase or rent a building to be used as the Land Titles Office, and properly furnish the same. The money necessary to be expended in the purchase of sites and the erection and furnishing of such buildings shall be provided out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but the same shall be repaid by the municipalities included in such districts respectively to the Government, in ten equal annual instalments. Interest at the rate of five per centum per annum on all unpaid principal, to be calculated from a date after the completion of such building to be fixed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, shall be paid with each instalment. The proportion to be paid by each of such municipalities shall be determined by the Municipal Commissioner in the same manner that other taxes levied by the said Commissioner are determined. The Municipal Commissioner shall levy upon municipalities a rate sufficient to meet the payments required by this section, or to meet the rent if a building is rented.\n\n14. On and after the date named in the Order-in-Council provided for in section four hereof, all Registrars appointed under the provisions of said Chapter sixty, or acting under the provisions of said chapter for counties or other divisions, included in any such Land Titles District so constituted, and all deputies thereof, shall cease to act as such and thereafter shall be relieved from all their duties under said Act, and such office shall from and after the date so named be abolished, provided that nothing in this Act contained shall have the effect of relieving any such registrar or his sureties from liability for acts done up to such date.\n\nThe offices so far abolished are the Registry Office for the County of Brandon, from 25th July, 1889, the Registry Office for the County of Portage La Prairie, from 1st August, 1889, and the Westbourne Registry office, from 15th August, 1889; Beautiful Plains County Registry Office, from 9th October; Minnedosa and Riding Mountain United County office, from 23rd October, the Marquette, Selkirk, Winnipeg and Norfolk offices from 30th October, 1889, and the Russell office on 5th November, 1889. The Registry Offices for the County of Dufferin and Rock Lake will cease to exist on 14th January 1890.\n\n15. On and after the said date so named, all registrations under the provisions of said Chapter sixty shall be made with the District-Registrar\nat the said Lands Titles Office for each district, and the said District-Registrar shall have all the powers and duties of a Registrar as provided by said Chapter sixty and amendments. A Deputy of the District-Registrar may be appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to act as Deputy-Registrar under said chapter sixty without the qualifications provided by this Act for a District-Registrar.\n\nSee sec. 7, ante.\n\n16. All such books, records, documents, plans and other papers and all registrations made in the said registry office prior to such date so named, shall continue to have the same effect on and after the said date so named, as if this Act had not been passed.\n\nThe intention and meaning of this section appears to be that no restriction should be placed upon the effect of registrations and rights thereby acquired under the law as it existed at the time the instruments were placed on record. The effect of general liens or charges secured under former registrations in the county offices has not been enlarged or augmented through the transference of several divisions or parts of divisions heretofore constituted under the Lands Registration Act of Manitoba, to the same Land Titles District under the new system. The effect of registration under the old system does not extend to lands subject to the provisions of the former Real Property Acts, notwithstanding the repeal of the restraining clauses without consolidation and re-enactment in the present statute (vide 46 and 47 Vic. cap. 48, sec. 3. Note the word \"unrepealed\" in the last line but one of this section, is evidently intended to be \"repealed\"). Section 152 post provides for the validity of acts done and the enforcement of rights acquired and liabilities incurred under the repealed statutes. Rights once acquired have not been taken away by this repeal, neither have they been thereby augmented (Hitchcock v. Way, 6 A. and E. 947; Butcher v. Henderson, L. R. 3 Q. B. 335; Restall v. London, etc., L. R. 3 Ex. 141).\n\nFor similar reasons liens or charges could not affect such lands, which were only bound by registration as provided by the statutes which have been repealed.\nQuaere the effect of registration of, say, a certificate of judgment, during the investigation under an application.\n\n17. Except as herein otherwise provided the said District Registrars shall continue to act as registrars under said chapter sixty and amendments, and shall carry out the provisions of said chapter sixty and amendments.\n\nUnder this section the District Registrar has succeeded to the office of the \"Registrar,\" who merely ceased to act under sec. 14 ante, but whose duties are still to be performed under the dual system of registration prevailing in the Land Titles Office for the district in which the abolished registration division may have been situated.\n\nQuaere whether he should use the official seals of the old Registry offices, when authenticating official instruments under the Lands Registration Act of Manitoba.\n\n18. The Registrar-General and all other officers appointed under the provisions of the Real Property Act of 1885 and amendments, shall continue to act under said Act until a date to be named in an order-in-council, including the City of Winnipeg, passed under section four hereof, but, on and after such date so named such Registrar-General and other officers so appointed shall cease all their functions and such offices shall, on and after said date so named be abolished.\n\nSee note to sec. 2.\n\nThe Registrar General and other officers as well as the Land Titles Office, under the Act of 1885 were abolished on 30th October, 1889. See note to sec. 4.\n\n19. The said District Registrars, Clerks and officers shall commence their respective duties on the day named in the Orders-in-Council respectively, passed under the provisions of section four hereof.\n\nSee note to sec. 4.\n\n20. No District Registrar, Examiner of Titles, Officer or Clerk in any office under this Act shall, directly or indirectly, act as the agent of any corporation, society, company, person or persons investing money, and taking securities on real estate within his registration division; nor shall such District Registrar, Examiner of Titles, Officer or Clerk, advise, for\nany fee or reward, or otherwise, upon titles to land, or practice as a conveyancer, nor shall he carry on or transact within the office, any business or occupation whatever other than his duties under this Act; nor shall such District-Registrar, Examiner of Titles, Officer or Clerk, practice as a barrister, attorney or solicitor, upon pain of dismissal from office for any offence against this clause.\n\n21. All fees for services under this Act or in connection with it other Fees, than for such services as relate solely to the old system of registration and in no way relate to the new system, or the bringing of land under the new system, shall be settled by tariff made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, and no service shall be rendered by an official of a Land Titles Office until all such fees fixed by tariff for such service and fixed by this Act have been paid to the District-Registrar.\n\nThe following is the tariff of fees at present in force in the Land Titles Offices under the new system:\n\n**TARIFF OF FEES.**\n\n**MANITOBA LAND TITLES OFFICES.**\n\nFor each application when the applicant is the original grantee, and no transaction affecting the land, excepting mortgages or leases, has been registered ........................................ $1 00\n\nThe like when the title is of any other description, and the value exceeds $3,000 .................................................. 15 00\n\nThe like when the value exceeds $2,000, and does not exceed $3,000 10 00\n\nThe like when the value exceeds $1,500, and does not exceed $2,000 7 00\n\nThe like when the value exceeds $1,000, and does not exceed $1,500 5 00\n\nThe like when the value exceeds $500, and does not exceed $1,000 3 00\n\nThe like when the value does not exceed $500 ......................... 2 00\n\nFor every Certificate of Title issued under an application to bring lands under the Act, which application shall only comprise lands in the same registration division, and shall not, except as hereinafter provided, comprise more than one Crown Section or other sub-division, contiguous country lands not exceeding altogether 2,000 acres\u2014a road not to be considered a break in the-contiguity\u2014and any number of lots under the same plan of sub-division may be included in the same application, but in no case shall a Certificate of Title issue for more than fifty lots, according to any plan of subdivision.

Where lands applied to be brought under the operation of the new system are claimed by the applicant as or through the heir or devisee of a person deceased, the applicant shall produce letters of administration or copy of probate with his evidence of title.\n\n8. The \"Caveat Book\" shall be hereafter known as the \"Caveat Book and General Register,\" and in it shall be entered certificates of judgment and attachments which may be filed in the Land Titles Office, as well as caveats and mechanics' liens.\n\nSee secs. 63 (e), 130 and 131.\n\n9. The District-Registrar shall keep a book or books, to be called \"The Register,\" and shall bind up therein duplicates of all certificates of titles to be issued as hereinafter provided for; and each certificate of title shall constitute a separate folium of such book, and the District-Registrar shall record therein the particulars of all instruments, dealings and other matters by this Act required to be registered or entered in the Register and affecting the land included under each certificate of title.\n\nCompare secs. 44, 58, 60, 68 (7), 74 and 130 (7) post, and Rules 10, 13, 14, 16 and 18 post.\n\n10. The District-Registrar shall also keep a book or books to be called \"The Day Book,\" in which shall be entered, by a short description, every instrument which is registered with the day, hour and minute of filing; and for the purpose of priority between mortgagees, transferees and others, the time of filing shall be taken as the time of registration. The District-Registrar in entering memorials upon the certificates of titles embodied in the Register, and endorsing a memorial upon an\nRULES OF PRACTICE.\n\ninstrument to be issued, shall take the time from the Day Book as the time of registration.\n\nSee secs. 74, 76 and 78.\n\nPlans.\n\n11. The District-Registrar shall keep a plan book, and all reference to plans shall be made by plan number and not by registration number.\n\nSee Secs. 68 (8), 69 and 70.\n\nDuplicate of plan.\n\n12. At the time of the deposit of any plan of subdivision of lands as a town plot, a duplicate of such plan, signed and certified in the same manner as the original is required to be signed and certified, shall be deposited therewith, and such duplicate plan so deposited shall be kept for use of the public making searches and for reference in the Land Titles Office.\n\nSee Schedule T, sec. 69.\n\nMemorial of charge to be endorsed on certificate.\n\n13. The District-Registrar shall endorse upon the certificate of title a memorial of every mortgage, encumbrance, lease, rent charge, term of years, or other dealing affecting the land, and such memorial shall be endorsed upon the duplicate in the possession of the owner, if any, as well as upon the duplicate which is in the Register.\n\nSee Sec. 76.\n\nWhat memorial in Register to state.\n\n14. Every memorial entered in the Register shall state the nature of the instrument to which it relates, the day, hour and minute of the presentation, of such instrument for registration, and the names of the parties thereto, and shall refer by number or symbol to such instrument, and shall be signed by the District-Registrar.\n\nSee Sec. 76.\n\nOwner to state address.\n\n15. Every registered owner of any land or interest therein and every applicant to bring land under the new system, shall deliver to the District-Registrar a memorandum in writing of some post-office address (within the Province of Manitoba), to which it shall be sufficient to mail all notices that, under this Act, may be required to be sent to such registered proprietor, and every registered proprietor or transferee of any registered interest shall, if required by the District-Registrar so to do, before the delivery of any certificate of title, sign a receipt therefor in his own hand-writing, or otherwise furnish the District-Registrar with his signature, so as to prevent fraud as far as possible.\n\nSee Rule 18 and secs. 40, 74, 98, 103, 106, 130 (1) (4), and 143 post.\nRULES OF PRACTICE.\n\n16. Every registration of ownership shall be made on a separate folium of the Register, and upon any transfer of ownership the register of the transferrer's title shall be cancelled, and the title of the transferee shall thereupon be entered upon a new folium; and the District-Registrar shall note upon the Register of the title of the transferrer the number of the register of the transferee's title, and upon that of the transferee the number of register of the transferrer, so that reference can be readily made from one to the other as occasion may require.\n\nSee Secs. 74-76, 113, 117 and 123.\n\n17. No instrument of a nature to require cancellation of a certificate of title or an endorsement to be made thereon shall be received and registered in the Land Titles Office, nor any entry thereof made in the books of said office, until the duplicate certificate of title to the lands thereby affected is produced for endorsement or cancellation, as the case may be; unless the production thereof be dispensed with by the District-Registrar under the provisions of the Act.\n\nSee Secs. 73-107, 113-117 and 123, Rules 5, 7 and 8, Sch. R. sec. 130.\n\n18. All transfers, mortgages and instruments to be registered in the Land Titles Office should show the names, residence and additions of the parties thereto.\n\nSee Rule 15 ante.\n\n19. Transfer and mortgage shall be accompanied by a certificate from the proper officers of the municipality wherein the property is situate that the land has not been sold for taxes, and is not then advertised for sale on account of arrears of taxes.\n\nThe word \"every\" has evidently been accidentally omitted at the beginning of this rule.\n\nSee Man. Municipal Act 1886, sec. 639, as amended by 50 Vic. cap. 10, sec. 45.\n\n20. Every District-Registrar shall, when required, and upon the payment of the legal fees, furnish, attested by the seal of his office, exemplifications and certified copies of any instruments affecting land which may be deposited, filed, kept or registered in his office, and such exemplification or certified copy shall, provided it is such an instrument as may affect land in his district, be received, registered or filed, as the case may require, by any other District-Registrar in the same manner.\nRULES OF PRACTICE.\n\nand with the same effect as if the original was produced, without proof of the signature of such District-Registrar.\n\nSee sec. 147 post.\n\n21. Upon the application of any owner or of any person entitled to become an owner of lands held under separate certificates of title, or under one certificate of title, and the delivering up of such certificate or certificates of title, it shall be lawful for the District-Registrar to issue to such proprietor a single certificate of title of the whole of such lands or several certificates each containing a portion of such land, or a certificate of a portion of the land included in any such certificate of title, in accordance with such application and as far as the same may be done consistently with any regulation for the time being in force respecting the parcels of land that may be included in one certificate of title; and upon issuing any such certificate of title, the District-Registrar shall enter on the new certificate of title all the memorials to which the piece of land is at the time subject, and shall cancel, either wholly or partially, pursuant to such application, the previous certificate of title of such land so delivered up, and shall endorse thereupon a memorandum setting forth the occasion of such cancellation and referring to the certificate of title so issued.\n\n22. The District-Registrar, upon cancelling any certificate of title, either wholly or partially, pursuant to any transfer, shall make out to the transferee a certificate of title to the land mentioned in such memorandum of transfer, and every such certificate of title shall refer, if practicable, to the instrument of transfer, and the District-Registrar shall retain every memorandum of transfer, and cancelled certificate of title, and in the case of a partially cancelled certificate of title shall return the duplicate to the grantor after the memorandum partially cancelling the same has been entered thereupon, or may, whenever required thereto by the owner of an unsold portion of land included in any such partially cancelled certificate of title, or where such a course may appear more expedient, retain such partially cancelled certificate and make out to such owner a certificate of title for such portion or any part thereof, of which he remains the owner.\n\n23. In the computation of time, unless otherwise specially mentioned, the same shall be reckoned exclusively of the day from which the computation is made, but inclusively of the day on which the Act or proceeding under these rules or under any notice given under the provisions of the \"Real Property Act of 1889,\" is to be done or taken.\n\n(a) Where notice of service is required to be made, a certain number of days before the day on which something is to be done, whether the words \"at least\" are used or not, the day of service or of giving notice\nRULES OF PRACTICE.\n\nshall be computed as one of such days, but the day on which such thing is to be done shall be excluded from the computation.\n\n24. In all matters and proceedings in a Land Titles Office, in so far as equitable principles can consistently be done, equitable principles and rules, as established by courts of equity, may be invoked, acted upon and applied.\n\n25. A search for caveats, executions, and judgments shall be considered Searches. and charged as one search; but searches in the archives for other documents shall be considered and charged as a separate search for every such document.\n\nMemo.-search fees are not now charged when registrations are made.\n\n26. On the filing of a Precipe and evidence to the satisfaction of the District-Registrar that any certificate of judgment has not been renewed or re-registered in the manner provided by law, he may enter a memorial releasing the lands of the judgment debtor therefrom, and thereafter such judgment shall be deemed to have ceased to be binding or a lien upon such lands.\n\n27. On proof to the satisfaction of the District-Registrar that proceedings to enforce a mechanic's lien have not been instituted within the time limited by the Acts respecting mechanic's liens, he may enter a memorial releasing the lands affected thereby, and thereafter such lien shall be deemed to have ceased to be binding or a charge upon said lands.\n\n28. When a certificate of title shall have been endorsed with memorials to such an extent as to interfere with its legibility, the District-Registrar may require it to be delivered up for cancellation as by request and issue a new certificate of title in lieu thereof, having entered thereon all the memorials to which the land affected thereby are then subject, and enter the cancellation of the former certificate by memorial setting forth the occasion of its cancellation and referring to the new certificate of title so issued.\n\n29. No certificate of title shall be signed during the hours the Land Titles Office is open for registration, and a final search shall be made before signing such certificate and after the closing of the office for registration purposes.\n\nSee secs. 60 and 61 post.\nAMENDMENT OF LAW RESPECTING LANDS.\n\n27. Land in the Province shall go to the personal representative of deceased owners thereof in the same manner as personal estate goes.\n\nSee secs. 29, 33 and 34 post.\n\nWhen the first Real Property Act was passed in 1885, the 21st section provided that: \"After the commencement of this Act (i.e. 1st July, 1885) all lands in the Province of Manitoba which, by the common law, are regarded as real estate, shall be held to be chattels real, and shall go to the executor or administrator of any person or persons dying, seized or possessed thereof, as other personal estate now passes to the personal representatives.\"\n\nThe meaning of this section was very difficult to arrive at, and it seemed doubtful to many whether real property had been divested of its character as \"realty,\" and converted into \"chattels real;\" here again appeared another incongruity, for the definition given in the interpretation clauses to the word \"lands\" could hardly be reconciled in every case with the apparent intention of this section, and the peculiar distinction made as to those rights and interests in land which, by the common law, were regarded as real estate. In re Irish, 2 M. L. R 361, it was held that lands became chattels real for the purpose of devolution, but were not subject to seizure under fit fa de bonis.\n\nAgain, it was asked did this change affect the \"seizin\" of lands? did it affect those facilities furnished for the conveyance of lands under the operation of the Statute of Uses? And what about the Statute of Mortmain?\n\nThese questions may possibly require to be decided in cases which may have been affected by the peculiar provisions of the Act which remained in force from 1st July, 1885, to 28th May, 1886, when the words \"shall be held to be chattels real\" were struck out. (See 49 Vic. c. 28 sec. 5).\nWith this alteration the old section remained in force, and where a mortgagor died intestate and his administrators \"released the equity of redemption to the mortgagee before the lands had been registered under the Act, it was held (Taylor, C.J., Re Lewis, 5 Man. L. R. 44) that the administrator had no power to release the equity of redemption, because the property had not theretofore been brought under the provisions of the Act. At the time of the first amendment the word \"other\" was left standing, and thus added further difficulty in arriving at a conclusion as to what the section intended. Section 28 of the Act of 1885, which was amended by 51 Vic. cap. 21, sec. 1, exempted certain lands from the operation of the statute, while it forbid dealings with other lands except under its provisions. The lands affected in the case lastly cited were of the exempted class, and this fact may have influenced the decision.\n\nIn an unreported case, Fleming v. Howard (1888), Mr. Justice Killam held that an administrator did not become seized of an equity of redemption of a deceased mortgagor, as the statute only affected property known to the common law as real estate.\n\nBy 51 Vic. cap. 22, sec. 3, which came into force on 18th May, 1888, and was in turn amended by 52 Vic. c. 4, secs. 1-4, the clause was altered to its present shape, and applies to all lands in Manitoba.\n\n28. Hereafter no words of limitation shall be necessary in any conveyance of any land in order to convey all or any title therein, but every deed or instrument conveying land shall operate as an absolute conveyance of all such right and title as the grantor has therein at the time of its execution, unless a contrary intention be expressed in such conveyance; but nothing herein contained shall preclude any conveyance from operating by way of estoppel; and hereafter the introduction of any words of limitation into any conveyance or devise of any land shall have the like force and meaning as the same words of limitation would have if used by way of limitation of any personal estate, and no other.\nThe Victorian Land Transfer Statute, (sec. 65) requires words of inheritance or succession to be implied.\n\nSee secs. 33, 34 and 144 post.\n\nThis section applies to all lands in the Province.\n\nCompare secs. 22, 27 and 138 of the Act of 1885; and secs. 6 and 12 of the Territorial Act, post; also sec. 8 (22) and (23) ante; and 45 Vic. cap. 2. sec. 24.\n\nThere has been as yet no decision as to the interpretation of this clause; it would seem to have reference solely to the forms provided by the R. P. Act, notwithstanding the very general wording of section 33 post, for it can hardly be said that the Legislature intended a greater estate to be conveyed than was actually contemplated by the vendor. For instance, were it intended to transfer a life estate in lands under the operation of the R. P. Act, the intention must be specially expressed in the instrument by which the transfer is to be effected; but if lands are subject to the \"old system\" of registration it is submitted that, in the absence of words of limitation, only a life estate would pass, for the omission of the necessary words of limitation to effect a conveyance in fee, would, of itself, be an expression of contrary intention on the part of the grantor.\n\n29. No devise shall be valid or effectual as against the personal representative of the testator until the land affected thereby is conveyed to the devisee thereof by the personal representative of the deviser, saving and excepting such devises as are made by the testator to his personal representative, either in his representative capacity or for his own use.\n\nSee sec. 27 ante and secs. 33 and 34 post.\n\nThis section applies to all lands in Manitoba.\n\nVide secs. 113-117 as to the transmission of estates. The personal representative must cause himself to be registered as owner before he can transfer the lands.\n\nAs to duty payable on transmission see sec. 140 post.\nThe executor must prove the will in the Surrogate Court before dealing with the property, *Re Bannerman*, 2 Man. L. R. 377. Any personal representative must be registered as owner before dealing with the lands, *Re Lewis*, Man. L. R. 48. In case of intestacy the administrator is in the same position as the executor under a will.\n\nBy this alteration in the law relating to the devolution of estates, it will in every case happen that between the time of the death of the owner and the proving of the will or grant of administration there will be a period during which there would be no one seized of the lands, and no person having authority to deal with them. The remedies of creditors and adverse claimants would remain the same, and could be exercised without interruption; (*Vide* secs. 68 (e), 123 and 129 post), except in some cases where the action might require to be brought against the personal representative.\n\nSpecial provision is made (sec. 134 post) for compensation to persons deprived of lands registered under this Act. But it may be doubted whether damages could be recovered in case possession was lost by an adverse occupant entering during the vacant period and holding it until a statutory title was acquired. See 46 & 47 Vic. cap. 26, sec. 5 (2).\n\n**30:** No widow, whose husband died on or after the first day of July, A.D. 1885, or hereafter dies shall be entitled to dower in the real property of her deceased husband, but shall have the same right in such real property as if it were personal property.\n\n*Vide* secs. 33 and 34 post.\n\nThis section applies to all lands in Manitoba.\n\nCompare former Acts, 34 Vic. cap. 2, sec. 38, cap. 6, secs. 2, 3 and 11; and cap. 8; 38 Vic. (1874) cap. 12, sec. 1; and cap. 18; C. S. M. cap. 46; 48 Vic. cap. 28, sec. 24.\n\nPrior to the 15th July, 1870, there do not appear to have been any estates of inheritance in possession in Manitoba.\nAt least in the writer's experience, which has been considerable, he has not seen or heard of any evidence to justify the conclusion that prior to that date any of the Selkirk settlers were seized of heritable estates in land, and in the absence of such seisin no widow would be entitled to dower at common law.\n\nUp to the coming into force of cap. 12 of 38th Vic. on the 22nd July, 1874, rights of dower were governed by the laws of England as they existed at the time of the passing of 1 & 2, Geo. IV. cap. 66. The Intestacy Act of 1871, dealt only with such lands as the husband had not disposed of in his lifetime or by will, the eleventh section guarding the widow's right of dower in other lands. By the enactment of the Queen's Bench Act, cap. 12 of 38 Vic., the laws relating to dower in England as amended by 3 & 4, Will. IV. c. 105, were to govern in determining matters relative to property and civil rights in Manitoba.\n\nAt the time the Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba came into force, sec. 11 of 34 Vic. cap. 6, became repealed. It had really become effete so far as the widow was concerned as after 22nd July, 1874, the dower of women married since 1st January, 1834, was completely within the power of their husbands in case they thought fit to dispose of their lands absolutely during their lives or by will; and in case of intestacy, the widow being an heir would have her right to dower satisfied by the inheritance of at least an equal portion in fee simple.\n\nAbolition of tenancy by courtesy.\n\n31. No husband, whose wife died on or after the first day of July, A.D. 1885, or hereafter dies shall be entitled to any estate by the curtesy in the real estate of his deceased wife, but shall have the same right in such real estate as a wife has in the personal estate of her deceased husband.\n\nVide secs. 33 and 34 post.\n\nThis section applies to all lands in Manitoba.\nCompare former Acts. 34 Vic. cap. 6, sec. 11; 88 Vic. (1875) cap. 25; secs. 4 and 13; C. S. M. cap. 65, sec. 16; 44 Vic. cap. 11, sec. 73.\n\n32. A man may make a valid conveyance or transfer of his real estate to his wife, and a woman may make a valid conveyance or transfer of her real estate to her husband, without in either case the intervention of a trustee.\n\nThese sections, 27 to 32, apply to all lands in Manitoba, whether brought under the operation of the \"new system\" or still remaining subject to the \"old system\" of registration:\n\nVide secs. 33 and 34 post.\n\n33. It is hereby declared that sections twenty-seven to thirty-two, both inclusive, were intended to extend, and the provisions of said sections shall be held to have extended from and after the first day of July, A.D. 1885, and shall hereafter extend to all land in the Province of Manitoba and to every estate and interest therein.\n\nSee sec. 34 infra.\n\nThis section was added by 51 Vic. cap. 22 sec. 3 to remove doubts as to the construction of Part III of the Real Property Act of 1885, and a further amendment was made by 52 Vic. cap. 4, sec. 2. A similar clause was enacted applicable to the Territorial Act, secs. 5-17, by 51 Vic. Can. cap. 20, sec. 4.\n\nThe clauses of the Act of 1885 abolishing estates tail are omitted in this Act.\n\nIn re Lewis, 5 M. L. R. 44, it was held by Taylor, C.J., that under the 21st section of the Act of 1885, as amended by 49 Vic. cap. 28 sec. 5, the administrator of a mortgagor who died in 1886, could not convey the mortgaged lands, as they were not registered under the Act at the time of the death of the mortgagor, and consequently did not vest in his personal representative.\n\n34. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act all conveyances and leases made by the heir or heirs of any deceased owner of lands, or any estate or interest therein, and all proceedings taken by way of foreclosure or sale or notice of sale under mortgage or by way of adminis-\ntration or partition in Equity by or against heirs of any such deceased owner before the fourth day of September, A.D. 1888, shall be good and valid, and shall be as effectual to pass the title to such lands as if such conveyances and releases had been executed or such proceedings taken by or against the personal representatives of such deceased owner, and all such proceedings so begun may be continued and carried to a conclusion with the same effect in all respects as to title and otherwise as if they had been taken by or against such personal representative.\n\nThis provision became necessary owing to want of uniformity in the interpretation of the clauses of Part III, secs. 21-27 of the Act of 1885, and the Legislature having declared (sec. 33) the true intention to be different from the construction placed by the Courts and by the bar, upon these sections, taken with section 28 of the Act of 1885.\n\nA volume might easily be written on sections 27-34, composing, with a few changes, Part III of the Act of 1885. They have already caused much confusion and no doubt will continue to lead to difficulties of construction, as they form part of a statute to which they are by no means essential, and give rise to complications where simplicity was aimed at. When such changes in the general laws relating to real estate were deemed advisable, it would have cleared the present Act respecting registration of the greatest difficulty that has presented itself in its practical operation, had they been made the subject of a separate Act.\n\nManner of Bringing Lands Under New System.\n\n35. Until the abolition of the present Land Titles Office at Winnipeg as provided by Section eighteen hereof, applications to bring lands under the new system may be received by the Registrar-General affecting lands in any part of the Province (a), but after such abolition, no District-Registrar shall receive any application affecting any lands not situate in the Land Titles District for which he acts. (b) In case before such abolition any portion of the Province is constituted Land Titles District under Section four hereof then all applications to bring lands situate in such District under the new system shall be made to the District-Registrar for such district. (c)\n(a) By sec. 18 ante the Registrar General was directed to act under the Real Property Act of 1885, and amendments, until such abolition.\n\n(b) Sec. 10 ante provides that instruments, etc., affecting lands in the new lands titles districts, shall, when transmitted, be kept and dealt with as if they had been made or registered under this Act.\n\n(c) See notes to sec. 4 ante as to districts and dates when constituted.\n\n36. After such abolition as aforesaid all lands under the new system or for which an application to bring under the new system has been made in the Land Titles Office at Winnipeg shall continue to be dealt with by the Land Titles Office of which the City of Winnipeg forms a new district, except where such lands are at any time included in any other Land Titles District.\n\nSee notes to sec. 14 ante.\n\n37. The District-Registrar shall not, except as hereinafter provided, bring under the new system any lands for which the patent from the Crown has not been granted. This section shall only apply to such lands as require to be originally granted by patent from the Crown.\n\nSee secs. 38 and 39. Compare re Irish, 2 M. L. R. 361, as to lands unpatented.\n\nThis section would not apply to the regular sections granted to the Hudson Bay Co. under sec. 22 of the Dominion Lands Act, nor to the lands surrounding the Company's Forts, nor to the lands of settlers reserved at the time Rupert's Land was transferred to Canada. Nor would it apply to the lands or interests mentioned in the first four sub-sections of the 32nd section of 33 Vic. Can., cap. 3, commonly called the \"Manitoba Act,\" and validated by Imperial Act 34-35 Vic., cap. 28. Nor would this section apply in cases where lands have vested in virtue of a statute, as for instance some of the lands granted as bonus to the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nSwamp lands acquired by the Provincial Government under the terms of agreement with the Dominion, and those held by the Province under any other title would require to be granted by letters patent before any registration could be made.\n\n38. In the case where the patent for a homestead has been issued the District-Registrar may upon receiving a certificate from the proper officer of the Department of the Interior that all sums of money due the Dominion Government for the pre-emption connected with such homestead have been paid and that the patent therefor will issue to such homesteader grant a certificate of title before the issue of the patent therefor.\n\nThe Minister, his deputy, or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior would be proper officers from whom such a certificate might be received and acted upon in case of Dominion lands, and the certificate should definitely state the lands and the name of the \"homesteader\" in whose name the Crown grant shall issue, as well as the fact that the pre-emption has been fully paid for.

Railway Co. of Canada* and *The Commercial Colonization Co. of Manitoba*, that the last named Company being a corporation organized under \"The Companies Acts 1862 to 1886\" in England, could not be registered as owner of lands in Manitoba, until a license to hold lands was obtained from the Provincial Secretary under 46 & 47 Vic., cap. 38. See 49 Vic., cap. 11, sec. 4. In *re \"The E. & C. Gurney Co.\"* of Hamilton, Ont., the same rule was followed in *re Massey Mfg. Co.* (in 1888) it was held that a Company incorporated under the Dominion Statute as a trading corporation, could hold lands for the purposes of its business within the Province and obtain a Certificate of Title as owner thereof.\n\nA mortgagee under the old system may apply for the registration of his estate as mortgagee, *(vide sec. 59 post)* subject to the equity of redemption, and the effect of such application is to remove the lands from the operation of the old system, notwithstanding that the equitable estate remains in the mortgagor; this would happen whether or not default had been made in the payment of the mortgage moneys, and it would be discretionary with the District Registrar whether the mortgagor should be made a party to the application, or be notified of the fact that application had been made to bring the lands under the new system, or he might require the certificate to be issued to him subject to the mortgage. Where the mortgagor applies and has the land brought under the Act, the rights of the mortgagee are not affected, but if the land is sold under power of sale it must be transferred by an instrument substantially in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n\nAlthough several certificates of title may issue respecting the same land, each for an interest of a separate nature, no\nconfusion need arise, for each certificate should specify the exact nature of the interest in the lands of which each individual proprietor is registered as owner, and each of such certificates ought to shew upon its face the nature of the outstanding interests to which other persons are entitled amounting to a charge upon the estate or interest certified to be in the registered owner.\n\nThe following memoranda, based on \"advice to applicants,\" by the Commissioner of Titles at Melbourne, afford plain and simple instructions rendering it easier for applicants to avail themselves of the advantages conferred by the Statute, and in ordinary cases to take proceedings in person and supply the information necessary to obtain a certificate of title under the provisions of the Act:\n\n1. The applicant may obtain at the Land Titles Office or from any law stationer a \"Form of Application,\" and after perusing it and the marginal notes, fill up the blanks carefully and in a legible manner.\n\n2. Any number of contiguous pieces of land in the same district may be included in one application, subject to the regulations as to consolidation (Rule 6, Sch. S, sec. 26, ante), but when the title is passed, if separate certificates are to be required, it is proper to value separately every parcel for which a separate certificate is to issue, as fees are payable on each additional Certificate of Title.\n\n3. An owner who has sub-divided land, and in whom are vested the sites of any roads or ways not clearly and notoriously dedicated to the public use, should include such sites in his application. He will then be in a position to grant rights of user to future purchasers.\n\n4. If the application is made by the agent of a corporation, or by the guardian of an infant, or by the committee of the estate of a lunatic, such alterations may be made in\nthe form as the character of the parties or the circumstances of the case may render necessary.\n\n5. Where plans of subdivision are referred to, it is well to obtain and file the plan or a copy of it with the application, and to refer to it in the schedule of documents.\n\n6. Applicants need not, in the first instance, be at the trouble or expense of ascertaining whether any registered charges or liens affect the property. After the application and papers have been lodged at the Land Titles Office proper searches will be made by the officers, and if any such incumbrance be found, the necessary consent, satisfaction or discharge can be afterwards obtained.\n\n7. No abstract of title need be filed. The abstract books are themselves consulted, and the deeds perused according to the custom of ancient conveyancers. The applicant merely pays the fee on application and files it, duly signed, verified and attested, with the documents of title specified in the schedule; and should take the precaution of obtaining a receipt for the latter, which will be supplied by the District Registrar on request.\n\n8. Lands for which an application has been made may be dealt with before the certificate of title has issued, and when granted the Certificate is made to meet the intervening circumstances. Mortgages for instance may be filed as provided by section 95 post, if the applicant desires to raise money on the land after lodging his application.\n\n9. The applicant can obtain one certificate of title representing the whole land (subject to Rule 6, Sch. S., sec. 26 ante,) or any number of certificates representing different portions of it, as the title to each portion is completed; and either in his own name, or in the name of such persons as he may appoint. See notes to sec. 45 post.\n41. The father, or if the father be dead, the mother or other guardian of any infant, or the committee or guardian of any lunatic or person of unsound mind, may apply to bring lands under this Act on behalf of such infant, lunatic or person of unsound mind, and a person holding a power of attorney authorizing the sale of a freehold or other estate in any land may apply in respect of such lands in the name and on behalf of the proprietor, unless such power of attorney expressly prohibits him from doing so.\n\nSee sec. 59 as to special mention of the infant's age or nature of disability to be made in the certificate of title.\n\nSee secs. 110-112 as to Powers of Attorney.\n\n42. Upon the filing of such application, such lands shall become subject to the new system, and no registrations under the old system shall be made as to such lands unless such application is withdrawn or rejected by the District Registrar, in either of which events the lands shall be dealt with under the old system.\n\nUnder the former Act (sec. 43 of 1885, as amended by 50 Vic., cap. 11, secs. 12 and 13, and 51 Vic., cap. 22, sec. 12) the registration of a certificate of filing of the application was necessary to close the local registry office against the registration of instruments or plans specifically affecting the lands applied for; and registrations in the general register were deprived of any binding effect upon such lands. Now, under the dual system introduced by the present Act, no such certificate of filing appears to be necessary; none has been provided for. Still it is evident that upon receiving an application the District Registrar ought in some manner to note on the abstract the fact of such application having been made, otherwise nothing but actual notice of application could affect a person dealing with the lands under the old system. Upon withdrawal or rejection also, some memorial to mark the altered condition of the title ought to be noted upon the abstract, before the registration of any transactions under the old system.\nIt is doubtful whether registrations in the general register under the old system made during the time \"withdrawn\" or \"rejected\" lands remained subject to the \"new system,\" would bind them without loss of priority after they have returned to the operation of the \"old system.\" The amendment to the Administration of Justice Act by 51 Vic., cap. 29, sec. 38, does not provide for the registration of certificates under the \"new system\" until the lands have been brought under its operation.\n\nAfter application no dealings can be registered in the register of deeds, but sembl\u00e9 statutory conveyances may be treated as substantially in conformity with the provisions of the Act. *Re Irish*, 2 M. L. R. 361. As to such deeds after the Certificate of Title has issued, see sec. 77 post.\n\n**43.** Thereupon it shall be the duty of the District-Registrar, forthwith to cause to be examined all titles which may be submitted to him, and to deliver to the applicant a written memorandum of all defects which on such examination may be found in the title, and which he thinks should be removed.\n\nSee Rules 3, 5, 7, 15. Sch. S, sec. 26 ante, and sec. 52 post.\n\n**44.** On the removal of such defects, or if none shall exist, the District-Registrar shall require the applicant to give such notices as he may think should be given and on being satisfied of the applicant's title and of the due service of all notices that he may think requisite, shall proceed to bring such lands under the provisions of the new system, and to issue the certificate of title therefor to the person who appears to be entitled to the same.\n\nFor form certificate of title see Schedule A, sec. 60 post.\n\nSee Rules 3-7, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante; and sec. 52 post.\n\nThe applicant must make out at least a safe-holding title; and it has been the practice of the Land Titles Office, as it was established under the Act of 1885, to admit the registration of any title when it was unexceptional in equity,\nand outstanding legal estates and interests were not allowed to interfere with its admission to the Register, as the provisions of the Statute respecting notice and the lodging of caveats permitted an extended application of the equitable doctrine of acquiescence in the administration of the Act.\n\nA substantially good title, regardless of technicalities, is all that is required to have land brought under the Statute. Nothing more is necessary in any case than any solicitor or conveyancer ought to require in duty to his client, and in many cases less is required, as safe-holding titles can be passed and an absolutely marketable title does not need to be made out to obtain a certificate. On the other hand, as the Province becomes an insurer against adverse claims, care has to be exercised in the examination of the title, and if a purchaser has bought a piece of land, voluntarily incurring the risk of taking a defective title by submitting to conditions which prevent objections being taken, he ought not to expect the public to adopt his bargain without due investigation.\n\nAn applicant who considers that the production of any plan or document, or the service of any notice, is unnecessarily required by any of the Examiners of Title, can bring the matter before the District Registrar by way of appeal, and his decision, if unsatisfactory, may be again appealed from to a Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench in a summary manner as provided by section 118 post.\n\n45. Any person applying to bring lands under the new system may in Direction his application, or upon special request in writing addressed to the District-Registrar prior to the drafting of the certificate of title, direct the other than certificate of title for such land, or any part thereof, to be issued in the name of some other person, and such direction as aforesaid whether comprised in an application or in a special request, shall from the time of its filing with the District-Registrar, have the effect of conveying and transferring to such person as regards such land, all interest, whether legal or equitable, which the applicant is applying to have registered under the said new system as fully and effectually as if.\nsuch estate were transferred by deed. (a) The signature to such application or request must be verified by the affidavit of the subscribing witness in the manner provided under the old system. (b) This section shall be considered to have been in full force and effect since the first day of July, A.D. 1885. (c)\n\n(a) This statutory conveyance is not accompanied by any covenants, and would amount to a quit claim deed from the applicant to the directee. See secs. 46 and 48 as to the effect of such direction in cases withdrawn or rejected. The operation of the conveyance is suspended until the filing of the written instrument, whether application or request, in the Land Titles Office. It is only the applicant who has power to convey in this manner, the directee is not authorized to execute a subsequent direction in favor of another person with a similar effect under the Statute.\n\nIt might be in the discretion of the District Registrar under sec. 44 supra to require notices to be served on persons beneficially interested, where such a direction is made by an applicant who holds in a fiduciary capacity.\n\n(b) See Rule 4, sch. S, Sec. 26, and forms given after notes to sec. 40 ante.\n\n(c) The retroactive effect is given to cover cases prior to 50 Vict. c. 11, sec. 11.\n\nA direction, to be acted on, must be lodged before the certificate of title is drafted, as from the time the certificate has reached the \"Engrossing Room\" directions must be disregarded. In re Paterson it was held by the Registrar-General (March, 1888) that a direction vested in the directee only what estate the applicant had at the time of the filing of the direction, and that an unregistered mortgage previously executed had priority as against the conveyance by direction.\n\nOn a sale of land the following practice may be adopted:\n1. If all the purchase money has been paid, the vendor may become the applicant and direct the certificate of title to issue to the purchaser, or to the purchaser as to the part of the land sold, and to himself (the vendor) as to the residue.\n\n2. If the purchase money has not all been paid, and the vendor is willing to give, and the purchaser to accept, a title subject to a lien or charge for the unpaid purchase money, the vendor may become the applicant and direct the certificate of title to issue in the name of the purchaser \"subject to a charge on the land in favor of (insert vendor's names and additions) for dollars, the amount of purchase money for the said land now remaining unpaid with interest thereon, etc., etc.\" But in such a case the vendor could only enforce his rights by a suit in Court in case of default. Under such circumstances the vendor might apply to have the certificate registered in his own name subject to the agreement for sale filed as a charge upon his title, and subsequently execute a transfer under the Act, which would operate as a merger of the agreement.\n\n3. An intending purchaser may agree to buy the land at a certain price conditionally upon the vendor obtaining a certificate of title under the Statute clear of encumbrances, within a certain specified time; and when the title is approved by the Examiner of Titles a direction may be filed vesting the property in the purchaser. The certificate of title will then issue directly to him.\n\nThis system of Directions will be found useful in effecting partitions of property held between different owners. They should apply together to bring the whole land under the Statute, and direct the certificate of title to issue as to one particular part to one of the applicants exclusively, and so on with the other parts, and thus the expense of manifolded partition deeds may be avoided.\n46. An applicant may withdraw his application as to the whole or any part of the lands comprised therein at any time prior to the registration of the certificate of title, (a) but in case the certificate is directed by the applicant to issue in the name of some other person, the applicant shall not be allowed to withdraw his application until he produce the written consent duly verified of such person to such withdrawal; (b) and the District-Registrar shall in such cases, as well as in cases wherein he shall reject the application, return to the applicant, or to the person appearing to him to be entitled thereto, all evidence of title lodged in support of the application as to the part withdrawn, together with the balance of fees properly returnable to him. (c) Provided always that in all such cases if a caveror shall have been put to expense without sufficient cause by reason of such application, he shall be entitled to receive from the applicant such compensation as a judge on a summons in Chambers may order, and on the withdrawal or rejection of such application the District-Registrar shall forthwith issue a certificate of the withdrawal or rejection thereof, in the prescribed form and under the seal of his office, and shall, at the expense of the original applicant, cause the same to be registered at once under the old system, and upon the registration of such certificate of withdrawal or rejection, the land thereby affected shall cease to be subject to the provisions of the new system, and thereafter any further instruments dealing with or affecting said land may be properly registered under the old system. (d)\n\n(a) A fee of $1.00 is payable on filing a withdrawal (see Tariff), and the following form may be used:\n\nFORM OF WITHDRAWAL.\n\nTHE REAL PROPERTY ACT OF 1889.\n\nLand Titles District\n\nApplication No.\n\nIn the matter of (here describe lands to be withdrawn).\n\nI, of (give post office address and addition as in application), the applicant in the above numbered application hereby withdraw the said application in so far as it affects the above described lands, subject, however, to the conditions as to the consent of interested parties and the payment of fees, costs and damages imposed by the provisions of the said Act.\n\nDated at this day of A.D. 189\n\nSigned in presence of (Witness to sign here) (Signature of Applicant).\nNOTE.\u2014The execution of a withdrawal must be attested and verified by the affidavit of the subscribing witness in the same manner as other instruments presented for registration. See note to sec. 74 post as to form.\n\n(b) The consent of any interested party must be verified in the same manner as other instruments.\n\nFORM OF CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL.\n\n(Commencement same as withdrawal.)\n\nI, of (post office address and addition), the person in whose name the certificate of title for the above described lands was directed to issue, hereby consent to the withdrawal of said application in so far as it affects the said lands.\n\nDated at this day of A.D. 18\n\nSigned in the presence of (Witness).\n\n(Signature.)\n\n(For Form of Affidavit see note to sec. 74, post.)\n\n(c) The fee on returning papers is $1.00 (see Tariff), and the rebate of fees in ordinary cases returnable to the applicant would be the amount of commission paid towards the \"Assurance Fund\" plus the fees paid for unissued certificates, less the fees on withdrawal or rejection, and registering same under old system; and if any instruments are required to be returned, the fees chargeable for return of documents. In cases where more than ten instruments have been perused in the examination of title, a fee of 20 cents per instrument is chargeable, and would have to be paid by the applicant or deducted from the rebate.\n\n(d) FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF WITHDRAWAL OR REJECTION OF AN APPLICATION.\n\n\"The Real Property Act of 1889.\"\n\nI certify that Application No. , whereby (Insert applicant's names and additions as in application) applied to bring the following lands under \"The Real Property Act of 1889\" (Here describe the lands which are withdrawn, or respecting which the application is to be rejected) has been this day (\"withdrawn\" or \"rejected\" as the case may be) and this certificate is\nissued for registration under the Lands Registration Act of Manitoba and to\nthe end that dealings with or affecting said above described land may be\nproperly registered under the \"Old System.\"\n\nDated at the Land Titles Office at this day of\nA.D. 18\n\n(L.S.) District Registrar.\n\nSec. 21 ante provides that all fees must be paid before\nthe certificate can issue to permit of registration under the\nold system.\n\n47. The District-Registrar may in all cases reject the application as\nto the whole or any part of the lands therein comprised if the applicant\nfail within a reasonable time, to produce the evidence and proof of facts\nnecessary or required to make out a good safe-holding title, unless said\napplicant shall adduce satisfactory proof that he is proceeding without\nunnecessary delay in removing defects and complying with the requis-\nitions made in the title, and in case the application is rejected as aforesaid,\nthe District-Registrar shall return to the applicant, or the person entitled\nthereto, all evidences of title lodged in support of the application as to\nthe part rejected, together with the balance of fees to which he may be\nproperly entitled, after deducting the amount required to register the\ncertificate of rejection under the old system as herein provided, and such\nregistration shall have the effect of withdrawing the land thereby affected\nfrom the provisions of the new system and of bringing them again under\nthe old system.\n\nSee notes to sec. 46 supra.\n\nBut he must in cases where a direction has been filed\nobtain the consent of the directee or cause notice to be\ngiven as required by sec. 48 post.\n\n48. In case of the withdrawal or rejection in whole or in part of any\napplication to bring land under the provisions of the new system, under\nwhich a direction or request has been filed with the District-Registrar\nthat the certificate of title shall issue to some other person, (a) the certifi-\ncate of withdrawal or rejection, so soon as signed by the District-Regis-\ntrar, shall have the effect of revesting the lands as to which such with-\ndrawal or rejection shall have taken place in the person in whom, had no\nsuch direction or request been filed, they would have remained vested as\nfully and effectually as if no such direction or request had been filed as\naforesaid, (b) and no person shall have notice, (c) from such direction or\nrequest having been filed, of any right to such lands that may exist.\nbetween the parties to or named in the direction or request. Provided, however, that the District-Registrar shall not allow such withdrawal or rejection except in the case of a withdrawal upon the written consent of the person to whom the certificate of title was directed to issue, (d) and in the case of a rejection, upon the written consent of the person to whom the certificate of title was directed to issue, or upon the expiration of the time limited in a notice of intention to reject (e) given by the District-Registrar to him; provided also that nothing herein contained shall affect the rights as between themselves of any of the parties to such direction or request.\n\n(a) See secs. 45, 46 and 47 supra.\n\n(b) Subject, however, to caveats or liens filed against the interest of the directee during the time the estate remained vested in him.\n\n(c) That is constructive notice from the record of the direction.\n\n(d) See note b, sec. 46 ante.\n\n(e) See sec. 148 post. This notice would of course require to be personally served at the expense of the party interested. See also Rule 23, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante.\n\n49. Proceedings under this Act shall not abate or be suspended by death or transmission or change of interest; but in any such event the District-Registrar before whom the proceedings are pending may make an order for carrying on, discontinuing, or suspending the proceedings upon the application of any person interested as under the circumstances may be just, and may require the production of such further evidence and such notice to be given as he may think necessary.\n\nAs the order would vary according to the circumstances of each case no general form can be given. The order should be drafted by or under the direction of the District Registrar. Apparently the omission to make an order would not affect the proceedings or the certificate of title issued under the application in any ordinary case. Where notice of death has been given the will must be proved or administration granted before the personal representative can deal with the lands. Re Bannerman, 2\nM. L. R. 377; and re Lewis, 5 M. L. R. 48; see also secs. 3, 113, et seq., post.\n\nIt may be doubted whether this section is intended to apply to proceedings pending in Court or before a Judge under provisions of this Act.\n\n50. In case any applicant or registered owner shall die after executing any instrument affecting land and before registration thereof, the registration of such instrument may nevertheless be proceeded with in accordance with this Act, and shall be valid notwithstanding such death.\n\nCompare secs. 81 and 113, et seq., post.\n\n51. In case an applicant or the person to whom he or the person applying in his name (a) may have directed a certificate to be issued shall die in the interval between the date of the application and the issue of the certificate, the certificate shall be issued in the name of the applicant or in the name of the person to whom it shall have been so directed to be issued, as the case may require, and the land shall devolve in like manner as if the certificate had been issued prior to the death of the applicant or of such person. (b)\n\n(a) It does not appear quite clear as to how any person can apply in the name of another and give such a direction as could have the effect of conveying the land.\n\n(b) In the event of the death of the applicant or the directee between the time when the lands became subject to the new system and the issue of a certificate of title the provisions of sec. 113 would apply to the lands in dealing with them. See also Re Bannerman, 2 M. L. R. 377; and Re Lewis 5 M. L. R. 48.\n\n52. In case the District-Registrar shall find that some person other than the applicant or registered owner of any estate or charge has, or appears to have, some right or claim to or against the land in question adverse to that of the applicant or such registered owner, he may cause such person to be served with a notice stating that a certificate of title will issue as set out in such notice for such lands unless such person appearing to have such adverse claim shall, within the time limited by such notice\u2014which time shall in each case be fixed by the District-Registrar\u2014file a caveat (a) forbidding the issue of such certificate of title, and in default of a caveat being filed by such person within the time so\nlimited or before the issue of such certificate such person having or appearing to have such adverse claim shall, if he has been personally served with such notice, be forever estopped and debarred from setting up any claim to or in respect of such land (b).\n\n(a) Compare secs. 54, 55, 130 and 137. See also secs. 53 and 57, as to notice in cases of tax deeds being served substitutionally.\n\n(b) Upon the service personally of such notice an estoppel would work outside the Statute. See note to sec. 44 ante as to appeal against unnecessary requisitions.\n\nOmission to lodge a caveat, or permitting a caveat to lapse, may be ground for a non-suit under sec. 137 post in an action to recover damages for deprivation of the land.\n\nGreat caution should be exercised by the District Registrar in permitting the service of official notices of this nature, for in some cases it might happen that the person so notified would be entitled to be ejected by due legal process, or for other causes ought not to be compelled to occupy the position of a plaintiff, as he would be required to do if he filed the necessary caveat to preserve his rights. See Rule 6, Sch.

The lodging of caveat suspends all further action until caveat be withdrawn, or lapses, or until decision obtained from the Court or a\nJudge. 2. Any person lodging caveat wrongfully and without reasonable cause is liable to make to any person who may have sustained damage thereby, such compensation as the Court or a Judge may decide. 3. For practice as to caveats see sec. 130 of the above Act, the sub-sections thereof and rules in Schedule R. 4.

As to service of any notice or proceeding upon any person provided for in section fifty-seven the District-Registrar in a proper case may order that such notice may be served substitutionally, and such substitutional service shall have the same effect as personal service of the notice or proceeding upon the person intended to be affected thereby.\n\nSuch substitutional services can only be permitted in cases where title is claimed through tax sale deeds. Notices served substitutionally have effect only in virtue of the Statute under which substitutional service is authorized. See secs. 52, 57 and 137.\n\nAn order for substitutional service can not issue until the District Registrar has been satisfied by affidavits that the person to be notified is absent from the Province and that after diligent search his residence can not be discovered.\n\nThe terms of the order are settled in each case by the District Registrar.\nFORM OF ORDER.\n\nTHE REAL PROPERTY ACT OF 1889.\n\nProvince of Manitoba Land Titles District of\n\nIn the matter of application in file No. and\n\n(Here describe the lands).\n\nUpon the application of the said applicant and upon hearing read the affidavit of filed herein I do order that service of the notice of said application be effected on by publishing a copy of said notice in the once in each week during the two weeks succeeding the date hereof and by mailing copies of said notice and of this order in envelopes, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:\n\nand also posting up a copy of said notice and of this order in this office.\n\nAnd I do further order that the said parties do have from such mailing or posting and from the last of said publications within which to file a caveat herein.\n\nDated at the Land Titles Office at this day of A.D. 18\n\nDistrict-Registrar.\n\n(Seal)\n\nNote.\u2014The Form of Notice (sec. 52, ante) can be varied for publication by omitting Notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and referring to the order that service should be effected by publication in a newspaper.\n\n54.

The District-Registrar and the Examiners of Titles, in investigating titles, either before or after land is brought under the new system, may receive and act upon any evidence which is receivable in any court in this Province, and receive and act upon affidavits and statutory declarations touching or affecting any question of title; and may also receive and act upon any evidence which the practice of English conveyancers authorizes to be received in an investigation of a title out of court, and any other evidence, whether the same is or is not receivable or sufficient in point of strict law or according to the practice of English conveyancers, provided the same satisfies the District-Registrar of the facts intended to be made out thereby, and may act upon the following rules:\n\n(1) Recitals, statements, and descriptions of facts, matters, and parties contained in deeds, instruments, registered copies of instruments, Acts of Parliament, or of the Legislature, or statutory declarations upwards of ten years old, shall, unless or except so far as they shall be proved to be inaccurate, be taken to be sufficient evidence of the truth of such facts, matters and descriptions.\n\n(2) Where a registered deed of conveyance acknowledges payment of the consideration money, such acknowledgment shall be sufficient evidence of payment, except so far as such acknowledgment may prove to be inaccurate.\n\n(3) It shall not be necessary to produce or account for the original of any registered deed, document or instrument.\n\n(4) Proofs may be in the form of affidavit, statutory declaration or certificates, or may be given viva voce or may be in any other manner or form that under the circumstances of the case is satisfactory to the District-Registrar in regard to the matters to which the same relate.\n\n(5) The District-Registrar and the Examiners of Titles may receive and administer oaths, affidavits and affirmations touching or affecting any matter or question of title.\n\nCompare 46 & 47 Vic., cap. 28, and 49 Vic., cap. 35, sec. 21. Sub-sec. 19 of sec. 8 declares what may be received as prima facie proof of Crown Grants.\n\nSee Rules 2 and 3 Sch. S. sec. 26 ante.\n\nThe power to administer oaths, etc., would be strictly confined to matters and questions of title under the Statute.\nThe officers mentioned would not be functionaries capable of receiving declarations under the Act respecting extra judicial oaths.\n\n57. In the case of tax sale deeds, the District-Registrar shall not take notice of any technicality, or irregularity in the tax sale, or in any of the proceedings relating thereto, and it shall not be necessary to have the title to the land described in such deed examined prior to such sale, (b) but a certificate from the treasurer of the municipality which has issued such deed shall be furnished to the effect that there were taxes in arrears and due for which such lands could properly have been sold for taxes at such sale, (c) and the District-Registrar shall satisfy himself that the sale was fairly and openly conducted, (d) and he shall also cause to be served upon all persons appearing to be the persons who would have been interested in such lands, except for such tax deed, a notice requiring them within the time limited by such notice to contest the claim of the tax purchaser, by way of caveat, and in default of a caveat being filed within the time so limited, or before the registration as owner of the person entitled under such tax deed, all persons so served with notice shall be forever estopped and debarred from setting up any claim, to or in respect of the lands so sold for taxes, and the District-Registrar shall register the person entitled under such tax deed as owner in fee simple of the said land. (e)\n\n(a) In case of lands under the new system being sold for taxes, the District-Registrar, on an application of the person entitled under the tax deed may dispense with the customary production of the certificate of title, (f) and cancel the same in full or partially, as the case may be, by memorial on the certificate of title in the Register Book, and may issue a new certificate of title to the person entitled under the tax deed as registered owner of said lands. The provisions of this section shall apply to such application the same as if the application were as to lands not already under the new system. (g)\n\n(b) An examination is always necessary to see what persons have such interest in the lands as might entitle them to notice of the proceedings being taken in the Land Titles Office; also to ascertain in the case of \"Manitoba Act\" Grants whether the lands were exempt from taxation by reason of the half-breed grantee being under the age of 18 years and still owner of the lands when the taxes were imposed.\n\nSee Manitoba Municipal Acts as to exemptions.\n(c) The Treasurer's certificate ought to be in the form of an affidavit or declaration, and should shew the years for which taxes were owing and unpaid at the time of the sale.\n\n(d) FORM OF AUCTIONEER'S CERTIFICATE.\n\n(Formal parts same as order sec. 53 ante).\n\nI, (insert names and additions of the officer) make oath and say:\n\n1. That my names and legal additions and the official capacity in which I acted in this matter are above correctly set forth.\n\n2. That by virtue of a warrant issued under the Manitoba Municipal Act, 1886, and Amending Acts (or as the case may be) for the sale of lands for arrears of taxes bearing date the of A.D. 18 , I did, on the day of A.D. 18 , in pursuance to advertisements duly published, at \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 in the County of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 in Manitoba, being the time and place mentioned in such advertisement, sell by public auction the lands above described together with other lands, mentioned in said warrant and advertisement.\n\n3. That the said sale was conducted by me in a fair, open and proper manner and according to the best of my skill and judgment.\n\nSworn. etc.\n\n(e) See Form given at sec. 52. It is proper in notices given under this section to add a special memo., giving shortly the particulars of the tax deed under which title is claimed.\n\nMortgagees, encumbrancees and lien holders ought to be notified as well as owners, but it is doubtful whether execution creditors are entitled to notice; it would seem prudent in some cases that they should be notified. See sec. 52 and notes; also as to substitutional services, see sec. 53 and notes.\n\n(f) The production of the certificate could not be dispensed with until after 30 days' notice, published as provided by sub-sec. 6 of sec. 68, but the proofs of non-deposit, etc., would not be necessary in such a case. It is in the discretion of the District Registrar to require a certificate to be produced even in the case of a transfer under a tax deed, and he has power within his district, under sec. 68,\nsub-sec. 1, to compel any person having it in his possession to produce the certificate for the purpose of cancellation.\n\nThe Municipal Act requires the registration of all tax deeds to be made within six months from the expiration of the time for redemption in order to secure priority over subsequent purchasers and mortgagees for valuable consideration without actual notice.\n\n(g) This proviso requires notices to be served on all the parties interested in the lands in the same manner as if the tax purchaser were an applicant for first registration of the title. See sec. 52 and notes ante.\n\nREGISTRATION OF TITLE.\n\n58. Every certificate of title shall be deemed and taken to be registered under the provisions and for the purposes of this Act, so soon as the same shall have been marked by the District-Registrar with the folio and volume on and in which it is embodied in the Register Book, (a) and every transfer and other instrument purporting to transfer, or in any way to affect land under the new system, shall be deemed to be so registered as soon as a memorial thereof as hereinafter described shall have been entered in the Register upon the folio constituted by the existing certificate of title of such land. (b)\n\n(a) See Rules 16 and 29, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante.\n\n(b) See secs. 74 and 76, and Rule 16, Sch. S, sec. 26.\n\nSec. 74 applies to all instruments, and declares that the enregistration makes the instrument, so memorialized, part and parcel of the Register, and that it is only when so embodied and sealed that it becomes effective as to the lands described in the Register. The \"Register\" here referred to is the existing duplicate certificate of title kept by the District Registrar under sec. 60 post. Sec. 81 provides how instruments shall operate as between the parties to them prior to their becoming effective through enregistration.\n\nIn the matter of the Massey Manufacturing Co. and Gibson, a case was submitted by the Registrar General for the opinion of the Court, the facts being as follows:\u2014\nOn the 29th March, 1888, W. G. was registered owner of the lands, and the Massey Mfg. Co., on that day registered a writ of execution they had issued against him, mentioning these lands in the schedule annexed to the writ.\n\nOn the 1st May, 1888, a transfer of the land from G. to H., dated 23rd February, 1888, was filed and registered, and thereupon a certificate of title was issued to H., but subject to the *fi. fa.* Affidavits were then filed, shewing that the transfer had been executed on the day of its date, and the money paid within a few days afterwards, and on the strength of this proof application was made to have the *fi. fa.* removed from the Register and certificate of title as an encumbrance affecting the lands. The Registrar General refused the application, and, at the request of the parties, submitted the question to the Court, whether under the circumstances the registration of the execution against G. bound the lands as against H.\n\nThe case was fully argued before Mr. Justice Bain in Chambers: W. H. Culver, Q.C., for the Coy., and C. P. Wilson for H., the registered owner, asking to have the *fi. fa.* removed.\n\nHis Lordship held that apart from the Real Property Act the land would not be bound by the execution; but looking at the provisions of the Act the unregistered transfer would not avail to prevent the execution binding the land. The whole object and policy of the Act is for all purposes, and against all the world to vest the beneficial ownership of the land in the person named in the certificate of title. This ownership, which is the creation of the Statute, is changed only by the registration of a transfer which has been executed in accordance with the Act. A properly executed transfer gives the transferee a right to have the land registered in his name, (a) but, as regards the land itself, until\n\n(a) See sec. 81 post.\nit is registered it has no effect whatever, and the land still remains the property of the transferrer, the registered owner. The Registrar General was right in issuing the certificate of title to H. subject to the execution, and in refusing the application for its removal. [Since going to press this case had been reported; Herbert & Gibson, 6 M. L. R. 191.]\n\nMr. A'Becket, in his work on the Transfer of Land Statute (Victoria), cites the following cases under section 42 of that Act on the point of the necessity of registration to the operation of every instrument, viz:\u2014National Bank v. United Hand-in-Hand, etc., Co., 4 App. Cases 391, 407; McCahill v. Henty, 4 V. L. R. (E.) 68 arg.; and Lange v. Rudwolt, 6 S. A. L. R. 75; 7 S. A. L. R. 1, discussed in Cuthbertson v. Swan, 11 S. A. L. R. 102.\n\nCompare \"Sedgfield's Practice,\" 82, 88.\n\n59. The owner (a) of land or any estates or interest therein, under the operation of the new system shall be entitled to receive a certificate of title to the same; (b) and if any certificate be issued to a minor, lunatic or person of unsound mind or to a person under any other disability, the District-Registrar shall state in such certificate of title the age of stated such minor, or the nature of the disability so far as known to him.\n\n(a) See ante sec. 3 (2) as to interpretation of the word \"owner.\"\n\n(b) See sec. 40 and notes ante. It would be in the discretion of the District Registrar whether the trustee for the sale, etc., of land should receive a certificate of title unless all persons interested had consented to the application.\n\nThe District Registrar is directed by the Act to make no entry in the Register of any notice of trust. See notes to sec. 86 post.\n\n60. All certificates of title to be granted by the District-Registrar shall be in the prescribed form (Schedule A) and shall be signed by the District-Registrar and shall be sealed with the seal of his office, (a) and a duplicate thereof shall be preserved and registered by the District-Registrar in his office, in a book to be kept for that purpose. (b)\nREGISTERED OWNERS.\n\n(a) No certificate of title can be signed during the time the office is open for purposes of registration. See Rule 29, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante.\n\n(b) As to the \"Register,\" see Rule 9, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante. Compare sec. 68 (7) post, where the certificate bound up in the \"Register\" is referred to as the \"original.\"\n\nSCHEDULE A.\n\n(Section 60.)\n\nCERTIFICATE OF TITLE.\n\nA. B. of (here insert description and if certificate be issued pursuant to any transfer referred to, insert memorandum of transfer on back), is now seized of an estate (here state whether in fee simple or for life, or as the case may be), subject to such encumbrances, liens and interests as are notified by memorandum underwritten (or endorsed hereon), of that piece or parcel of land known or described as follows:\n\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto signed my name and affixed my seal this day of\n\nDistrict Registrar.\n\n[L.S.]\n\nSigned in the presence of\n\nthe day of\n\n61. The date of the certificate of title shall in all cases be the date appearing in the body thereof, or the date of registration of the last encumbrance (whether existing or discharged) registered under the new system and endorsed on the back of the certificate of title, whichever shall be the later date.\n\nSee secs. 64, 146, and 147 post.\n\n62. In all cases where two or more persons are entitled as tenants in common to an estate of freehold in any land such persons may receive one certificate for the entirety or each may receive a separate certificate for his undivided share.\n\nAs to joint tenants see sec. 82 post.\n\nEFFECT OF REGISTRATION OF TITLE.\n\n63. The land mentioned in any certificate of title granted under this Act, shall, by implication, and without any special mention in the cer-\nIMPLIED QUALIFICATIONS.\n\nCertificate of title, unless the contrary be expressly declared, be deemed to be subject to:\n\n(a) Any subsisting reservations contained in the original grant of said land from the Crown; (1)\n\n(b) Any municipal charges, rates or assessments at the date of such certificate, or which may be thereafter imposed on the said land, or which have theretofore been imposed for local improvements and which are not then due and payable; (2)\n\n(c) Any subsisting right of way or other easement, howsoever created upon, over or in respect of said land; (3)\n\n(d) Any subsisting lease or agreement for a lease for a period not exceeding three years where there is actual occupation of said land under the same;\n\n(e) Any judgments, decrees, or orders, for the payment of money against the registered owner of such lands, and any mechanic's liens affecting the said lands which may be respectively registered since the last date of the certificate of title, and maintained in force under the provisions of the Acts relating to the Administration of Justice, the Acts respecting the County Courts, or of the Act respecting Mechanic's Liens, and priority of registration in the Land Titles Office shall prevail in settling the priorities between them;\n\n(f) All public highways embraced in the description of the lands included in any certificate shall be deemed to be excluded from the certificate;\n\n(g) Any right of expropriation which may by statute be vested in any person or body corporate;\n\n(h) The provisions of Section sixty-five of this Act.\n\n(1) See section 84 post.\n\n(2) As to tax sale deeds see sec. 57 (a) ante.\n\n(3) As to registration of easements see sec. 79 post.\n\n(4) As to executions see 52 Vic., cap. 36, secs. 13 and 14, which limits their binding effect on lands to such executions as were in the Sheriff's hands on 1st April, 1889, and their renewals.\n\nIn Burt v. Clarke, 5 M. L. R. 150, it was held (Bain J.) that a County Court judgment for less than $100 registered before the County Court Act of 1887 came into force, and\nre-registered before 1st November, 1887, was valid, and could be enforced in equity.\n\nSince 29th April, 1884, no premium note or undertaking under the Manitoba Mutual Fire Insurance Companies Act creates a lien upon lands. 47 Vic., cap. 34, sec. 7.\n\nRules 26 and 27, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante, provide for the removal of lapsed judgments and mechanics' liens.\n\nThe Seed Grain Mortgage Act of 1876 (C. S. M. cap. 48), is still in force, and such mortgages would remain in full binding effect, although any mention thereof might be omitted from the certificate of title, because the rights of the Crown cannot thus be interfered with. A person lead into error by such omission might have recourse under the provisions of sections 132-141 post.\n\nA lien may be secured for seed grain advances by a municipality, on filing notes in the office of the Clerk of the County Court, sec. 52 Vic., cap. 10, sec. 9.\n\nEvery person dealing in lands should, before concluding the transaction, satisfy himself as to caveats, pending suits, judgments, liens, etc. (see secs. 108, 130, 131 and Rule 8, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante), by a search at the proper Land Titles Office, as even where the lands affected have been specifically mentioned, the memorial may not appear on the certificate of title which may not have been produced in the Land Titles Office since the filing of the caveat or charge. At the same time it might be asked whether there is a chance of a prior certificate having issued which would affect the title under the exceptions made by section 64 post.\n\nCertificate conclusive evidence of title.\n\n64. Every certificate of title granted under this Act, when duly registered, shall (except in case of fraud wherein the registered owner or encumbrancee shall have participated or colluded and as against such registered owner or encumbrancee) so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled under this Act, be conclusive evidence at law and in equity as against Her Majesty, as represented by the Government of the Province of Manitoba, and all persons whomsoever, that the person\nCERTIFICATES OF TITLE.\n\nnamed in such certificate is entitled to the land included in such certificate, for the estate or interest therein specified, subject to the exceptions and reservations mentioned in section sixty-three, except as regards any portion of land that may by wrong description of boundaries or parcels be included in such certificate, when the holder of such certificate is neither a purchaser or mortgagee (a) for value, nor the transferee of a purchaser or mortgagee for value, (b) and except as against any person claiming under any prior certificate of title granted under this Act in respect of the same land, and for the purpose of this section that person shall be deemed to claim under a prior certificate who is holder of, or whose claim is derived, directly or indirectly, from the person who was the holder of the earliest certificate granted, notwithstanding such certificate may have been surrendered and a new certificate granted upon any transfer or dealing.\n\n(a) The \"Mortgagee\" is not mentioned in the corresponding section of the Victorian Act.\n\n(b) See secs. 85, 133 and 143 post.\n\n65. Any certificate of title issued upon the first bringing of land under the provisions of the new system, and every certificate of title issued in respect of the same land, or any part thereof, to any person claiming or deriving title under or through the applicant owner, shall be void as against the title of any person adversely in actual occupation of, and rightly entitled to such land or any part thereof, at the time when such land was so brought under the new system, and continuing in such occupation at the time of any subsequent certificate of title being issued in respect of the said land.\n\nSee sec. 3 (21), as to what \"possession\" includes, and sec. 67 (9) post as to ejectments, etc.\n\nCompare sec. 127 of the Act of 1885, and sec. 40 ante.\n\nThe Registrar-General in re Jackson and McPherson (1887), required the applicant to vindicate his title by ejecting the adverse occupant, before registration under the Act.\n\nOn this subject, and as to what constitutes \"adverse possession,\" see A'Becket's Transfer of Land Statute (Victoria), p. 108 (g), cases there cited; Chisholm v. Capper, 6 W. W. & A'B. (L.) 225; N.C. 22, 56, 60; Staughton v. Brown, 1 V. L. R. (L.) 150, 159, 163; Grave v. Wharton, 5 V. L. R.\nCERTIFICATES OF TITLE.\n\n(L.) 97; Robertson v. Keith, 1 V. R.

His Lordship Chief Justice Taylor, in the introduction to his work on the Quieting Titles Act, says: \"The possession of the property and not merely the paper title should be inquired into. * * * If the possession has not always gone with the title, satisfactory evidence of the reason cannot safely be dispensed with.\"\n\nIn Scott v. Nixon, 3 Dr. & War. 405, Lord St. Leonard's remarks \"that a clear title, and just as good as any other title might be acquired by adverse possession.\" See Taylor on Titles, 53; Dart on Vendors; 369; Taylor's Vendors and Purchasers, 389; Darling on Limitations, 389; Hyde v. Delamay, 6 Jur. 119.\n\n66. In any suit for specific performance brought by a registered owner of any land subject to the new system, against a person who may have contracted to purchase such land, not having notice of any fraud or other circumstances which, according to the provisions of this Act, would affect the right of the vendor, the certificate of title of such registered owner shall be held in every court of law or equity to be conclusive evidence that such registered owner has a good and valid title to the land and for the estate or interest therein mentioned or described, and shall entitle such registered owner to a decree for the specific performance of such contract.\n\nSee sec. 147 post and Rule 20 Sch. S, sec. 26 ante, making certified copies evidence.\n\nCompare sec. 67 post, as to ejectment and other actions.\n\nThis section must be read in connection with sections 64 and 65 ante, and secs. 85, 133, 143, and 146 post. The section precludes technical objections by an unwilling purchaser seeking to escape from his contract.\n\n67. No action of ejectment or other action for the recovery of any land under the new system shall lie or be sustained against the registered owner for the estate or interest in respect to which he is so registered, except in the following cases, that is to say:\nEJECTMENTS\u2014EXCEPTIONS.\n\n(1) The case of a mortgagee as against a mortgagor in default; Mortgagee.\n(2) The case of an encumbrancee as against an encumbrancer in Encum-\ndefault; brancee.\n(3) The case of a lessor as against a lessee in default; (a) Lessor.\n(4) The case of a person deprived of any land by fraud as against the Fraudulent\nperson registered as owner of such land through fraud, or as against a or voluntary trans-\nperson deriving otherwise than as a transferee bona fide for value, from or feree; (b)\nthrough a person so registered through fraud; (b)\n(5) The case of a person deprived of or claiming any land included in Misdescription.\nany grant or certificate of title of other land by misdescription of such other land or its boundaries as against the registered owner of such other land not being a transferee of such other land or deriving from or through a transferee thereof bona fide for value; (b)\n(6) The case of a registered owner claiming under the instrument of Prior instrument.\ntitle prior in date of registration under the provisions of this Act, or in any case in which two or more grants, or two or more certificates of title, or a grant and a certificate of title may be registered under the provisions of this Act in respect to the same land; (b)\n(7) For rights arising or partly arising after the date of the certificate Rights subsequently\nof title under which the registered owner claims;\n(8) For rights arising through possession; (c)\n(9) And in any case other than as aforesaid, the production of the In all other cases certi-\nregistered certificate of title, shall be held in every court of law or equity to be an absolute bar and estoppel of any such action (d) against the person named in such instrument as seized of, or as registered owner or lessee of the land therein described, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n(a) This paragraph is wide enough to cover default in any condition made by the lessee, whether implied under sec. 89 (2) post, or expressed in the contract.\n\nMr. A'Becket, under the corresponding section (138) of the Victorian Act, refers to Saunders v. Wadham, 4 S. A. L. R. 73; Bucknall v. Reid, 10 S. A. L.

See Report, page 15:\n\n\"The extent of the power of the Registrar-General to call for the production of documents seems to be not clearly defined. We think that it should extend to requiring, and, if necessary, compelling the production of any document relating, or purporting to relate, to land under the provisions of the Acts which it is in his judgment necessary or desirable to have produced; and that he should be authorized to retain any document which the holder had improperly obtained, or which had been issued or signed in fraud or contravention of the law.\"\n\nBankers and money lenders generally should bear in mind that the mere deposit of a certificate of title without lodging a caveat will give no safe security, unless they watch the newspapers published or circulating in the neighbourhood of the lands for advertisements of an intention of dealing with the property without the production of the certificate.\n(2) He may summon any such person as aforesaid, or any person whose evidence may be necessary or material in respect to any such lands, to appear and give any explanations upon oath respecting such lands, or the instruments affecting the title thereto.\n\nFor form see sub-sec. 3 infra.\n\n(3) Every such summons issued by the District-Registrar as above mentioned, shall be in the prescribed form or to the like effect, and in the event of any disobedience of any such summons being certified to the Court of Queen's Bench, may be enforced by such Court in like manner and by the like proceedings and with a like penalty as subpoenas of such Court.\n\nSee sec. 121 post.\n\nFORM OF SUBPOENA.\n\nThe REAL PROPERTY ACT OF 1889.\n\nProvince of Manitoba.\n\nThe Land Titles District of\n\nTo wit:\n\nIn the matter of application file No. and\n\n(Here describe the lands.)\n\nTo\n\nI command you, and each of you, that all other business and excuses whatsoever ceasing, you do appear personally before the District Registrar for the Land Titles District of in Manitoba, in the Land Titles Office at in the Province of Manitoba, on the day of next, A.D. 189 , at o'clock in the noon, and so from day to day until the matter herein mentioned be disposed of, and also that you bring with you and produce at the time and place aforesaid (here describe the instrument, etc., to be produced), then and there to testify and show all and singular those things which you, or either of you, know, or the said deed, instrument, record, document or writing doth import, of and concerning this matter on behalf of the Applicant; and this you or either of you, shall by no means omit, under a penalty of Five Hundred Dollars, and all other penalties provided by the said Act.\n\nWitness the hand and official seal of the District Registrar for the Land Titles District of at this day of A.D. 189 .\n\n[Seal.]\n\nDistrict Registrar.\nCorrection of errors in certificates, etc.\n\n(4) He may, upon such evidence as may appear to him sufficient in that behalf, so far as practicable, without prejudicing the rights conferred upon transferees for value, correct errors in certificates of title or in the Register, or in entries made therein respectively, or in any memorial certificate, exemplification or copy of any instrument made in or issued (a) from the Land Titles Office, and may supply entries omitted to be made; provided always, that in the correction of any such error he shall not erase or render illegible the original words, and he shall fix the date upon which such correction was made or entry supplied with his initials, and every certificate of title so corrected, and every entry so corrected or supplied, shall have the like validity and effect as if such error had not been made or such entry omitted.\n\n(a) Evidently a comma ought to be inserted here.\n\nMay enter caveat on behalf of Her Majesty and others.\n\n(5) He may enter a caveat on behalf of Her Majesty or on behalf of any person who may be under the disability of infancy, lunacy, unsoundness of mind, or absence from the Province, to prohibit the transfer or dealing with any land belonging, or supposed to belong, to the Crown or to any such person as hereinbefore mentioned, and also to prohibit the dealing with any land in any case in which it shall appear to him that an error has been made by misdescription of any such land or otherwise, in any certificate of title or other instrument, or for the prevention of any fraud or improper dealing.\n\nIt would not appear necessary that this caveat should comply with any of the forms given under sec. 130, nor be subject to any of the rules respecting caveats or procedure in matters of caveat. A simple caution against registration is all that is required.\n\nAbsence from the Province would probably be insufficient ground for a caveat after ten years from the date of the instrument conferring titles. See sec. 56 (1) ante.\n\nSee A'Becket's note to sec. 121, sub-sec. III., of the Victorian Act.\n\nMay dispense with production of certificate.\n\n(6) The District-Registrar, in case he shall see reasonable cause for so doing, may dispense with the production of any certificate of title, lease or other instrument, for the purpose of entering the endorsement by this Act required to be entered upon the dealing with land; and upon the registration of such dealing the District-Registrar shall note in the entry of the memorial in the Register that no entry of such memorial has been\nmade on the duplicate grant or other instrument, and such dealing shall, thereupon, be as valid and effectual as if such memorial had been so entered; Provided always, that before registering such dealing, the District-Registrar shall, in such case, require the party dealing to make an affidavit that such grant or instrument has not been deposited by way of lien or as security for any loan, and satisfactorily to account to the District-Registrar for its non-production, and shall give at least thirty days' notice of his intention in some newspaper published in the Land Titles District, if there be such newspaper, or, in the absence of such publication, to give such public notice as the District-Registrar may think necessary. The number of insertions in such newspaper and the form of the notice shall be settled by the District-Registrar.\n\nA provisional certificate can also be obtained, if necessary, under sec. 7 post.\n\nSince the enactment of sec. 109 post, this section can only apply to lost or destroyed certificates. The proofs of loss or destruction should be by affidavit, tracing the lost certificate to the last person who had it in custody and who should account for its non-production, and the presumption of its pledge as collateral should be negatived.\n\nFORM OF NOTICE FOR PUBLICATION.\n\nTHE REAL PROPERTY ACT OF 1889.\n\nNotice is hereby given that on or after the day of A.D. 18 unless cause to the contrary be shewn, I will dispense with the production of the Certificate of Title for (here describe lands) issued on the of A.D. 18 , to (insert names and additions of registered owner) for the purpose of endorsing thereon the memorial of a dealing affecting said lands presented for registration by the said registered owner (or by A.B., a mortgagee, or person interested in said lands, or as the case may be).\n\nDated at the Land Titles Office at this of A.D. 18\n\nDistrict-Registrar.\n\nAs to deposits as equitable mortgages reference may be had to London Chartered Bank v. Hayes, 2 V.R. (E) 104, 2 A.J.R. 60; Re Nathan, 1 S.A.L.R. 166; Richards v. Jones, ib. 167.\n\nMAN.L.A.\n(7) In the event of a grant (a) or certificate of title of land being lost or destroyed, the owner of such land, together with other persons, if any, having knowledge of the circumstances, may make a statutory declaration stating the facts of the case, the names and descriptions of the registered owners, and the particulars of all mortgages, encumbrances and other matter affecting such land and the title thereto, to the best of the declarant's knowledge and belief, and the District-Registrar, if satisfied of the truth of such declaration and the bona fides of the transaction, may issue to the owner of such land a provisional certificate of title of such land, which provisional certificate shall contain an exact copy of the original grant (a) or certificate of title bound up in the Register, and of every memorandum and endorsement thereon, and shall also contain a statement why such provisional certificate is issued; and the District-Registrar shall at the same time enter in the Register, notice of the issuing of such provisional certificate and the date thereof and why it was issued, and such provisional certificate shall be available for all purposes and uses for which the grant, (a) or certificate of title so lost or destroyed would have been available, and as valid to all intents as such lost grant or certificate; Provided always, that the District-Registrar, before issuing such provisional certificate, shall give at least thirty days' notice (b) of his intention so to do, in some newspaper published in the Judicial District in which such land is situate, or if there be no such newspaper, then by giving such public notice as the District-Registrar may deem expedient. The number of insertions in such newspaper shall be settled by the District-Registrar. (c)\n\n(a) The word \"grant\" here has evidently been inserted through inadvertence, as will be seen by the context.\n\nCompare sec. 60 ante, which refers to the certificate bound up in the \"Register\" as a \"duplicate.\"\n\n(b) FORM OF NOTICE FOR PUBLICATION.\n\nTHE REAL PROPERTY ACT OF 1889.\n\nNotice is hereby given that on or after the day of A.D. 18 a provisional Certificate of Title will be issued to (insert names and additions of registered owner) under the provisions of above Act for (describe lands) subject to all subsisting registered charges, to replace the Certificate of Title issued to the said (registered owner's name) on the of A.D. 18 , which he alleges to have been lost or destroyed.\n\nDated at the Land Titles Office at this of A.D. 18\n\nDistrict-Registrar.\n(c) Where the production of a certificate has been dispensed with on a transfer of all the land, a provisional certificate would be unnecessary.\n\nA registered proprietor of several adjoining allotments under separate certificates of title having lost them applied under the corresponding section of the Victorian Statute for a consolidated special certificate, but his application was refused, it being considered that a special certificate should be issued in respect of each allotment: Sedgefield's \"Practice of the Office of Titles\" (Victoria) 85.\n\n(8) The District-Registrar may require the owner of any land, other than town plots, within his district desiring to transfer or otherwise to deal with the same under the provisions of this Act, to deposit a plan of such land signed by the owner, or his properly authorized attorney, with the several measurements and bearings marked thereon, and certified by a Provincial land surveyor, and such plan shall be upon one of the following scales:\n\n(a) If the land, or the portion thereof proposed to be transferred or dealt with, is of less area than one acre, then such plan shall be on a scale of not more than two chains to one inch.\n\n(b) If such land, or the portion thereof proposed to be transferred or dealt with, is of greater area than one acre, but not exceeding five acres, then such plan shall be on a scale not more than five chains to one inch.\n\n(c) If such land, or the portion thereof proposed to be transferred or dealt with, is of greater area than five acres, but not exceeding eighty acres, then such plan shall be on a scale not more than ten chains to one inch.\n\n(d) If such land, or the portion thereof proposed to be transferred or dealt with, is of greater area than eighty acres, then such plan shall be on a scale of not more than twenty chains to one inch.\n\n(e) If such proprietor neglects or refuses to comply with such requirements as aforesaid, it shall not be incumbent on the District-Registrar to proceed with the registration of such transfer or dealing.\n\n(9) Where parts of different legal sub-divisions or parish lots are included in the same transfer, the plan shall represent the whole of such legal sub-divisions or parish lots, and shall indicate the location of the\nlands to be transferred; Provided always, that this shall not be necessary in the case of lots in a city, town, or village, the plan of which has been registered.\n\nSee sec. 69 and 70 post.\n\n69. Any owner sub-dividing land for the purpose of selling the same in allotments shall deposit with the District-Registrar a plan in duplicate of such sub-division on a scale of not more than four chains to one inch, provided that such plan shall exhibit distinctly all roads, streets, passages, thoroughfares, squares or reserves appropriated or set apart for public use, having the measurements marked thereon, and also all allotments into which the said land is divided marked with distinct numbers or letters, and such plan shall show distinctly a sufficient number of astrometric bearings and measurements from which can be deduced the bearings and dimensions of each and all the allotments into which said land is divided, and shall also show the original section or lot lines according to the survey thereof by the Dominion Government, or a sufficient number of said lines to show the location and connection of such sub-division therewith, and shall be signed by the owner or his agent and certified as accurate by a Provincial land surveyor\u2014under oath in the form in Schedule T hereto.\n\n(a) The District-Registrar may require the owner of any land desiring to deal with the same under the new system and which has heretofore been sub-divided, or which is comprised within the limits of any city, town or village, and the location of which in his opinion is not sufficiently well or accurately defined upon any existing registered plan, to file a plan of the same in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing section.\n\nSee sec. 68, sub-secs. 8 and 9 ante. But quere whether it is not the foregoing sub-section that is intended to be referred to.\n\nSCHEDULE T.\n\nFORM OF SURVEYOR'S CERTIFICATE.\n\nI, (name of surveyor) of the (place of residence), Provincial Land Surveyor, make oath and say that I was present at and did personally superintend the survey represented by this plan and that the survey and plan are correct.\n\nSworn before me this day of A.D. 18\n\nJ. P. or Com. in B. R., etc.\n70. All railway or other corporations shall hereafter deposit with the Railways District-Registrar, plans of their right of way, and station grounds, showing the area taken from each quarter section or parish-lot as the case may be.\n\nProvision as to these plans will be found in the General Railway Acts, and in each company's special act of incorporation.\n\n71. For the purpose of payment of any fees fixed by this Act or by the tariff of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, the value of land shall be ascertained by the oath or solemn affirmation of the applicant, owner or person acquiring land, (a) but if the District-Registrar be not satisfied as to the correctness of the value so affirmed or sworn to, it shall be lawful for him to require such applicant, owner, or person deriving such land by transmission, to produce such other evidence as he may think necessary, or a certificate of such value under the hand of a valuator, which certificate shall be received as conclusive evidence of such value for the purpose aforesaid. (b)\n\nProvided further, that lands in rural municipalities not sub-divided into lots or blocks shall be valued according to their value for agricultural purposes, including the improvements and buildings thereon. And all other lands shall be valued according to their actual value, including improvements and buildings thereon. Estates less than freehold shall be valued the same as freehold estates, unless the District-Registrar, for sufficient cause shown, directs otherwise.\n\n(a) On first application the affidavit verifying the facts therein set forth is usually sufficient. See second form following sec. 40 ante.\n\n(b) See tariff following sec. 21 ante as to fees, and sec. 140 post as to commissions payable on first applications and upon transmissions by death or insolvency.\n\nREGISTRATIONS\u2014TRANSFERS.\n\n72. When land under the new system or any portion of such land, is intended to be transferred or any right-of-way or other easement is intended to be created or transferred, the registered owner may execute a memorandum of transfer in the form contained in Schedule B to this Act, which memorandum shall, for description of the land intended to be dealt with, refer to the certificate of title of such land, or shall give such description as may be sufficient to identify the same, and shall contain an accurate statement of the estate, interest, or easement intended to be\ntransferred or created, and a memorandum of all leases, mortgages and other encumbrances, to which the same may be subject; and such transfer, if it be endorsed on the instrument evidencing the title of the transferor may be in the following form:\n\nI, the within named A.B., in consideration of dollars paid to me by C.D., transfer to said C.D. (here state the easement, estate or interest intended to be transferred).\n\nDated this day of 18\n\nWitness: A.B.\n\nAs to land tax sale transfers see sec. 57 (a) ante, which must be registered within six months.\n\nAs to implied covenants, see secs. 80, 98, and 99 post.\n\nA transfer is effective only upon registration (sec. 74 post), but it confers upon the transferee a right to be registered as owner (sec. 81 post).\n\nAs to transmissions see 113 et seq. post.\n\nSCHEDULE B.\n\nMEMORANDUM OF TRANSFER.\n\nI, A.B., being registered owner of an estate (state the nature of estate), subject, however, to such encumbrances, liens, and interests as are notified by memorandum underwritten (or endorsed hereon), in all that land containing (as the case may be).

For forms of transfer of\nmortgages, encumbrances, leases, etc., see Schedules F, G and H, (sec. 98). When the transfer is made by a separate instrument it must be in the foregoing form, or comply substantially with it, i.e., it must purport to be made by the \"registered owner\" and must refer to encumbrances if any exist (see sec. 72). No seal need be affixed by the vendor. The title passes on the sealing by the District Registrar. See sec. 74, and note to sec. 96 post.\n\n73. If the memorandum of transfer purports to transfer the whole or part of the transferrer's interest in the land mentioned in any certificate of title, the transferrer shall deliver up the certificate of title of said land, and the District Registrar shall, when registering the transfer, enter in the register and on the duplicate certificate of title a memorandum cancelling the same, either wholly or partially, according as the memorandum of transfer purports to transfer the whole or part only of the interest of the transferrer in the land mentioned in such certificate of title, and setting forth the particulars of the transfer.\n\nCompare Rule 22, Sch. S, s. 26 ante.\n\nPurchasers should assure themselves that there are no unpaid rates affecting the land and that it has not been sold for taxes since the date of the vendor's certificate of Title. See also Note (4) sec. 63 ante, and Rule 19, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante. If there are unpaid arrears, he should either obtain the amount from the vendor or require a certificate that they have been discharged. He should also arrange to have the certificate of title produced at the proper Land Titles Office for the purpose of having the transfer registered. He should also search the General Register as to caveats and general charges, and assure himself that there are no rights subsisting under any adverse possession of any part of the land; and also that there are no rights of way, rights to light, or other easements acquired by user, or subsisting over, or upon, or affecting the land; and where the possession is not adverse the interest of any tenant of the land should be ascertained.\nEvery instrument except transfer may be in duplicate.\n\nAffidavit of Execution.\n\nPriority according to time of registration.\n\n74. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, every instrument presented for registration under the new system may be in duplicate except a transfer and shall, unless a Crown grant, Order-in-Council, instrument under the seal of any corporation, or certificate of judicial proceedings, be attested by a witness who shall prove the execution thereof in the manner required by said chapter Sixty of the Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba and amendments thereto, and shall be registered in the order of time in which the same is presented for that purpose; and instruments registered in respect of or affecting the same estate or interest, shall, notwithstanding any express, implied, or constructive notice, be entitled to priority according to the time of registration, and the District-Registrar, upon registration thereof, shall file the same, or a duplicate thereof, in his office; and so soon as registered every instrument shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed and be taken to be embodied in the Register as part and parcel thereof, and such instrument, when so constructively embodied, and stamped with the seal of the District-Registrar, shall thereupon create, transfer, surrender or discharge, as the case may be, the estate or interest therein mentioned in the lands mentioned in the said instrument.\n\nCompare secs. 69-72, chap. 7, of the Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba.\n\nSoundness of mind is necessary on the part of a witness, and that he understands the nature of an oath and is not a party to the instrument.\n\nCompare secs. 58, 77, 78, 81, 99, and notes.\n\nIn the discretion of the Inspector old system forms may be ordered to be registered and are then given effect by sec. 77 post. Persons dealing with lands should satisfy themselves that no objections will be taken to the form of instruments before closing.\n\nSee sec 3 (12), as to meaning of the word \"instrument.\" Also Herbert v. Gibson, 6 M. L. R. 192.\n\nRegistration dates from the time of filing. Rule 10, Sch. S. sec. 26 ante.\n\nInstruments unfit for registration may be rejected by the registrar and no instrument may be registered to affect land under the new system except in the manner provided by this Act. Instruments substantially in conformity with.\nthe Act may be received, but in order to pass an estate it must be executed and registered in accordance with the new system. Under the statute instruments are inoperative as affecting lands or interests in lands until registered, saving however the rights of the parties to unregistered documents as between themselves. See secs. 77 and 81 post, and notes under sec. 58 ante.\n\nThe affidavit may be according to the last form given under sec. 40 ante.\n\nSee note to sec. 100 post as to essential form of discharges of mortgages or encumbrances, for the purpose of enregistration and release of the lands affected.\n\nC. S. M. Cap. 60, sec. 35, Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba, as amended, provides as follows:\n\n35. All deeds of lands sold under process issued from the court of Queen's Bench in Manitoba, and all certificates of sales of land for taxes given under the hand of the treasurer of a municipality or other authorized person, shall be registered within six months after the sale of such lands or after the date hereof, (See provisions as to the registration of tax deeds in the Manitoba Municipal Acts), otherwise the parties respectively claiming under any of such sales shall not be deemed to have preserved their priority as against a purchaser in good faith, who may have registered his deed prior to the registration of such deed from the sheriff, treasurer, warden, or other officer; provided that deeds of land heretofore sold for school taxes shall be deemed to have preserved their priority if the same be registered within six months after the expiration of the time allowed by the law to redeem.\n\nThe provisions of the \"Lands Registration Act of Manitoba\" as amended, relating to the proof of the execution of instruments produced for registration under the \"old system\" are as follows:\n\n15. Grants from the crown may be registered by the production thereof to the registrar, with a true copy sworn to by any person who may have compared the same with the original\u2014such copy to be filed with the registrar\u2014and all other instruments, excepting wills, shall be registered by the deposit of the original instrument, or by the deposit of a duplicate or other original part thereof, with all the necessary affidavits.\n16. Every will shall be registered at full length by the production of the original will, and the deposit of a copy thereof with an affidavit sworn to by one of the witnesses to the will, proving the due execution thereof by the testator, or by the production of probate or letters of administration with the will annexed, or an exemplification thereof, under the seal of any court in this Province, or in Great Britain or Ireland, or in any British province, colony, or possession having jurisdiction therein, and by the deposit of a copy of such probate, or letters of administration, with an affidavit verifying such copy.\n\nWhen required to swear to.\n\n17. In the case of an instrument other than a will, a subscribing witness to such instrument, shall in an affidavit setting forth in full his name, place of residence and addition or calling in full, swear to the following facts:\n\n(1) To the execution of the original and duplicate, if any there be;\n(2) To the place of execution;\n(3) That he knew the parties to such instrument, if such be the fact; or that he knew such one or more of them, according to the fact;\n(4) That he is a subscribing witness thereto.\n\nAffidavit to be made on instrument.\n\n18. The said affidavit shall be made on the said instrument, or securely attached thereto; and such instrument and affidavit shall be copied at full length in the registry book.\n\nSeparate executions to be sworn to separately.\n\n19. When any instrument is executed by one or more grantors, but not by all of them in presence of the same witness or witnesses, or by one or more of the other parties thereto in presence of another witness or other witnesses, then in such case the witness or one of the witnesses, whether the same be so executed in the same or in different places, shall make an affidavit, in accordance with the seventeenth section of this Act, as to each separate and distinct execution of the instrument before the same shall be registered.\n\nInsufficient description of witness or clerical error not to invalidate registration of instrument.\n\n(a) No registration under this Act of any instrument shall be deemed or adjudged void or defective by reason of the name, place of residence, addition, occupation, or calling of the subscribing witness thereto, not being set forth in full, or being improperly or insufficiently given or described in the affidavits mentioned in and required by section seventeen, nor by reason of any clerical error or omission of a merely formal or technical character, in such affidavit, but, nevertheless, it shall continue to be the duty of every registrar not to register any instrument except on such proof as is required by this Act.\n\n(b) The preceding sub-section shall apply retrospectively in all cases except those in respect of which litigation has already been commenced.\n\n45 Vic. cap. 13, sec. 3.\nSee note re Farmers & Conklin, and Renwick & Berryman, page 126 infra.\n\n20.

Every subscribing witness shall be compellable, when necessary, by order of a judge of the court of Queen's Bench or county court, to make affidavit or proof of the execution of any instrument for the purpose of registration under this Act, and to do all other acts necessary for the same purpose, upon being paid or duly tendered his reasonable expenses therefor.\n\n23. The proof may be either by affidavit or by affirmation or declaration, when by the law of the country where such proof is made, an affirmation or declaration may be substituted for an affidavit, and the registrar may receive such instruments so proved without any other or further proof of their due execution.\n\n24. None of the persons authorized to take affidavits by this Act shall take any affidavit of the execution of any instrument, in case he is a party to such instrument, and no one who is a party to the instrument shall make such affidavit, provided that any instrument executed before this Act takes effect may still be registered on the affidavit of a party thereto, but in such affidavit the witness shall swear that the said instru-\nment was executed before the date at which this act takes effect; nor Cap. 60.\nshall any such affidavit of the proof of any instrument executed here-\nafter, be taken from any witness, unless such witness has subscribed his\nname in his own handwriting as such witness.\n\n25.

When any instrument is registered, the registrar (a) shall deliver a certified\ncopy or copies of such instrument, certified under his hand and seal of office, as may be required of him, and of all documents connected with or relating to the same; in which certificate he shall declare and substitute the time, place, and other particulars of registration as in other cases thereof.\n\n(a) That is, the registrar of deeds under the \"old system.\"\n\n28. Every copy of an instrument so certified as aforesaid, may be registered in any other registry office (a) by deposit thereof, without production of the original instrument, and without proof of any kind other than the production of the copy so certified as aforesaid.\n\n(a) That is, offices under the \"old system.\"\n29. Every copy of original instrument, so certified as in the next preceding section mentioned, shall be received in all cases in place of the original as *prima facie* evidence of the original instrument and of the due execution thereof.\n\nCompare sec. 147 post.\n\n39. All by-laws hereafter to be passed by any municipal council, under the authority of which any street, road, or highway shall be opened on any private property, shall, before the same becomes effectual in law, be duly registered in the registry office of the county where the land is situate; and for the purpose of registration a duplicate original of such by-law shall be made out certified under the hand of the clerk, and the seal of the municipality, which may be registered without any further proof.\n\nThe receipt and actual registration in fact of an instrument without any affidavit does not bind parties with implied notice under the Lands Registration Act of Manitoba; (a) and under the wording of section 17 of that Act it appears quite as necessary that the affidavit should set forth the name, place of residence, and addition or calling of the witness, as that there should be an affidavit. Where the addition or calling of the subscribing witness is not set forth in the affidavit of execution, its omission renders the registration invalid, and parties would not be affected with implied notice. (b) Under the new system no such irregularities can invalidate a registration, but any person deprived of property on account of any such action of the registrar, might recover compensation in an action against the person through whose fraud or wrongful act he suffered the loss, or against the District Registrar upon the *fiat* of the Attorney General; (c) and in certain cases the assurance fund might be made liable for damages. (d) In a case where a document had been improperly received by the Registrar General and placed on the register, it was\n\n(a) *Farmers and Traders Loan Co. v. Conklin*, 1 Man. L.

(g)\n\nIn Re Scarry and Joyce it was held (Bain, J., April, 1889) in Chambers that where an Administrator brings an action and fails, costs can only be given against the Administrator personally, and not against the estate, and that in an action not stated to have been brought as administrator, which had been dismissed with costs, a certificate of the judgment issued and filed in the Land Titles Office against the estate of the deceased could not bind the lands where the action was brought by the administrator after the death of the intestate, and an order was made requiring the Registrar General to remove the judgment from the register as a charge upon the said lands.\n\n75. When the witness to any instrument is dead or is out of this Province, any person who is or claims to be interested in the registration of the instrument, may make proof before a Judge in Manitoba, or before the Judge of any Superior Court of Record in any other Province of the Dominion or any portion of the British Empire of the execution of such instrument, and upon a certificate endorsed on such instrument and signed by such Judge, that the Judge is satisfied by the proof adduced of the due execution of the instrument, the District-Registrar shall register such instrument and certificate.\n\nCompare sec. 25 Land \"Registration Act of Manitoba,\" recited above under sec. 74. The proofs should be made in the Judge's presence.\n\n(e) Galt v. Kelly, 5 Man. L. R. 224.\n(f) Sec. 123 post.\n(g) Sec. 129 post.\n76. Whenever the memorial of any instrument has been entered in the Register Book, the District-Registrar shall, except in the case of transfer or other dealing endorsed upon any certificate or other instrument as hereinafter provided, record the like memorial on the duplicate certificate, or other instrument evidencing title to the land intended to be dealt with or in any way affected, unless the District-Registrar shall, as hereinafter provided, dispense with the production of the same; and the District-Registrar shall endorse on every instrument so registered a certificate of the day and hour at which the instrument was entered in the Register Book, and shall authenticate each such certificate by signing his name and affixing his seal thereto, and such certificate shall be received in all courts of law as conclusive evidence that such instrument has been duly registered, without proof of the signature of the District-Registrar.\n\nSee Rules 13 to 19, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante.\n\n77. The District-Registrar shall have power to reject any instrument appearing to be unfit for registration, and shall not register any instrument purporting to transfer or otherwise deal with or affect land under the new system, except in the manner herein provided for registration under the new system, nor unless such instrument be in accordance with the provisions of this Act as applicable to the new system, but any instrument substantially in conformity with the schedules to this Act, or an instrument of a like nature shall be sufficient, and, except as in this Section mentioned, no instrument shall be effectual to pass any interest in land under the new system or to render such land liable as security for the payment of money as against any bona fide transferee of such land, unless such instrument be executed and registered in accordance with this Act as applicable to the new system: Provided, however, that where an instrument, in accordance with the forms in use, or sufficient to pass an estate or interest in lands under the old system, deals with lands under the new system, the Inspector may, in his discretion in a proper case, direct the District-Registrar to register it under the new system, and when so registered it shall have the same effect as to the operative parts thereof, as, and shall by implication be held to contain all such covenants as are implied in an instrument of a like nature under the new system, and if it is a mortgage the mortgagee may, for the purpose of foreclosure or sale under the mortgage, elect to proceed either under the provisions of this Act or as if the land were subject to the old system, but in case he proceeds under the provisions of this Act, and the mortgage covers other land not under the new system, he must before doing so bring all the land intended to be foreclosed or sold under the new system.\n\nSee notes to secs. 58 and 74 ante, and sec. 95 post.\nThis section does not allow the Registrar the liberal discretion as to registration of instruments which was permitted by sec. 37 of the Act of 1885, but taken in connection with the special provisions of this Act relating to the instruments most frequently produced for registration (a) and the discretionary power given to the Inspector, it admits any document sufficient under either system to pass an estate or interest in lands, and makes it effective by adding implied covenants and regulating remedial proceedings.\n\nC. S. M. cap. 60, sec. 14, as amended is as follows:\n\n14. The following instruments and proceedings may be registered, namely:\n\n(1) Grants from the crown, deeds, conveyances, assurances, bonds and agreements for the sale or purchase of land, and all other instruments, including sheriffs, deeds of land sold by virtue of their office, certificates or deeds for the sale of lands for taxes, or any instruments in anywise affecting, in law, or in equity, lands in Manitoba;\n\n(2) Powers of attorney under which any deed, conveyance, assurance, discharge of mortgage or other instrument has been or may be executed;\n\n(3) Wills and devices of or affecting any lands;\n\n(4) Certificates of decrees of foreclosure, and all other decrees of proceeding of any Court of record in this Province affecting any title or interest in lands;\n\n(5) Certificate of the filing or dismissal of any bill, answer, or the taking of any proceedings in any courts of record in this Province, on its equity side, where by any title to or interest in lands may be brought in question;\n\n(6) Certificates of satisfaction of mortgages;\n\n(7) All other instruments in the first section of this Act mentioned, and every other instrument affecting lands in Manitoba, in law or equity or otherwise howsoever.\n\nThis clause is wide enough to admit of the registration of any documents, even sub-leases on such an order made by the Inspector under the discretionary power with which he is invested.\n\n(a) See secs. 45, 57, 69, 70, 72, 79, 81, 82, 86, 87-108, 110-117, 123, 130, 131, 133 and 142; also notes to sec. 144 post.\n\nMAN.L.A.\nCompare 49 Vic. cap. 22, secs. 3-5. The Victorian Act provides for the registration of Sheriff's deeds (sec. 106, and Sch. 15), but here no such case is included unless covered by this section. See also in same schedule the form of a transfer under decree or order of the Court.\n\nUnder the Act of 1885, all lands patented between the 1st July, 1885 and 18th May, 1888 were without an application or other action on the part of the owner\u2014subject to the provisions of the new system, but it was held (Re Irish, 2 Man. L. R. 361) that in respect to such lands, conveyances in the statutory form might be treated as substantially in conformity with the forms given in the Act. In this case (id. 367) Mr. Justice Dubuc expressed the opinion that instruments in the ordinary form executed before the issue of a certificate of title should have the usual effect they purport to have, but clearly they must be registered in order to be operative where the lands have been the subject of an application. Chief Justice Taylor said in delivering his judgment, (id. 372) that in the case of lands not brought under the Act, instruments according to its forms derived no meaning, force or effect from its provisions, and had no other effect than the words used would have as ordinary words. Mr. Justice Killam held (id. 373) that the application had the effect of bringing the lands under the Act, and that after it was made no instrument could affect the lands until duly registered under its provisions. See notes to sec. 59 Territorial Act, post.\n\nThe Inspector can now by an order under this section set many questions at rest by giving statutory effect to instruments which might under ordinary circumstances occasion still greater difficulties of construction than those noted in Re Irish. His power extends to instruments containing no specific descriptions as well as to those wherein the lands are described\u2014and not the least of the difficulties are those\nlikely to follow the registration of instruments affecting lands partly under the new and partly under the old system.\n\n78. Should two or more instruments executed by the same person and purporting to affect the same estate or interest be at the same time presented to the District-Registrar for registration, he shall register that instrument which shall be presented by the person producing certificate or other instrument evidencing title to such estate or interest.\n\nThe person acquiring an interest should insist upon the certificate being produced for the registration of his instrument.\n\n79. Whenever any easement or any incorporeal right in or over any land under the new system is created for the purpose of being annexed to or used and enjoyed together with other land under the new system, the District-Registrar shall also enter a memorial of the instrument creating such easement or incorporeal right upon the folium of the Register Book, constituted by the existing certificate of title of such other land.\n\nThis section relates to easements appurtenant, and does not include ways in gross. Compare sec. 64 of the Victorian Act, and the decision in *Ex parte Johnston*, 5 W. W. & A' B. (L) 55. At page 240 of A'Becket's *Transfer of Land Statute*, it is suggested that upon the acquisition of an easement, it would be proper for the owner to surrender the certificate of title and apply for a new one shewing the easement, as in Victorian. No certificate can issue for an easement only. Rules of the Victorian office noted at the page referred to; forms of clauses to create easements, *id.* p. 218; and form of surrender of easement, *id.* p. 282.\n\n80. In every instrument transferring an estate or interest in land under the new system, subject to mortgage or encumbrance, there shall be implied unless otherwise expressed, (a) the following covenant by the estate transferee, that is to say: That such transferee will pay the interest, annuity or rent charge secured by such mortgage or encumbrance, after the rate and at the time specified in the instrument creating the same, and will indemnify and keep harmless the transferrer from and against the principal sum or other moneys secured by such instrument, and from and\nagainst all liability in respect of any of the covenants therein contained or under this Act implied, on the part of transferrer.

As to estoppel by covenants, sec. 46 & 47 Vic. cap. 28.\n\n(a) Implied covenants may be modified by the terms of the instrument and are to be construed as against parties to the instrument severally not jointly. See sec. 144 post.\n\n(b) See sec. 145 post, as to obligation of an owner to allow the use of his name in suits.\n\nA similar covenant would be implied in equity on the conveyance of any similar estate. (Waring v. Ward 7 Ves., 336, 337.)\n\nIn Australian Deposit and Mortgage Co. v. Lord, 2 V.L.R. (L) 31, the meaning of implied covenants is discussed, and it was held that the object of the Act was not to create a new liability, but to make the transferee liable to covenants running with the land, and that the transferee did not become personally liable.\n\nThe Act of 1885, by sec. 90, which has been omitted in the present Statute provided an implied covenant on the part of the mortgagor, that he would keep buildings and improvements in repair, and that the mortgagee might enter at all reasonable times to view and inspect the state of repair.\n\n\u00a71. Every instrument signed by a proprietor or others claiming through or under him, purporting to pass an estate, or interest in land, for the registration of which provision is made by this Act, shall, until registered, be deemed to confer upon the person intended to take under such instrument, or others claiming through or under him, a right or claim to the registration of such estate or interest; and the District-Registrar, upon application made for that purpose by any person other than the person immediately claiming under or in respect of the instrument signed by a proprietor, may either reject such application altogether, or may direct the applicant to be registered as proprietor of the land, estate or interest forthwith, or at the expiration of some defined period of time, and may further direct\nsuch other entries to be made in the Register Book and such notices to be served as may be, in his opinion, necessary; Provided always, that on registering any such applicant the District-Registrar shall, so far as possible, enter the like memorial of every instrument produced by the applicant which may confer the right or claim aforesaid, as if such instrument had been duly presented for registration in its proper order of time, and the duplicate certificate of title shall be delivered up, and the like memorials, or other entries made thereon; and provided also, that no such registration shall be made if it would interfere with the right of any person claiming under any instrument previously registered under the new system.\n\nSee South Australian \"Torrens' Act\" (1885) sec. 258; Queensland Real Property Act of 1877, sec. 48. See also secs. 74 and 77 ante.\n\nMr. Gawlor, who settled the South Australian Consolidating Bill in 1885, states that this provision was first contained in his amending Act in the year 1878, and was rendered necessary on account of the Supreme Court having decided that neither contracts nor equities could be enforced against a person who had entered into or created such contracts or equities, even although the land still remained in his name as registered owner; and as no estate or interest passes except upon registration, power was given to register as owner a person who derived title through unregistered instruments, which ought to have been filed in regular order, but which were never actually so registered. For instance, without this provision, if the registered owner executed a transfer, and the transferee died before having had it placed on the register, his representatives would take nothing, as the transferee could only take the estate upon becoming its registered owner, and therefore had nothing to transmit. See Jones' Torrens' System, 279.\n\n\u00a72. Upon the transfer of any land, estate or interest, under the new system, to two or more persons as joint owners to be held by them as trustees, it shall be lawful for the transferrer to insert in the memorandum of transfer or other instrument the words \"no survivorship\"; and the District-Registrar shall in such case include such words in the memorial.\nof such instrument to be entered by him in the Register Book as hereinbefore directed; and shall also enter the said words upon any certificate of title issued to such joint owners pursuant to such memorandum of transfer; and any two or more persons registered as joint owners of any land, estate or interest, under the new system, held by them as trustees, may, by writing under their hand, authorize the District-Registrar to enter the words \"no survivorship\" upon the certificate of title, or other instrument evidencing their title to such estate or interest, and also upon the duplicate of such instrument in the Register Book or filed in his office, and after such entry has been made and signed by the District-Registrar in either such case as aforesaid, it shall not be lawful for any less number of joint proprietors than the number then registered to transfer or otherwise deal with the said land, estate or interest, without obtaining the sanction of the court or a judge thereof by an order on motion or petition.\n\nCompare 46 and 47 Vic. cap. 25.\n\nAs to tenants in common, see sec. 62 ante.\n\nThe insertion of these words is a precaution for the protection of cestui que trusts, as it is probable that none but trustees will be required to hold lands under joint proprietorship.\n\n83. Before making any such order as aforesaid, the court or a judge thereof shall, if it seems requisite, cause notice of intention so to do to be properly advertised, (a) and shall appoint a period of time within which it shall be lawful for any person interested to show cause why such order should not be issued; and thereupon it shall be lawful for the said court or judge in such order to give directions for the transfer of such land, estate or interest to any new owner or owners, solely or jointly, with or in the place of any existing owner or owners, or to make such order in the premises as the court or judge thinks just for the protection of the persons beneficially interested in such land estate or interest, or in the proceeds thereof; and upon such order being deposited with the District-Registrar he shall make such entries, and upon such entries being made, the executors or administrators, or the curator (b) of intestate estates, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the registered owner or owners of such mortgage, encumbrance or lease; and the District-Registrar shall note the fact of such registration by memorandum under his hand on the letters of administration, probate, or other instrument as aforesaid.\n\n(a) Vide C. S. M. cap. 7 sec. 73.\n(b) This office does not exist in Manitoba.\nTRUSTS AND NOTICE.\n\n84. Whenever in any grant or instrument under this Act, any mines Exception of minerals are excepted from the grant or transfer, the District-Registrar, on issuing a certificate of title, shall therein insert the words so used in the grant or instrument.\n\nSee sec. 63 (a) ante.\n\n85. Except in the case of fraud, no person contracting or dealing with, or taking or proposing to take a transfer from the registered owner of any registered estate or interest, shall be required or in any manner concerned to inquire into or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which such registered owner or any previous registered owner of the estate or interest, in question is or was registered, or to see to the application of trusts, the purchase money, or of any part thereof, or shall be affected by notice, direct, implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest, any money, rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding; and the knowledge that any trust of unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\n\nThe words \"trust of\" in the last line but one of this section are evidently intended for the words \"trust or.\"\n\nSee secs. 64, 65, and notes ante, and the following sec.\n\n86. The District-Registrar shall not make any entry in the Register Notice of any notice of trusts, whether expressed, implied or constructive, but registered trusts may be declared by any instrument or deed, which instrument or deed may include as well, land under the provisions of the new system as May declare lands which are not under the provisions thereof, provided that the descriptions of the several parcels of the land contained in such instrument or deed shall sufficiently distinguish the land which is under the provisions of the new system from the land which is not under the provisions thereof; and a duplicate or an attested copy of such instrument may be deposited with the District-Registrar for safe custody and reference, but shall not be registered.\n\nSee sec. 68 (5) ante, and secs. 117, 28, 129 post.\n\nCompare 49 Vic. cap. 13.\n\nMost of the provisions as to express trusts apply equally to implied trusts, but a person dealing with a trustee without actual notice could not be deprived of any acquired rights except on account of positive dishonesty; it would not be\nsufficient that he was merely censurably indifferent to the rights of others. (a)\n\nTrusts and contracts may be enforced against the registered owner as formerly, and he may be wholly or partially deprived of his interests by a Court of Equity, or compelled to apply the proceeds as justice may require. (b)\n\nIn Queensland the Royal Commission of Inquiry respecting the working of the Real Property Acts 1861-1877, made the following comments at page 14 of their report presented to both houses of Parliament in 1879.\n\n\"29. We think that the system of the Real Property Acts with respect to property held by trustees is unsatisfactory and dangerous. It not only does not impose, but practically forbids the imposition of any safeguards against fraud. Two methods of dealing with this matter appear to be practicable.\"\n\n\"(1) To provide for the lodging by a cestui que trust of a perpetual caveat against any dealing with the land by the trustee; (2) To state the trusts on the face of the instrument of titles, and (3) To notify by memorandum endorsed upon it the existence of trusts. The first of these methods, which has very lately been adopted in New South Wales, appears to us unsatisfactory. The second and third are, no doubt, open to the objection that on any dealing with land by a trustee, the Registrar-General or Master of Titles would be charged with the duty of seeing that the dealing was within his powers. This duty, however, he performs at present in every case in which land which has been settled upon trust is sought to be brought under the Act, and in many cases of transmission of title by will, and we can see no reason why he should not\n\n(a) Robertson v. Keith, 1 Vict. Reps. Eq. 11; Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Pie, 6 V. L. R. (Eq.) 186.\n(b) Maddison v. McCarthy, 6 Wy. W & A'B. Eq. 151.\nexercise the same function in all cases of trusts. We think that this change in the law, while it would effectually prevent frauds by trustees, would not unduly increase the labours of the Master of Titles beyond those which we think ought to be performed by him under the existing law, and we recommend that it be adopted.\"\n\nMr. Harding moved, that after the word \"trusts,\" in line 11, the following words be inserted:\u2014 \"If the method thirdly mentioned be adopted, it would be necessary to repeal such parts of 'The Real Property Acts' as allow trustees to receive certificates of title, and deal with the land as if they were its beneficial owners, and to provide that all certificates of title issued to trustees should be distinguished by memorandum endorsed thereon (for example: \"The registered proprietor is a trustee. The trusts are declared by an instrument dated made between\n\nand\n\nand numbered\n\n\"), and that all persons dealing with a proprietor holding a certificate so distinguished, should be deemed to have notice of the contents of the instrument declaring the trusts, and that the Registrar-General on receiving for registration any instrument purporting to deal with such land, should, before registering it, refer to the instrument declaring the trust; and if such dealing should not be authorized thereby, he should forthwith enter up a caveat in the names of the beneficiaries forbidding the registration of such instrument, which caveat should have precedence of the application to register such instrument.\"\n\n87. When any land under the new system is intended to be leased or demised for a life or lives, or for any term of years exceeding one year, the owner shall execute a lease in the form contained in Schedule E to this Act, and every such instrument shall, for description of the land intended to be dealt with, refer to the certificate of title of the land; or\nshall give such other description as may be necessary to identify such land; and a right for, or covenant by the lessee, to purchase the land therein described may be stipulated in such instrument, and in case the lessee pays the purchase money stipulated, and otherwise observes his covenants expressed and implied in such instrument, the lessor shall be bound to execute a memorandum of transfer to such lessee of the said land, and to perform all necessary acts, by this Act prescribed, for the purpose of transferring land to the purchaser: Provided always, that no lease of land, subject to any prior registered mortgage or encumbrance, shall be valid and binding against the mortgagee or encumbrancee, unless such mortgagee or encumbrancee shall have consented to such lease, prior to the same being registered.\n\nSee secs. 92, 93 and 94 post as to consent to surrender.\n\nProvisions as to implied covenants are set out in secs. 88, 89 and 144 post.

The covenantor, his executors, administrators, or transferees will, during the continuance of the said term, erect and put upon the boundaries of the said land, or on those boundaries on which no substantial fence now exists, a good and substantial fence.\n\n3. That he will perform the conditions of the covenants as required.\n\n3. The covenantor, his executors, administrators, or transferees will, at all times during the said term, cultivate, use, and manage in a proper husbandlike manner all such parts of the land as are now or shall hereafter with the consent in writing of the said lessor or his transferees, be broken up or converted into tillage, and will not impoverish or waste the same.\n\n*Note: These words in italics are omitted in the Act.\n\n92. Whenever any lease or demise which is required to be registered under the new system is intended to be surrendered, and the surrender otherwise\nthereof is effected otherwise than through the operation of a surrender in law, or than under the provisions of any law relating to bankrupt estates, there shall be endorsed upon such lease or counterpart thereof the word \"surrendered,\" with the date of such surrender, and such endorsement shall be signed by the lessee and the lessor as evidence of the acceptance thereof, and shall be attested by a witness and the District-Registrar shall thereupon enter in the Register a memorial recording the date of such surrender, and shall likewise endorse upon the lease a memorandum recording the fact of such entry having been so made in the register, and upon such entry having been so made, the estate or interest of the lessee in such land shall vest in the lessor or in the person in whom, having regard to intervening circumstances, if any, the said land would have vested if no such lease had ever been executed, and the production of such lease or counterpart bearing such endorsed memorandum, shall be sufficient evidence that such lease has been so surrendered: Provided that no lease subject to mortgage or encumbrance shall be surrendered without the consent of the mortgagee or encumbrancee.\n\nCompare sec. 87 ante, as to consent.\n\nSee sec. 81 ante, as to intermediate dealings.\n\n93. Upon any assignment being made by any lessee for the benefit of his creditors, the District-Registrar, unless the land be subject to a mortgage or encumbrance under the provisions of this Act, shall, upon the application in writing of the lessor, accompanied by a statement in writing signed by the assignee or trustee under such assignment, certifying his refusal to accept such lease, or shall, upon the order of the court on the application of the lessor, enter in the Register a note of such refusal or order, and such entry shall operate as a surrender of such lease.\n\nSee sec. 87 and notes ante.\n\n94. Upon any assignment for the benefit of his creditors being made by any lessee or owner of any land registered, where the land is subject to mortgage or encumbrance, the District-Registrar shall, upon the application in writing of the mortgagee or encumbrancee, accompanied by a statement in writing signed by the assignee or trustee of such lessee or owner, certifying his refusal to accept such lease, enter in the Register Book a note of such application and refusal, and such entry shall vest the interest of the lessee in such lease in such mortgagee or encumbrancee; and if such mortgagee or encumbrancee shall neglect or decline to make such application as aforesaid, the District-Registrar upon application by the lessor, and proof of such neglect or refusal, and of the matters aforesaid, shall enter in the Register Book notice of such neglect or refusal.\nof such assignee to accept such lease, and such entry shall operate as a surrender of such lease.\n\nSee sec. 87 and notes ante.\n\nMortgages and Encumbrances.\n\n95. Any mortgage or other encumbrance created by any party right fully in possession of lands prior to the issue of the certificate of title may be filed in the office of the District Registrar, who shall endorse upon the certificate of title and duplicate thereof a memorandum of such encumbrance, and when so entered and endorsed the said mortgage or encumbrance shall be as fully valid as if made subsequent to the issue of the certificate of title; and should more than one mortgage or encumbrance be filed, they shall be registered in the order of time in which they have been filed in the office.\n\nSee secs. 74, 76, 77 and 78 ante, and notes.\n\nThis is almost identical with sec. 139 of the Act revised and consolidated with an extended application adding greatly to its usefulness in facilitating dealings. Such instruments may be in the statutory short forms, or in any form sufficient to pass an estate or interest under the old system, but, as the forms given in this Act are only operative under the statute, they cannot be used under this section or have their statutory effect or meaning until the title to the lands has been registered under the new system; but see sec. 81 ante, as to their effect.\n\nApparently a sub-mortgage or an assignment of a mortgage could not be filed or registered under this section.\n\nAs to the effect of a lease as an encumbrance see note to sec. 87 ante.\n\n96. Whenever any land or estate, or interest in land, under the new system is intended to be charged or made security in favor of any mortgagee, the mortgagor shall execute a memorandum of mortgage in the form contained in Schedule C to this Act, or to the like effect; and whenever any such land is intended to be charged with or made security for the payment of an annuity, rent charge or sum of money, in favor of any encumbrancee, the encumbrancer shall execute a memorandum of encumbrance in form contained in Schedule D to this Act, or to the\nlike effect; and every such instrument shall contain an accurate statement of the estate or interest intended to be mortgaged or encumbered, and shall for description of the land intended to be dealt with, refer to the certificate of title on which such estate or interest is held, or shall give such other description as shall be necessary to identify such land, together with all mortgages or encumbrances affecting the same.\n\nNo sealing appears to be necessary by the parties to mortgages or encumbrances. As to limitations see 46 and 47 Vic. cap. 26, secs. 18-23, and compare interpretation of the word \"mortgage,\" sec. 8 (4) ante. Qu\u00e6re, whether the \"covenant\" would require a seal. See note to sec. 144 post.\n\nAs to implied covenants on the part of a transferee of mortgaged premises see sec. 80 ante; See secs. 103-106 post as to powers of mortgagees; and sec. 109 post as to custody of mortgaged certificates of title.\n\nShort form covenants are given in Sch. N, sec. 91 ante.\n\nAs to covenants operating an estoppel see 46 & 47 Vic. c. 28.\n\nLeases upon mortgaged premises must be consented to by the mortgagee or encumbrancer before registration, (vide sec. 87 ante) and likewise before they can be surrendered (secs. 92, 93 and 94 ante). Mortgages may be transferred wholly or partially, and one portion preferred or deferred to the other (sec. 98), and the mortgagee's rights and privileges pass to the transferee (sec. 99). As to discharges, see sec. 100 post, and as to the equitable jurisdiction of the Court, secs. 123 and 129 post.\n\nA sub-mortgage executed conformably to the old system can be registered under this Act, see secs. 77 and 81 ante; but the original mortgage should be produced for endorsement with a memorial (sec. 76 ante).\n\nA second mortgage may be in the same form as a first mortgage, but it should refer to the first mortgage as an encumbrance.\nEquitable mortgages may be effected by depositing the certificate of title where it has not been impounded under sec. 109, and could be protected if necessary by caveat (sec. 130 post). London Chartered Bank v. Hayes, 2 V. R. (E.) 104; 2 A. J. R. 60; Patchell v. Mannsell, 7 V. L. R. (E.) 6; and if the caveat is allowed to lapse, notice of the equitable mortgage would not secure the equitable mortgagee if the Registrar chooses to dispense with the production of the certificate of title.\n\nSee notes to sec. 68 (1) ante.\n\nSCHEDULE C.\n\nMEMORANDUM OF MORTGAGE.\n\nI, A.

Mortgage and encumbrance under the new system shall have effect as security, but shall not operate as a transfer of the land thereby charged.\n\nThere is no \"Grant\" effected by this instrument called a \"Mortgage\"; it is actually a hypothec. Section 77 allows instruments in the forms under the old system to be registered in the discretion of the inspector, but so far as its operation affects lands under the new system, it is still merely a hypothec, and the \"Grant\" passes no estate.\n\nNo bill for foreclosure could be filed upon a mortgage in the new form, as the legal title is not in the mortgagee, the procedure in the Act alone can be resorted to in case of default. *Greig v. Watson*, 7 V. L. R. (E) 79; *National Bank of Australasia v. Hand in Hand, etc., Co'y*, 4 App. Cases, P. C. 891, 405.\n\n98. Mortgages, encumbrances and leases may be transferred by a Transfer of transfer executed in the form contained in Schedule G to this Act or by a separate transfer. The transfer must be registered in the manner hereinbefore set forth, and transferees shall have priority according to the date and time of registration. And any mortgagee may transfer a part of the sum secured by the mortgage by a transfer executed in the form of Schedule H to this Act or by a separate transfer (Schedule F); and the part so transferred shall continue to be secured by the mortgage and may be given priority over the remaining part or may be deferred or may continue to rank equally with it under the security of the original mortgage, as may be stated in the instrument of transfer; and the District-Registrar shall enter on the certificate of title a memorial of the amount of the mortgage so transferred, the name of the transferee, and how the sum so transferred is to rank, and shall notify the mortgagor of the facts.\n\nSee 49 Vic. cap. 13, as to transfers by personal representatives; cap. 35, sec. 31, as to the seizure and sale of mortgages under execution.\n\nSCHEDULE F.\n\nForm of Transfer of a Lease, Mortgage or Charge.\n\nI, of being registered as the owner of a lease (or mortgage or charge, as the case may be, numbered of (or upon) the land hereafter described subject to the encum-\nbrances notified hereunder in consideration of the sum of paid to me by C.

Where none exist these words may be omitted.\n\nNo witness appears to be required in this and the following Schedule, although made necessary in transfers by endorsement (sec. 72 ante), and endorsed discharges (sec. 100 post). It is probable that in most cases attestation by a witness as provided by section 74 ante, would be required\nbefore registration although it may be doubted whether such an endorsement is an \"instrument\" as interpreted by sec. 3 (12) ante.\n\nSCHEDULE H.\n\nFORM OF TRANSFER OF PART OF MORTGAGE OR ENCUMBRANCE BY ENDORSEMENT.\n\nI, the within named C. D., in consideration of $ this day paid to me by X.

Upon the registration of any transfer of any mortgage, encumbrance or lease, the estate or interest of the transferrer, as set forth in such instruments, with all rights, powers, and privileges thereto belonging or appertaining, shall pass to the transferee, and such transferee shall thereupon become subject to and liable for all and every the same requirements and liabilities to which he would have been subject and liable if named in such instrument originally as mortgagee, encumbrancee or lessee of such land, estate, or interest.\n\nThe transfer is effective only upon registration, see sec. 74 ante.\n\nUpon transmission on death or insolvency the personal representative or assignee would require to be registered as owner. See secs. 114 and 115 post.\n\nAs to implied covenants, see secs. 80, 88, 89 and 91 ante. Compare also sec. 89 of the Real Property Act of 1885, which has been omitted in the present Act. It made provision as to suits by transferees.\n100. Upon the production of any memorandum of mortgage or encumbrance, having thereon an endorsement signed by the mortgagee or encumbrancee, and attested by a witness, (a) or of any separate memorandum of discharge of mortgage, duly executed, discharging the land from the whole or part of the principal sum or annuity, secured, or discharging any part of the land comprised in such instrument from the whole of such principal sum or annuity, the District-Registrar shall make an entry in the Register, noting that such mortgage or encumbrance is discharged wholly or partially or that part of the land is discharged as aforesaid, as the case may require; and upon such entry being so made, (7) the land or the estate or interest in, or the portion of the land mentioned or referred to in such endorsement or memorandum of discharge as aforesaid, shall cease to be subject to or liable for such principal sum or annuity, or (as the case may be), for the part thereof noted in such entry as discharged. (b)\n\n(a) See sec. 74 ante, as to manner of attestation and when it becomes effective by registration.\n\n(b) See secs. 123 and 129 as to jurisdiction of the court to order a discharge.\n\nCompare 49 Vic. cap. 13, secs. 5-7, and cap. 22, secs. 3-5.\n\nThe provisions of the Lands Registration Act of Manitoba as to discharges are as follows:\n\n36. When any registered mortgage shall have been satisfied, the Registrar, on receiving a certificate executed by the mortgagee, or if the mortgage has been assigned and such assignment registered, then executed by such assignee, or by such other person as may be entitled by law to receive the money and to discharge such mortgage, in the form D to this Act, or to the like effect, executed in the presence of one witness, and duly proven by the oath of the subscribing witness thereto, in the same manner as herein provided for the proof of other instruments affecting lands, shall register the same and every affidavit attached thereto or endorsed thereon, at full length in its proper order, in the Registry Book, and numbering it in like manner as other instruments are required to be registered and numbered, and also by writing in the margin of the Register wherein the said mortgage has been registered, words to the following effect: \"\u2014\u2014\u2014 see certificate purporting to be discharge, signed by \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014, (naming the person who has executed the same)\" and \"see registry number of such certificate, book (stating the same according to the fact)\" and to which marginal entry the Registrar or his deputy shall affix his name, and the same shall be deemed a discharge of such mortgage; and such certificate so registered shall be\nvalid and effectual in law as a release of such mortgage, and as a conveyance to the mortgagor, his heirs, or assigns, or any person lawfully claiming by, through or under him or them, of the original estate of the mortgage.\n\nFORM D.\n\n(Sec. 36, cap. 60, C. S. M.)\n\nTo the Registrar of the county of\n\nI, , of the do certify that hath satisfied all money due on, or to grow due on (or hath satisfied the sum of $ mentioned in) a certain mortgage made by of to which mortgage bears date the day of 18', and was registered in the registry office for the county of on day of 18', at minutes past o'clock of the noon, in Liber as No. (here mention the day and date of registration of each assignment thereof, and the names of the parties, or mention that such mortgage has not been assigned, as the fact may be), and that I am the person entitled by law to receive the money, and that such mortgage, (or such sum of money as aforesaid, or such part of the lands as is herein particularly described, that is to say: ) is therefore discharged.\n\nWitness my hand this day of 18'\n\nOne witness.\n\nSee form of affidavit sec. 74 ante.\n\n\u00a7 37. In case the mortgagee or any assignee of the mortgagee, desires to release or discharge part only of the lands contained in such mortgage, or to release or discharge only part of the money specified in the mortgage, he may do so by deed or by a certificate to be made, executed, proven and registered in the same manner as in cases where the whole lands and mortgage are wholly released and discharged; and such deed or certificate shall contain as precise a description of the portion of lands so released or discharged as would be necessary to be contained in an instrument of conveyance for registry under this Act, and also a precise statement of the amount or particular sum or sums so released or discharged.\n\n38. Every certificate of payment or discharge of the mortgage, or of the conditions therein, or of the lands or of any part of the same, or of Certificate of payment or dis-\nany part of the money, by the mortgagee, or his assignee, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, or any one of them, at whatsoever time given, and whether before or after the time limited by the mortgage for payment or performance, shall be valid, if in conformity with this Act to all intents and purposes whatsoever as herein mentioned.\n\nCompare sec. 84 Real Property Act, 1885, as to proof of payment being sufficient to authorize discharge.\n\nIt does not now appear to be within the power of the District-Registrar to enter a discharge of mortgage unless all formalities are complied with, as to execution, attestation, etc., nor could the Inspector allow it to be received unless it amounted to a \"release\" of the lands, as sec. 77 ante only authorizes him to use this discretion where the instrument is sufficient to pass an estate.\n\n101. If any mortgagor becomes entitled to pay off the mortgage money, and the registered mortgagee is absent from this Province, and there is no person authorized by registered power of attorney to give a receipt to the mortgagor for the mortgage-money after the date appointed for the redemption of any mortgage, it shall be lawful for the Treasurer of this Province to receive such mortgage-money with all arrears of interest then due thereon, in trust for the mortgagee or other person entitled thereto, and thereupon the interest upon such mortgage shall cease to run or accrue, and the District-Registrar shall, upon presentation of the receipt of the said Treasurer, for the amount of the said mortgage-money and interest, and upon proof being made to his satisfaction that such payment satisfies all moneys due and owing upon such mortgage, cause an entry to be made in the Register discharging such mortgage, stating the day and hour on which such entry is made and such entry shall be a valid discharge for such mortgage and shall have the same force and effect as is hereinbefore given to a like entry when made upon the production of a discharge of mortgage, and the District-Registrar shall endorse on the certificate of title or other instrument as aforesaid, (a) and also on the memorandum of mortgage, whenever those instruments shall be brought to him for that purpose, the several particulars hereinbefore directed to be endorsed upon each of such instruments respectively. Such moneys so paid to the Provincial Treasurer shall be paid over by him to the person or persons entitled thereto (b) on application.\n\n(a) Sec. 109 post, provides for the impounding of the certificate to have it available for such endorsements.\n(b) To the mortgagee or the transferee or personal representative of the mortgagee (s. 99).\n\n102. Upon proof of the death (a) of the annuitant, (b) or of the occurrence of the event or circumstance upon which, in accordance with the provisions of any memorandum of encumbrance, the annuity or sum of money thereby secured shall cease to be payable, and upon proof all arrears of the said annuity and interest or money have been paid, satisfied or discharged, the District-Registrar shall make an entry in the Register, noting that such annuity or sum of money is satisfied and discharged, and shall cancel such instrument; and upon such entry being made, the land shall cease to be subject to or liable for such annuity or sum of money, and the District-Registrar shall, in any or either such case (sic) as aforesaid endorse on the certificate of title, or other instrument evidencing the title of the mortgagor or encumbrancer to the land mortgaged or encumbered a memorandum of the date on which such entry as aforesaid was made by him in the Register, whenever such certificate of title, or other instrument is presented to him for that purpose.\n\n(a) In this case the lands are released by the fact of the death of the annuitant or the occurrence of the event or circumstance, and registration is only for the purpose of clearing the Register, after the lands have ceased to be bound.\n\n(b) Annuitant is the term used in Victoria when referring to an encumbrance.\n\n103. In case default be made in the payment of the principal sum, interest, annuity or rent charge, (a) or any part thereof secured by or in the observance of any covenant expressed in any mortgagee or encumbrance registered under the new system, or that is herein declared to be implied in such instrument, (a) and such default be continued for the space of one calendar month, or for such longer period of time as may therein for that purpose be expressly limited, (b) the mortgagee or encumbrance may forthwith, after giving written notice, (c) a copy of which shall be filed in the Land Titles Office, (d) to the said mortgagor or encumbrancer, his executors, administrators or assigns, and every other person appearing at the time of filing such notice in the Land Titles Office to have any estate, right or interest in or to the lands subsequent to such mortgage or encumbrance, of his intention in that behalf, without any further consent or concurrence, upon his or their part enter into possession of the lands and receive and take the rents, issues and profits thereof, and whether in or out of possession thereof to make any lease.\nof the same or any part thereof as he may see fit, and may also in such notice require the mortgagor or encumbrancer and such other interested persons as aforesaid to pay within a time to be specified in such notice the money then due or owing on such mortgage or encumbrance, or to observe the covenants therein expressed or implied, as the case may be, and that all remedies competent will be resorted to unless such default be remedied.\n\nCompare sec. 84 of the Victorian Act.\n\n(a) The powers are similar in the case of a mortgage or encumbrance, but apply only to those which have been executed and registered under the new system. These powers are only exercisable on notice, given as provided by this section, and not until at least one month after service of the notice. Vide sec. 104 post.\n\n(b) Where no time is limited by the instrument the default must have continued for at least one calendar month. An instance of such variation of time occurs in National Bank of Australasia v. United Hand in Hand Co., 4 App. Cases 391, 406. As to the method of computing time see Rule 23, Sch. S, sec 26 ante. Notice and default cannot run concurrently.\n\n(c) This notice may be given by the personal representative or assignee after registration as owner, (secs. 114, 115 post), or registered transferee of the mortgagee (sec. 99 ante), and may also contain a notice of intention to apply for a foreclosure order (see sec. 106 post), and may be in the form following the notes to this section. If the mortgage makes it optional with the mortgagee to require payment of principal on default made in the payment of interest, the exercise of the option should distinctly appear by the notice. The notice may be given by an agent, and it would be sufficient if it were shewn that notice in fact reached the mortgagor: McDonald v. Rowe, 3 A.J.R. 90. Upon a notice to pay interest only the mortgagee may proceed to sell for both principal and interest, although the\ntime for payment of principal has not arrived, provided default has been made in the payment of the interest: *Harvey v. Inglis*, 5 W. W., and A'B. (E) 125. Notice may be served substitutionally as provided in the instrument or as the Registrar may direct under the proviso to sec. 106 post. The omission to give such notices, or the non-receipt thereof, would have no effect as against a purchaser or *bona fide* encumbrancer (see sec. 143 post); but notice ought to be given to all persons appearing by the Register or Caveat Book to be interested. According to Sedgefield's *Practice of the Office of Titles of Victoria*, service on the executor or administrator of the mortgagor, or on the assignee of his insolvent estate, is not sufficient unless he has been registered as owner. Compare secs. 114 and 115 post. A transferee must register before he is entitled to notice, *vide* secs. 80 and 99 ante.\n\nAs to service of notices see secs. 54 and 55 ante. The District Registrar cannot authorize substitutional service of such notices. Compare sec. 79 of the Act of 1885.\n\n(d) See sec. 108 post.\n\n**NOTICE BY MORTGAGEE.**\n\n**The Real Property Act of 1889.**\n\nMANITOBA\n\nTO WIT.\n\nIn the matter of\n\n(here describe the lands)\n\nI,\n\n(The names and additions of the mortgagee, encumbrancee or person for the time being registered owner of the mortgage or rent charge.)\n\nhereby give you notice that demand payment of the sum of and interest thereon at the rate of per centum per annum, from the day of one thousand eight hundred and due to the said upon a certain indenture of mortgage executed by to and dated the day of one thousand eight\nhundred and for securing the repayment of\nand interest thereon, as therein mentioned, on the lands above described.\ndefault having been made in payment of the secured by\nsaid mortgage (or in the observance of the covenants therein as the case may\nbe) for the space of over one calendar month.\n\nAnd take notice, that unless payment of the said mortgage money and\ninterest be made (or such default be remedied) within calendar\nmonth from the time of your being served herewith,\nthe said\n(mortgagee, encumbrancee, or, as the case may be), will proceed\nwith or without any consent or concurrence on your part, or of any\nperson claiming through or under you subsequently to such mortgage,\nand without any further notice to you to enter into possession of the said\nmortgaged lands and premises, and to receive and take the rents, issues\nand profits thereof; and whether in or out of possession of the same, to\nmake any lease or leases of the same, as\nthe said\nshall see fit, and that all remedies competent\nwill be resorted to unless such default be remedied.\n\nAnd after such default in payment continuing for the further space of\none month as aforesaid\nthe said (mortgagee, encumbrancee, or\nas the case may be) will proceed to sell the land so mortgaged or encum-\nbered or any part thereof and all the estate or interest therein of the\nmortgagor in such manner and upon such terms as\nmay think\nfit and pursuant to the provisions of the Real Property Act of 1869.\n\nAnd take notice, that in the event of a sale not realizing sufficient to\nsatisfy the moneys secured by said mortgage together with the expenses\noccasioned by such sale, then the said (mortgagee, encumbrancee, or as the\ncase may be) will after such default shall have continued for six months\nafter the time mentioned in said mortgage for payment, make an appli-\ncation in writing to the District-Registrar for an order for foreclosure.\n\nDated at this day of A.D. 18\n\nMortgagee\n(or as the case may be);\n\n104. After such default in payment or in the observance of covenants\ncontinuing for the further space of one calendar month from the date of\nservice of such notice, such mortgagee or incumbrancee (a) is hereby\nauthorized and empowered to sell the land so mortgaged or encumbered,\nor any part thereof, and all the estate or interest therein of the\nmortgagor or encumbrancer and of the other interested persons referred\nto in the last preceding section, and either altogether, or in lots, by\npublic auction or by private contract or both such modes of sale (b)\nand subject to such conditions as he may think fit, (c) without being liable\nfor any losses occasioned thereby; (d) and to make and execute all such\ninstruments as shall be necessary for the sale or enjoyment thereof, and all of which sales, contracts, matters and things hereby authorized shall be as valid and effectual as if the mortgagor or encumbrancer and other persons as aforesaid had made, done or executed the same; (e) and the receipt in writing of the mortgagee or encumbrancee Receipt for shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser of such land, estate or purchase interest, or of any portion thereof, for so much of his purchase money as may be thereby expressed to be received; and no such purchaser shall be answerable for the loss, misapplication or non-application, or be obliged to see to the application of the purchase money by him paid, nor shall he be obliged to inquire as to the fact of any default or notice having been made or given as aforesaid, or how the purchase money to arise from the sale of any such land, estate or interest shall be applied; (f) but such purchase money shall be applied: firstly, in payment of the expenses occasioned by such sale; secondly, in payment of the moneys which may then be due or owing to the mortgagee or encumbrancee; thirdly, in payment of subsequent mortgages or encumbrances, if any, in the order of their priority; and the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the mortgagor or encumbrancer, as the case may be. (g)\n\n(a) The notice served as required by the preceding section may also be given by the registered personal representative, assignee or transferee; see notes to sec. 103 ante.\n\n(b) A sale under this power is bad if the land be sold together with other lands in mortgage from the same mortgagor under the old system by one contract and at one price. Ross v. The Victorian Permanent Building Society, 8 V. L. R. (E.) 254; and sembl\u00e9 on a sale by one mortgagee of several mortgages from one mortgagor, all under the Act separate and distinct sales would also be necessary.\n\nSee sec. 77 ante as to proceedings on informal instruments.\n\nIt seems necessary in most cases to sell by public auction in order to have the market value established by a sale or failure to sell for an upset price after sufficient notice and publication. It must also be borne in mind that it is a condition precedent to foreclosure in sec. 106 post, that the land be put up for sale by a licensed auctioneer at public auction.\n(c) Unusual or harsh conditions should not be required.\n\n(d) The mortgagee or encumbrancee selling under power of sale is liable to all the obligations as to prudent administration imposed on executors and trustees. *Latch v. Furlong*, 12 Gr. 303.\n\n(e) The form of transfer \"Schedule B\" (sec. 72) may be varied to suit the circumstances. It should recite that the sale is made by the mortgagee under power of sale and omit the words \"registered owner.\"\n\nIn Victoria the Office of Titles before registering a transfer under power of sale requires proof of demand, where the money is payable on demand, of default having happened and continued as recommended in *Ex parte Hassall*, c. 10, S. C. R. (L) 292, 299, by the Supreme Court of New South Wales; of service of notice, as approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in *Re National Bank of Australasia v. Hand in Hand Co.*, App. Cases 391.\n\nThe happening and continuance of default should be proved by the affidavit or statutory declaration of the mortgagee or of some person having knowledge of the facts, stating his means of knowledge.\n\nWhere notice has been given by letter, the post office registration receipt ought to be produced.\n\nAll these proofs could be dispensed with on production of a written waiver of notice or consent from the mortgagor or owner of the land to the transfer. Such waiver or consent may be given by the official assignee or personal representative of the mortgagor or owner for the time being when registered as proprietor.\n\n(f) See secs. 64 and 85 ante, and secs. 133 and 143 post.\n\n(g) Compare secs. 85 and 86 Victorian Land Transfer Statute, and sec. 57, Queensland Act.\n\nA purchaser at a mortgage sale under powers should ascertain the interest of any tenant in possession of the\nland, for the mortgagor might, after mortgaging, have created a tenancy in the land not binding on the mortgagee, (see sec. 87 ante) but diminishing its annual value; and the effect of the new certificate may be to legalize the tenancy as against the purchaser. In such a case the mortgagee should be required to obtain the actual occupation, or to compel the tenant to accept a holding beneficial to the purchaser. Compare Colonial Bank v. Roach, 1 V. R. (L) 165; 1 A. J. R. 136.\n\n105. Upon the registration of any memorandum or instrument of transfer executed by a mortgagee or encumbrance, for the purpose of vesting estate in such sale, as aforesaid, the estate or interest of the mortgagor or encumbrancer and all subsequent encumbrances therein described as to be conveyed, shall pass to and vest in the purchaser, freed and discharged from all liability on account of such mortgage or encumbrance, or of any mortgage or encumbrance registered subsequent thereto, and the purchaser shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the same.\n\nAs to Form see note (e), sec. 104 ante.\n\nNo interest passes to the purchaser until registration. See secs. 74 and 77 and notes ante; sec. 144 post.\n\nCompare secs. 42, 53, 58, 87 and 106, Victorian Land Transfer Statute. See also National Bank of Australasia v. Hand in Hand, etc., 4 App. Cases 391, 407; London Chartered Bank of Australasia v. Hayes, 2 V. R. (E) 104; 2 A. J. R. 60; Kickham v. The Queen, 8 V. L. R. (E) 1,250.\n\n106. Whenever default has been made in payment of the principal or interest moneys secured by a mortgage registered under the new system, and such default shall be continued for six months after the time for payment mentioned in the mortgage, the mortgagee or his transferee may make application in writing to the District-Registrar for an order for foreclosure and such application shall state that such default has been made and has continued for the period aforesaid, and that the land mortgaged has been offered for sale by public auction by a licensed auctioneer after a notice of sale served as hereinbefore provided, and that the amount of the highest bid at such sale was not sufficient to satisfy the moneys secured by such mortgage together with the expenses occasioned by such sale; and that such notice or a subsequent notice served upon the same\npersons declared the intention of the mortgagee or his transferee to make an application for foreclosure in case such sale proved abortive, and such application shall be accompanied by a statutory declaration or affidavit of the auctioneer by whom such land was put up for sale and such other proof of the matters stated by the applicant as the District-Registrar may require.\n\nProvided that unless the District-Registrar shall see fit to otherwise order, such notice shall be served personally on such mortgagor or encumbrancer and other persons interested as aforesaid, but in case he or they cannot, after due diligence, be found, the District-Registrar may direct service of such notice by being left on the mortgaged lands, or by the same being sent through the post office by a registered letter directed to him or them at his or their last known address or in such other manner as the District-Registrar may direct.\n\nSee notes and form of notice, secs. 103, 104 ante. This procedure is permitted only in the case of mortgages and does not apply to encumbrances, but see next section.\n\nThe application in writing necessary under this section may be in the following form:\n\n**Form of Application for Foreclosure Order.**\n\n*The Real Property Act of 1889.*\n\n**Manitoba,**  \n**Land Titles District of**  \n**To Wit:**  \n\n*In re Application No.*  \n*and Mortgage No.* affecting  \n\n*(Here describe lands.)*\n\n**To The District Registrar,\u2014**\n\nThe Mortgagee hereby applies for an order of foreclosure under the above Act against (describe mortgagor) of all his estate, right, title, interest and equity of redemption in said lands and declares:\n\n1. That default has been made in the payment of the moneys secured by the said mortgage and that such default has continued for more than six months after the time of payment mentioned therein.\n\n2. That after notices duly given as provided by said Act the said mortgaged lands were on the day of A.D. 18 offered for sale at public auction by a licensed auctioneer at the time and place mentioned in such notices and the highest bid made at such sale was not sufficient to satisfy the moneys secured by such mortgage together with the expenses occasioned by such sale.\n3. That notice of the mortgagee's intention to apply for foreclosure in case the sale proved abortive, has been served on the mortgagor, and all other persons appearing to have any estate, right or interest, in the said lands subsequent to said mortgage.\n\nDated at this day of A.D. 18\n\nSignature of mortgagee\n\nby\n\nHis Solicitor.\n\n(Here follow affidavits as to fitness of auctioneer, fairness of sale and truth of facts alleged with schedules, etc., annexed).\n\nThe auctioneer is required to make declaration as to the sale.\n\n107. Upon such application the District-Registrar may, if he considers it proper, cause notice to be published once in each of three successive weeks in such newspaper or newspapers as the District-Registrar may direct offering such land for private sale, and shall appoint a time not less than one month from the date of the first of such advertisements, or in case there is no advertisement not less than one month from the date of such application (a) upon or after which the District-Registrar may issue to such applicant an order for foreclosure (b) unless in the interval a sufficient amount has been obtained by the sale of such lands or paid by or on behalf of such mortgagor or encumbrancer or other person as aforesaid, to satisfy the principal and interest moneys secured, and all expenses occasioned by such sale and proceedings; and every such order for foreclosure under the hand of the District-Registrar when entered (c) in the Register Book shall have the effect of vesting in the mortgagee or his transferee the land mentioned in such order, free from all right and equity of redemption on the part of the mortgagor or encumbrancer or of any person claiming through or under him subsequently to the mortgage, or encumbrance, and such mortgagee, encumbrances or transferee shall upon such entry being made (c) be deemed a transferee of the land, and become the proprietor thereof, and be entitled to receive a certificate of title to the same. (d)\n\n(a) The application in writing required by the foregoing section should be filed as early as may be, in order to allow the necessary time to elapse before the foreclosure order can be made.\n\n(b) The order may be as follows:\n\nFORM OF FORECLOSURE ORDER.\n\n(Formal part same as in application for foreclosure).\n\nUpon the application of A.B., the mortgagee, (or as the case may be) of said lands under the said mortgage by C.D. the mortgagor therein, to the MAN.L.A.\nsaid mortgagee (or as the case may be) and upon reading the affidavits and papers filed; and whereas it appears to me that the proceedings required by the said Act have been regularly and properly taken, and that default has been made in payment of the moneys secured by the said mortgage and that such default has continued for a period of more than six months after the time for payment mentioned in the mortgage and still continues, and that the moneys secured by said mortgage and the expenses occasioned by such default are all still due, owing and unpaid.\n\nIt is hereby ordered under the provisions of said Act that the said C.D. do stand absolutely debarred and foreclosed from all estate, right, title and equity of redemption in and to the said above described lands and premises.\n\nIssued under my hand and seal of office at the Land Titles Office at this day of A.D. 18\n\n[Seal.]\n\nDistrict-Registrar.\n\n(c) The foreclosure order, like any other instrument of transfer, has its operative effect suspended until the entry of the foreclosure and the registration of the mortgagee, etc., as owner.\n\n(d) See Rule 17, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante. The certificate of title if mortgaged since 5th of March, 1889, would be impounded in the proper Land Titles Office under sec. 109 post; if not it must either be produced or its production dispensed with by the District-Registrar, as provided by sec. 68 (6) ante.\n\nNo procedure is provided in this Act by which an encumbrance can obtain such an order of foreclosure. See note to sec. 106 ante.\n\nIn Queensland the Amending Act of 1877, (sec. 19) provided that in the case of the purchase of lands charged by a mortgage lien or encumbrance by the person entitled to such charge, he should be entitled to a certificate of title discharged therefrom. Under this Act the charge would ipso facto be merged and extinguished, unless an intention to prevent a merger has been expressed in the instrument\nof transfer or may be implied from the circumstances of the case.\n\n108. For the purpose of this Act the District-Registrar, Examiner of Lis Pendens Titles, or other officers of the Land Titles Office, shall not have notice of, to be filed or be bound by, any proceedings taken by any mortgagee or encumbrancee gagee, under his mortgage security or encumbrance for the purpose of foreclosing, selling or otherwise realizing upon his said security or encumbrance unless such mortgagee or encumbrancee shall have filed a Lis Pendens or in case of proceedings under Power of Sale a notice of such proceedings in the Land Titles Office for the District in which the land is situated.\n\nSee secs. 103 ante and 131 post.\n\n109. In every case where a mortgage or other encumbrance (except a mortgage lease), under the hand of the holder of the certificate of title, is presented to the District-Registrar for registration, the certificate of title shall be deposited with the District-Registrar, who shall retain the same on behalf of all the persons interested in the lands mentioned in such certificate. The District-Registrar shall, if desired, (a) furnish to the owner of such land a certified copy of the certificate of title and to the encumbrancee or his assignee a certificate of charge and before any subsequent dealings with said land by the owner or before discharges of all existing encumbrances are registered, said certified copy shall be delivered up to the District-Registrar to be cancelled and before any dealing with or discharge of said encumbrance is registered, except in the case provided by section one hundred and one, (b) said certificate of charge shall be delivered up to the District-Registrar to be cancelled. Provided, however, that the District-Registrar may dispense with such production upon satisfactory evidence being produced of the loss or destruction of any such certificate or certified copy. (c)\n\n(a) A praecipe must be filed for every such copy or certificate of charge.\n\n(b) Where payment is made to the Provincial Treasurer.\n\n(c) As provided by sec 68 (6) ante.\n\nForm of Certificate of Charges.\n\nLAND TITLES OFFICE, DISTRICT OF\n\nCertificate of Charges.\n\nMortgage No. Application No.\nAssignment No. Cert. of Title No.\n\nThis is to certify that a mortgage (or encumbrance, or as the case may be), made by (describe mortgagee, encumbrancer, or as the case may\nbe), to (describe mortgagee, etc., and recite assignments, etc., if any), for the sum of Dollars affecting (describe lands), was duly registered in the Land Titles Office at , on the day of A.D. 18 at o'clock in the noon, and that no registered mortgages or encumbrances affecting the said lands are entitled to priority over the said mortgage (or as the case may be), except the following, that is to say: (here set forth prior charges).\n\nDated at the Land Titles Office at Winnipeg, this day of A.D. 18\n\n[Seal.]\n\nDistrict Registrar.\n\nPowers of Attorney.\n\nII O. The registered proprietor of any land, estate or interest under the new system may authorize and appoint any person to act for him or on his behalf in respect of the transfer or other dealing with such land, estate or interest in accordance with the provisions of this Act, by executing a power of attorney in any form heretofore in use for the like purpose, or in the form contained in Schedule K to this Act or as near thereto as circumstances will permit, and a duplicate or attested copy thereof shall be deposited with the District Registrar, who shall enter the same in a register kept for that purpose, and if the land therein referred to is specifically and properly described he shall also enter in the Register a memorandum of the particulars therein contained and the date and hour and minute it is deposited with him.\n\nSee sec. 41 ante as to applications by an attorney.\n\nSCHEDULE K.\n\nForm of Power of Attorney.\n\nI, A.

Also to mortgage all or any such lands or leases for any sum at any rate of interest. Also to charge the same with any annuity of any amount. Also to lease all or any such lands at any rent. Also to surrender or obtain or accept the surrender of any lease in which I am or may be interested. Also to\nexercise and execute all powers which now are or shall hereafter be vested in or conferred on me as lessor, mortgagee or assistant under the said Act (or otherwise, according to the nature and extent of the powers intended to be conferred).

And also for me, and in my name and on my behalf, to deal with any land, lease, mortgage or charge of which I am now or shall or may at any time or times hereafter be the registered proprietor, either solely or jointly with any other person or persons, as effectually as I could do in all respects, and to sign any instruments necessary to give effect to any such dealing.\n\nDated this day of A.D., 18\n\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\n\n(Sealing seems necessary by the attestation.)\n\nRevocation of power of attorney.\n\n112. Any such power of attorney may be revoked by a revocation in the form contained in Schedule M to this Act, or in a form to the like effect, or in a form heretofore in use for a like purpose, and after the registration of any revocation of a power the District-Registrar shall not give effect to any transfer or other instrument signed pursuant to such power unless it appears upon any certificate granted previous to such registration and outstanding at the time, but no power of attorney shall be deemed revoked by act of the party or by death until a revocation thereof shall have been registered with or notice of death given or become known to the District-Registrar with whom the power of attorney or any certified copy thereof is registered.\n\nThe exception evidently refers to transfers by endorsement on an outstanding certificate, sec. 72 ante.\n\nAn instrument signed before registration of a revocation but produced afterwards will not be registered.

Whenever the owner of any lands subject to the new system dies, the executor or administrator (a) shall, before dealing with the lands, (b) make application in writing (c) to the District-Registrar to be registered as owner, and shall produce to the District-Registrar the probate of the will of the deceased owner, or letters of administration or the order of the court authorizing him to administer the estate of the deceased owner, or an office copy of the said probate letters of administration or order, as the case may be, (d) and such further evidence as the District-Registrar may require; (e) and thereupon the District-Registrar shall enter in the Register a memorial of the date of the will and of the probate, or of the letters of administration or order of the court as aforesaid, the date, hour and minute of the production of the same to him; the date of the death of such owner when the same can be ascertained, with such other particulars as he may deem necessary, and upon such entry being made the executor or administrator, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the owner of such lands (f) and the District-\nRegistrar shall note the fact of such registration by memorandum under his hand on the probate of the will, letters of administration, order or other instrument as aforesaid; (g) Provided always, that the title of the executor or administrator to such land shall relate back and take effect as from the date of the death of the deceased owner; (h) Provided that the duplicate certificate of title granted to the deceased owner shall be delivered up to be cancelled, (i) and the District-Registrar shall issue to the executor or administrator a fresh certificate of title stating therein the fact that the new registered owner is the executor or administrator. (j)\n\n(a) See sec. 3 (1) and (17) ante, as to what is included in the word \"lands\" and as to the expression \"transmission\" which would be included in the term \"transfer,\" sec. 3 (3) ante, where the context permitted.\n\nThis section only applies to lands after an application has been filed (sec. 42 ante), but applies to such lands even where deceased held them in a fiduciary capacity, see sec. 117 post.\n\nThe death of the owner does not stay proceedings in the Land Titles Office, (secs. 49, 50, 51 and 81, ante), but on dealings, the sanction of the Court would be required in case of joint proprietors, where under secs. 82 and 83 ante, the entry \"no survivorship\" has been made.\n\nAs to the descent of lands, see secs. 27 and 29 and notes ante. See also the Wills Act of Manitoba, 45 Vic, cap. 2, and Surrogate Acts cited at note (d) infra:\n\n(b) An executor must prove the will before he can apply for registration of the testator's land; (re Bannerman, 2 Man. L. R. 377); see also Rule 7, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante; and of necessity probate must be made and letters of administration must be granted before the intestate's lands vest in the personal representatives. Compare remarks of Taylor, C.J., Re Lewis, 5 Man. L. R. 48, and see note (f), infra.\n\n(c) The application should be by petition to the Registrar, setting out the circumstances of the transmission.\n(d) See Acts affecting the Surrogate Court, 44 Vic. cap. 28, amended by 46 & 47 Vic. cap. 1, secs. 96-102; and 49 Vic. cap. 5; also 48 Vic. cap. 21; 49 Vic. cap. 13; 51 Vic. cap. 29, sec. 32; and 52 Vic. cap. 22.\n\n(e) The production of Probate or Letters of Administration cannot be received as sufficient evidence of death or intestacy, *Re Lewis*, 5 Man. L. R. 44. These facts must be proved in the usual manner, and the production of a tax certificate is required by Rule 19, Sch. S, s. 26 ante. A fee is exigible on the entry of transmission (see tariff sec. 21 ante) and commission is payable as required by sec. 140 post, which may render a valuation of the lands necessary, (see sec. 71 ante).\n\n(f) The lands do not pass until the registration has been made (secs. 74 and 77 ante), and before the entry of transmission can be made in the Register all proceedings must be completed if any were pending at the time of the owner's decease. See secs. 49, 50, 51 and 81 ante.\n\n(g) See secs. 74 and 76, and Rules 7, and 14-19, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante.\n\n(h) The title of the personal representative would be subject to all encumbrances, liens and charges registered in the meantime, (see notes to sec. 29 ante, also secs. 63, 64 and 65 ante), and sembl\u00e9, that he should take possession in fact of all lands which have passed to him, for during the time between the death of the deceased owner and the transmission there was nothing to prevent another entering and holding possession of any vacant or unoccupied lands.\n\n(i) See sec. 73 and Rules 17 and 22, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante. The District Registrar may dispense with the production of the certificate of title in a proper case, as provided by sec. 68 (6) ante, but a provisional certificate [sec. 68 (7) ante] could not be issued in the place of one lost or\ndestroyed, as there is as yet no 'owner' to whom it can be issued.\n\n(j) The new registered owner takes subject to all trusts and equities upon which the deceased held the estate as well as those to which he may be bound in his fiduciary capacity.

Upon any assignment being made by the registered owner of any land, mortgage or encumbrance for the benefit of his creditors, the assignee or trustee of such person shall be entitled to be registered as owner in respect of the same, and the District-Registrar, upon registration of the instrument transferring such land, mortgage or encumbrance to such assignee or trustee, shall enter in the Register a memorandum notifying the appointment of such assignee or trustee, and upon such entry being made such assignee or trustee shall be deemed and taken to be the owner of such land and a certificate of title shall issue in his favor.\n\nCompare with sections 113 and 114 and notes; see sec. 117 post.\nAs to commission, see sec. 140 post, and sec. 71 ante as to valuation.\n\n116. Under the preceding provisions as to a bankrupt lessee, no entry of the assignee's or trustee's refusal to accept shall operate to prejudice any action or cause of action which shall have previously been commenced or have accrued in respect of any breach or non-observance of any covenants in such lease.\n\nSee secs. 98 and 94 ante.

R. may state a case or after it is brought under the new system, the District-Registrar, after hearing all the evidence procurable, entertains a doubt as to the matter-of-law or fact arising upon such title, he may state a case for opinion of the court or a judge; the District-Registrar may also inform the parties to such case, and the manner in which the proceedings thereunto are to be brought before the court or judge, to which case is referred.\n\nCompare sec. 48 of the Territorial Act, post, and from S. given for cases stated.\n\nnote to next following section.\n\nWhenever any question arises with regard to the performance of any duties, or the exercise of any of the functions by this Act conferred or imposed upon the District-Registrar, or whenever in the exercise of any of the duties of the District-Registrar, any question arises as to true construction or legal validity or effect of any instrument, or as to the persons entitled, or to the extent or nature of the estate, right or interest, power or authority, of any person or class of persons, or the\nmode in which any entry ow\nof title, or as to any doubt\ndealt with by the Distric\nrefer the same with a sh\nreferring the matter an\nhe knows or has been i\nBench in Chambers, wh\nthe Attorney-General /\nsummon any other pe\nand if upon such reta\nappearing before him\npower to do so or to d\npose, or, at the discr\nquestion, to direct\nRegister or certifica\njust.\n\nWhere the C\nopinion of the\nTransfer of L\nwrit\" in the se\nunder fi. fa., d\nan original, an\nquence of that\nbeing of a diff\nmade and al\nparte Paters\n\nThe Regis\nunder the St\nrights of th\nassurance fu\n\nCompare 4\n\nThe ruling\nsections (119 a\nthe decision of\n\nCaveats order\naside by the Cour\nSee sec. 130 (15) po\nthe satisfaction of the District-Registrar that where certificate other instrument has been issued in error, (a) issued in division of land, or of boundaries, or that any D.R. may been made in error on any certificate of title summon any such certificate, instrument, entry, or deliver up. rently or wrongfully obtained, or that any fraudulently or wrongfully retained, he such certificate or instrument has been so obtained or is retained, to deliver up cancelled or corrected as the case may on refuses or neglects to comply with In case of refusal, the District-Registrar may apply to such in Chambers to issue a summons judge thereof, and show cause why such should not be delivered up to be (c) and if such person, when served Arrest on to attend before the judge, at the further refusal for the judge to issue a warrant o summoned to be apprehended and tion.\n\nake of fact, but also an error Ex parte Bond, 6 V.

See Rule 24, Sch. S, s. 26 ante, and sec. 127 post.\n\nCompare section 112 of the R. P. Act of 1885.\n\nDecisions under corresponding provisions (secs. 132 and 133) of the Victorian Statute have been rendered in Gunn v. Harvey, 1 V. L. R. (E) 111; and Campbell v. Janet, 7 V. L. R. (E) 137. Where certificates were impeached for fraud, it was held that the Court had no jurisdiction to correct or cancel them, and that the proper course was to direct the parties to execute the necessary transfers. Where a voluntary settlement was defeated by a subsequent mortgage, the Court did not order the mortgagee to be registered as absolute proprietor, but directed the trustee of the settlement to execute a mortgage. Moss v. Williamson, 3 V. L. R. (E) 221; Re Biggs, 11 S. A. L. R. 43; Biggs v. Waterhouse, 12 S. A. L. R. 75, 86; but this section (122 Man. Act) appears wider than the 132nd section of the Victorian Statute. The 123rd section of the Manitoba Act post has also a general application which appears to have been doubted in the above cited cases in applying the corresponding section 139 of the Victorian Statute.\n\nA person properly entitled to land included by error, fraud or any misdescription of lands or boundaries in any certificate of title may obtain relief by an action of eject-\nment against the person registered as owner through such fraud, error or misdescription, without having recourse to the proceeding provided by these two sections, and likewise in the case of a fraudulent or voluntary transferee or owner holding a prior certificate of title, or where two or more certificates of title have been registered under this Act in respect of the same land. See sec. 67 ante.\n\nWhere the Court decided that a certificate of title had been issued in error and ordered a new certificate to issue in the name of another person, proceedings were taken under the corresponding sections of the Victorian Statute to have the first certificate of title delivered up; the Court refused to make any order until a person with whom it had been deposited by way of equitable mortgage had been repaid his mortgage debt. Ex parte Paterson, 4 A. J. R. 110.\n\n123. In any proceeding respecting land or in respect of any transaction Judge may or contract relating thereto, or in respect of any instrument, caveat, memorial, or other entry affecting land, it shall be lawful for a judge in chambers, by decree or order, to direct the District-Registrar to cancel, correct, substitute, or issue any certificate of title, or make any memorial or entry in the Register, or otherwise to do every such act or make every such entry as may be necessary to give effect to the judgment, or decree, or order of the court.\n\nProvided that no certificate of title shall be cancelled or set aside save in the cases specially excepted in Section sixty-four of this Act, and provided further that the District-Registrar shall not issue any certificate of title by order of the court unless in such order it is certified that the title of the person to whom the certificate of title is to issue has been found upon investigation to be a good safe-holding title, or unless such has been determined to be the case by the District-Registrar.\n\nThis proviso would also apply to an order or decree by a Judge in Chambers. See Appendix, new caveat rules.\n\nCompare sec. 139 of the Victorian Land Transfer Statute and sec. 113 of the R. P. Act of 1885 as amended by 51 Vic. cap. 22, sec. 10, and see notes to the foregoing section.\n\nSee secs. 117 ante and 129 post.\n124. After an application has been made to have any land brought under the operation of the new system, a judge in chambers may require all persons having in their possession or custody any deeds, instruments or evidences of title relating to or affecting the land, the subject of such application, to produce the same in the Land Titles Office to the District-Registrar or to any Examiner of Titles for his inspection, upon such terms and subject to such conditions and for such charge or fee as the judge making the order shall think just and shall fix: all applications to be made to a judge under this section may be made by summons in chambers by the applicant, owner or by the person to whom he may have directed a certificate of title to be issued.\n\nSee sec. 68 ante. Compare 50 Vic. cap. 11, sec. 40.\n\n125. Upon the hearing of any matter arising under this Act, a judge in chambers or the court may summon any person to appear, either to give evidence, or be made a party in the cause, and any person interested, and the Attorney-General for the Province of Manitoba may appear and be heard before such judge or court, or any court of appeal to which such cause or matter may be taken, and such judge or court may dispose of the matter, and award costs to any of the parties in such manner as the said judge or court may think proper.\n\nSee Rule 24, Sch. S, sec. 26 ante, notes to secs. 124 and 126, and sec. 47, Act of 1890 in Appendix.\n\n126. Any order made by such judge or court or court of appeal in any matter arising under this Act, shall be subject to appeal in the same manner as any other order made by such judge or court, and all parties to the cause, and the Attorney-General of the Province of Manitoba shall have the right to appeal.\n\nSee note to next following section.\n\nCompare sec. 138 of the Territorial Act post.\n\n127. In the conduct of actions and other proceedings provided for under this Act, there shall be the same rights of appeal, and the same rules of procedure and practice shall apply as are in force or exist for the time being in respect of actions and other proceedings of a similar nature in the court in which such action or proceeding may be tried or taken, and such court shall have power to make additional, or alter rules and regulations, and to make new, or alter forms of proceedings, and from time to time repeal, alter or vary the then existing rules and regulations, and to make new rules and regulations and forms of proceedings for the practice and procedure of the court in regard to matters which may arise under the provisions of this Act.\nCompare sec. 114 of R. P. Act 1885, and sec. 152 of the Victorian Statute, under which it was intimated (Hodgson v. Hunter, 3 A. J. R. 13) that the Judges might direct the details of proceedings in matters of caveat, bringing the parties before the Court, and putting doubtful questions into a course of legal determination within a limited time so as to uphold the policy of the Act, which is to bring all titles into a state of simplicity.\n\nThus far no rules or regulations have been made by the Court under this section.\n\nAn appeal will lie from a verdict rendered upon the trial of an issue under the provisions of this Act; and upon such appeal affidavits cannot be read when they are not mentioned in the notice of appeal, or of the intention to read which notice has not been given until two days before the argument on the motion, unless satisfactory reasons are assigned why an earlier notice was not given: Morrice v. Baird, 6 Man. L. R. 241. Upon a reference by the Registrar-General no material other than the case submitted, together with any documents transmitted, can be considered: Joyce v. Scarry, 6 Man. L.

The court shall have the power to fix and regulate from time to time the fees payable upon all proceedings before the court, and until the said court shall otherwise order, the fees payable shall be according to the fees payable in respect to proceedings of a similar nature in the court.\n\nSee note to last preceding section. Compare sec. 115 R. P. Act of 1885. No special tariff has as yet been fixed by the Court.\n\n129.

(8) Every caveat filed with the District Registrar shall state the name and addition of the person by whom or on whose behalf the same is\nCAVEATS.\n\nfiled and (except in the case of a caveat filed by order of the court or by the District-Registrar) (j) shall be signed by the caveator, his attorney or agent (k) and shall state some address or place within the Province of Manitoba at which notices and proceedings relating to such caveat may be served and shall be supported by an affidavit or statutory declaration stating the nature of the title (l) under which the claim is made, and that in support of the caveat the person by whom or on whose behalf the caveat is filed has a good and valid claim upon the said lands or upon the estate, interest or charge intended to be affected by the same and that the caveat is not filed for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing the applicant or registered owner or any person claiming through him, which affidavit or declaration may be in the form in Schedule Q hereunder.\n\n(j) See sub-sec. 15 infra.\n\n(k) In Victoria (Australia) proof of agency is required except where the agent is a solicitor (A'Becket, 82).\n\n(l) In May, 1889, it was held (Bain; J.) in McArthur v. Glass, 6 Man. L. R. 224, where the affidavit did not state the 'nature of the title' that the caveat had been imperfectly filed, and should be removed from the Register, as the filing of a caveat complying with the Statute was a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain a petition; but subsequently, Re McArthur and Glass, 6 Man. L. R. 801, Mr. Justice Killam decided that it was not necessary to file affidavits in support of a petition based upon a caveat in the Land Titles Office, and that cause may be shewn by argument upon the allegations of the petition, or by affidavits; after which the judge may, if necessary, permit the petitioner to adduce evidence, or may direct an issue, and made the following remarks:\n\n\"I cannot find that it has ever been decided whether affidavits or other evidence should be filed with the petition of the caveator or before the caveatee is asked to show cause. Rule 5 of Schedule H of the Act of 1887 seems to contemplate that at some stage affidavits may be filed in support of the petition, but it speaks of this as a contingency only. Rule 4, however, provides, that 'If the\ncaveatee shall not appear on the day appointed for the hearing, the court may, upon due proof of the service of such petition, make such order in the absence of the caveatee, either for the establishment of the right of the caveat or as the nature and circumstances of the case may require, as to the Court may seem meet.' Thus, it is evident that, unless cause be shown, it is unnecessary to support the petition by evidence. The affidavit required by sub-section 11 of section 37 (Sch D, 1887) to be filed with the caveat is sufficient to show the good faith of the caveat, and is evidently demanded to guard against the abuse of the practice, so that for that purpose there is little reason to require the petition to be supported by evidence before allowing the caveat to have an issue tried or some other investigation ordered.\"\n\n\"The practice which I shall adopt hereafter will be to hear the petition without affidavits or other evidence in support if none be filed; to allow cause to be shown, by argument that the case made by the petition is sufficient to show a right, or by affidavit either directly meeting allegations of fact in the petition or showing fresh facts, and, upon thus learning the questions in dispute, to allow the petition to be supported by affidavits or other evidence, or, without such, to direct the trial of an issue, direct inquiries or otherwise deal with the matter. This will, of course, not prevent a petitioner from filing affidavits or other evidence in advance, if, knowing the cause proposed to be shown he shall deem this advisable as saving expense or otherwise simplifying the matter.\"\n\nThe provisions of this sub-section, however, seem as a rule applicable to \"caveats generally,\" and require good faith and grounds for belief in the validity of his title to be shewn by every caveat upon filing his caveat, and it is probable that a refusal on the part of the District Registrar\nto receive a caveat upon the grounds mentioned in the judgment of Mr. Justice Bain would be upheld as in conformity with the policy of the Statute.\n\nSchedule Q refers to the caveat as annexed to the affidavit.\n\n**SCHEDULE Q.**\n\n**Form of Affidavit in Support of Caveat.**\n\nI, A. B., make oath and say (or solemnly declare) as follows:\n\n(1) The land affected by the caveat dated the day of hereunto annexed, lodged by me with the District-Registrar, is the land described in the schedule hereto, and my interest in the said lands entitles me to object to any disposition of the said land being made without my consent, and the nature of my interest is as follows:\n\n*(Here state particulars of caveator's interest.)*\n\nOr substitute for the above, as the case may require the following:\n\nI, A. B., make oath and say [or solemnly declare] as follows:\u2014I claim the land [or an interest therein, as the case may be] mentioned in the caveat, hereunto annexed and described in the schedule hereto [here state the nature of the estate or interest claimed and the grounds upon which such claim is founded].\n\n(2) I believe that I have a good and valid claim upon the said lands, and I say that this caveat is not being filed for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing the applicant or any person claiming under him.\n\nThe schedule above referred to\n\n*(Here insert ordinary description of land to be affected by caveat.)*\n\n(3) The caveator may, by notice in writing to the District-Registrar *(m)* Caveator withdraw his caveat at any time, but such withdrawal shall not prejudice the power of the court or judge to make an order as to payment by the draw. caveator of the costs and damages of the caveatee incurred prior to the receipt by the caveatee of notice in writing *(n)* of the withdrawal of such caveat.\n\n*(m)* This notice has the effect of prejudicing the claim of the caveator to the lands and consequently should be attested and verified by a witness in the same manner as other instruments intended for registration. See sec. 74 ante. It should be signed by the caveator or by some person specially authorized to do so under a registered power of attorney. See secs. 110 and 111 ante.\n(n) A copy of the notice of withdrawal might be served on the caveatee before it is filed.\n\n(10) Any person other than the District-Registrar lodging or continuing any caveat wrongfully and without reasonable cause shall be liable to make compensation to any person who may have sustained damage thereby, and such compensation may be recovered by proceedings at law if the caveator has withdrawn such caveat and no proceedings shall have been taken by the caveatee as herein provided, but if proceedings have been taken by the caveatee then such compensation shall be decided by the court or judge before whom proceedings have been taken.\n\n(11) Every caveat except a caveat filed by the District-Registrar or by order of the court (o) shall be deemed to have lapsed after the expiration of the time limited by this section, (p) in such case for proceeding thereunder, unless the person by whom, or on whose behalf the same was lodged shall within that time (p) have taken the prescribed proceedings to establish his title to the land, mortgage or encumbrance, or his right as set out in such caveat, and shall have filed with the District-Registrar evidence to his satisfaction, of such proceedings having been taken. (q)\n\n(o) See sub-secs. 15 and 16 infra.\n\n(p) See sub-secs. 2 and 5 ante. But the time may be extended by order of a Judge, sub-sec. 16 infra.\n\n(q) See Rules 2 and 13, Sch. R infra.\n\nThe practice of the Land Titles Offices is to require the petition filed under Rule 2 to be certified as to filing by the prothonotary or clerk of the Court, or the filing proved by affidavit when the petition is produced for registration, and this filing is received as sufficient proof of proceedings having been taken.\n\n(12) In the case of any caveat filed (except a caveat filed by the District-Registrar or by an order of the court) (r) the applicant or registered owner may, at any time within the time limited by this section (s) for the caveator to take proceedings thereunder, apply to the court, or a judge, or a judge in chambers, for a summons calling upon the caveator to show cause why such caveat should not be withdrawn or discharged, and upon the return of such summons the said court or judge, upon proof that such caveator has been duly served with such summons and upon such evidence as the said court or judge may require, may, in the absence of such caveator or otherwise, make such order in the premises and as to costs as\nto such court or judge may seem just; and where a question of right or title requires to be determined the proceedings followed shall be, as nearly as may be, in conformity with the rules of court in relation to civil cases. (t)\n\n(13) In every case in which a caveat shall have lapsed or been withdrawn, or shall have been discharged or withdrawn by order of the court, or a judge, the District-Registrar may at once proceed, as if no caveat had been filed (u) unless in the meantime he shall have been served with an order of the court or of a judge or judge in chambers, staying such proceedings.\n\n(r) See sub-sec. 15 infra.\n(s) See sub-secs. 2 and 5 supra.\n(t) See sec. 127 and notes ante.\n(u) See sub-sec. 7 supra.\n\nThe practice of the Land Titles Offices is to require the lapse or withdrawal to be entered across the memorial of caveat on the application before proceeding with the investigation of title; and in cases where the certificate of title has been issued, a similar entry is required in the register before dealings can be registered, except subject to the caveat. (See Appendix, sec. 43, Act of 1890.)\n\n(14) After a caveat shall have lapsed or been withdrawn, or discharged except as in this section mentioned, it shall not be lawful for the same person, or for any one on his behalf to lodge a further caveat, or file a lis pendens (r) under any proceeding in court in relation to the same matter, but nothing herein contained shall prejudice the right of the District Registrar to enter any caveat under the powers vested in him by this Act, (w) and a judge or judge in chambers may, if he thinks proper, upon application made to him for that purpose, and upon such terms as to costs, or otherwise as he may consider just, order that a new caveat be filed, and such order shall fix a time within which the caveator must proceed upon such caveat under the rules in schedule R to this Act. (x)\n\n(v) As to lis pendens see sec. 131 post.\n\nThere is no provision prohibiting the filing of a caveat after a certificate of lis pendens has been discharged.\n\n(w) See sec. 68 (5) ante.\n\n(x) A caveat filed by order of a Judge under this subsection would lapse as a matter of course on the expiration\nof the time limited, unless an order under sub-sec. 16 infra be obtained extending the time fixed by the first order permitting a second caveat to be filed.\n\nCompare sub-secs. 2, 5, 7, 8 and 11 supra, and the next following sub-section.\n\n(15) In the case of a caveat filed by the District-Registrar or by order of court, the applicant or registered owner may, if he so desires, apply to the court or judge or a judge in chambers for a summons calling upon the person on whose behalf such caveat has been filed to show cause why such caveat should not be withdrawn or discharged, and in case the person on whose behalf such caveat has been filed is an infant, lunatic, or person of unsound mind, without guardian or committee, the said court or judge may direct in such summons that it be served on the official guardian of the court or some other person to be named therein, and may impose upon the applicant such terms as to the costs of such guardian or other person appointed by such order as may seem just, and upon the return of such summons, if the same shall appear to have been duly served upon the proper persons, such court or judge may make such order in the premises either as to dismissing such summons discharging or withdrawing such caveat, or directing any of the parties to commence proceeding under the rules of Schedule R to this Act, as to the said court or judge may seem just and proper.\n\nExtension of time for proceeding on caveat.\n\n(16) At any time before the expiration of the time limited for proceeding upon a caveat (y) upon application on behalf of the caveator after notice to the caveatee, the court or a judge thereof for sufficient cause shown, and subject to such conditions as may seem proper, may extend the time for proceeding under such caveat for a further period to be specified in the order made upon such application which shall forthwith be lodged in the Land Titles office and filed with the caveat.\n\n(y) See secs. 2 and 5 supra, and Rules 2 and 13, Sch. R. infra. See sec. 48, Act of 1890, in Appendix.\n\nUnder the provisions of sec. 24 of the Victorian Statute giving the Court or Judge restraining powers, the Court was held to have jurisdiction to make an order although no suit or action had been instituted, at least where no other remedy was open to the caveator; The procedure may be by rule nisi and absolute: Ex parte Gunn, 3 V. L. R. (L.) 36; Ex parte Beissel, 5 V. L. R. (L.) 53; Hodgson v. Hunter, 3 A. J. R 13.\nCompare sec. 107 of the Act of 1885 as amended in 1887 and 1888.\n\nSCHEDULE R.\n\nRULES AND REGULATIONS FOR PROCEDURE IN THE MATTER OF CAVEATS.\n\n1. The caveatator, for the purpose of establishing his claim, may take petition to proceedings by way of petition to the court. Such petition shall be filed with the prothonotary, and shall contain as concisely as may be, a statement of the material facts on which the caveatator relies. Such statement shall be divided into paragraphs numbered consecutively, each paragraph containing as nearly as may be a separate and distinct allegation, and shall state specifically what estate, interest or charge the caveatator claims, and the court or a judge thereof shall, upon the filing of such petition, appoint a time for hearing the same. Such hearing may take place before the court or a judge thereof, or the District-Registrar, or such other person or persons as the said court or a judge may direct, and such hearing may be heard partly by one and partly by one or more persons as the nature and circumstances of the case may require, as to such court or judge may seem meet.\n\nIn Clarke v. Scott, 5 Man. L. R. 281, it was held: That the petition was defective in not showing the petitioner's claim of title, and that the petition need not show upon its face that it is filed in time. See note l, p. 187 supra.\n\n2. The caveatator shall cause a copy of such petition to be filed with the District-Registrar, and a copy with notice of the time appointed for hearing shall be served, three days at least before the time appointed for the hearing of the said petition, on the caveatee.\n\n3. On the day of hearing, the caveatee is personally or by counsel to show cause, and if necessary by affidavit, why the prayer of such petition should not be granted.\n\n4. If the caveatee shall not appear on the day appointed for the hearing, the court may, upon due proof of the service of such petition, make such order in the absence of the caveatee, either for the establishment of the right of the caveatator or, as the nature and circumstances of the case may require, as to the court may seem meet.\n\n5. Upon the hearing of the petition and upon reading the affidavits, if any filed in support thereof, and any documents produced to the court and hearing what may be alleged on behalf of the caveatee and caveatator, the court may, if it shall think fit, dismiss the petition; or may make an order establishing the right of the caveatator or directing any inquiries to\nbe made or other proceedings taken for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of the parties and for that purpose may adjourn the hearing and order the petition to be served on any other person or persons the court may consider necessary, and every person so served shall attend at the adjourned hearing of the petition, and be subjected to such further order as the court may cause to be made.\n\nSee Rule 14 infra as to substitutional service.\n\nWhat order may be made.\n\n6. The court may, if it shall think fit, direct any question of fact brought before it to be decided before a judge thereof, and for that purpose may direct an issue to be tried wherein the caveat shall be plaintiff and the caveatee defendant. And the said court shall direct when and where the trial of such issue shall take place; and the court may also direct all parties to produce all deeds, books, papers and writings in their or in either of their custody or power, on oath before the District Registrar or prothonotary, or such other officers of the court as the court may direct, on a day to be named, and each party shall have liberty to inspect the same and take copies thereof at his own expense and such of them as either party shall give notice to be produced at the trial shall be produced accordingly, and the issue may be in the form following:\n\n\"In the Queen's Bench.\n\n\"Manitoba,\n\n\"To Wit:\n\n\"The day of\n\n\"in the year of our Lord 18\n\n\"WHEREAS A. B., affirms and C. D. denies (here state the questions of fact to be tried,) and it has been ordered by (the C. J. or other judge, as the case may be) that the said questions shall be tried by a judge.\n\n\"Therefore let the same be tried accordingly.\"\n\nAnd in case the parties differ upon the questions to be tried, the court may either settle the same or refer them to the master.\n\nWhere a certificate of title was applied for a caveat was filed and an issue ordered to be tried with the caveat as plaintiff and the caveatee as defendant. The caveatee (applicant for registration of title) applied for security for costs as the caveat resided in Ontario, and the summons was dismissed, Taylor, C.J., holding that the applicant for registration of title was in reality the plaintiff and could not obtain security for costs: McCarthy v. Badgley, 6 Man. L.R. 270. On the analogy of interpleader proceedings compare Belmonte v. Aynard, 4 C. P. D. 221, 352, and Mc-\nPhillips v. Wolf, 4 Man. L. R. 300, which latter cases were followed in McCarthy v. Badgley. See Rule 10, infra.\n\nA disputed question of fact will not be tried upon affidavit, but an issue directed; Clarke v. Scott, 5 Man. L. R. 281; in this case the form of issue was given.\n\n7. If the court shall find that the caveator is entitled to all or some of the relief claimed by him, the order of the court shall declare what is the estate of estate, interest, lien, or claim to which the caveator is entitled, and the caveator may make such order as the circumstances may require, and shall have power to afford the caveator the same relief as in an ordinary action.\n\n8. Every order of the court made under these rules shall have the same effect as a judgment or order of the court given or made in any action, and the District-Registrar shall make such entries in the Register Book and do such things as may be necessary to give effect to the order of the court.\n\n9. If, at the hearing of such petition, it shall appear to the court that for the purpose of justice it is necessary or expedient that an action should be brought, the court may order such action to be brought accordingly, subject to such terms as to the costs or otherwise as may be thought proper.\n\n10. In all proceedings of the court, either by the caveator or caveattee, Costs. the court may make such order as to the costs of the proceedings in the court and incidental to filing the caveat as the court shall see fit.\n\nNo costs of appeal will be allowed where the case is disposed of on a point which has not been argued; Clarke v. Scott, 5 Man. L. R. 281. As to charging order see Wishart v. Bonneau, 5 Man. L. R. 132. See note to Rule 6, re McCarthy v. Badgley, as to security for costs, ubi supra.\n\n11. The court, or a judge thereof, may, without prejudice to the exercise of any other power of the court upon the application of any person interested in any land, make an order restraining for a time or until the occurrence of an event to be named in such order, or generally until further order, the registration of any dealing with land and may impose any terms and conditions upon making such order.\n\n12. The court, or a judge thereof, may discharge any such order with or without costs and generally act in the premises in such a manner as charge the justice of the case requires; and the District-Registrar, without being a party to the proceedings, upon being served with any order or copy thereof, shall obey the same.\n13. Unless the petition, filed under such caveat, shall have been served on all proper parties within thirty days next after it has been filed with the District-Registrar or within such further time as a Judge in Chambers may have ordered, any person interested may apply to a Judge in Chambers, for, and such Judge in Chambers may grant an order dismissing and discharging such petition and caveat for want of prosecution and such dismissal shall be deemed to have been a dismissal on its merits.\n\n14. When service of any proceedings under these rules is required to be made upon any person who cannot after due diligence be found within the Province of Manitoba, a Judge in Chambers may, in a proper case, order that service of such proceedings may be effected substitutionally in such manner as to such Judge may seem proper, and such substitutional service shall have the same effect as personal service upon the person intended to be affected thereby.\n\nVide Rule 5 supra. New rules added in Appendix.\n\nNote: The Lieutenant-Governor in Council has power to alter the rules, and to make rules in cases left unprovided for by the Act. Vide sec. 26 ante.\n\nLis Pendens.\n\n131. Any party to a suit, or his solicitor, or any person claiming to be interested in such suit may, except as hereinbefore provided, file with the District-Registrar a lis pendens affecting lands, mortgage or encumbrance, subject to the new system, and from and after the filing of such lis pendens with the District-Registrar the same shall operate as a caveat against the transfer of the land, mortgage or encumbrance mentioned in such lis pendens, and no transfer or other dealings with such land, mortgage or encumbrance shall be made except subject to the right or interest of such party or person claiming to be interested in such suit as aforesaid, unless said lis pendens shall have been previously discharged, or the bill of complaint or other proceeding in court dismissed by an order of the court or judge thereof and duly filed with the District-Registrar.\n\nA certificate of lis pendens cannot be filed after a caveat shall have lapsed or been withdrawn or discharged except upon an order of a Judge made on special application as provided by sub-sec. 14 of sec. 130 ante. There is no provision prohibiting the filing of a caveat after the termination of a suit respecting which a lis pendens has been registered, nor the filing of any number of such certifi-\nASSURANCE FUND.\n\nThis clause was not in the R. P. Act of 1885, but was introduced by sec. 38 of the amending Act of 1887.\n\nASSURANCE FUND.\n\n132. Any person deprived (a) of land or of any estate or interest in compensation of land in consequence of fraud or misrepresentation in bringing of such party deprived of land under the new system, or in the registration of any other person as proprietor of such land, estate or interest, or in consequence of any error, fraud, omission or misdescription of (b) any certificate of title or in any entry or memorial in the Register, (c) may bring and prosecute an action at law for the recovery of damages against the person by whose fraud, error, omission, misrepresentation, misdescription or wrongful act such person has been deprived of his land or of his estate or interest therein. (d) The bringing or prosecuting of an action as aforesaid shall not prevent proceedings being taken against the District-Registrar in respect of any loss or damage not recovered in such action; provided that no action shall in such case be brought against the District-Registrar without first proceeding as above provided, unless authorized by the fiat of the Attorney-General. (e)\n\n(a) As to what constitutes a deprival, see Bonnin v. Andrews, 12 S. A. L. R. 153.\n\n(b) No doubt intended for \"in any certificate of title.\"\n\n(c) Qu\u00e6re, whether errors, omissions, etc., in a certificate of charges, or a certified copy or a provisional certificate, would entitle to compensation a person to whom loss or deprivation of property occurred in consequence, of such error, etc.; see secs. 66, 68 (7), 109, and Rule 20 Sch. S, sec. 26 ante; also secs. 146 and 147 post; or would the recourse be against the fund only as provided in sec. 135 post?\n\n(d) As to the effect of improperly lodging liens, etc., compare decision as to fi. fa. and sheriff's deed lodged under Victorian Statute in Hassett v. Colonial Bank of Australasia, 7 V. L. R. (L) 380. It does not appear to be essential that the person against whom action is brought\nhas been registered as proprietor. *Fotheringham v. Archer*, 5 W. W. and A'BE. (L) 95. Nor does it seem that fraudulent misrepresentation is necessary. *Per Higginbotham, J.*, in *Hassett v. Col. Bank of Australasia*, 7 V. L. R. (L) 388.\n\n(e) Sec. 23 ante indemnifies officers against liability for *bona fide* acts or omissions in the exercise or supposed exercise of powers under the Act. See Appendix.\n\nSection 135 post provides for actions against the District-Registrar as nominal defendant in cases of omissions, mistakes or misfeasances by him or any of his officers or clerks (*i.e.*, officials appointed to the Land Titles Offices, see secs. 5, 6 and 7 ante) made in a similar *bona fide* manner.\n\nThe case of fraud or collusion by officials does not appear to have been clearly provided for.\n\nAll such actions may be bound by limitations or by estoppel, see sec. 52 ante and 137 post.\n\nPurchasers, mortgagees and occupants in good faith, and for valuable consideration are protected by secs. 64, 65 and 67 ante and 138 post; and knowledge of a trust or unregistered interest is not of itself to be imputed as fraud; see sec. 85 ante.\n\nAs to when the assurance fund is liable and the extent to which it is liable, see secs. 134 and 139 post. There is no proviso as to what damages shall be recoverable as in the Victorian Land Transfer Statute, sec. 144; consequently actual damages would be assessed under this section.\n\n**133.** Nothing in this Act contained shall be so interpreted as to leave, subject to action for recovery of damages as aforesaid, or to action of ejectment, or to deprivation of the estate, or interest in respect to which he is registered as owner, any purchaser or mortgagee *bona fide* for valuable consideration of land under the new system, on the plea that his vendor or mortgagor may have been registered as proprietor, through fraud or error, or may have derived from or through a person registered as owner through fraud or error, and this whether such fraud or error shall\nASSURANCE FUND.\n\nconsist in wrong description of the boundaries or of the parcels of any and or otherwise howsoever.\n\nCompare secs. 64, 65, 67, 77 and 85 ante, and sec. 143 post.\n\nThe effect of the corresponding section in the Victorian Statute, (sec. 145) is commented on per Gwynne, J., in Brady v. Brady, 8 S. A. L. R. 219, 230.\n\n134. In case the person against whom such action for damages is directed to be brought as aforesaid shall be dead, or cannot be found within the Province, then in such case it shall be lawful to bring such action for damages against the District-Registrar as nominal defendant for the purpose of recovering the amount of the said damages and costs against the Assurance Fund, and in any such case, if final judgment be recovered, and also in any case in which damages may be awarded in any action, as aforesaid, and the sheriff shall make a return of nulla bona, or shall certify that the full amount, with costs awarded, cannot be recovered from such person, the Provincial Treasurer, upon receipt of a certificate of the court before which said action was tried, shall pay the amount of such damages and costs as may be awarded, or the unrecovered balance thereof, as the case may be, and charge the same to the account of the Assurance Fund.\n\nAs to limitation of actions, see sec. 138 post.\n\nAs to liability of assurance fund, see 139 post.\n\nSee note (e) to sec. 132 ante.\n\n135. Any person sustaining loss or damage (a) through any omission, mistake or misfeasance of the District-Registrar, or any of his officers or clerks in the execution of their respective duties, under the provisions of this Act, (so far as applicable to the new system) and any person deprived of any land or of any estate or interest in land through the bringing of the same under the provisions of the new system or by the registration of any other person as owner of such land, or by any error, omission or misdescription in any certificate of title, or in any entry or memorial in the Register Book, and who by the provisions of this Act is barred from bringing action of ejectment or other action for the recovery of such land, (b) estate or interest, may, in any case in which the remedy by action for recovery of damages as hereinbefore provided is barred, (c) or when any damage has been sustained through any omission, mistake, or misfeasance of the District-Registrar in the granting of a certificate of charges provided for in Section one hundred and nine (109), (d) bring an\naction against the District-Registrar as nominal defendant for recovery of damages; and in case the plaintiff recovers final judgment against such nominal defendant, then the court or judge before whom such action may be tried, shall certify to the Provincial Treasurer the fact of such judgment and the amount of damages and costs recovered and the said Treasurer thereupon shall pay the amount of the said damages and costs to the person recovering the same, and shall charge the same to the account of the Assurance Fund. Provided always, that notice in writing of every such action, and of the cause thereof (e) shall be served upon the Attorney-General of the Province and also upon the District-Registrar one calendar month at least before the commencement of such action.(f)\n\n(a) The Provincial Treasurer shall pay the amount of any judgment obtained payable out of the Assurance Fund, notwithstanding that there may not be a sufficient sum to the credit of the Assurance Fund. (g)\n\n(a) In Victoria it has been held that notwithstanding the substitution of the words \"sustaining loss\" for the words \"deprived of land\" (see sec. 132 ante) the meaning is the same, and they apply solely to the deprivation of an interest previously possessed. Where an owner was registered under the Act and the Registrar omitted to endorse the title deeds as required by the Victorian Land Transfer Statute, (compare secs. 76 and 114 of the Manitoba Statute ante) the owner getting back the deeds was by this omission enabled fraudulently to conceal the fact that the land had been transferred to a purchaser under the statute and borrowed money on the security of the worthless deeds. The lenders sued the Registrar under the corresponding section (sec. 146) of the Victorian Statute, and it was held by the Chief Justice and Holroyd, J. (Higginbotham J. dissentiente) that as the lenders took no interest in the land under the worthless security, they had not been deprived of an interest, and had therefore sustained no loss within the meaning of the section. Oakden v. Gibbs, 8 V. L. R. (L.) 380. The effect of sections dealing with the liability of the assurance fund is discussed in this case.\n\n(b) See sec. 67 ante as to ejectments.\n(c) The word used in the Victorian Statute is \"inapplicable.\" See secs. 132-134 ante as to these remedies. An action should not be brought against the Registrar where one will lie against any other person. Fotheringham v. Archer, 5 W. W. & A'B. (L.) 95.\n\n(d) Compare sec. 132 and note (c) in pede.\n\n(e) As to fiat of the Attorney-General see sec. 132 ante.\n\n(f) See note (e) to sec. 132 ante.\n\n(g) As to formation of the fund see secs. 140 and 141 post. As to recovery of money paid see sec. 138 post.\n\n136. If in any such action judgment be given in favor of the nominal defendant, or the plaintiff discontinue or become non-suit, the plaintiff shall be liable to pay the full costs of defending such action, and the same when taxed shall be levied in the name of the nominal defendant by the like process or execution as in other actions on the case.\n\n137. No action for recovery of damages sustained through deprivation of land, or of any estate or interest in land as hereinbefore described (a) action shall lie or be sustained against the District-Registrar, or against the Assurance Fund, or against the person by whose fraud, error, omission, misrepresentation, misdescription or wrongful act, the person entitled to the land or some estate or interest therein has been deprived thereof, unless such action be commenced within the period of six years from the date of such deprivation: Provided, nevertheless, that any person being under the disability of infancy, or unsoundness of mind at the time of such deprivation, may bring such action within six years from the date on which such disability shall have ceased; (b) and the plaintiff in any such action, at whatever time it may be brought, or the plaintiff in an action for the recovery of land, shall be non-suited in any case in which the deprivation complained of may have been occasioned through the bringing of such land under the new system, if it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court before which such action shall be tried that such plaintiff or the person through or under whom he claims title had notice, by personal service or otherwise, (c) or was aware that application had been made to bring such land under the provisions of this Act, and had wilfully or collusively omitted to lodge a caveat forbidding the same or had allowed such caveat to lapse. (d)\n\n(a) See note a to sec. 132 ante and compare wording of the first lines of that section and of section 134 ante; see also note a of the latter section.\n(b) Compare 46 & 47 Vic. cap. 26.\n\n(c) See secs. 52-55 and 57 ante.\n\n(d) See sec. 130 and Rules Sch. R ante.\n\n138. Whenever any amount has been paid by the Provincial Treasurer as aforesaid, on account of any person who may be dead, such amount may be recovered from the estate of such person by action against his personal representatives in the name of the District-Registrar; and whenever any amount has been so paid on account of any person who may have absconded, or who cannot be found within the Province, and may have left any real or personal estate within the Province, it shall be lawful for the said court or a judge thereof, upon the application of the District-Registrar, and upon the production of a certificate signed by the Provincial Treasurer certifying that the amount has been paid in satisfaction of a judgment against the District-Registrar, as nominal defendant, to allow the District-Registrar to sign judgment against such person forthwith, for the amount so paid, together with the costs of the application; and such judgment shall be final and signed in like manner as a final judgment, by confession or default in any adverse suit and execution may issue immediately; and if such person shall not have left real property or personal estate within the Province sufficient to satisfy the amount for which execution may have been issued as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the District-Registrar to recover such amount, or the unrecovered balance thereof, by action against such person whenever and in such manner as may be possible.\n\nSee sec. 134 ante. See Appendix, Act of 1890, sec. 34.\n\n139. The Assurance Fund shall not, under any circumstances, be liable for compensation for any loss, damage or deprivation occasioned by the breach by a registered owner of any trust, whether express, implied or constructive; nor in any case in which the same land may have been included in two or more grants from the Crown; nor shall the Assurance Fund be liable in any case in which loss or deprivation has been occasioned by any land being included in the same certificate of title with other land through misdescription of the boundaries or parcels of any land, unless in the case last aforesaid it shall be proved that the person liable for compensation and damages is dead, or has absconded, or the sheriff shall certify that such person is unable to pay the full amount and costs awarded in any action for recovery of such compensation; and the said fund shall be liable for such amounts only as the sheriff shall fail to recover from the person liable as aforesaid.\n\nSee last paragraph note e to sec. 132 ante.\nAs to actions against the Assurance Fund the Queensland Royal Commission in 1879 reported as follows:\n\n\"\u00a72. Our attention was directed to the difficulties which at present stand in the way of any person seeking recourse to the Assurance Fund. No claim has yet been established against that fund, nor, while the law remains unaltered, is it probable that any will be established, inasmuch as the right of redress is limited to cases in which a man is deprived of land, and all right of recourse is barred after the expiration of six years from the deprivation\u2014a period which is likely to elapse before the error or fraud is discovered. We think that the right of recourse to this fund should be extended to all cases in which a man has sustained loss by reason of any entry made in the Register Book, by which he has been prejudiced, or by reliance on which he has been misled, and that the time for bringing a claim against it should be extended to that now allowed by law for bringing actions of ejectment.\"\n\n140. Upon the first bringing of land under the new system and also upon the registration of the title to an estate of freehold in possession of land under the new system, derived through the will or intestacy of a previous owner, or under any settlement or assignment in bankruptcy, there shall be paid one-tenth of one per cent. in case of an original grantee where no transaction or instrument affecting the lands has been registered except mortgages or leases; but in other cases one-quarter of one per cent. of the value thereof.\n\nIn the Land Titles Offices this section is construed as permitting the lower rate of commission to be charged after registrations appear upon the abstract only in cases where no more than one mortgage or one lease has been registered.\n\n141. All sums of money so received as in last section mentioned shall be paid to the Provincial Treasurer, who shall from time to time invest such sums, together with all interest and profits which may have accrued thereon, in such securities as may from time to time be approved of.\nby the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, to constitute an Assurance Fund for the purposes herein provided.\n\nRefer to secs. 44 and 45 of the Act of 1890 in Appendix.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.\n\n142. No petition, order, affidavit, certificate, registration or other proceeding under this Act shall be invalid by reason of any informality or technical irregularity therein or of any mistake not affecting the substantial justice of the proceeding.\n\nThis results from the policy of the Act. Compare the preamble to R. P. Act of 1885, referred to at page 1 ante.\n\n143. A purchaser or encumbrancee for valuable consideration shall not be affected by the omission to send any notice by this Act directed to be given or by the non-receipt thereof.\n\nCompare secs. 52, 57, 98, 103, 106, 107, 108, 130, (4) (9) (12) (15) and (16) 131, and 135.\n\n144. Every covenant and power declared to be implied in any instrument by virtue of this Act may be negatived or modified by express declaration in the instrument or endorsed thereon, and in any action for a supposed breach of any such covenant, the covenant alleged to be broken may be set forth and it shall be lawful to allege that the party against whom such action is brought did so covenant, precisely in the same manner as if such covenant had been expressed in words in such memorandum of transfer or other instrument, any law or practice to the contrary notwithstanding; and every such implied covenant shall have the same force and effect and be enforced in the same manner as if it had been set out at length in such instrument; and where any memorandum of transfer or other instrument in accordance with the provisions of this Act is executed by more parties than one, such covenants as are by this Act to be implied in instruments of a like nature shall be construed to be several and not to bind the parties jointly.\n\nCompare secs. 80, 88, 89, 91, 99, 103, 104 and 107 ante, and C. S. M. cap. 1, sec. 7 (28).\n\nCovenants and powers of an entirely different character from those implied under the provisions of the Act may be introduced. Reviewing a similar provision of the South Australian Act, Stow, J., observed that the object of the section was to allow people to make their own tenancy contracts so far as covenants are concerned. The implied covenants and powers mentioned in the Act enable short\nforms of deeds to be made, but the power of individuals to make their bargains remains, *Bucknall v. Reid*, 10 S. A. L. R. 188, 189.\n\nThe provisions of this section taken with those of sub-sec. 26 of sec. 3 and sec. 77 ante (*q. v.* with notes), permit of almost unlimited variety in the character and covenants of instruments which may be registered under the new system. The clauses declaring implied covenants, in addition to such as follow from the interpretation of terms (sec. 3 ante), are sections 28, 77, 80, 88, 89, 91, 99, 103, 104 and 117, and as the covenants so to be implied derive their potency from the statute, in all matters respecting dealings with lands under the provisions of the Act, they would probably have to be regarded as specialty contracts, and invariably construed as binding the parties severally, not jointly. None of the instruments are \"deeds,\" however, and with regard to limitations would be affected as if simple contracts only (*a*). If the implied covenants are negatived or modified seals are absolutely necessary to give them proper effect. There is a distinction made in sec. 28 between \"deeds\" and other instruments, and sec. 97 declares in effect that the term \"mortgage\" used in the Act is applied to instruments not necessarily *deeds*. These questions are more fully discussed and cases cited under secs. 4, 6 and 59 of the Territorial Real Property Act in Part III. of this manual. One effect of these provisions is to extend greatly the interpretation of the words \"substantially in conformity with the schedules\" in the 77th section, and probably the concluding words of sub-sec. 26 (page 46 ante) may be construed as requiring seals when rendered necessary by variations from the forms given in the Act.\n\n*In re Irish*, 2 Man. L. R. 361, statutory conveyances were declared to be substantially in conformity with the provisions of the R. P. Act of 1885.\n\n(*a*) 46 and 47 Vic., cap. 26.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\nWhere the defendant, owner of land subject to the new system, executed a lease of it upon a short form purporting to be made in respect of \"The Act respecting Short Forms of Leases,\" (b) which was not registered or filed in the Land Titles Office; and afterwards conveyed the land to X by a conveyance in which he made no mention of the lease; it was held by the full Court in an action by the lessee upon the covenant for quiet enjoyment, after ouster by X, that the covenant in the lease could be sued upon: Shore v. Green, 6 Man. L. R. 322, and per Killam, J. 1. The instrument was substantially in conformity with the form given in the R. P. Act, and could have been registered. 2. Not having been registered it could not take effect as a lease (c). 3. Even without registration the covenant could be sued upon. 4. The neglect of the lessee to register his lease was not; but the transfer by the lessor without mention of the lease was the proximate cause of the damage to the plaintiff. Bain, J., doubted whether the lease was one which could have been registered under the Real Property Act.\n\n145. The owner of any land or of any lease, mortgage or charge shall, on the application of any beneficiary or person interested therein, be bound to allow his name to be used by such beneficiary or person in any action, suit or proceeding which it may be necessary or proper to bring or institute in the name of such owner concerning such land, lease, mortgage or charge, or for the protection or benefit of the title vested in such owner, or of the interest of any such beneficiary person; but nevertheless such owner shall in any case be entitled to be indemnified in like manner as if, being a trustee, he would, before the passing of this Act, have been entitled to be indemnified in a similar case of his name being used in any such action, suit or proceeding by his cestui que trust.\n\n146. Whenever in any action, suit, or other proceeding affecting the title to land, or any estate or interest therein, subject to the new system, it becomes necessary to determine the fact whether the transferee, mortgagee, encumbrancee or lessee is a purchaser or transferee for valuable consideration or not, any person who is a party to such action, suit, or\n\n(b) Probably on an Ontario form; the Manitoba Short Forms Act is cited as \"An Act respecting Short Forms of Indentures.\"\n\n(c) Compare sec. 74 ante.\nother proceeding may give in evidence any transfer, mortgage, encumbrance, lease or other instrument affecting the title to such land, estate or interest in dispute, although the same may not be referred to in the certificate of title or may have been cancelled by the District-Registrar.\n\n147. Every certificate of title issued under this Act, and every exemplification or certified copy of any instrument deposited, filed, kept or registered in any Land Titles Office, together with all memoranda and endorsements thereon, shall be received as evidence in any court of law or proof of equity in this Province in the same manner and with the same effect as if the original within his office was produced without proof of the signature or seal of office of such District-Registrar.\n\nSee Rule 20 Sch. S, s. 26, and secs. 66, 132 and 135 ante. Vide note p. 45 ante.\n\n148. In case any person who, if not under disability might have made any application, given any consent, or done any act, or been party to any proceeding under this Act, is a minor, an idiot, or a lunatic, the guardian of the minor, or committee of the estate of the idiot or lunatic, may make such application, give such consent, do such act and be party to such proceedings as such person might, if free from disability, have made, given, done, or been party to, and shall otherwise represent such person for the purposes of this Act. If the minor has no guardian, or the idiot or lunatic no committee of his estate, or persons yet unborn are interested, the official guardian ad litem, or such other person as may be appointed for that purpose by the District-Registrar, may act with like power for such minor, idiot, lunatic or person yet unborn, and any notices or proceedings which may be required by the District-Registrar to be served on a person under any such disability may be served on the guardian ad litem, or other person so appointed by the District-Registrar for such person under disability, and such service shall be considered as good service and as effectual and binding upon such person under disability as if personally served upon him while under no disability.\n\nThis clause was introduced by section 29 of the amending Act of 1887.\n\nThe proper course is to apply by petition supported by affidavits as to the circumstances and the propriety of appointing the guardian, etc., as in a proceeding in equity.\n\nThe effect of service upon guardians, etc., appointed under this section would be to work a statutory estoppel only. See secs. 52, 53, 57 and 137 ante.\nThe following form can be varied to suit the special circumstances of each case:\n\nTHE REAL PROPERTY ACT OF 1889.\n\nApplication No.\nIn the Matter of the Application of\n(Applicants' names and additions.)\nto bring under the operation of the above Act.

If any person wilfully makes any false statement or declaration in any dealing in land under this Act, or suppresses or conceals, or assists or joins in, or is privy to the suppressing, withholding or concealing from the District-Registrar any material document, fact or matter of information, or wilfully makes any false declaration required under the authority or made in pursuance of this Act, or if any person fraudulently procures or is privy to the fraudulent procurement of any certificate of title or instrument, or of any entry in the Register, or of any erasure or alteration in any entry in the Register, or if upon requisition made by the District-Registrar any person refuses or wilfully neglects to produce any instrument or allow the same to be inspected, or refuses or wilfully neglects to give any information or explanation which he is by this Act required to give, or knowingly misleads or deceives any person hereinbefore authorized to require explanation or information in respect to any land, or the title to any land or in respect to which any dealing or transmission is proposed to be registered, or is a party to or privy to any fraudulent act whatever in any matter connected with the working of this Act; such person shall for each such offence be liable to a penalty of not less than fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, and in default of payment imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than six months.\nSee secs. 68, 121 and 122 ante, and compare sec. 153 Victorian Land Transfer Statute, which is more comprehensive in its provisions.\n\nSee secs. 64, 85, 117, 128 and 129 ante.\n\nThere must be a fraudulent intention and sembl\u00e9 there should first be a conviction for the criminal offence before any civil proceeding is determined: Wiggins v. Hammill, 4 V. L. R. (L.) 63.\n\nIn Canada the Criminal Law and procedure in criminal matters are subject to the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament. See B. N. A. Act sec. 91.\n\nWhere a plaintiff had applied for registration of title, alleging that the land and adjacent ground were unoccupied, it was held that, without a guilty intention, this did not make the certificate void; and sembl\u00e9, there should be first a conviction for a criminal offence, the charge should not be determined in a civil proceeding: Wiggins v. Hammill, 4 V. L. R. (L.) 63. It must be noted that sec. 153 of the Victorian Land Transfer Statute provides that certain fraudulent acts and false declarations in proceedings thereunder shall be deemed misdemeanors. In Canada the criminal laws are exclusively within the jurisdiction of Parliament, and Provincial Legislatures can only impose punishment for the purpose of enforcing their laws enacted respecting limited classes of subjects: vide \"The British North American Act, 1867\" (Imperial, 30 and 31 Vic., cap. 8, secs. 91 and 92).\n\nCompare provision as to penalty in sec. 122 ante.\n\n150. All prosecutions for penalties under this Act may be brought before a Police Magistrate or any two Justices of the Peace, and all penalties when collected shall be paid over to the Provincial Treasurer.\n\nProcedure would be regulated by the Summary Convictions Act, R. S. C. cap. 178.\n151. Section four of forty-eight Victoria, chapter eight, is hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following words \"Land Titles Offices.\"\n\nThis section has the effect of adding Land Titles Offices to departments included in the Civil Service of Manitoba and subject to the provisions of \"The Manitoba Civil Service Act.\" At present the Land Titles Offices are administered under the supervision of the Attorney-General.\n\n152. Except as herein before provided Forty-eight Victoria, chapter twenty-eight, forty-nine Victoria, chapter twenty-eight, fifty Victoria, chapter eleven, fifty-one Victoria, chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, fifty-two Victoria, chapter four, and any other Act which may be passed this present session amending any of said Acts, are hereby repealed, but the Acts repealed by any of said Acts shall remain repealed, and all things lawfully done and all rights acquired or liabilities incurred under them or any of them shall remain valid and may be enforced.\n\nSee secs. 2, 14, 16, 18, 35, and 36 and notes ante.\n\nTHE END OF PART II.\nPART III.\n\nTHE TERRITORIES REAL PROPERTY ACT.\n\nNote.\u2014The side notes are not printed as they appear in the authorized edition of the Statutes.\nTHE TERRITORIES REAL PROPERTY ACT\n\nAs Amended with References and Notes;\nBeing Revised Statutes of Canada.\n\nCHAPTER 51.\n\nAn Act respecting Real Property in the Territories.\n\nHer Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and A.D. 1866.

Compare sec. 74 of the Manitoba Statute. See notes pages 101-103 and 206 ante.\n\nIn re Thompson, 10 Can. L. T. 44, referred by the Inspector and the Registrar of the East Saskatchewan District under sec. 114 post, the following facts were stated.\n\nThe land had been sold by the patentees to one F., who on 8th March, 1887, sold it to T., giving him a deed in fee simple. This deed was not filed or registered until after an execution issued against F. had been placed in the Sheriff's hands and charged upon the land by the filing of a copy and memorandum on 8th June, 1888. On 4th March, 1889, T. applied to have his title registered, producing the above deed, and in the certificate of title issued to him, reference was made to the execution against F. as a charge upon the lands.\n\nThe question submitted was whether the Registrar was right in issuing the certificate subject to the execution.\nIt was contended that the effect of this section was that F. was still to be deemed the owner when the execution against him was filed by the Sheriff, as no title or interest was passed to T. for want of registration, and consequently that the lands were charged by the writ; and contra that this section did not apply to lands patented prior to 1st January, 1887, (as in this case) until after application for registration of title had been made, that the title passed to T. on delivery of the deed and the land was not bound by the execution.\n\nMr. Justice McGuire said that at first sight section 4, ante would seem to indicate that on and after the 1st January, 1887, the various provisions of the Act were intended to apply to all lands and all dealings therewith, but in subsequent sections beginning with sec. 34, ante the word \"land\" is qualified by the uniform phrase \"under the provisions of this Act.\" Now if the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act\" in section 4 have the wide meaning they appear to have, all lands would be under the provisions of the Act, and it would be not only unnecessary but misleading to use the phrase \"under the provisions of this Act,\" in section 34 and the many other places in which it appears. These words are evidently used to distinguish lands which are, from others which are not \"under the provisions, etc., so we must see if the words \"subject to\" in section 4 have not a different meaning from the word \"under\" in section 34, etc. Looking at Worcester's dictionary I find that \"subject\" in addition to its primary meaning of \"placed under\" also means \"exposed,\" \"liable,\" in this sense it is used by Shakespeare \"most subject is the fattest soil for weeds,\" and by Dryden \"all human things are subject to decay,\" meaning not that \"fattest soils\" are actually \"weedy,\" or \"all human things\" actually are in a state of \"decay,\" but only that they are respectively \"liable to\" or exposed to become so whenever certain conditions are\nfulfilled. If we take this meaning we may interpret section 4 as saying that all lands may become under this Act, and then sections 44 and 45 deal with two classes; the former with lands where patent had not issued on 1st January, 1887, the latter with lands where the patent has issued before that date. In the former case the lands come under the Act by the patent being transmitted direct to the Registrar, whereupon he issues a certificate to the patentee; in the latter an application may be made by the owner, the procedure for which is provided, and when on that application a certificate is issued, then the land becomes \"under the provisions of the Act\"; but until such application is made the land is not actually under the Act, and the registration provisions do not apply.\n\nSections 5 to 17 both inclusive form a part of the Act distinct from the rest, and they took effect from the 1st January, 1887, and they are so interpreted by the amending Act of 1888, which again furnishes another reason for distinguishing between these thirteen sections and the rest of the Act. Since Parliament by limiting the interpretation of these sections implicitly declares that the whole Act was not \"intended to extend, etc.\" (1). Another circumstance strongly confirming this view is that in these sections we find the words \"deed\" and \"deed or transfer\" repeated, and section 6 defines what a \"deed\" shall convey. Now the instruments to be used under the Act are none of these deeds, not being under seal, and these sections therefore seem clearly to provide for the use both of deeds which must mean instruments under the law as it existed before the Act, and \"transfers,\" the new form of conveyance introduced by the Act, according as the land is or is not \"under the provisions\" of the Act. Section 34 deals with lands which are \"under the provisions\" of the\n\n(1) Compare McCaul and Bown's Notes, 9 Can. L. T. 27.\nAct, and the form of instruments \"purporting to transfer, etc.,\" such lands, and it is to be noted that the word \"transfer\" and not \"deed\" is used here as being the term appropriate to conveyances under the Act. Section 58 also expressly deals with lands under the provisions of the Act, and while section 59 does not contain the qualifying phrase: I think that it must be read along with the preceding sections, and as one of the seven sections (58 to 64) put under the heading, \"Effect of Registration,\" and the concluding words of section 59 seem to presuppose the existence of a certificate of title and therefore confine the view that it applies only where the land has been brought under section 44 or section 45. Moreover section 64 declares that \"after registration of the title to any land under the provisions of this Act no instrument shall be effectual to pass any interest, etc., unless two things occur: (a) It is executed in accordance with the Act, and (b) it is duly registered thereunder. But section 34 had already dealt with (a), and if section 59 applied to all lands and all instruments then it had already rendered impossible the registering of the instrument whether before or after registration of title. In order, however, to give section 64 a reasonable construction it is necessary to read section 59 as applying only to lands after issue of a certificate of ownership and the instruments in the schedule, and then section 64 as declaring that as against a bona fide transferee of the land under this Act the conditions therein mentioned must be complied with. Notwithstanding the T.R.P. Act, as far at least as lands are concerned which have not yet been brought under the Act by secs. 44 or 45, the old law is in force and a deed passes the interest it purports to pass, and on delivery of the deed to T., F. ceased to be owner of or in any way entitled to any interest whatever in the land in question, and the execution against F. was no lien or charge thereon.\n\nMAN.L.A\nA different view of the application of the Act has been taken by Messrs. McCaul and Bown in some very useful notes on the Territorial Act furnished by them to the Canada Law Times; vol. 9, pages 23-28, where these provisions of the Act are discussed and comparison made with the Manitoba decision *In re Irish*, 2 Man. L. R. 361; and the proposition submitted that the Territories Real Property Act is applicable to all lands in the Territories, whether patented or unpatented, when it comes into force, and that its provisions are practically compulsory on all owners.\n\n**60.** The registered owner of land or of any estate or interest in land, under the provisions of this Act, shall hold the same subject (in addition to the incidents implied by virtue of this Act) to such encumbrances, liens, estates or interests, as are notified on the folio of the register constituted by the certificate of title to such land, absolutely free from all other encumbrances, lien, estates or interests whatsoever,\u2014except in case of fraud wherein he has participated or colluded, and except the estates or interests of all persons entitled to or interested in any portion of land that is, by wrong description of parcels or of boundaries, erroneously included in the certificate of title, lease or other instrument evidencing the title of such registered owner, and except the estate or interest of an owner claiming the same land under a prior certificate of title registered under the provisions of this Act:\n\n2.

Section 1 of chapter sixteen of the Statutes passed in the fifty-second year of Her Majesty's reign is hereby repealed, and the following section substituted therefor:\n\n1. This Act, with all amendments that may at any time be made thereto, or to any such amendments may together be cited and known as \"The Real Property Act of 1889,\" and when, in any statute of this Province now in force and unrepealed, reference is made to \"The Real Property Act of 1885,\" or to that Act and amendments thereto, under whatever name that Act and amendments is or are cited, such reference shall be held to apply to and include \"The Real Property Act of 1889.\"\n\nThis amendment should be noted at all the forms printed with the R. P. Act, 1889, in this Manual.\n\n2. Sub-section 4 of section 3 of said Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following words: \"or any hypothecation of such charge.\"\n\nSee note to next section.\n\n3. Sub-section 7 of said section 3 is amended by adding at the end thereof the words \"or any hypothecation of such charge or lien.\"\n\nCompare notes as to sub-leases and sub-mortgages; pp. 22 and 25 ante, and sections there referred to.\nSee notes to secs. 87 and 95 R. P. Act, 1889, pp. 138 and 143 ante.\n\nSec. 3, ss. 17 amended.\n\n4. Sub-section 17 of said section 3 is amended by inserting after the word \"execution\" in the second line thereof the words \"tax-sale, assignment for benefit of creditors.\"\n\nCompare sub-sec. (b), sec. 17 and sec. 29 post.\n\nSec. 3, ss. 18 amended.\n\n5.

Said section 3 is further amended by adding thereto the following sub-section:\n\n\"(27) The word \"lease\" shall include a sub-lease, and the word \"lessee\" shall mean and include a \"sub-lessee.\"\n\nCompare note to sec. 87, R. P. Act, 1889, p. 138 ante. See also sec. 30 post.\n\nBond of registrar.\n\n7. Section 8 of said Act is amended by striking out all the words after the word \"council\" in the fourth line, and substituting therefor the words \"for the due payment over of all moneys received by him as such District Registrar.\"\n\nSec. 10 repealed, and substitution.\n\n8. Section 10 of said Act is repealed, and the following substituted therefor:\n\n10. The Registrar-General or his deputy appointed under \"The Real Property Act of 1885,\" or any district registrar appointed under this Act, shall have full power to furnish originals or certified copies of all registers, books or instruments, or of any certified copies of registers, books or instruments in his office, affecting lands within the district or under the control of such Registrar General or District Registrar when such lands are, under section four of this Act, added to or formed into another district, and all such originals or certified copies shall for all purposes be of the same force and effect when deposited in the office of the new district as if they were originals and had been originally registered, deposited or kept in that office. This section shall be read as if it had come into force on the 5th day of March, 1889.\n\nSee note to sec. 48 post.\n\n9. Section 16 of said Act is amended by inserting after the word \"as, in the fourth line thereof, the words \"but no greater effect than,\" and\nby adding at the end of said section the words, \"and no registration made under the old system, either prior or subsequent to the said date so named shall affect any land, which, at the time of such registration, was or is subject to, or under the provisions of the new system, so long as such land remains subject to the new system; nor shall any registration, made or hereafter made under the new system, affect any land which is not subject to, or under the new system; and no registration made in any registration division prior to the said date so named, or in the office of any land titles district prior to the date when a portion of such district is added to some other district, shall, after said date, have the effect of binding any land, other than the land it would have bound or affected had that registration division not been brought into a land titles district, or that portion of a land titles district not been added to some other district.\" It is hereby declared that this section, as amended, was always intended to have the effect and meaning it has, as now amended.\n\nCompare notes on pages 55 and 56 ante. Qu\u00e6re, what would be the effect of the amended section upon unregistered ft. fa. in the sheriff's hands?\n\nIn re Murchison, where a transfer was presented before the passing of this Act, the District-Registrar for Winnipeg refused its registration, except subject to ft. fa., which had not been registered as required by the R. P. Act of 1885, but were still in force in the sheriff's hands, and held that this registration was merely an additional formality imposed upon the execution creditors to make writs in the sheriff's hands bind lands requiring to be dealt with under the \"New System,\" and was dispensed with by the repealing clauses of the R. P. Act of 1889, which removed the restriction and permitted writs to bind all lands in the bailiwick as provided by the Administration of Justice Act.\n\nOn a reference of the case to the Court, Mr. Justice Killam held that, for want of registration, the ft. fa. did not bind the land, and ordered the issue of the certificate of title to the transferee clear of any such encumbrances.\n\nThe insertion of the words \"but no greater effect,\" etc., does not so extend the amended section (16) as to affect any but the registrations made in old system registry offices.\nprior to their abolition and would leave \\( \\text{fa. fa.} \\) with the same binding effect as they had at the time of the above decision.\n\nThe section as now amended restricts general liens to the limits of the district as constituted at the time of their registration.\n\nSection 28 amended.\n\n10. Section 28 of said Act is amended by inserting after the word \"in,\" at the end of the first line thereof, the words \"any grant of Crown lands or in,\" and by inserting in the third line, after the word \"every,\" the word \"grant,\" and by inserting before the word \"grantor\" in the fifth line, the words \"Crown or,\" and by striking out all the words in said section, after the word \"estoppel\" in the eighth line.\n\nCompare notes at page 72, ante.\n\nThe Legislature of Manitoba can have no authority that can in this manner affect Dominion lands (B. N. A. Act 1867, secs. 91, 92;) and it would not appear that the Crown could in any case be affected by these provisions: R. S. C. cap. 1, sec. 7 (46), and C. S. M. cap. 1, sec. 7 (30).\n\nDuring the present session (1890) of the Dominion Parliament a bill has been introduced respecting Grants of Public Lands, providing that although no words of limitation be used in Crown grants the fee simple shall be thereby conveyed unless a contrary or different intention be expressed.\n\n11. Section 34 is amended by adding thereto the following subsection:\n\n(1) When, by or under any indenture of mortgage, whether under the new or the old system, and whether heretofore or hereafter made, any notice is stipulated to be given to the mortgagor, his heirs or assigns, such notice may be given, in cases where such mortgagor or his assign is dead, to the executor or administrator of such deceased person; and such notice shall be as effectual as if made in conformity with such stipulation.\n\nSee section 39 infra; compare sections 99, 103, 104, 106 and 107 of the R. P. Act of 1889 ante.\n\nSection 40 amended.\n\n12. Section 40 of said Act is amended by adding thereto the following sub-section:\u2014\nAPPENDIX.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in this section contained, an application shall not be received to bring under the new system an undivided interest in any land, unless an application is also made for all other undivided interests in the same land; and no withdrawal or rejection of any application for an undivided interest shall be permitted, unless the application for all other undivided interests in the same land are withdrawn or rejected.\n\nCompare section 27 post.\n\n13. Section 46 of said Act is amended by striking out all the words from, and including the word \"issue\" in the nineteenth line thereof, down to and including the word \"rejection\" in the twenty-third line thereof, and by substituting for such words struck out, the following words, \"cause to be entered in the proper abstract book, under the old system, a memorandum stating that such application has been withdrawn or rejected, and upon the entry of such memorandum.\"\n\nCompare note to sec. 42 R. P. Act of 1889 at p. 85 ante.\n\nSee note to section 15 post.\n\n14. Section 47 of said Act is amended by striking out all the words in said section after the word \"entitled\" in the thirteenth line thereof.\n\nSee note to next section.\n\n15. Section 48 of said Act is amended by striking out the word \"certificate\" in the fifth line thereof and substituting therefor the word \"memorandum,\" and by striking out the word \"signed\" in the sixth line thereof and substituting therefor the words \"entered in the abstract books under the old system.\"\n\nCompare note to sec. 42, page 85 ante. This and the two preceding sections simplify the method of returning land in the operation of the \"Old System.\"\n\n16. Section 56 of said Act is amended by striking out the word \"and\" in the ninth line and substituting therefor the word \"or.\"\n\n17. Section 57 of said Act is amended by inserting in the third line of sub-section (a) after the word \"may\" the following words \"without requiring the proceedings necessary under this Act in the case of a lost certificate of title to be taken,\" and by adding thereto the following sub-section:\n\n(b) The expression \"tax deed\" or \"tax sale deed\" shall be held to mean and include any vesting certificate of the nature or effect of the certificate set forth in sub-section 1 of 49 Vic., cap. 52, section 656.\nVide note (f) section 57, R. P. Act of 1889, p. 100 ante, as to dispensing with the production of certificate of title.\n\nSub-section (b) now added covers the case where the municipality becomes the purchaser of lands within its boundaries at a sale for arrears of taxes.\n\nNote the distinction between \"deeds\" and \"transfers;\" compare notes to sec. 144, R. P. Act 1889, p. 205 ante, and the amendment as to the meaning of the word \"transmission\" by the fourth section of this Act, supra.\n\nSection 63 amended.\n\n18. Section 63 of said Act is amended by adding thereto the following sub-sections:\n\nCaveats.\n\n(k) Caveats affecting the land registered since the last date of the certificate of title.\n\nFi. Fas., etc.\n\n(l) Writs of execution or attachment lodged or maintained in force in the office of the sheriff of the proper judicial district between the original date of the certificate of title and the first day of April 1889, in cases where such date of the certificate of title is prior to said first day of April.\n\nSee notes to sec. 9 of this Act, supra.\n\nCompare note to sec. 63, p. 105 ante.\n\nSec. 68, ss. 3 amended.\n\n19. Sub-section 3 of section 68 of said Act is amended by striking out the word \"prescribed\" in the second line thereof, and by adding after the word \"form\" in the same line the words \"of Schedule U.\"\n\nSee section 42 post.\n\nSec. 68, ss. 6 amended.\n\n20. Sub-section 6 of said section 68 is amended by striking out the word \"grant\" where it occurs in the eighth and thirteenth lines, and by substituting therefor in each case the words \"certificate of title.\"\n\nSec. 68, ss. 7 amended.\n\n21. Sub-section 7 of said section 68 is amended by striking out the words \"grant or\" where they occur in the first, thirteenth, twentieth and twenty-second lines of said sub-section.\n\nSec. 68, ss. 8 amended.\n\n22. Sub-section 8 of said section 68 is amended by inserting after the work \"surveyor\" in the seventh line thereof the words \"under oath in the form in Schedule T to this Act.\"\n\nSee note to section 24 post.\n\nSec. 69 amended.\n\n23. Section 69 of said Act is amended by adding after the word \"hereto,\" at the end of said section, the words \"and where the land...\"\naffected is in a town or city, having a town or city engineer, all plans presented for registration shall be approved of and signed by such engineer before the same can be registered,\" and by inserting after the word \"has\" in the third line of sub-section (a) the words \"or has not,\" and by striking out the words \"the foregoing,\" where they occur together in the seventh line and substituting therefor the word \"this.\"\n\nSee note to next section.\n\n24. Section 70 of said Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the words \"and certified to be accurate by a provincial land surveyor under oath in the form in schedule T to this Act.\"\n\nThis and the two preceding sections clear away the confusion in the reference to the rules as to plans existing in the Act of 1889, p. 116 ante, and render plans of the right of way and station grounds of railway companies subject to the same regulations, for registration purposes, as town plots.\n\n25. Section 74 of said Act is amended by adding thereto the following sub-sections:\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any defect in the proof or form of execution of any instrument presented for registration under the new system, the district registrar may, in his discretion, upon being satisfied of the due execution of such instrument, register the same, and such registration shall be valid and effectual for all purposes, notwithstanding any such defect.\n\n(2) In all cases, unless the district registrar shall dispense with it, there shall be annexed to every instrument dealing with land under the new system an affidavit, statutory declaration or other evidence proving to the satisfaction of the district registrar that the party dealing with the land is of the full age of twenty-one years.\n\nCompare amendment to sec. 77 of the R. P. Act 1889 by sec. 27 infra.\n\nSee notes In re Farmers, etc. Co. v. Conklin, and Renwick v. Berryman, p. 126 ante.\n\nThe proof as to age does not appear to be required except in the case of dealings under the \"New System.\"\n\nCompliance with the requirements of the amended section 20 of cap. 60, C. S. Man., p. 123 ante, is still necessary,\nas to dealings under the \"Old System,\" notwithstanding the liberal discretion given by this newly added subsection (1).\n\nWhere an irregular instrument is presented for registration under the \"new system\" it must still be sufficient to \"pass an estate, etc.,\" in order to be received, and registered as provided by section 77, R. P. Act 1889.\n\nSee remarks of Bain, J., in Shore v. Green, as to an informal lease; p. 206 ante.\n\nNote the meaning of the term \"Instrument\" as interpreted by sec. 3 (12), page 44 ante. Mr. Justice Bain considered that a copy of a writ of execution might be considered \"an instrument;\" Herbert v. Gibson, 6 Man. L. R. 192.\n\nSection 76 amended.\n\n26. Section 76 of said Act is amended by striking out the word \"instrument\" in the eleventh line thereof and substituting therefor the word \"memorial.\"\n\n27. Section 77 of said Act is amended by adding thereto the following sub-sections:\n\n(1) Except as in this section mentioned and except instruments affecting land without specific description, no instrument shall be registered under the new system unless all the land affected by such instrument is under the operation of the new system and within the same land titles district.\n\n(2) Certificates of judgment and attachment presented for registration shall be registered under both the new and the old system, and shall have the effect upon land under both systems given to such certificates by the administration of Justice Act and amendments thereto, or by the County Court Act and amendments thereto, as the case may be.\n\nThese newly added provisions avoid the difficulty suggested at pages 130-131 ante. Compare also the amendment to sec. 74 by section 25 supra.\n\n28. Section eighty-six of said Act is repealed, and the following section substituted:\n\n86. Except as in sections 113, 114 and 115 of this Act mentioned, the district registrar shall not receive any instrument, nor make any entry\nin the register, containing any notice of trusts whether expressed, implied or constructive. Describing the owner of any freehold or leasehold land, or of any mortgage, charge or encumbrance, as a trustee, whether the beneficiary or object of the trust is mentioned or not, shall not impose upon the district registrar or any person dealing with such owner the duty of making any enquiry as to the power of the owner, in respect of the land, mortgage, encumbrance or charge or the money secured thereby, or otherwise, but (subject to the registration of any caveat) the land, mortgage, encumbrance or charge may be dealt with as if such description had not been inserted.\n\nCompare sections 32 and 33 infra and \"Introductory Analysis,\" pages 3 and 4 ante. Note also the effect of this amendment upon section 3 (22) of the R. P. Act of 1889.\n\n29. Section 95 of said Act is amended by adding thereto the following sub-section:\n\n(1) Any assignment, or mortgage, of any such mortgage or encumbrance, whether such assignment or sub-mortgage be made before or after the issue of the certificate of title, may be made according to the reforms in use under the old system, and may be registered under the new system in the same manner and with the same effect as the original mortgage or encumbrance was registered under this section.\n\nSee secs. 3 and 4 supra.\n\n30. Section 99 of said Act is amended by adding thereto the following sub-sections:\n\n(1) By virtue of every such transfer the right to sue upon any mortgage or other instrument, and to recover any debt, sum of money, annuity, or damage thereunder (notwithstanding the same may be deemed or held to constitute a chose in action), and all interest at the time of such transfer in any such debt, sum of money, annuity, or damages, shall be transferred so as to vest the same in law in the transferee thereof; provided always that nothing herein contained shall prevent the court from giving effect to any trusts affecting the said debt, sum of money, annuity or damages, in case the said transferee shall hold the same as trustee for any other person.\n\nCompare sec. 89 of the R. P. Act of 1885 and 48 Vic. cap. 17, sec. 125 et seq. as to the assignment of choses in action.\n\n31. Section 109 of said Act is amended by inserting after the word \"where\" in the first line the words \"land is subject to,\" and by striking out all the words from and including the word \"holder\" in the second line down to and including the word \"registration\" in the fourth line encumbered.\nthereof, and substituting therefor the words \"owner or any former owner of the land, whether such encumbrance is created before or after such land is brought under the new system.\"\n\nSection 115 amended.\n\n32. Section 115 of said Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following words \"but shall not refer therein to the fact that the new registered owner is such assignee or trustee or that he holds such land for any other than his own absolute use.\"\n\nCompare sec. 28 supra as to entry of notice of trusts.\n\nSection 117 amended.\n\n33. Section 117 of said Act is amended by adding after the word \"thereof\" in the eighth line the words \"except in the case of an executor, or administrator with the will annexed, who appears to be dealing with the land in a manner contrary to the terms of the will, in which case, and in which case only, it shall be the duty of the district registrar to enquire whether such dealing is proper or necessary in order to carry out the true intent and meaning of the will,\" and by striking out the word \"bankrupt\" in the twelfth line and by inserting after the word \"property\" in the thirteenth line the words \"of a deceased person or bankrupt proprietor.\"\n\nCompare amendment as to entering notice of trusts, sec. 28 supra.\n\nLoss to assurance fund to be paid without action in certain cases.\n\n34. In any case where it appears that the assurance fund is clearly liable for any loss or damage to any person under any of the provisions of this Act, and where it appears that the claim for loss or damage is a fair and reasonable one, the Provincial Treasurer may, without an action being first brought, pay the amount of any such claim; provided that no such claim shall be paid unless and until the Provincial Treasurer shall be authorized to do so by the reports, advising such payment, of the Attorney-General of the Province, the Inspector of land titles offices and the district registrar of the district in which the land which is the subject of such claim lies.\n\nThis section is an additional proviso to sec. 135 of the R. P. Act, 1889.\n\nSection 136 amended.\n\n35. Section 136 is amended by striking out the words \"on the case,\" where they occur in the sixth line.\n\nSchedule N amended.\n\n36.

P. Act 1889, p. 141 ante.\n37. Schedule R of said Act is amended\u2014\n\n(a) By adding, after the word \"defendant\" in the fourth line of the Judge may sixth rule, the words \"but upon proper cause shewn, a Judge or Judge in direct cava-\nChambers may direct that the issue be tried with the caveatee, as plain-plaintiff,\ntiff, and the caveat, as defendant,\"\n\n(b) And by adding thereto, as additional rules, the following:\n\n15.

When a district registrar is ordered to issue a certificate of title, Judge\nthe order shall declare that the title in the lands of the person to whom\nthe certificate of title is to issue has been found, upon investigation, to be\na good safe-holding title.\n\nThese rules appeared in the R. P. Act of 1885 as amended\nby sec. 14, cap. 22 of 51 Vic., but were omitted in the\nR. P. Act of 1889. See note to the following section.\n\nIn Grant v. Hunter, 1 Western Law Times 36, Killam J.\nstated that the Chief Justice did not intend to lay down as\nan absolute rule in McCarthy v. Badgley, (page 194 ante)\nthat every applicant must be taken to occupy the position\nof a plaintiff towards the caveat in respect of issues\nunder petitions for the enforcement of the caveat; and\nheld that the relative position of the parties must depend\nupon the circumstances of each case, and the nature of the\nissue directed.\n\n38. Schedule R is further amended by adding thereto the following Rule 15\nadditional rule:\n\n15. No failure to comply with any of the rules in this Act made as to Order to\nany petition shall in the first instance be considered sufficient to dismiss to be made\nor set aside such petition, but a motion may at any time be made to dismiss\nsuch petition for want of prosecution or non-compliance with\nsaid rules, and upon the return the judge or judge in chambers may make\nan order that such matter be proceeded with or such non-compliance\namended or remedied, within a time to be specified in the order, and that\nin default thereof such caveat or petition or any proceeding thereunder\ndo stand dismissed, and such judge may, upon such return, make such order as to costs as he may see fit.\n\nThis rule has been given the same number as the first rule in the foregoing section; cross-references should be made to avoid confusion.\n\nRule 15 of Schedule S amended.\n\n39. Rule 15 of schedule S to said Act is amended by inserting after the word \"proprietor\" in the sixth line thereof, the words \"and at or near which he may be served with any notice or proceeding under this Act, and if such applicant or owner is not a resident of this Province, he shall also deliver to the district registrar the name and post office address of some agent within this Province, upon whom any such notice or proceeding may be served in lieu of service upon himself personally, and if such applicant or owner do not so deliver his post office address or name and address of an agent, and if such applicant or owner cannot be found at or near such place in order to effect such service, then upon application the District Registrar may make an order that he may be served by posting up a copy of such notice or proceeding in the land titles office for the district in which the land in question is situate.\"\n\nCompare sections 53, 54 and 55, pages 96 and 97 ante.

Said schedule S is further amended by adding thereto the following rule:\n\n30. Affidavits or statutory declarations in proof of any matter under this Act shall not be sworn or declared before the attorney, solicitor or agent of any applicant for registration, or before the partner, clerk or agent of such attorney, solicitor, agent or applicant.\n\n42.
