Crerar,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Ebb and Flow School\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nThe accommodation for the teacher, who is married with a family, at the above school, is certainly not adequate for a family. It is simply two small rooms, a part of the school building, and I understand that the Indian Agent for Manitoba did some time ago, recommend the building of an addition to the school to be used as part of the residence.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is mainly to acquaint you with the facts and to advise you that I know the situation at Ebb & Flow very well and there is very real need of additional living accommodation, and that if it is at all possible, something should be done before the coming winter. I think that a lean-to about 12 feet wide, and the width of the school, would be just about right with the accommodation already provided. By a reference to Mr. Waite, your Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, you could ascertain further facts regarding this situation.\n\nThanking you in advance for your usual prompt attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) W. J. Ward, M.P.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSept. 2, 1939\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nEbb and Flow Indian Day School,\nReedy Creek, Man.\nre- request for additional\naccommodation for Teacher.\n\nI am submitting herewith a letter received from Mr. W.J. Ward, M.P., Aug. 29th, in which you will note he states there is very real need of additional living accommodation for the teacher of the above school.\n\nIt is noted Mr. Ward states - quote:\n\"I understand that the Indian Agent for Manitoba did some time ago, recommend the building of an addition to the school to be used as part of the residence\".\n\nYou might have a report furnished, also a draft reply, for my signature by direction of the Minister.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6231, file 509-5, part 4)\nOttawa, September 7, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a report to the Department dated November 23, 1938, you intimated that the living accommodation at the Ebb and Flow Indian Day School was wholly inadequate for the present teacher and her family.\n\nWhen Mrs. Adam was appointed as teacher of this school, the appointment was made on the recommendation of Archbishop Sinnott, who intimated that a married teacher might be employed for a year and that later a better arrangement might be made. It might be well if you discussed this matter with Archbishop Sinnott. The Department feels under no obligation to provide living quarters for a married teacher at this school. The present policy is, as you know, to employ only single teachers or women whose husbands are physically incapacitated. It would appear that in this case the husband is a trader outside the reserve.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 7, 1939.\n\nRe: Request for additional accommodation for teacher, Bob and Flow Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Ward:\n\nI am directed by the Minister to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 29, in which you state that, in your judgment, the teacher's living quarters at the above noted school are wholly inadequate to accommodate the present teacher and her family.\n\nThe records indicate that the present teacher, Mrs. Hilda Mary Adam, was nominated for the position of teacher at the Bob and Flow school by Archbishop Sinnott. The Archbishop was reminded at that time that it was not the policy of the Department to employ married women as teachers, other than those whose husbands were physically incapacitated. Archbishop Sinnott requested, however, that Mrs. Adam be appointed for a year, in the hope that he would be able to make better arrangements the succeeding year. The failure of the Archbishop, however, to nominate a single teacher to take charge of this school would indicate that he has experienced difficulty in securing a suitable teacher for the position.\n\nIt is true, as you state, that Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, in a report dated -\n\nW. J. Ward, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6231, file 509-5, part 4)\ndated November 28, 1936, expressed the view that the living accommodation at the Bob and Flow school was insufficient for a married man. However, the Department did not feel that we were under any obligation whatever to provide accommodation for the husband of this teacher, who, according to the reports on file here, is a trader, operating just off the reserve.\n\nIn view of your representation, Inspector Hamilton will be asked to again report on the accommodation at this particular school and to interview Archbishop Sinnott regarding any thought the Archbishop may have in mind with respect to the nomination of an unmarried teacher. Just as soon as the Inspector's report is received, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, September 7, 1939.\n\nRe: Request for additional accommodation for teacher, Ebb and Flow Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Ward:\n\nI am directed by the Minister to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 28, in which you state that, in your judgment, the teacher's living quarters at the above noted school are wholly inadequate to accommodate the present teacher and her family.\n\nThe records indicate that the present teacher, Mrs. Hilda Mary Adam, was nominated for the position of teacher at the Ebb and Flow school by Archbishop Sinnott.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nSir,\n\nIn Estimates 1939-40 an amount of $471.00 was entered for the erection of an addition to the Ebb and Flow Day School. The addition is to the living quarters of the teacher. I might state that there are only two rooms for the teacher and these are small; they consist of a kitchen and bedroom. There is no accommodation for a visiting official. The present teacher is married and the husband lives at the school. If it is the Department's intention to build this addition this fall the work should be commenced as soon as possible as the season is beginning to get late.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant the Department is not considering erecting an addition to the Ebb and Flow Indian day school this year.\n\nIf minor repairs are required to place the building in a more habitable condition you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $50.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 126-4-5, dated September 7th, I would report that I have discussed this with Archbishop Sinnott and he concurs with me, in the opinion that due to the war situation no program of building should be undertaken at present in regards to providing more living accommodation for the teacher on the Ebb and Flow Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Some months ago we wrote to Inspector Hamilton in regard to this matter and he submitted detailed information regarding the material required to enlarge the teacher's living quarters.\n\nI understand that enlarging the building would involve an expenditure of approximately $700.00. In our estimates for the current fiscal year this amount was not specifically included. However, if there is a real necessity for an addition to this building it might be possible to allocate funds for the purpose. Could Indian labour be secured?\n\nI have been informed that the teacher's husband is residing at the school. Is he physically capable of earning a living? If not, what does he do at the school? Is it due to the fact that there are two persons living in the teacher's living quarters that requests are reaching us for enlarged accommodation? An immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.

As no reply had been received, he was again written on June 30. Today I am sending him a telegram, directing him to reply immediately to the letters mentioned above. As soon as his reply is received I will communicate with you again.\n\nDirector.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nJuly 12th,\n1941.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-4-5\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of June 10th, and regret the delay in answering. This was due to the payment of treaty.\n\nThere are two rooms at present in the teacherage which is a part of the school building; the size of the rooms is approximately 12 x 13 each. I suggested that a lean too addition be built 12 x 26. This would give two additional rooms. Indian labour would not be experienced enough without the help of a white foreman. The cramped space is not altogether due to the teacher (Mrs. Adam) being married. There is no family. The husband runs a small store outside the reserve, about one mile from the school. He is apparently physically capable of earning a living. He does no work around the school. Under present conditions the living quarters are too small. They are too small for a single man as there is no extra accommodation for visiting officials. The present arrangement means that the Adams give up their bed to accommodate officials and use the Indian school room as an extra bedroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The roads from Lock's place to the reserve are poor at the best of seasons. This year, due to heavy rains, they were almost impassable. I hired truck freight from the Monarch Lumber Company's yard at Ste. Rose to Lock's farm at a cost of $15.00. From that point teams and wagons were necessary. The Chief took this job at an estimate of $30.00. There would be at least eight loads of material. The hauling was done by Indian teams.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|            | Portage la Prairie Indian Agency Trust Account    |        |\n|            | Send cheque to:-                                 |        |\n|            | Mr. J.

They now have two bedrooms, a kitchen and dining-room combined, and a living room. The school and residence are badly in need of exterior painting. The old paint has almost entirely disappeared and the building presents a neglected and dismal appearance. I urge that funds be provided to do this work early next spring.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRef: 126-4-5 November 3/42.\n\nI beg to advise that the cost of paint for the outside of the Ebb and Flow Indian Day School cost $64.00. The nailing of the siding has been completed.\n\nThere will be a cost of approximately $4.00 for freighting of the paint from Alonsa station to the reserve.\n\nThe season is too far advanced to consider painting before the end of the fiscal year and I beg to request that an amount of $40.00 be made available for this work in the spring.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1943.\n\nEXD\n\nMr. J.

Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI am in receipt of the attached voucher N 283. I note that the account covers the purchase of hand saws, shovel and hammer on October 4, 1941. It would, therefore, appear that the tools have been in use for nearly two years and presumably are not of much value to Mr. Dufault. Under the circumstances I cannot see any reason why we should pay for these tools and, unless Mr. Dufault wishes to donate them to the Indians, they should be returned to him.\n\nR.A.

Neary.\n\nI recently visited the Ebb and Flow Reserve in the Portage Agency, and outside the school they have an over-flowing well, which is making the ground around the well wet and boggy. Cattle are drinking around this well, which makes it very unsanitary.\n\nI took the liberty of giving Mr. Hamilton authority to get the well fixed at once, by digging a ditch away from it and hauling in some stones around the well. This well is cased with a 4 inch iron pipe and when fixed in this way I believe it will be quite satisfactory.\n\nI hope my action meets with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Sir,\n\nReferring to my conversation with Your Grace and Archdeacon McKay yesterday, I beg to outline herewith the policy of the Department with regard to improved day schools.\n\nOn many Reserves it is possible to conduct this type of school with considerable success, and a reference to some of the schools in the Province of Saskatchewan will so attest. Suitable buildings are provided, consisting of a dwelling, in some instances with dining-room attached, and modern class-rooms. The children are provided with a simple mid-day meal and the preparation of this meal rests with the girls under the supervision of the matron. The services of a married man and his wife are desirable; he to conduct the class-room work and she domestic science and field matron work on the Reserve in accordance with instructions laid down by the Department. In addition to the housing accommodation a salary of $800.00 is allowed; $600.00 for the class-room work\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nand $300.00 for the other branches. The Department would be prepared to allow this salary at schools within Your Grace's jurisdiction, where it is considered they can be successfully conducted. I would suggest that the experiment be tried at Lower Fairford where provision will be made for suitable buildings next year, if funds can be obtained.\n\nI shall be pleased to keep this matter in mind and hope to be able to proceed with building operations in the early spring.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOct. 15, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI thank you for yours of October 10th. I am writing to the districts concerned with a view to gathering information which I will put before you between this and Spring. I am also taking steps to find out some suitable men to take up the work of these \"improved schools.\" It would be necessary, however, to have the buildings ready before any superior class of teachers can be secured to occupy them. It therefore looks as if we should have to wait till next summer before putting these \"improved schools\" in operation. You speak of placing one at Lower Fairford. I think the better place would be Upper Fairford where young Rupert Bruce is now teaching.\n\nWith kind regards and many thanks, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNovember 16th, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson -\n\nFor your information I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, and also a copy of his reply thereto.\n\nAs I intimated in the letter to His Grace I am most anxious to establish at least one of these improved day schools next year, if funds are available, and I wish to place the matter in your hands.\n\nIn the first place we must decide as to the better location of the two referred to by His Grace for this experiment, then the character of the buildings would have to be determined. We have plans which would probably be suitable with very little amendment, if the number of pupils for whom provision is being made is ascertained.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSuite No. 8,\n470 River Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nKindly take this matter up at your earliest convenience.\n\nI think the letter to His Grace will give you the necessary information as to the character of these day schools, and if there are any points on which you are not clear, I shall be very pleased to give further details.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThere could be 11 rooms located in the upper part of class-room as I wanted 16 ft clearance in the hall and have only 3 story in the wing. The lower 20 meter school could be used as a play-room in the winter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nYour wire of the 6th inst. re the Fairford Improved Day School, and also plans of the proposed building, received yesterday on my return from Fairford. Canon Jeffery representing the Archbishop accompanied me on the trip, and we went thoroughly into the matter and have viewed this situation of the education of the children from every standpoint.\n\nWe spent three full days on the reserve, had a fairly full and representative meeting of the band at Lower Fairford, on Saturday the 10th inst., and fully discussed all matters affecting the school. After considering the question carefully, I have come to the conclusion that the best place for this school is about halfway between the Upper and Lower Fairford Day schools, where a beautiful high and dry site can be obtained. Both districts were represented by their leading men, and they agreed unanimously that the site midway is the best for all concerned.\n\nIn my opinion, and the band have agreed to this, it will be necessary to do what all our consolidated white schools are now doing, convey all the children to the school every day.\n\nThe children available for this school at the present time number 42 of which number 17 are living in Upper, and 25 in Lower Fairford. I have received tenders from 2 reliable Indians for this work and they have agreed to take the pupils to and from the school every day, the upper children for seventy-five cents, and the lower children for one dollar a day, so in round figures it will cost $15.00 per pupil per month to do this work.\nreserve which will give you an idea of the situation, the school would be two miles from the farthest pupil in the upper part, and 2\u00bd miles from the farthest pupil in the lower reserve.\n\nWhere the new school is located, is in my opinion the best part of the reserve, but along the river at that point for some miles there is quite an extensive hay swamp, which prevents the Indians building close to the river, and for that reason none of the band have built in that territory, a stretch of about two miles. There is also the question of the children who live across the river at Lower Fairford, the Indians there went a Day school, they are afraid to send their children to the present school on account of the river which is very wide at this point, there is also a very swift current, and it means that to be sure of the safety of the children, it is necessary for the parents to take the children over and back every day in the summer time and in the winter the ice is also very dangerous at many times during that season. If the new school was built at Lower Fairford we cannot figure on their attendance, and it will be necessary in any event to build them a school east of the river.\n\nIf the new school was built at Lower Fairford 25 pupils are available, if it was built at Upper Fairford 17 children are in sight that could walk to the school. In both places there are 42 and we can count on an average attendance of at least 30, if the pupils are conveyed to the school. The band have agreed to give all the land necessary for the purposes of the school, they are perfectly willing to hand over to the Department 160 acres at the point indicated on the sketch, and I would advise this, as it would prevent any houses being put in the near vicinity of the school, and which might become a nuisance later.\n\nI also took up the question of moving the Upper Fairford school to a point across the river at Lower Fairford, and the band were very much in favour of this being done and will agree to move this building next winter to the selected point at a price to be fixed later. For the information of the Department, I may say that this building can be moved quite easily and\nit would cost about $200.00 to take this building down to the site, the size of the building is I should say 16 X 24 with a small porch, and is all wood construction inside and out.\n\nAfter giving these matters my careful consideration I would recommend that this New Improved Day School be built at the midway point, also that an annual grant be made for conveying the pupils to the school, and I would further recommend that the Upper Fairfield Day School building be moved to a point across the river at Lower Fairfield, as soon as the new School building is erected.\n\nCanon Jeffery and the Archbishop will be reporting to you in a very short time their views on the situation.\n\nAs suggested in your telegram of the 9th instant I will get you an estimate of the probable cost of a building such as the plan calls for, with an estimated attendance of 35 children, and a staff of Teacher and Housekeeper.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI understand that the improved School at Fairford is near-\ning completion and that it will soon be necessary to appoint the\nteacher. On the suggestion of Mr. Jackson, the inspector, I have\nbeen communicating with Mr. Augustus Hyson, who at present is teach-\ning the day school at the Little Saskatchewan Reserve. The man\nseems very anxious to obtain the appointment and offers to bring\nhis wife out from England, who, he tells me, would be quite compe-\ntent to take up her part of the duties. Mr. Hyson is a well educat-\ned man who had a school of his own in England. I am deeply sensible\nof the importance of making a wise appointment in the case of this\nSchool, and for that reason I should like to have known a little more\nabout Mr. Hyson, but all who know him around Fairford speak very\nhighly of him.\n\nI should be gratified, therefore, if the Department would\ngive him the appointment, but I think that he should be told that it\nwould be only for one year, and that its extension would depend upon\nthe way he did his work.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian affairs,\nOttawa.\nBISHOP'S COURT,\nWINNIPEG,\nMANITOBA.\n\n16th November, 1915.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n16th November, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Secretary,\n\nI thought you might be interested in what I had visited Peguis Reserve shortly before my visit there. We had a long conference and when it was over, only one dissenting voice that a Church should be built for the present at each end of the Reserve, and that the Church Yard and Mission House should remain in the centre, where they are at present located. It was also recommended that a small portion of land, about one acre, be given to the Church at each end, and ten acres in the middle. It appears that the man employed to go round and explain to the people in regard to the voting, lives near the centre and used his influence against the granting of the land in the hope that he might thus secure the building of the Church at the centre near himself. It was a strange proceeding and I am told that the Indians now regret the action very much. Of course, this will put a stop in the meantime to the building of the Churches, but I am in hopes that in a short time the Indians will think better of it and reverse their vote.\n\nIn conversation with Inspector B. J. Jackson over the telephone the other day, he does not seem to be so enthusiastic about the appointment of Mr. Ryden and I confess that I am not self sure that he will be a successful teacher. Perhaps, therefore, it would be wiser to go more slowly in making the appoint-\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wrote you some time ago about the appointment to the Improved School at Fairford, recommending Mr. Ryson. Subsequently I advised delay in view of what Mr. Jackson, the Inspector, stated to me. I find now that matters have gone so far with Mr. Ryson that he will be placed in a very inconvenient position if he is not appointed, from the fact that he has arranged for his wife to come over from England and join him in the work. She has disposed of her furniture and is sailing on December 3rd.\n\nMay I suggest that he and his wife be given the appointment for one year on trial. I saw him this morning, and he is willing to accept on that understanding. If the Department agrees to this, kindly let me hear from you as soon as possible, so as to relieve the poor man's mind. A telegram to me before Friday night next when I leave the City, would be a kindness.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan B. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 1, 1915.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 23rd ultimo, which only reached the Department on the 29th of last month, in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the improved day school on the Fairford Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will accept Your Grace's nomination of Mr. and Mrs. Nyson as teacher and matron for this school provisionally at the remuneration mentioned in letter of October 12th, 1914, to Your Grace, viz.\u2014a combined salary of $900.00 per annum and housing accommodation. Both Mr. and Mrs. Nyson are new to the country and conditions and it would be hardly fair to be bound to retain their services for a year should they fail to make a success of this school. The Department will be willing to give them every opportunity and assistance to prove their fitness for the position and if their work is satisfactory their appointment will be confirmed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI received a letter short ago from His Grace Archbishop Matheson in regard to a teacher for our new school here in Upper Fairford. We wrote to His Grace sometime ago asking and begging him to give us the whole teacher that we have at present so the whole Band want him.\nand so do I myself, but\nthe answer we got back from\nHis Grace was, that the\nGovernment called for a married\nman, with certificate. The\npresent teacher, that we have,\nR. Bruce, is a single man\nand has no certificate, but\nhas taught more and is\nmore capable of handling\nsuch work than any of\nour certified teachers that\ncame out here before, which\njust simply carried the\ntitle and nothing more\nwas behind it.\nFor the last few years, he has had great advantage in his school, on account of regular attendance, which was the fault of the parents being so careless and indifferent to the education of their children. Any other man who had no experience with the Indians, or understood their ways, would have sent the work to ruin, for we know this young man from when he was a child, and he knows us, and understands our ways, and we know him.\ncannot get a better one,\nand we will not hear or\ngetting any more of these\nEnglish strangers, and why\ncannot we get the man\nthat we all want, and who\nhas proved himself capable\nof teaching any Indian\nchild in this part of the\ncountry. He helps us in\nevery way, also, by keeping\ndown troubles, which is a\nthing that is always\nhelping in a place\nto be safe and well, what\nhe knows to our children\nwill be sufficient for them\nall the rest of their days, and\nwe will feel quite assured\nthat they can come out in\npublic, and compete with\nthe white man in business.\nWe like him because we\nhave confidence in him,\nand when we get stuck\nwe always have to go to him\nand it will always be the\nsame. I asked him the\nother day if he was ready\nto take the new school over,\nand he said yes; also, I\nasked him in regard to\nsewing and knitting\nfor the girls in the School.\nand he said, that, that was no obstacle, as he could get the services of an experienced worker who had been employed in an Industrial School, and thoroughly understood the work with Indian children.\n\nNow, we want Mr. Keruel and his father, Rev. Mr. Bunn to take this School, and the son to work under the father, for his father had been one of the best men who ever came out to this part of the country, to work amongst our people. This\nwork & discipline and examples\nof what he has taught\u2014still\nstand before us yet today,\nand no other improvements\nhave been made since he\nleft.\n\nWe have had so many teachers\nwho have proved perfect failures\nwho were graduates and certi-\nfied teachers, but this\nyoung man has always\nshown some improvement\nin his work, in spite of\nall his disadvantages\u2014\nwith irregular attendance\nand indiscipline of parents.\nWe thank the Government and Church for all they are doing for us, and it is not that we do not value and appreciate what both the Government and Church are doing for us, why we wish so much to have this same young teacher, and trust we may have a favorable reply which will be much appreciated by us all.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nChief Richard Woodhouse\nSir,\n\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nA short time ago I wrote Major General Sir Sam Hughes offering to raise a company (250) of Treaty and Non-treaty Indians for use overseas, and have just received a reply to consult Lieut. Col. H.H. Rutten, Commanding Officer, District No. 10, and lay the proposition before him which I have done today.\n\nMy proposition is to use the new school at Fairford till the 30th of June as the headquarters for this company. There is as yet no teacher in sight for the school. I have consulted Archbishop Matheson about this matter and he is agreeable to any action the Department of Indian Affairs may take in the matter. There need be no special injury to the Fairford Band as the present schools can be operated for the next two quarters. There will be no injury to the building as the Militia Department will be responsible for any damage. I am proposing in addition to raising this Company, to fulfill my present duties as Inspector. Trusting that this will receive your favourable consideration, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nD.C.

Mr. Scott has been absent for some time, but your letter was brought to his notice today and he expressed his appreciation of your efforts to aid in recruiting for overseas service. He also intimated that he would not make any objection to the use of the new Fairford school building as the headquarters of the company which you propose to recruit.\n\nAt the same time he asked me to bring to your attention the fact that the Department some days ago gave its consent to the engagement of Mr. and Mrs. Nyson as teacher and matron respectively of the new school at Fairford. I suppose, however, it will be possible to overcome this difficulty and I would ask you to be good enough to again consult with His Grace Archbishop Matheson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. J.

I was quite interested in the threshing scenes, and I am pleased to see that we have apparently a very nice school at Fairford.

Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n5 Chelsea Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI beg to draw your attention to a school teacher that we all want here in this reserve. And this young man is the teacher that we have had of lately and has given satisfactory work right along ever since he has taken over the school which he is still going on with. He has always been a faithful worker and never gave us trouble nor the Department but attended to his work faithfully and has always been a respectful young man both among the whites and our Indians.\n\nI just received a letter from this young man, Mr. Bishop Matheson, in regard to Mr. Burns being wanted by the Board to take the school over. Now his Grace says that Mr. Burns is a single man and holds no certificate and that the Department calls for a certified teacher and a married man so that his wife can teach the girls knitting and sewing.\nThis man who is trying for the school is an English man by the name of Hyson which we do not want or wish to have him at all, as he is no good in the school which he has now. He holds a certificate but that is all the good of it he can't impart to the children what he knows if he does know anything at all. Why we all want this young man, his father the Rev Geo Burns worked among us Indians on our Reserve for over forty years and we never had a better man both for School and Church his works today are like shining stars along side of the new hands that are in work here. As for the Industrial Schools they could not produce one Scholar that could compete with the scholars of the Rev Geo Burns nor yet one and his son is a promising young man and his works are already showing that he is a true and sincere young man to his work and we all have the greatest confidence in him for we know him as well and his father was the man that took the places of the late Arch Deacon Carly.\nand Mr. Hagg who first brought out the Gospel to this place when we were all in darkness. You kindly answer us at your earliest convenience in regard to keep Mr. Brier or teaching for us if he can't do the work, it is not hard to get another teacher but we want to keep him on and give him a trial; it is not as if he was going into the work of the Government for a life term that if he could not do the work, that another man could not be put in his place.\n\nYours Most respectfully,\n\nThomas Beardy\nSir:\u2014\n\nIn our meeting held in our school house just recently one subject which we talked about was that we wanted another man to take charge of the New Improved Day school, and not Mr. Hyson we would like to have this done before his teaching commences, we all know how the men from the other Reserve which he was teacher found fault with him, that he didn't fill out his duties as he should, and we know this to be true, for often when he should been down at his school we seen him up at our Reserve and we think we have good reasons not to have this man, to put the thing very strong all the Indians agree that they will not send their children to school if the Ind Dept will have this man, at the New School we had one teacher already like this man, his name was Fryer and he couldn't succeed in teaching Indian children as they couldn't understand to explain to an Indian child, the meaning into the language of the Indian child.\n\nImproved day we were all so glad when we got a New School and also that the Ind Dept agreed with certain ones to bring these children to this school.\n\nRupert Bruce is the man, he says that he secured a trained Nurse, we are sure that he can get along finesse he can talk the language of the children this was the method of his Father the Rev. G. Bruce use when he was teacher, and we think it helped the Indian child we wrote this already to His Grace the Archbish and he told us to write to the Ind Dept and say that don't want Mr. Hyson, but that we would have Rupert Bruce we want you to help us in this matter, as you yourself found out that Mr. Hyson neglected his duties as teac\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

I informed the Indians of this Band, that I knew nothing about this appointment, as Mr Inspector Jackson had this matter in hand, in speaking with the Rev Mr Dobbe, who is in charge of the church at Fairford, said that he thought the Indians were very unreasonable as he considered Mr Hysen, a Good Appointment and in his opinion Mr Bruce was not qualified for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Ogletree encloses a letter received from the Chief and Councillors of the Fairford Reserve regarding the appointment of a teacher for the new improved day school which has been put up there. They object to the appointment of Mr. Hyson, who was nominated by His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, and ask for the appointment of a Mr. Rupert Bruce, at present teaching the Upper Fairford School, where he has been for the past eight years.\n\nA letter has also been received from Chief Beardy urging the appointment of Mr. Bruce and making strong objections to Mr. Hyson, who is an Englishman and has only been a short time in this country and is unused to its ways.\n\nI have turned out the correspondence in regard to the appointment of Mr. Hyson, which was only temporary. Mr. Hyson has been teaching for the past three quarters at the Little Saskatchewan School and,\nif what the Indians say is true, he has not been a success there. The December quarter return shows only an average of seven, while he started with an enrolment of 45 in the June quarter, last.

I was in communication, yesterday, with the J.A. Thorburn Co., the people from whom I ordered the seats in Winnipeg, and they have no word yet on the seats, which were ordered in January. The first shipment was lost completely and the second is not in sight but they are expecting word at any time now.\n\nWith regard to the supplies and equipment belonging to the Upper and Lower Fairford Schools, I might say that both schools had a very limited equipment, which has been in use for quite a long time, of which the desks are the principal item. As I understand the people at Upper Fairford are going to start a school, I would suggest that I be given authority to sell the old desks to this School District, if they will purchase them.

Ryson, teacher of the Improved Day School on the Fairford Reserve, with reference to the amount of salary he received for the period he taught this school till June 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Ryson was appointed teacher of this school at a salary of $600.00 per year, and his wife as matron at a salary of $300.00 per year. This agreement as to salary was made with His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land.\n\nMr. Ryson began duties during February and taught a total of 91 days to June 30th, last, the end of the school year. The Department requires that each of its day schools shall be open 200 days in each school year. Mr. Ryson has been paid 91/200 of his yearly salary of $600.00, or a total of $273.00. There is, therefore, no further balance of salary due Mr. Ryson.\n\nThe Department has not been advised as to whether Mrs. Ryson arrived from England and took the duties of matron at this point, and if so, no reports from her concerning her work have been received.

I know nothing of the circumstances of the case, but you can ascertain from Mr. Jackson, the inspector, whether there is the need.\n\nIf it will make for increased efficiency, I should be pleased to see the purchase authorized.

Payments made in connection with this school show that for nine months the cost of running it was over $100.00 per pupil on the average attendance and the Department wishes to ascertain whether this large expenditure is justified.\n\nAs no reports have been received on the Little Saskatchewan and Lake St. Martin Schools for sometime, you might visit these two schools also and report on them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nYour letter of the 2nd instant to hand and in reply. The school is situated about two miles from the nearest store and at the time the school was started no arrangement was made as to how Mr. Hyson was to get to the school what provisions were required for the noon meal. He was told what kind of a meal to give the children and was told to get the provision and send voucher to the Agent for payment. The roads are bad between the store and the school for several months of the year and a pony and a light buckboard would be of great use to Mr. Hyson, not alone to carry the supplies but to enable him to visit the Indians who are not sending their children regularly to school. The pony, harness and rig required could be bought for about $250.00. A stable has already been erected at this school big enough for a cow and horse.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 2nd of April and my letter of the 16th ultimo, it has cost Mr Hyson at the least $1.00 per week for getting his supplies from the station to the school, and as well he has expended $50.00 more in hire of rigs in going to see people who are reported sick. According to the regulations of the Department he can only send for the Doctor when he is required on the Fairford Reserve for serious cases, and in order to establish that fact he has to visit the patient from one half to five miles away. Those families who have horses will usually send a horse and rig after him but in most cases he has to walk and in all kinds of weather. After going into the situation thoroughly with Mr Hyson, I have no hesitation in reporting that a pony and buggy should be bought for him. He informs me that a suitable light horse can be bought for $100.00 and a buggy or buckboard will cost about the same, $100.00 for the buggy and $60.00 for the buckboard, and the latter will do for Mr Hyson's purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter No. 469929/1, of date April 16th, 1917, I made a visit to the Fairford Improved Day School on the 24th instant and you will find attached my report on the school. When Canon Jeffrey came up with me to pick the site for the school, we agreed after consultation with Archbishop Matheson to recommend the present site on condition that the children would be conveyed to the school, and that agreement ought to be carried out by the Department, seeing that they went on and built the school.\n\nThe school building is a credit to the Department, the site is a good one and very little remains to be done to make the grounds both attractive and useful. The Teacher and the Matron are both careful and capable and they can make the school a success.\n\nWhile at the school during the building in 1915, I notified the Department that I was about to fence in forty acres with barb wire and two gates. I got out enough teakwood posts for this work but on account of the lateness in the season I was unable to go on with the fence that fall, and nothing has been done since then. This fencing ought to be done at once so as to enable the teacher to keep a cow or two and thus be able to give the children milk to drink. The cost of this fencing will be about $64.00 for wire and $16.00 for gates. If the Department will authorize this expenditure I will go out there in July or later, after my return from the Treaty Payments at The Pas, and see this work completed.\n\nI would also like to expend about $200.00 more on the road leading into Fairford Station. I did three quarters of a mile in 1915 and this road should be finished. It is very bad in\nwet seasons, and the Indians will work for their rations.\n\nOwing to the high price of flour, $7.00 a sack, at the present time and all other supplies in proportion, the Indians here will have a hard time pulling through the season and this work in July or August would help them to get some supplies for haying.\n\nThe school was in great danger on the 14th, 15th and 16th of May from bush fires but was saved by backfiring. I would recommend a fire break, say 15 feet wide, ploughed around the school grounds to protect the school buildings from the fall fires. There will be about three acres of ploughing.\n\nThe room in the basement that was boarded or partitioned off from the rest of the basement for the purpose of keeping vegetables, requires boarding up inside to prevent the frost from getting into the room. This room is 12 x 14 and it will require 500 ft of shiplap, 9 pieces 2 x 4 16 ft long, two rolls of brown paper, and say ten pounds of nails to do what is necessary. Thos. Sanderson will do the work for $6.00. I would recommend that Mr. Hyson be authorized to get this material from the Armstrong Trading Company, Fairford, and send in the voucher for material and Sanderson's bill when the work is completed.\n\nI would recommend that John Robert Woodford be given the contract for hauling the children from Lower Fairford at $2.00 per day, Thos. Storr the contract for hauling the children from Upper Fairford at $1.50 per day, and Robert Anderson be given the contract for hauling them from across the river at Lower Fairford to meet Woodford. All of these contracts to be for one year. With these arrangements I see no difficulty in keeping the attendance up to 25.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

Hyson, Teacher.\nMrs. A. Hyson, Matron.\n\nOn the roll I found six boys and twenty one girls, classified as follows:\n\n| Standard | 1   | 16 |\n|----------|-----|----|\n|          | 2   | 7  |\n|          | 3   | 4  |\n\nThere were present at inspection in the forenoon four boys and eleven girls. School was started by the singing of a hymn and prayer.\n\nThe Second Standard, two pupils, read fairly well in the Ontario Second Reader and can spell nearly all the words in their lesson. The second part of the First Standard, 2 boys and 2 girls, read well in the First Ontario Reader and also can spell any word in their lesson. The First part of the First Standard read nicely in the Ontario Primer and spell well all of the words taken from their lesson. The Third Standard, 2 girls, read well in the Third Book and are very good at Spelling. The A.B.C. Class can spell out of the Ontario Primer all the words on Page 17 and can also say from the blackboard all the letters of the Alphabet. At recess three of the larger girls went into the kitchen to help the matron get dinner. After recess all the classes in the school were taught Arithmetic from figures only to Long Division. This lasted just one hour.\n\nAt 12 sharp the fifteen pupils went into the dining room adjoining the school room and had their dinner. They had soup, minced meat, biscuit, bannock, tea, sugar but no milk.\n\nAt the afternoon session all the pupils in the room were taught writing with pen and ink in their copy books for one hour, and then\nfrom 20 to 3 all the girls went for one hour to Mrs. Hyson, who taught them sewing, knitting, etc., and the boys for one hour went out with Mr. Hyson to clean up the grounds and work in the garden. From 3 to 4 all the pupils are taught drawing on their slates, scribblers and on the blackboard.\n\nThe class-room is 24 x 36, with 16 foot ceiling and six large windows. The pupils' dining room is behind and is 12 x 24 with 8 foot 6 inches ceiling. The wing on the east for the teacher is 32 x 16 divided into kitchen, dining room on the first floor and three bedrooms upstairs. There are also two small dormitories over the Pupils' Dining room. There is a full basement under all the building with an 8 foot ceiling and cement floor. There is a large hot air furnace to heat the building and a fifty barrel tank for soft water. The furnace heats all the building above the basement perfectly and a very little improvement will make the basement frostproof.\n\nThere is a small stable and poultry house 14 x 20 and three water closets. All the buildings are in first class shape with the exception of the stable which never got any paint on account of the lateness of the painter in finishing the main building. Nothing was lost to the Department as this painting would have been an extra. If the Department will authorize me to buy about six gallons of paint I will have this building painted when I go up in July.\n\nThe attendance at the school for the first and second quarters after it was opened was well over the 80 mark, but since they quit hauling the children from Upper Fairfield, the attendance has fallen for the last three full quarters to 12.15. If some adjustment and rearrangement is not soon made, the attendance will soon be nil. This school is in a fine position and can do good work if the Department will agree to pay a fair price to the men who will carry the children to the school. John Robert Woodhouse has been\ncarrying the children from Lower Fairford since the school started for $1.00 a trip and he has to drive every day over 20 miles to get and return the children to their homes. He has been awaiting a reply for sometime from the Department as to an increase, and Mr Ogletree informed him at the last treaty payments that he had applied to the Department for an increase to $2.00 a trip but up to that time had received no reply.\n\nIn the first start Alex Letandre agreed to haul the children from Upper Fairford for 75 cents a day. He turned the job over to Thos.Storr who brought the children to the end of June 1916, and then quit as he could not make it pay. Since the first week in July no children have been brought from Upper Fairford and in consequence the average attendance has been reduced by the number at that point. Thos.Storr has agreed to haul the children from Upper Fairford for $1.50 a day. This is a reasonable rate, and I would recommend the acceptance of his offer to start on the first day of July. Wm.Sumner, who has been hauling the children from across the river to meet John Robert Woodford's team, has not been giving satisfaction, and I have arranged that he quit on the first of July, Robert Anderson taking his place and job at the price of 75 cents a day.\nIndian Affairs.

It is the reason why we are bothering you through your Grace and kindness to grant us a order to be paid by the Dept. to continue the transporting those children for another year. With kind regards to you.\n\nWe remain faithfully,\n\nSigned Chief Richard Woodhouse\n\nCouncillor Harry Anderson\nsituation than I can.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMy Dear Mr. Scott:\n\nThere appears to be some difficulty about the conveying of the children to the Improved School at Fairford. Mr. Jackson on behalf of the Indian Department, and Canon Jeffery representing the Church, decided on the site of the School and the former assured me that the Indian Department had undertaken to pay for the conveying of the children to the School. The teamsters seem to have discovered that they cannot afford to do the work for the price at first agreed upon, and apparently have ceased to carry the children to the School. The consequence is that the attendance has fallen off seriously and promises to dwindle down to a worse degree. I am informed by the inspector and others that very satisfactory work was being done in the school, and there was every hope that the influence of the instruction given would be far-reaching for good in the Reserve. I am enclosing a petition which I received from the Chief of the Band, which speaks for itself. Will you kindly have the matter looked into as soon as possible, so that no further injury may be done to the School. From my experience of the distances covered by the teamsters, the remuneration they ask is not at all unreasonable. I have not been able to get into touch with Mr. Jackson, who, I daresay, can give you more information about the\nNovember 6th, 1917.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Matheson -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's communication of the 25th ultimo, in reference to the situation at Fairford.\n\nI have looked carefully into this matter. Some time ago when action was taken to discontinue the transport of pupils, it was upon the ground of economy. The cost of maintaining this school under the present management has been over $100.00 per capita on the average attendance. I think Your Grace will agree with me that expenditure at this rate for a day school education is hardly justifiable.\n\nAt the same time I will admit that there is some obligation on the part of the Department to convey these children to school, but we must obtain reasonable service. The drivers have doubled their rates, which I do not think they should have done. However, I propose to write the agent telling him\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nthat if he can obtain reasonable rates for the transport he may make engagements with teamsters for the winter months at least. I hope that the Indians of this reserve will realize that they too have some obligation at this time when the funds of the Department have been so seriously curtailed. Frankly I do not think it would be any hardship if they were asked to undertake to drive the children to school during the winter months, if they are so interested in their education as they would wish to appear. I propose to offer the drivers remuneration at the original rate or at the rate first agreed upon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, November 9, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nHis Grace, Archbishop Matheson, who wrote the Department under date of the 25th ultimo asking for a reconsideration of the instructions issued to discontinue the driving of pupils to and from the Fairford Improved Day School, has been informed that, while the cost of maintaining this school under the present management is hardly justifiable, it is admitted that there is some obligation on the part of the Department to convey the children to school, but reasonable rates for this service must be obtained.\n\nIf you can make satisfactory arrangements with the teamsters for the winter months you may do so. It is considered that they should be willing to accept the rate of pay first agreed upon, and the Indians should see that they do this, if they are as interested as they claim to be in the education of their children.

Forwarded under cover of his letter of December 6th, 1927. Original on 427021/26.\n\nThis reserve has the best Improved Day School in the Inspectorate and the band are commencing to see the benefit of such an institution on the reserve. The health of the band has been fair during the year and at my last visit there was little or no sickness on the reserve. Mr. Nyson, teacher, and his wife do a lot for this band in the way of looking after all the minor ailments among the Indians, and in serious cases send calls for the Doctor who lives at Lundy's sixty miles south of the reserve. Mr. Nyson at the time of my visit had a good supply of all the necessary drugs.\nSir,\n\nWhen in Fairford during the last week of October, and while at the Improved Day School, the Teacher asked me if he might admit to the school three children belonging to Joseph Sinclair, No.56 of the Little Saskatchewan Band. At that time the children were stopping with their Grandfather, Geo/Bruce, a member of the Fairford Band. One of the Councillors of the Fairford Band is objecting to these children attending the school and told Mr Ryson to turn them out. I might say further that by permission of Chief Woodhouse of the Fairford Band, Joseph Sinclair has put up a small house on the reserve to use during the fishing season.\n\nThis school has not an attendance anywhere near its capacity and I would recommend that these children be permitted to attend the school. I have notified Mr Ryson to admit them till a ruling on the matter has been obtained on-the-matter from the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

Bruce, a member of the Fairford Band, as one of the councillors of the Band objected to these children attending the school, and stating further that, by permission of Chief Woodhouse, Joseph Sinclair has put up a small house on the reserve to use during the fishing season.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in notifying Mr. Nyson, the teacher, to admit these children into his school is approved.

Mrs Desjarlais has 8 boys, ages 10 and 8 years and one girl 12 years old. Mrs R. Sanderson has 2 girls, ages 15 and 14 years and one boy 10 years old. The number of children on the roll for week ending May 17th was 23.\n\nThe total attendance to that date was 47%. The daily average for that time was 14.7%.

Desjarlais and Mrs. Robert Cameron, now treaty Indians, would like to send their children, six in number, to the Fairford School, while they are visiting at Fairford.

Iden's Child\n\nOn Nov. 1st I received a note asking for medicine, as I was out on a visit across the river to seek child. I went down to a settlement and saw the child on my return. He told me she had got very wet whilst out with her grandfather on Tuesday Oct 27th and had gone to sleep in her damp clothes. He asked for Calomel oil as his towels were working badly. I had several cases of sickness the same as he case, and Dr. Donald gave me, and also some Indians, known instructions to keep the children in bed and keep their feet up. I told Alex if he wanted me the next day I would go and I would come. I had no message till Friday (not enclosed) when I went at once, the child was very sick a high temperature was on and she was in pain. I did all I could to relieve her pain and told them to keep her in bed, and I would get the Dr. Whilst there although the her temperature was high she got off the couch to go to have her hair done, & as Alex said she was looking out of window a few minutes before she died. The Dr. came after she had died and made an examination, & took a statement from Alex. I am fairness to Alex I have not heard myself that he committed it was through any neglect on my part and went when he called me, & Alex\nWhen he had not called me. This report I think you will find will be in accordance with the one the D has.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obediently,\n\nA. Styron.\n\nS. J. Jackson Esq.,\nInspector of Indian agencies,\nSherrill,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nYour letter No. 46929/1 of date the 8th of August was received in due course, with copy of a petition received from the Fairford band of Indians, which petition asked for the dismissal of Mr. Hyson the teacher of the Improved day-school, on that reserve.\n\nI beg leave to report on this matter as follows. I interviewed nearly all of the Indians who signed the petition and some whose names were not attached thereto.\n\nMr. Hyson has a difficult position to fill on this reserve, seeing that he is the custodian of the destitute supplies, and nearly always has supplies on hand, when often the stores at that point are entirely out of flour, and the members of the band come to him and ask him to lend them flour till the Merchants get theirs in. He has to refuse them, and in consequence makes enemies of some members of the band. The last time I was at the school, one of the leading men in the band asked me to try and get Mr. Hyson to loan him a sack of flour, as there was none to be obtained at the Fairford stores. I explained to him fully Mr. Hyson's position as the official in charge of the destitute supplies, and that he could not on any account give these supplies to anyone but the destitute. Mr. Hyson has charge of the medicines, and is the one charged with the duty of calling in the Doctor in case of illness, if he does not consider it necessary to send for him, and anything goes wrong, he gets all the blame.\n\nLast spring the Indians of the reserve cut a lot of dry wood without a permit from the Agent, and they blame Mr. Hyson for giving Mr. Ogiltree information on the matter, but Mr. Ogiltree informs me that he got his knowledge of this when he visited the reserve in June, and seized the wood some days later. Alexander Letander blames Mr. Hyson for his daughter's death, but I investigated this charge last year and found that Mr. Hyson was not to blame in the matter, and that it was neglect.\nneglect by the parents of the Doctor's instructions, that really caused\nthe child's death. These instructions were given by Mr. Hyson, as told\nhim by the Doctor for similar cases.\n\nI saw the authorities of the Anglican Church at Winnipeg, and\nwas informed that Archbishop Matheson is well pleased with the work\nof Mr. & Mrs. Hyson in the Fairford district, and does not think that\nhe would be able to replace them at an early date.\n\nI interviewed nearly all of the Indians who signed the petition\nand I find that there is very little cause of complaint against Mr.\nHyson, and that not of a serious character. You will find a copy of\nthe notes made by me when interviewing the Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy And Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nStonewall, October 22nd, 1918.\n\nInterviews with Fairford Indians re the petition sent to the Department of Indian Affairs, asking for the dismissal of Mr. Ryson the teacher of the Improved Day School at Fairford, Manitoba.\n\nCouncillor John Robert Woodford, says that he did not mean to sign the petition against Mr. Ryson; he told Gilbert Cook that he had no fault to find with Mr. Ryson, and says that he is a good man. He also says that it was Hamilton Letandre who told them about Mr. Ryson having sent word to Agent Ogilvie that the wood was being cut without a permit, and that this caused the seizure of the wood. He says that Archbishop Matheson gave them Mr. Ryson and they ought to be satisfied with him. Mrs. Ryson also is a good woman, and teaches their children how to sew, knit, and keep house. When they were talking this matter over at Upper Fairford, and outside of any building, H. Letandre went into the Icelandic Store and came out with the petition in a few minutes, and said sign here, sign here, and the most of them who were present signed.\n\nGilbert Cook whose name is on the petition, says that he did not sign it, and that Mr. Ryson is a good man, and that his wife is a good woman, and that he has no fault to find with either of them.\n\nAlexander Letandre's only reason for wanting Mr. Ryson removed is that he did not act promptly in calling the Doctor when his daughter was sick about two years ago. The girl died and he still feels that if the Doctor had been called right away she might have recovered. He has nothing against Mr. or Mrs. Ryson as teacher or matron, and is sending his children to the school. (Copy of letter re this matter attached.)\n\nW.J. Sumner says that he put his name on the petition because he did not like to say no. He likes Mr. Ryson, and has nothing to say against him, and as far as he knows he is doing well, he says he was urged to sign by H. Letandre. He also says that his brother John who was present at the meeting, signed the same as he.\nRobert Anderson did not sign the petition, and has nothing against Mr. Hyson, and thinks that both Mr. & Mrs. Hyson are doing a very good work at the school, and on the reserve. His Father Harry Anderson who is a Councillor of the reserve signed the petition because he believed that Mr. Hyson informed Mr. Ogilvie about the Indians cutting wood without a permit. I am sending my children to the school, and would like to see the Department arrange to pay for the conveying the children to the school, as it was the first year. He wants permission to put up a small stable at or near the school, if he does this he will give his children a pony so that they can drive to the school.\n\nWilliam Sumner signed the petition just because he was asked, as for himself he knows nothing against Mr. or Mrs. Hyson, he was told by Alexander, and Hamilton Letander, that they ought to get a new teacher, and he thought he would sign the petition to have him removed. He thinks that the Government ought to carry out their promise and haul their children to the school.\n\nJim Thompson says that he signed the petition because the Chief told him that his children were not learning very fast, as for himself he knows nothing, he does not send his children to the school, as he lives too far away.\n\nThomas Store was at the meeting where they talked about getting Mr. Hyson dismissed, and heard all that took place. I heard them say that the reason they wanted him dismissed was because he sent word to Mr. Ogilvie about the wood being cut without a permit. I knew nothing this matter and would not sign the petition. I know nothing against Mr. Hyson, and as I live too far away from the school, do not send my children, and do not know anything regarding Mr. Hyson as a teacher.\n\nWilliam Woodhouse signed the petition because the rest did, but has nothing against Mr. Hyson, and does not know much about his teaching.\nRobert Bruce did not sign the petition as he knows nothing for which Mr. Nyson deserves to be dismissed. He has known him ever since he has been at the school and can say nothing against him. He also knows Mrs. Nyson and thinks she is very good.\n\nChief Woodhouse signed the petition because he thinks that Mr. Nyson was meddling with things on the reserve with which he has no business, for instance, his writing the Agent about the wood that was cut without a permit. He says that this wood was dry and it was better to dispose of it, as his band was hard up at the time, and they had to do something to make a living. He does not think that Mr. Nyson is much of a teacher, and thought that a change would do some good. Robert Anderson told him that he was at the Portage La Prairie in the Indian Agents office, and saw the letter from Mr. Nyson to Mr. Ogilvie informing the Agent that the Dry wood on the reserve was being sold by the band.\n\nRobert Anderson told on being asked, that he saw the letter at the Agents office, referred to by the Chief, and that it was as stated giving the information to Mr. Ogilvie that the band was selling the wood on the reserve.\nOttawa, October 31, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the petition signed by yourself, the councillors and other members of the Fairford Band asking for the removal of Mr. Nyson from the position of teacher of the school on your reserve was referred to Mr. Inspector Jackson, who has sent in his report and copies of evidence taken by him.\n\nAfter reading this report and the evidence the Department is satisfied that there is no just cause for the removal of Mr. Nyson and it is hoped that, instead of fault finding, the Indians will assist him in his school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChief Richard Woodhouse,\nFairford Reserve,\nFairford, Man.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, November 2, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo reporting on the petition received from the Fairford Band of Indians asking for the dismissal of Mr. Ryson, teacher of the improved day school on their reserve, and enclosing a copy of the notes made by you when interviewing the Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Chief Richard Woodhouse has been informed that, after reading this report and evidence, the Department is satisfied that there is no just cause for the removal of Mr. Ryson and that it is hoped that, instead of fault finding, the Indians will assist him in his school work.\n\nIt is noted that some of the Indians ask that their children be not driven to school. The Department is unable to do this, however, as it has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nYou also state that Robert Anderson wants permission to put up a small stable at or near the school and, if he does this, he will give his children a pony so that they can drive to school. Kindly furnish a report in regard to this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nJohn Henry Sanderson, a non-treaty Indian, lives one mile from the Fairford Improved Day School, and seven miles from a white school, as he informed me lately when he came to see me about his children. He asked me to write the Department and find out if they would let him send his children, one boy 10 and one girl each seven and eight years of age, to the Fairford School.\n\nHis wife's father Peter Anderson was a teacher at Indian Dept. schools for about 20 years; his cousins are members of Indian bands around Lake St. Martin, and he promises to send his children every school day.\n\nHe will deliver at the school three cords of wood every year in which his children are allowed to attend.\n\nI would recommend that the request of Mr. Sanderson be granted, and that Mr. Nyson be notified to put the children's names on the roll of the school, regular attendance and the delivery of the wood being all that is required of Mr. Sanderson.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

The Inspector states that Sanderson will deliver at the school three cords of wood every year while the children are in attendance. The Inspector is being informed that the Department will consent to these children being enrolled and they are to receive the same attention from the teacher as given to the other Indian children.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mr. Sanderson of the permission granted his children to attend the Fairford School and it is expected that he will see that they attend regularly and also that he fulfills his promise to deliver the wood each year. You will also inform the teacher to the same effect.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.B. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nA.

December, 15.93. April, 12.78. June, 14.27. Sept. 10.70\n\nThe first standard pupils read fairly well in the first primer, and are good at spelling. They can do small sums in addition, and are making good progress at writing.\n\nThe second standard read well in the 2nd book at any place I asked for, and could spell any word in their lessons. They do sums up to long division, and are good writers.\n\nThe 3rd standard read well at several places in the 3rd book (picked by me), and are very well on in spelling. In arithmetic they do all sorts of problems, up to and including fractions. They are also good at writing. I inspected the table while they were having their lunch, and I found the bill of fare as follows, Porridge, potatoes, biscuit, tea, and plenty of it. Mrs. Hyson has a class every afternoon for girls, where she teaches them to sew knit and keep house. The poor attendance at the time of my visit, was on account of the children staying home to help their parents pick the potato crop. This school is kept very clean and neat, and all the school material is in the very best of order, and Mrs. Hyson has her portion of the building in good order. The building in every part is in a good state of repair.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed you will find a copy of the notes made by me on a recent visit to the Improved Day School, which is situated on the Fairford Reserve.\n\nI would like to call the attention of the Department to the fact that this school building was located on the present site with the understanding that the children were to be conveyed to the school, and I am convinced that the attendance would be largely increased if the Department could see its way clear to put a couple of school van's on the road. Most of the children who attend at this school come about two miles, so that in stormy weather and when the roads are bad, the children can not be expected to attend.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nJ.D.

He has also been informed that the stable must be at least one hundred feet from any of the outbuildings in connection with the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEARY,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nSir\n\nI wish to bring this matter before you, and trust you will take it up with the proper authorities on my behalf.\n\nMrs. Hyson, (Field Matron) has been receiving a salary of $300.00 a year, and a bonus of $150.00 a year. By the classification of the Department under the Civil Service Act, she has received a cheque for $180.00 as arrears of salary for the past fiscal year ended March the 31st, 1920, this was on July the 10th, and a week later, a further cheque of $45.00 as arrears for this year, then came the usual cheque of $37.50 for bonus.\n\nNow from her monthly cheque received last night for the month ending July, her salary has been raised from $25.00 a month to $40.00 a month.\n\nI should like to know why I am not entitled to like arrears on my salary under the classification, as I have been in the service of the Department longer than Mrs. Hyson, and again the Teachers of Lake St. Martin's and Little Saskatchewan Reserves are both receiving extra salary now.\n\nI am Sir\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Signed.)

Ryson, teacher of the Fairford Indian Day School, regarding the salary which he receives as teacher and his wife as field matron.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, under the classification, the minimum salary for field matrons is $40.00 per month, and the cheques which Mrs. Ryson has received were for arrears of salary from the first of April, 1919.\n\nThe teachers in the Indian day schools have not come under the classification and there is, therefore, no increase made in the salary of Mr. Ryson and no arrears of salary are due him. I may add that the Department has made no general increase in salaries to teachers in the Indian day schools, and, in the few instances where increases have been made, it was because of special circumstances in each case, and your remark that you have written Mr. Ryson to the effect that no doubt the increase allowed by the Department to teachers would be sent him in due time is not understood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Original on 126-5-6.\n\nThe number of children of school age within two miles of the school is, as told me by the field matron, Mrs. Ryson, 35 and the attendance should be very much larger than the register shows.\n\nThe chief and councilors of this band, though spoken to by me on many occasions, have not been able to keep the children going to this school, though the Chief and Councillor John R. Woodford have done their best to keep the children going to school, but they tell me that a large number of the band do not like Mr. Ryson and in consequence are careless about the matter. The real reason for this dislike is that Agent Ogletree gives him too much agency work to do and this gets him in wrong with a large number of the band and this has a bad effect on the school. Mr. Ryson is perfectly competent to teach these Indian children all that it is necessary for them to learn. He was a scout-master in England, is well educated and though he has had no normal training he has a good general knowledge of how to impart what he knows.\n\nAt the band meeting while I was there it was thought by one of the band that the Department might arrange to allow some of the children to stay at the school from Monday morning to till Friday evening. Mrs. Ryson says that she could manage this if she were given the services of a servant girl at say $30.00 a month and board. Ten girls could be kept letting all the boys go home.\n\nS. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nI am a member of Fairford Band, Treaty No. 50. I beg to put before you my reasons for not sending my children to the Fairford Improved Day School, as I feel it is the wish of your department that our children should be educated. If the teacher is not satisfactory and does not exercise proper supervision over the children, or my child learned curse words in the native language for the short time she attended, also, I beg to state re the inquiry held here by Indian agent Mr. Cuthbert June 20th the agent did not interrogate the entire band. I gave evidence which could not be disproved. I would like to know whether it is allowable for the teacher to sell rations. I can prove that our teacher sold the rations. I have evidence to show that he never bought any flour in the local stores. These things ought to be inquired into. Other members of the Band too have complained but no notice has been taken of it. Truly, Thos. Storr\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nWhen it was agreed between this Band and an Indian Officer to give a portion of our Reserve to build an improved day school, we were promised by the Indian Department was willing to give a certain sum of money for the hauling of the pupils to the school. This was carried on for a while then stopped. We would like this taken up again at $2.50 per day.\n\nAlso kindly send us a map showing all the Islands belonging to the Reserve, especially the Undametkin Island.\n\nYours very truly,\nRichard Woodhouse, Chief\nHarry Anderson, Councillor.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nSir - Re A. Hyeon our teacher for our school. It is agreed by all the members of this band to have him removed from here, and have the services of another teacher. All, or the majority of this band will not send their children to school as long as he is teacher.\n\nNow we want you to give us a change of teachers. If the Indian Department wishes to have him, we do not send him to some other school, and give us another teacher.\n\nIn the past we have had teachers who were conversant with the language of the pupils, who could make them understand what they study. Mr. Hyeon cannot do this, as he cannot talk or understand it. We want a teacher who can both use the English and the language of the Indian pupil, and in that both teacher and pupil will not be labouring in difficulty of that nature. We may say since our last teacher (Colin Sanderson) our children has made little or no progress at school especially in arithmetic which is a very useful branch of study in our schools. We who live and reside here in the Reserve and in the vicinity of the school know all about it and how Mr. Hyeon teaches and in other ways he does in the Reserve. The Indian Department at Ottawa do not know all what we know about him.\n\nAwaiting your reply.\n\nWitness,\n\nColin Sanderson.\n\nWe are yours very truly,\n\nRichard Woodhouse, Chief\n\nHarry Anderson, Councillor.\nOTTAWA, August 15th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant regarding the services of Mr. A. Hyson, teacher of the Fairford Indian Day School, and requesting that another teacher be assigned who has a knowledge of both the English and Indian languages.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department made enquiries regarding the work that Mr. Hyson has performed in the school, and, it is considered, from the report received, that the complaint made by yourself and the Councillor is on account of a personal disagreement with the teacher over the issuing of rations and the borrowing of money, which he had trouble to collect.\n\nMr. Hyson is quite competent to teach the children provided he does so regularly, and it is hoped that you will use your influence and the vote of parents and their children to school. The Department is not prepared, on the statements submitted by you, to take any action in dismissing the present teacher and obtaining the services of another.\n\nRegarding the providing of a grant to transport the children to and from school, I beg to say that this has been tried on a number of other Reserves and has not been a success. A grant cannot, therefore, be paid for the purpose at Fairford.\n\nRegarding the request for a map of the Reserve, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose a copy of the petition which I received from the Indians at Fairford, which explains itself. When I was out there a few days ago the Chief and a number of others waited upon me and urged the combination of the School and Church work under an Ordained Missionary. I explained to them that the experiment was not uniformly successful, and that recently, where such a combination exists, I have had complaints that the Missionary was giving all his time to the School and neglecting his pastoral work. They persisted in their plea however, and the enclosed is the result.\n\nI may state that some time ago I had complaints about the inefficiency of Mr. Hyson, etc., and I wrote to Mr. Ogletree who promised to hold an investigation and let me know the outcome, but I have never heard from him since.\n\nMy opinion is that the discontent arises, not fully perhaps but largely from a dislike to Mr. Hyson though I am not aware of any reason for such. He appears to be a pleasant man but certainly the attendance at the school is most discouraging, and in my address to them on Sunday I spoke strongly of the neglect of the parents in sending their children to school and told them that we white people had to make sacrifices to have our children educated and that they should do the same especially as the education cost them nothing.\n\nIn their interview afterwards they accused me of hurting their feelings by talking too plainly. My view is that the only solution of the difficulty at all these Missions is to bring the compulsory regulation in to force forthwith. I find the same condition prevailing in other missions which I visited and children are growing up in absolute ignorance, not able to read or write. With kindest regards, I am,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nIndian Office,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 21st, 1921.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a copy of a petition which you received from the Indians of the Fairford Reserve in which they request that the school and church work on that Reserve be combined under an ordained missionary.\n\nIn connection with this request, I beg to say that the Department has received several complaints from the Indians regarding the work that Mr. Hyson, the present teacher, is performing in the school. Our Agent, Mr. Ogilvie, was asked to investigate the complaints and he reported as follows:\n\n\"I might say, I find that these Indians were very hard up last winter on account of the poor fishing, and they have been bothering Mr. Hyson a great deal about provisions, demanding several times to be allowed to use rations, and also wanting to borrow money. Mr. Hyson has been advancing money to some of them, to help them out and has had trouble with them when trying to collect from them.\"\n\nThe Department informed the Chief, Richard Woodhouse, that it was not prepared, on the reports received regarding the work the teacher is performing, to take any action in dismissing him and obtaining the services of another teacher, as Mr. Hyson is quite competent to teach the children provided they attend regularly.\n\nThe Department does not desire to lose the services of Mr. Hyson, but if the Indians are dissatisfied with him it is doubtful if his future work in this school would meet with much success, and it may be that an arrangement could be made to have him transferred to another school.\n\nRegarding the wish of the Indians that the work of the missionary and teacher be combined, I beg to say that the Department will leave this matter in your hands for such action as you consider to be in the best interests of the work on this Reserve. If there are any other of the Church of England Indian schools to which Mr. Hyson could be transferred and a new teacher secured for Fairford it might solve\n\nMost Rev. S. P.

It will not be kind or fair to Mr. Hyson to make the change before next Spring, unless he consents to it willingly. However, as soon as I have time I will go into the question fully, and do what I consider wisest in the premises. Mr. Hyson might do well at the Sioux Mission at Oak River, Man.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nI understand from His Grace the Archbishop that it has been decided by the Church that Mr. and Mrs. Hyson are to be removed from Fairford School.\n\nI beg to say that I consider this a grave mistake as both Mr. and Mrs. Hyson have done good work at Fairford, and if these people are removed by request of the Indians, there will always be trouble there.\n\nIt is no fault of Mr. Hyson that there is not a better attendance at the school, the whole trouble is the location of the school. We could have a good attendance there if the children were taken to and from the school.\n\nIt is impossible to compel children to come three miles to school.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nMarch 25, 1922.\n\nMemorandum For File:\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hyson were appointed Teacher and Matron, respectively, at the Fairford Improved Day School, Fortage agency, in February 1916, at salaries of $600 and $300.\n\nThe Department turned down a petition of the Indians that Mr. Hyson be dismissed, in November 1918. It appears to be a personal dislike for the teacher that keeps the attendance low and the Indians dissatisfied. Mr. Inspector Jackson reported that the small attendance was caused by Mr. Hyson's unpopularity. It is stated that Mr. Agent Ogletree gives Mr. Hyson agency work, the execution of which has given rise to the dissatisfaction on the part of the Indians.\n\nIn April 1921 the Department turned down another petition from the band. The agent reported that Mr. Hyson had had trouble as Dispenser of Rations, etc., and in the collection of personal loans to the Indians.\n\nIn August 1921 the Chief and two other Indians petitioned the Department again, and were again refused.\n\nIn September 1921, His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land was petitioned, and he suggested to the Department the compulsory clause to solve the difficulty. We informed His Grace that it might be advisable to have Mr. Hyson transferred, and Archbishop Matheson thought that the spring and summer of 1922 would give him an opportunity to place the teacher at another point.\n\nI promised to visit His Grace in Winnipeg, in June, and to discuss the future of the Fairford Improved Day School.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have noted your opinion that it would be a mistake to transfer Mr. and Mrs. Hyson, Teacher and Matron at the Fairford Improved Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that the Department is aware that the discontent on the part of the Indian band is caused by no inefficiency on the part of the teacher. However, if Mr. Hyson does not possess the confidence of the band with which he is working, his efforts are unavoidably, more or less abortive. I am convinced that Mr. Hyson is suited to Indian work, and correspondence has been initiated between this office and His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, with a view to transferring Mr. Hyson and his wife to some other reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa, March 29, 1922.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nA Mr. and Mrs. MacDougall, of Carleton Place, Ont., called at the office this morning, and I find that the young man, who is 24 years of age, is looking forward to ordination in the Anglican Church Ministry. He and his wife are very much interested in Indian work, and I immediately thought of the Fairford Improved Day School and possible openings in your work in Manitoba.\n\nMr. and Mrs. MacDougall are very bright and he is qualified, professionally, as a teacher; she has some experience teaching music. They have promised to keep in touch with me, and I am writing to you and to Canon Gould, of Toronto, with a view to having them enter our Indian work under the auspices of your Church.\n\nDo you feel that Fairford is too exacting a position for an unordained missionary teacher of 24 years? If not, I would be very pleased, from a Department standpoint, to place Mr. and Mrs. MacDougall at that, or any other point, where there are facilities for a married missionary teacher whose wife is prepared to do field matron duties.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMr. Ferrier  \nInspector of Indian Schools  \nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been informed by His Grace, Archbishop Matheson, that the Department wishes him to transfer me to another school, as I do not possess the confidence of the band here. Respectfully ask if an investigation could be held on my behalf by you as Inspector.\n\nI have been here since the school was opened in Jan. 1916 and have always tried to do my best.\n\nThere is one member of this band who claims they were promised a boarding school, and as it was not given, he will not send his children, and is the means of keeping many away as well, and is continually making stuff here amongst those who do support the school.\n\nI have had a hard time here, but shall be very sorry if the Department wishes me to leave. I am a married man with three children. I have incurred expenses in fencing here to keep two cows and a horse, and stables.\n\nMarch 30th, 1922.\nI trust sir you will take my case up with Mr. Scott and the Department, on my behalf, and do see if something cannot be done, so that I shall not have to leave here. I have more friends than those who sometimes only are against me, and my work. The state of the Country at present as regards work, would make it very hard for me to get into another post the same as this is.\n\nAwaiting sir, your kind reply,\n\nSam. Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. Tyson\n(teacher)\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nMr. Ogletree, your agent at Portage la Prairie, writes strongly opposing the removal of Mr. Hyson from the Improved School at Fairford, and Mr. Hyson himself complains that he is being unfairly treated, and deprecates any action looking towards his removal. I have told him that the church authorities have made no move against him, but that the Indians have petitioned for his removal. Matters have become so complicated that, under all the circumstances, I think that it would be well to have Mr. Ferrier hold an investigation and report on the matter before steps are taken to remove Mr. Hyson.\n\nWhen I visited Fairford last year, the Indians waited upon me, and urged that a change be made and afterwards, as you know, they communicated with the Department on the subject, with the result that I was asked by you to look out another place for Mr. Hyson.\n\nShould Mr. Ferrier be coming West to hold an investigation, I should be grateful if he could call to see me about this school, and also about others. With kindest regards.\n\n(Sgd.) S.P., Rupert's Land\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, April 5, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 30th ultimo, requesting that the Department give serious consideration before asking for your transfer to another school.\n\nAs you are aware, the Indian band, or a portion of it, has taken a dislike to you and your activities. The result is that the attendance at the school is not what it might be and the Indians are dissatisfied. For your information, I wish to state that the Department has turned down petitions from the Indians, dating November 1921, April, August and September 1921. You understand, I am sure, that whereas these petitions have been ignored, the Department must not shut its eyes to the fact that it is an unsatisfactory situation.\n\nI intimated to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land that, in the interest of our work, it might be advisable to have you transferred to some other cause. Allow me to quote from my letter:\n\n\"When a teacher does not possess the confidence of the band with which he is working, his efficiency is unavoidably impaired. I am convinced that Mr. Hyson is admirably suited for our work and that it is in the interests of yourself and this Department to have him engaged as teacher for one of our day schools. I am also sure, however, that he should be on the Fairford reserve no longer than can be helped.\"\n\nI might also quote from my letter to Mr. Agent Ogletree, in reply to his protest concerning your transfer:\n\n\"I beg to state that the Department is aware that the discontent on the part of the Indian band is caused by no inefficiency on the part of the teacher. However, if Mr. Hyson does not possess the confidence of the band with which he is working, his efforts are, unavoidably, more or less abortive.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 5, 1922.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to refer to that portion of your letter of the 29th ultimo, referring to the situation at Fairford, Man. I have noted that Mr. Agent Ogletree, of Portage la Prairie, and Mr. Hyson himself have strongly protested concerning the transfer of the present teacher. I am now of the opinion that this matter should be held in abeyance until I have had an opportunity to visit you in Winnipeg this summer. My present plans are to be in Winnipeg on the 9th of June, and perhaps we can make arrangements to have Mr. Ogletree come up and we will discuss the Fairford situation in detail.\n\nFor your information, I am enclosing a copy of a letter to Mr. Hyson.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Mr. Scott will explain the reasons why I have made this request. As to a possible successor to Mr. Hyson, should he be relieved, I gathered from the Indians when they waited upon me last Summer, that they intended to ask that Mr. Conlin should have charge of the School along with his Missionary duties. I told them at the time that I doubted whether he could accomplish the two, and that the probability would be that they would be sending in complaints of his neglect of pastoral visitation, etc., but I could easily see that they had made up their minds for the arrangement that I refer to. There are other vacancies among our Indian Schools and I shall be grateful to you if you will kindly ask Mr. McDougal to write to me and send me his testimonials. He might make a very useful man for one of our Indian Missions even, if there were not a place found for him at Fairford.\n\nI sent a night letter this evening to Mr. Scott asking for the approval of the Department for the appointment of Mr. Joseph Everett to the Jackhead School. Archdeacon Thomas has just returned from a visit to the place when the Indians urged an early appointment and asked for Mr. Everett. I am willing to have him sent out there even though he may not be able to do the work of the Church fully, as I understand that he does not belong to our Church but is a Methodist. I dare say that he is known to the Department as he has had charge of Schools under the Methodist Church, and I am told he is most anxious to take this position.\n\nI received your letter in regard to the School at Scantebeg and I am to take up the matter with the General Missionary where I am. In some extraordinary way the letter has got mislaid and I shall be grateful if you will kindly send me a copy of it.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRussell T.

Hyson be accepted, to take effect on the 31st of August.\n\nThat, in his place, Miss Olive Thomas and Miss Catherine McCabe be appointed Teachers of this school, the former to commence her duties on September the 1st, and the latter on October the 1st.\n\n(b) OAK RIVER INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nInasmuch as Wilfred Westgate terminates his summer engagement on the 31st of August, we recommend that Mr A. Hyson be appointed Teacher of this school from September the 1st. We think it necessary to suggest that his appointment be for a period of one year, and that any extension shall entirely depend on his success in the work.\n\nWe are willing to offer the use of a large room in the Mission House for school purposes, and in lieu of rent suggest that the sum of $75 be paid to Mr Hyson to assist in meeting the expenses of heating for the year.\n\n(c) LITTLE SASKATCHEWAN DAY SCHOOL (SANDY BAY)\n\nWe recommend that Mr John E. Favelle be transferred from the Day school at Lake St Martin and be placed in charge of the Little Saskatchewan Day School, such appoint-\nment to be for one full year, and any extension to depend on the results obtained. The transfer to take effect on October the 1st.\n\nThis school will remain closed during the month of September.\n\n(d) LAKE ST MARTIN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nWe are seeking a good and efficient man for this school and hope to be able to nominate very shortly.\n\nI should consider it a favour if you would let me know the salary to be paid in each of the above cases.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nArchdeacon.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nOn August 5th, in company with Archdeacon Thomas, of Winnipeg, our Mr. Agent Ogletree of Portage la Prairie, Man., visited the Fairford Indian Day School. My findings are on this file in the form of communications.\n\nIt will be necessary to employ Alex. Letander as Janitor, upon recommendation from agent. Mr. Ogletree promised to go up with the new teachers and assist them in establishing themselves.\n\nR.F.\nThere is an improved day school on the reserve, which was built in 1916. At the time of my visit it was closed for the summer holidays, and I was, therefore, unable to examine the children. I, however, had an interview with Mr. Hyson, the teacher, who informed me that the attendance had been very irregular, especially during the winter months due to the fact that the children have from 7 to 8 miles to travel to attend school, as nearly all the Indians live near the Fairford River, and on that portion of the Reserve towards Lake St. Martin.\nOttawa, Sept. 11, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 30th ultimo, referring to the arrangements for the coming academic year at the Fairford, Oak River, Little Saskatchewan and Lake St. Martin Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the resignation of Mr. A. Nyson of the Fairford Indian Day School is accepted as from the 31st ultimo, and the appointment of Miss Olive Thomas and Miss Catherine McCabe as Teachers, to commence duties on September first and October first, respectively, is approved. Mr. Agent Ogletree, of Portage la Prairie, and Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, have been informed that Miss Olive Thomas, as Senior Teacher, will receive $900 and Miss McCabe, as Junior Teacher, $700.- both salaries to be supplemented by any bonus provided by law. It is understood that these teachers will undertake the dispensing of drugs and relief, and will visit the sick.\n\nYour recommendation concerning the Oak River, Little Saskatchewan and Lake St. Martin Indian Day Schools will receive attention in separate communications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Thomas,\n901 Somerset Block,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that Mrs. Chas. Mear, No. 98, Fairford Band, has made application to have her children attend the Fairford Indian Day School.\n\nI might say that this woman does not live on the Reserve, she is married to a half-breed, and there is no local school within 6 miles.\n\nI would recommend that these children be allowed to attend the Fairford School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, September 27, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the application of Mrs. Chas. Mear, No. 98, Fairford Band, for permission to allow her children to attend the Fairford Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no objection to the children of this woman attending this school, provided there is accommodation for them. The mother should, however, see that they attend regularly or the privilege granted may be withdrawn. You will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of August 14th, last, with reference to the appointments of Miss Olive Thomas and Miss Catherine McCabe as teachers of the Fairfield Indian Day School.\n\nIn a letter received from Ven. Archdeacon Thomas he states that Miss Thomas reached Fairfield in September but that Miss McCabe did not begin duties until October 1st. In paying salary to this school for the September quarter, the Department, through oversight, issued a cheque for $35.00 in favour of Miss McCabe and this cheque was sent October 11th, addressed to the teacher at Fairfield.\n\nKindly inform the Department if Miss McCabe began duties October 1st. If so, she may cash the cheque already sent her and this amount will be deducted from her December quarter salary.\n\nIf it should happen that Miss McCabe does not assume duties at this school, you should endeavour to get in touch with her and have the cheque already sent her returned to the Department.\n\nIf Miss McCabe is teaching at Fairfield, both she and Miss Thomas should sign the future returns. Salary will only be paid to the teacher or teachers whose names are on the returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.

While we are anxious to do everything possible to make this school a success, yet we do not desire to create a precedent, and, unless a very satisfactory reason is advanced, we are not prepared to accede to the chief's request. We are aware that a number of the children have a considerable distance to go in returning to their homes, but, as teams are provided, this should overcome any difficulty that would be experienced if they had to walk. On very cold or stormy days, the teachers could use their discretion and dismiss school before the regular hour\u2014first, however, arranging with the drivers to be on hand in time.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a further report from you as to the need of a change in the Department's regulations in regard to the Fairford school by granting permission to dismiss classes before the regular hour for closing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lucas, R.N.,\nTravelling Nurse.\n\nComment by Mr. Graham:\n\nI do not know how these cases can be treated as local doctors do not appear to be able to deal with them, and to send the children to a hospital in a city or town for treatment would involve considerable expense.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nCommissioner.\nOttawa. June 16, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nTravelling Nurse Lucas, in a report on her visit to the Fairfield Indian Day School, states that the children are dirty and covered with head and body vermin, also that they seem to be undernourished and poorly cared for in their homes.\n\nIn this connection would it not be possible for the teacher to instruct the children in cleanliness of body and to some extent see that their instructions are carried out.\n\nThe travelling nurse further recommends that the use of bread instead of bannock be furnished the children at their mid-day meal. You should ascertain from the teacher whether it would not be possible for them to furnish the children with bread and also if they can obtain at a reasonable cost a quantity of vegetables from time to time.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the above matter after you have consulted the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sometimes vegetables are impossible to get. The majority of these parents keep their children clean. I went through every house on the Reserve last winter, and found them fairly clean, with few exceptions. I have had no complaints from the parents about these children being underfed; the parents are well satisfied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

The substitute engaged by her should be satisfactory to you. We will continue salary to Miss McCabe and she should arrange to pay the substitute engaged by her. I shall be pleased to be informed later of the name of the substitute engaged and also the month when Miss McCabe will take the leave granted.\n\nWe are unable to comply with Miss McCabe's request to make arrangements for a two-cent rate from Fairford and return to the port of sailing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFAIRFORD IMPROVED INDIAN DAY SCHOOL:\n\nThis school was built on the same standard as the school we have at Felly. It has the same living quarters and 1 classroom. A new school was built here last summer, so there are now 2 classrooms; previous to that, the dining room was used as a classroom. The\n\nThe senior room is taught by Miss Thomas and the junior room by Miss McCabe. There are 67 children on the register and on the day of my visit at the school there were 32 in the junior room and 25 in the senior room, a total of 57. The average attendance, I believe, was about 55.\n\nTwo vans are used in transporting the children to and from school, one from Lower Fairford and the other from Upper Fairford. These children are also supplied with a play outfit. An Indian who lives about two miles from the school acts as cook, looks after fires, etc., and a girl is employed in the kitchen to do the housework, look after meals, etc. This is generally an Indian girl.\n\nI spent half a day in the classrooms and I was favourably impressed with the work that is being done here. I consider that Miss Thomas and Miss McCabe are splendid teachers and they are certainly very much interested in their work. They keep the children clean and tidy and take an interest in their health just as much as they do in their woodwork. They have a pony at the school, that they drive around with, and in cases of sickness they always give all possible assistance. They have also done considerable work in advising the mothers about keeping their children clean, etc. These two ladies are now in their fourth year on the reserve.\n\nMiss Thomas asked me if there was any such thing as an increase in salary for teachers on an Indian Reserve, as she pointed out that they were still getting the same salary as they did when they started. Miss McCabe is getting $720.00 per year and Miss Thomas, $900.00. Out of this amount, some of them have to board themselves and the girl that is in the kitchen, Miss Thomas told me, stated that it was not just for the sake of getting more money but that even if they got a small increase in salary, she would feel that their work was satisfactory to the Department.\n\nOne thing I would recommend is that they be furnished with a little more furniture. These women are living an isolated life and I think we should make them as comfortable as possible. And when I see how well some of the boarding schools are furnished, I think the Department should supply them anew with the bare necessities\u2014as most of their furniture is broken or worn out or broken, etc. Should the Department have funds for this purpose, I can furnish a list of what is actually required. The school building as a whole is in good shape.\nThe Inspector comments favourably on the Improved Day School on the Fairford Reserve. The teachers, Miss Thomas and Miss McCabe, seem to be doing good work and they have a large attendance at the school. I would draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding an increase in salary for these teachers, and I am of the opinion that, if there is any way of granting the request, it should be done.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the poorly furnished condition of the living quarters at this school, I think, myself, that we should do something to make living conditions more comfortable for these women and for an outlay of about $200.00 we might be able to buy the necessary furniture. I do not know whether any rugs or linoleum are required or not; if so, they would be additional.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your No. 208-9 of the 23rd ultimo, commenting on Inspector Christianson's report of his inspection of the Fairfield Improved Indian Day School in which he recommends that an increase in salary be allowed the teachers and also that a further quantity of furniture be supplied for the use of the residence, I beg to say that, in view of the favourable report received regarding their work, the Department will approve of an increase of $5 per teaching month in the salary of each of these teachers from the 1st of April, next. At the present time, Miss Thomas is in receipt of $105 per teaching month and Miss McCabe $85 per teaching month. The above increases will provide for payment from the date mentioned of $110 per teaching month to Miss Thomas and $90 per teaching month to Miss McCabe. We are informing Mr. Agent Ogletree of this increase.\n\nThe Department is very pleased to learn of the excellent work that is being performed by these two teachers, the regular attendance of the Indian children and the interest both they and the teachers take in the work.\n\nRelative to the furniture for the teachers' residence, I beg to say that you will be advised regarding this matter in a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. W. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that, upon the recommendation of Mr. Inspector Christianson, who recently visited the Fairfield Improved Indian Day School, and also upon the recommendation of Mr. Commissioner Graham, the Department is approving of an increase of $5 per teaching month from the 1st of April, next, to Miss Thomas and Miss McCabe, the teachers. I shall be pleased if you will inform them accordingly.\n\nThe Department is very pleased to learn of the splendid work being performed by these two teachers, and also to learn of the regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nFAIRFORD DAY SCHOOL.\u2014This school is under the Church of England Mission and taught by Miss C.A. Thomas, Principal and Miss C.R. McCabe, assistant teacher; of these two ladies I cannot speak highly of them, they are both capable and effectual teachers and devoted to their work and understand the Indian character and do everything in their power for the welfare of their pupils and the Indians generally, the pupils in this school make splendid progress. There are 64 pupils on the Register with an average attendance of 56. These pupils are brought to and taken home from school by two Vans driven by two members of the Fairford Band, who pride themselves that they get the pupils to school on time and also see that they get to their homes as soon as possible after the school is dismissed. A New Class Room was added to this school last fall which was a much needed acquisition and of which the teachers and pupils are very proud of. I do not think there is any Rural Day Schools run with better and with more success in the Province than this school. Miss Favell, as Cook and Kitchen help and Alex Letendre as caretaker are both good conscientious workers and leave nothing to be desired for the comfort of the teachers and pupils. The teachers have a horse, buggy and cutter which is supplied by the Department and are thus able to make regular visits to the parents of their pupils, which makes a very friendly feeling with the Indians and their teachers. All the Indians on this Reserve without exception speak of the good work these two teachers are doing among them.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n18th March, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose my report of Educational work in the Portage la Prairie and Manitowah Agencies for the fiscal year ending 31st March 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nA few days ago I received a letter from Miss A.H. Thomas, teacher at the Fairford School, reporting that on account of an epidemic of measles on the reserve, which, however, was not of a severe form, the Doctor thought it wise to close the school, but that the Indian Agent had objected and insisted on its being re-opened.\n\nI telegraphed to Dr. Peake at Ashern, asking him if he had advised the closing of the school, and he replied in the affirmative. I immediately wired to Miss Thomas that the school might be closed temporarily on the Doctor's advice. These telegraphic exchanges were followed by a letter from Dr. Peake, stating that he had advised Miss Thomas to close the school and notified the Agent, Mr. A. Ogletree, who replied stating that the Department did not wish the school closed for measles and requested him to telephone Miss Thomas to re-open it.\n\nAs Dr. Peake advised the closing of the school I cannot understand Agent Ogletree's attitude in insisting that it should be re-opened, and supporting his decision on the ground that the Department did not wish the school closed because measles had developed. I think there must have been some misunderstanding and I should be glad to know if the Department issued any instructions to Mr. Ogletree which would have resulted in his running counter to the Doctor's recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Mr. Ogletree reported that Dr. Peake ordered the school closed for two weeks. He concluded as follows: \"The Manitoba School Authorities do not approve of schools being closed for measles. I have written Dr. Peake to have this school re-opened on Monday, 29th instant.\" (March).

We note that the teachers are employed in attending the sick and that you have made arrangements for assistance in nursing the children. It is hoped that it will be possible to have this school reopened at an early date and that no further cases will develop among the school children.\n\nYou should forward a voucher covering the amount due Mrs. R. Sanderson for her services for the period she was engaged in assisting the teachers in nursing the sick.\n\nThe teachers should state on their returns for the current quarter the dates between which the school was closed on account of sickness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This is one reason we solicit the department to grant us our request, and by doing so you will not only do us a great favor but also save us our hard earned necessaries.\n\nAlso, if the department would listen to our request it will materially help to clear up many misunderstanding between ourselves and the officials that look out for the welfare of our raising generations.\n\nThirdly; If we have a Residential School in our immediate vicinity there will be no room for the Indians to find any complaint.\nComplaint about what expenses we as a whole have to make whenever we wish to see our children. Also, the money that we have to pay for our children's return from the distant schools would be used towards their maintenance when they are at home. It would give us no room to make any complaints, and it would also make us a happy community.\n\nChief Com. Woodhouse\nCommittee H. Litanley\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Alex Clark\nCommittee John P.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF G. W. BARTLETT,\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS, ERIKSDALE, Man.,\ndated January 24, 1927.\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that all the schools have made good progress during the year. Fairford operating under most favorable conditions still holds the lead, but it is being overtaken by Lake St. Martin School, though Mr. Garwood works alone there with scanty equipment, unfavorable environment and a heavy ungraded school. All are doing well, however. Mr. Wheeldon, of Little Saskatchewan, has done much more efficient work this year and the school shows substantial progress.\nFAIRFORD IMPROVED DAY SCHOOL.\n\nWe have two classrooms at this school, the Senior room being taught by Miss Thomas and the Junior room by Miss McCabe. There are 65 children on the register and I think the average attendance, when you take everything into consideration, is very good. Two vans are used to convey the children to and from school, one for Upper Fairford and the other for Lower Fairford. The classroom work at this school is exceptionally good as both teachers are well qualified. The teachers also do a lot of work on the reserve in the way of visiting and attending to sick, etc., and a great improvement has been noticed in the children that are attending school; they are keeping themselves clean and tidy. I think Misses Thomas and McCabe are doing...\nare doing splendid work on the reserve and I am glad to know that the Indians appreciate what they are doing.\n\nTheir Christmas concert had been delayed on account of one of the teachers being sick and it was held the day after I arrived there. I think everybody was impressed with the splendid concert that was put on by the children. There was a huge Christmas tree and the Indians had donated about $116.00 towards buying presents for the children. The teachers also spent some of their own money in furnishing presents, as well as a number of the parents bringing individual presents for the children, therefore the tree was well loaded. The large school-room was packed to the doors, not only with Indians but with a lot of white people who live adjacent to the reserve. The concert was splendid and the children took their parts exceptionally well. In an address given by me between numbers, I took the opportunity of telling them how the Indians on the reserves in other parts of the three provinces were now making their living from farming and stock raising. I had many enquiries from Indians afterwards regarding conditions on other reserves.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the person who takes Miss Thomas' place proves suitable and consents to go on, my idea would be to procure someone to join her in September next. Kindly let me know what the salaries will be and greatly oblige me. As soon as I can light upon a suitable person to take Miss Thomas' place I will communicate further with you.

For the 10 teaching months, $1,000 and $650, respectively, will be allowed for a fully qualified teacher and for an assistant who will be competent to take over Miss McCabe's duties.

As I understand it, Miss Owen is taking Miss Thomas' post. Miss Thomas was the senior teacher and was in receipt of a larger salary than Miss McCabe.

With the two farms combined the school ought to fare well.\n\nI am making enquiries for a successor for her at Peguis. Miss McGee has written to me suggesting that Miss Marion L. McKenzie, who has been employed in some capacity at the Improved School, might take the position of junior teacher under Miss Fairservice. She describes her as most competent and claims that her knowledge of nursing would be most helpful. The difficulty, of course, is about her standing. Apparently the girl has only Grade IX, so on account of illness she fell down in her Grade I examination, but her marks in Grade IX are quite high and include the subjects of Latin and French. She has also a most satisfactory recommendation from the hospital where she spent a period of training for nursing. I enclose a letter of hers, which indicates that she writes very correctly.\n\nIf you can do anything towards accepting her as a teacher, I shall be greatly pleased as she is a very worthy and efficient girl and connected with a very fine family.

(RG 10, Volume '6232, file 510-1, part 1)\nJuly 20th, 1928\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 18th. Evidently Miss Feirservice has taken offence and sent the telegram without waiting for any further word from me. What happened was this.\n\nInspector Christienson called on me some weeks ago on his return from Fairford and informed me that he had almost persuaded Miss McCabe to remain on at the Improved School at Fairford as senior teacher. He seemed most anxious that she should be retained on account of the excellent service which she has given for several years past. I told him that I had entirely failed to induce her to change her mind and withdrew her resignation, though I had written several letters to her. I then explained that on my nomination Miss Feirservice had been appointed senior teacher by your Department and that I could not take the responsibility of making any change or even of writing to the Department on the subject. He undertook to write himself and let me know the result. \"Leave the matter to me\" was his reply and there has been ample time for him to communicate with the Department, since he stated that he would write that very night from the hotel. My hope was that I would hear from him before Miss Feirservice called after the vacation, which I expected her to do in about two weeks. When she called the other day I told her what had happened and she was visibly annoyed. I have not seen or heard anything of Miss McCabe since my interview with Mr. Christienson, nor do I know whether she has consented to remain and, if so, whether she would wish to be senior teacher or go on as junior. I told Mr. Christienson that it was important that I should be told soon the result of his correspondence, for until I knew I could not proceed with enquiries about teachers to fill the\nJuly 20th, 1928.\n\nI may add that I have had an application for the position in the North Peguis School and I am only waiting to know what certificate the applicant holds before writing to you. She is very strongly recommended by Mrs. Morris, the wife of the Missionary at Peguis.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA. F.

I enclose the reply from Mrs. Miller. The time is so short before the School should open that I would advise that the Department allow Miss Clare to go temporarily, as it will be most difficult to procure any teacher who will consent to go out that distance for such a short period.

The Agent states that he does not think it necessary to engage a substitute teacher as a large number of the Indians of the Fairford Reserve are away threshing and will only be returning to the reserve by the time Miss Skaftefeld is well enough to resume her duties. In view of the Agent's report, it is thought that it will not be necessary to employ Miss Clare as substitute teacher.

Canon Calvert, B.A., and Miss E. Bartlett, the Headmistress of Rupert's Land Girls' School, to proceed to Fairford immediately and perform the duties required by the Department of Indian Affairs.

Considerable pains have been taken to select the best of teachers for this School and I trust the appointments will meet with the hearty approval of the Department.\n\nI have just visited Fairford and Lake St. Martin and find things progressing satisfactorily with the Clinic in residence. However the school at Lake St. Martin sadly needs to be made air-tight and water-tight for the winter, with some minor repairs.

A number of the Indians of the Lake Reserves fish at the Hatchery (Little Saskatchewan Reserve No. 48A) during the winter months and in many cases their families accompany them. This year the school van was discontinued and the children from across the Fairford River have three miles to walk. I would suggest that if the van is to be discontinued indefinitely, that the senior school be moved to the bank of the river. This would take care of all the children at Lower Fairford and would be a separate day school. The teacher would have a walk of approximately one and a half miles to the improved day school where she would board.\n\nI intend to visit the Lake Reserves immediately after the New Year and a further report will be forwarded when I return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nJanuary 27, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-5-1\n\nWith reference to Department letter dated December 9, and further to my report of the 21st idem., I wish to advise that I visited the Fairford Day School on the 7th. of the month and found the school had opened that morning after the Christmas vacation. Five children were present in the junior room and one girl in the senior room. I held a meeting with the Fairford Indians that night and discussed the school situation with them. They claimed that the small number of children present that morning was due to the parents not knowing when the school would open, and that most of the children were on hand on the 6th. and had to return home. Few Indians were present at the meeting and a further meeting was held at the Little Saskatchewan Reserve No. 48A on the 10th. of the month.\n\nAt least 60% of the Indians and their families are fishing on Lake Winnipeg. The season on this lake opens January 1st and continues until March 11th. The general opinion is that if the Indians lived on their reserve and sent their children to school they would have to be furnished with relief. This also applies to the Indians of the Little Saskatchewan Reserve. The fishing on Lake Winnipeg has been especially good and the Indians are making a very good living. Lake St. Martin is now so low that fishing is only possible at the outlet of the Fairford River and the upper mouth of the Dauphin River. These two places are fished from November 11th., the opening date for commercial fishing on this lake, until practically all the fish are caught. Then there is general movement to Lake Winnipeg.\n\nThere are a number of children on the extreme south end of the reserve and a number across the Fairford River. The children from the south would have a walk of close to four miles and the children across the river about three miles. Previous to this year a van service was operated for these children.\nThere are 23 children on the register in the junior room, and I have no doubt that in the neighbourhood of 15 will now attend fairly regularly. There are 8 on the register in the senior room and the attendance should now average 4. One teacher is all that is necessary. Miss Brock, the matron, has her M.A. degree, Miss Simpson is teaching on permit.\n\nThe solution of the school question on this reserve is to move the senior school to a place near the river. This would take care of the children on the south end of the reserve and those across the Fairford River. The cost of moving would not be expensive as the work could be done by Indians. There would be no extra cost in the upkeep.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the Fairford Indian Day School. I am surprised to learn that this school did not re-open until January 7 as teachers of all Indian day schools were notified months ago that the re-opening date after the Christmas holidays would be January 6, 1941. The teachers should be informed that they are expected to carry out the instructions issued by the Department in regard to the opening and closing dates of the schools.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of your letter please let me know the approximate cost of moving the present school to a place near the river. You should also state at what period of the year this could be done.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter it appears that only one teacher will be required for the academic year 1941-42 and arrangements will be made to that effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa,\nMarch 21, 1941.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nAs you are aware two teachers have been employed at the Fairford Indian Day School. At the present time Miss L. Brock and Miss Ada Simpson are teaching at this school.\n\nFrom information recently received it is found that the total enrolment at the Fairford School is 22 and the average attendance is 15. The Indian Agent reports that it is unlikely that the number of children attending this school during the academic year 1941-42 will be any larger. Under these circumstances the services of two teachers are not required. Consequently only one teacher will be necessary commencing with the new academic year on October 1, 1941.\n\nI should appreciate your advising whether you prefer Miss Brock or Miss Simpson to remain at Fairford during the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMost Rev.

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA - ONT.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOur Indian affairs must be giving you considerable concern during the present emergency but I hope nothing but that which is absolutely necessary will be curtailed on our Fairford Reserve. The conditions that surround the Indians and their children on this Reserve are thanks to the attention your Department has given to our appeals improving but it will certainly be disappointing in the extreme if a reduction in the number of teachers takes place in October next. In February the daily average attendance in the Junior Class room at Fairford was 16 and 6 in the Senior Class room, while the attendance will undoubtedly increase with the advent of warm weather and the improvement of the trails. With the removal of the small school to the proposed new site two teachers will be absolutely necessary, one at the lower and one at the upper school. Therefore I am at present not informing the teachers at Fairford of any possible change. I understand that they are very efficient and happy in their work, therefore unsettlement at this time would not advantageously affect the school or their labours.\n\nAssuring you of our earnest desire to co-operate with the Department in the amelioration of the Indians and the education of their children, I am, dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nApril 2, 1941.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the Fairford Indian Day School.\n\nI have carefully noted the contents of your letter and I am communicating with the Indian Agent. On receipt of his reply I will write to you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Rev. M.M. Harding, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa,\nApril 2, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of January 27 and my reply of February 5 in connection with the attendance at the Fairford Indian Day School. In view of the contents of your letter I recently wrote to Most Reverend M.M. Harding, D.D., Archbishop of Rupert's Land, advising him that because of the very small attendance it was felt that the Department would not be justified in employing two teachers during the academic year 1941-42. He has replied, in part, as follows:\n\n\"In February the daily average attendance in the junior class room at Fairford was 16 and 6 in the senior class room and the attendance will undoubtedly increase with the advent of warm weather and the improvement of the trails. With the removal of the small school to the proposed new site two teachers will be absolutely necessary, one at the lower end one at the upper school.\"\n\nPlease let me know immediately what the Archbishop means by two schools. In recently authorizing the moving of the Fairford School to a new site by the river the Department was under the impression that you were moving the two-roomed school. In this connection I would refer you to the last paragraph of your letter of January 27.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nApril 7, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-5-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of the 2nd instant received this morning. In reply I wish to say that there is evidently a misunderstanding in the school situation at Fairford. The main school is an Improved Day School housing the junior class room and the living quarters of the staff. The senior class room is a small school apart from the Improved Day School. The work of moving the large school could not be done by Indians, and the cost would be tremendous, as a complete new basement would have to be built. The moving of this school was not suggested as it is necessary to take care of the children from the west end of the reserve. In this connection I would refer to my report of December 21st. This report was again referred to in my further report of January 27th, and in my letter of March 19th, the moving of the small school was again stated.\n\nThe moving of the small school will not dispense with the services of one teacher. It will dispense with the van service and draw the children from the south end of the reserve and across the river. The Improved Day School would take care of the children from the large settlement near the village of Fairford. This is set out in my letter of December 21st.\n\nHis Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land wrote to me on the 25th of March, and enclose, herewith, a copy of his letter and a copy of my reply.\n\nI also wish to advise that the small school has been moved to the new site and the cement has been shipped. The work will be completed as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I presume that the teachers at present at the school intend to continue for the academic year 1941-42.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Rev. M.M.

It is proposed that Mrs. McKenzie take charge of the School at Fairford and Miss Ada Simpson the Lower Fairford School. The appointment of Mrs. McKenzie is made necessary by the resignation of Miss Brock.

I am informed that every heavy rain turns the road a mass of mud and water. It is quite evident and believable. The appointment is not suitable for a woman. I doubt if a man would care for it.\n\nI went to considerable expense preparing for the work and would be very glad if the amount of my fare could at least be refunded as well as whatever remuneration the Department deems suitable and right.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Mildred M.

I was appointed teacher of the Lower Fairford School and opened school Oct. 1st, but a sudden attack of stomach trouble, nervous upset and the long rough walk from the Upper School and residence combined has weakened me so that I dare not risk attempting it any longer.\n\nThere is no residence at the Lower School nor shelter for a horse. Several of the most intelligent Indians, also the missionary say they know it is too hard for a woman and it is doubtful if even a man would remain unless there were a place to stay.\n\nThe reserve is in two quite detached little settlements and part of the way to the lower one leads through boggy land that means knee-deep wading after heavy rains. All the road is rough and poor.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Upper School has large bedrooms, living-room, kitchen, pantry and furniture beside the large classroom with stacks of equipment, basement dining-room for the children and a good inside well with pump.\n\nThe Lower School is a one-roomed structure, moved from beside the residence a year or more ago. The moving cracked it somewhat but is to be repaired shortly. One end is partitioned off and divided into a small cloakroom and room for the jacketed heater. Circulation of heat is aided by overhead piping which circles nearly half the room. There is a teacher's desk and chair, a small kitchen table and a cardboard box of texts and exercise books. Mrs. McVigue of the upper school lent me some pencils and a blackboard eraser and chalk. There are desks enough at present but a cupboard or shelves would be a great convenience. There are four fine large windows in the south but very rickety and they have no blinds.\n\nI went to considerable expense preparing for the post and am disappointed that it is beyond my strength and I hope no one else will suffer.\nI am notifying the Synod Office (Anglican Church) Winnipeg, also the Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie of my decision to leave at once rather than struggle on indefinitely.\n\nWhatever remuneration the Department considers suitable and right will be acceptable to me. I would be very glad if my fare could be refunded.\n\nYours very truly,\n(Mrs) Mildred M. Smith.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nOctober 14, 1942.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-5-1\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mrs Mildred N.

Hoey,\nDept' of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs' Branch,\nOTTAWA - ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMrs. Smith, the lately appointed teacher at Lower Fairford School finds the walk to and from the School too exacting and has resigned as teacher. We find it extremely difficult if not impossible to obtain the services of a well qualified teacher who can give himself entirely to the work but I have called into Winnipeg today and have seen the Rev. A. E. Thain, a graduate of The Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, B.C., and the incumbent of Fairford, who came to Manitoba last Spring from Alert Bay, British Columbia, having had some experience with the Indians and also in teaching their children at our School there. I find he can and will gladly give Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of each week to teaching in Fairford School, if this agreement is in accord with the Department's decision. He is an excellent teacher, liked by the Indians and well able to teach the children committed to his care. If the Department will consent during the present emergency to Mr. Thain being appointed teacher under these conditions and until we find a full time competent teacher available for the Monday also I shall feel much happier in knowing our Indian children are well provided for.\n\nIn this case it will be necessary to provide Mr. Thain with a horse and cutter and also to erect a stable for the horse on the school property. Under these conditions I desire to know the financial arrangements the Department can and will make and also whether or no any provision can be made for the furnishing of horse and cutter and stable. In any event it will, I think, be necessary during the winter months to provide a stable for the teacher's horse.\nAt present I cannot see how any more satisfactory arrangements can be made than those I have suggested and I shall be glad if the Department can agree to the same. It is with regret I give the Department further trouble.\n\nI am, my dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nOctober 27, 1942.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nPrevious to his departure on official business, Mr. Hoey discussed with me your letter of the 21st instant. It is regretted that it is not possible for us to consider supplying a horse and cutter, but we are writing to the Indian Agent with a view to ascertaining if a stable could be provided. The offer of Rev. Mr. Thain is appreciated and as soon as we hear from the Indian Agent you will be written again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Reverend M.M.

Harding, D.D., suggesting that, in view of the difficulty of obtaining qualified teachers, we accept the offer of Rev. A.E. Thain, who is the Anglican Incumbent at Fairford, Man. He is prepared to teach the school on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of each week. It is understood, of course, that this would only be a temporary arrangement pending the procuring of a qualified teacher. I would appreciate your advising if you consider this arrangement will be reasonably satisfactory for the present. In the event of our accepting the offer of Mr. Thain, it will be necessary to provide some accommodation for the horse which he apparently intends to use to drive to and from the school. Could this be arranged without incurring heavy expenditure?\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

Mrs. Branson does not hold a Teacher's Certificate but obtained Grade XI Standing in Manitoba, and we feel that she is competent to teach in the South Fairford School. Moreover she will be residing with Miss M. E.

We much regret this but find it necessary to point out that we have had difficulty with this school since it was moved a few years ago, necessitating a walk of at least two miles in all weathers. For the past two years we were singularly fortunate in having a Clergyman at Fairford who undertook the teaching duties, although he found it extremely difficult at times.

We understand that there are about 45 children in the vicinity who could and should be attending school and we feel that the only remedy to the situation would be the erection of a residence close to the school building, or provision for suitable transportation at all times.\n\nWill you therefore kindly give the matter some consideration as we are most anxious that the children receive the education to which they are entitled.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-1, part 2)\nOttawa, 30th October, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have just received the following letter from the Most Reverend L.R. Sherman, Archbishop of Rupert's Land:\n\n\"It is necessary for me to draw to your attention a difficult situation existing in connection with the Indian Day Schools on the Fairford Reserve.\n\nA few years ago the Indian Department considered it advisable to erect a School about two miles south of the Teachers' residence and owing to the distance and with no provision for transportation it has been impossible for us to persuade a teacher to take charge of the school.

However, I suppose that travel in that part of the country may not be very easy. It is not possible to consider the erection of another teacher's residence at the present time but I thought I would communicate with you in order to ascertain if there is any possibility of providing living quarters for a teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Miss McCabe, Teacher at the Fairford School - Portage la Prairie Agency.\n\nIn a letter from Mr. Waite, the Agent, he writes as follows:\n\n\"I feel that the matter of Miss McCabe should be taken up with the Department. This woman is around 60 odd years of age, is a cripple and only able to take care of herself. There is no doubt that she is an experienced teacher and during the war years when teachers were not available, has filled a gap. The condition of the war years in regard to the obtaining of teachers is changing and I feel that a younger teacher should now be engaged for the Fairford School. If a nurse is to be kept comfortable at the school, the services of a house-keeper should also be obtained. The house is large, requires a lot of upkeep that a teacher after teaching all day cannot give. The ideal setup for this school would be a married couple. This would eliminate the services of a caretaker.\"\n\nIf possible, I think a younger teacher should be obtained for the opening of school in January, 1946. I agree with Mr. Waite that the ideal setup would be a married couple; but if such cannot be obtained then the Department should allow a house-keeper. This is a large building and there is altogether too much work for a teacher. She cannot teach all day - keep the residence clean and tidy - cook and issue drugs. The housekeeper could issue drugs and cook also for the nurse when on the reserve. The salary might be charged against both the schools and medical service.\n\nA real effort should be made to provide a first class teacher.\n\nA.G.

Both Mr. Waite and yourself are probably correct in stating that a younger teacher would be preferable for the Fairford School. However, all the information we have is to the effect that teachers, especially in Manitoba, are just as difficult to obtain as they have been during the past few months.

The only possible solution is the erection of an annex to the building to provide living quarters for the teacher but it is not possible to consider this solution at the present time owing to lack of funds.\n\nIf by chance you hear of a qualified teacher who would be willing to accept the position we would be glad to hear from you and arrange for her immediate appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Reverend L.R.

Baron is the teacher in charge. She is a qualified teacher and is doing excellent work.\n\nThe register shows 22 pupils and the grades are as follows:\n\n- Grade 1 - 14\n- Grade 2 - 5\n- Grade 3 - 2\n- Grade 5 - 1\n\nThe pupils were well dressed and clean in appearance.\n\nThe class-room is large, well-lighted and tidy.\n\nThe outhouses are in good condition.\n\nSome pupils have had impetigo and so could not attend. A few have been absent with severe colds.\n\nIt was much impressed with the work being done by Miss Baron. She is greatly interested and the children are making good progress.\n\nThis school is a large building and considerable time is required to keep it clean. This work along with the preparation of meals, teaching, and preparing class-room work is altogether too much for one person. She also issues drugs when the Nurse, Mrs. Raynor is working on the other reserves. I recommend that authority be granted Mr. Waite, the Agent, to engage a maid so that Miss Baron may devote all her time to teaching. As pointed out above Miss Baron is a qualified teacher and is doing excellent work but unless she can be given help I doubt if she will remain for long.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, February 27th, 1947.\n\nDear Archbishop Sherman:\n\nAs you are aware, Miss Phyllis Baron is teaching at the Fairford Indian Day School.\n\nFor the last two years we have not had a teacher at the Lower Fairford School. A review of our files indicates that a possible reason for this is that you were not able to secure a teacher owing to the fact that she had to walk to the residence at the Fairford School. In this connection may I draw your attention to my letter of August 17th, 1946.\n\nThis Branch has recently been criticized for not having a teacher at the Lower Fairford School as we are informed approximately thirty children are not receiving any education.\n\nIs it possible for you to nominate a teacher for this school to begin duties immediately. If you cannot nominate a teacher we feel that it will be necessary for us to make an endeavour to do so as we want this school reopened if it is humanly possible to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard P.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWe have been in communication with Archbishop Sherman regarding a teacher for the Lower Fairford school.\n\nRecently we have been in touch with universities throughout Canada and are receiving applications from a number of undergraduates who would be prepared to teach school from April 12th to about the middle of September.\n\nIf we can secure one of the applicants for the Lower Fairford School do you think that there would be a reasonable attendance during the summer months? We are following similar procedure in other localities where we have been unable to secure a teacher but the Indians have expressed their willingness to send their children to school during July and August in order to make up some of the time that has been lost.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 13th, 1947.\n\nDear Archbishop Sherman:\n\nAs we have not received a reply to our letter of February 27th regarding a teacher for the Lower Fairford School, it is presumed that you are having difficulty in finding a teacher.\n\nRecently we have been in touch with different universities throughout Canada and we have the names of a number of undergraduates who would be prepared to teach school from April 12th to September 20th. If you so desire we can forward you the applications of any of them who are members of the Church of England.\n\nAt some localities we have had the same difficulty as at Lower Fairford, namely, inability to secure a teacher and we are making arrangements to conduct these schools throughout the summer holidays.\n\nWe are writing to Indian Agent Waite with a view to ascertaining if he considers we can operate the Lower Fairford School throughout the summer holidays and thus give an opportunity for some training to those who have been without a school for some time past.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would let me have an immediate answer to this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Lauchlan\nActing Chief Treasury Officer.\nDear Mr. Henry:\n\nThere were no children in attendance at the Lower Fairford School today. Perhaps this was due in part to the continued Treaty Day celebrations, but I fear that it is mainly because the Indians are opposed to having the school open during July and August.\n\nDuring the morning session I was surprised by a visit from Chief Woodhouse and the three councillors. The chief approached belligerently with the words: \"Why are you staying here? I am the boss on the Reserve, and we don't want the school open during July and August.\" Though taken aback by his abruptness, I informed him that I was hired for those\nmonths and that I was simply carrying out instructions when I opened the school.\n\nApparently they didn't have the courage to approach Mr. Waite with their opposition when he visited at treaty time. Would you kindly cooperate by writing to inform the Chief that I am only doing my duty? Though I explained this to him, a letter from head office would perhaps be more satisfactory to him.\n\nI also said that I planned to carry on in spite of opposition, unless I received different instructions from you. They seem to fear that the school will be open for the summer only and closed again in September. I assured them that you would endeavor to secure a teacher for the whole year.\n\nThanks for your cooperation in this matter! Kindly reply immediately. In the meantime I will keep the school open.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Miss) V. M. Graham.\nOttawa, July 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter just received from Miss V.M. Graham, teacher of the Fairford School.\n\nAs you are aware, our only purpose in securing a teacher for the summer months was to provide educational facilities for those children who were unable to attend school during the past few months in view of the impossibility of securing a teacher.\n\nThere was never any intention on our part to only operate the school for the summer months. We are placing advertisements in the Winnipeg papers for teachers and we are making enquiries along other lines and we are hopeful that we will be able to secure teachers for the academic year 1947-48.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the attitude apparently adopted by Chief Woodhouse and his councillors. If the Indians are not sufficiently interested in the education of their children to send them to school when facilities are available, we are quite prepared to withdraw Miss Graham and place her in another school.\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention and let me have a report as soon as possible regarding what action you consider should be taken.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\ne/e to Inspector Hamilton.\n\nTP/MGD\n\nIndian Affairs.

We immediately sent a copy of it by air mail to Indian Agent Waite in Portage la Prairie and Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg.\n\nWe requested the Indian Agent to immediately review the action taken by the Chief and Councillors.\n\nWe appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The Chief was elected to this position in January last and it is my opinion that he merely wished to show a little authority.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 13th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Peck:\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a letter forwarded to Most Reverend L.R. Sherman, D.D., on May 20th to which we have received no reply.\n\nAlthough you may be aware of conditions at the Fairford School, I may say that there is one building with teacher's living quarters attached. There is a second classroom approximately two miles away. At the latter point we are erecting a pre-fabricated residence for the teacher.\n\nMiss Phyllis Baron taught at the main school until May last when she had to give up duties owing to illness. We did not have a teacher at the other school last year owing to lack of living quarters for the teacher.\n\nWe are extremely anxious to have two teachers for this school for the coming year and as you will note from the above, there will be living accommodation for both of them.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could nominate two qualified teachers for this school.

So thanks.\n\nI would like to see you coming back to teach, for my son learns very fast.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nCouncillor Charles Anderson\nBF NEARY\nIndian Affairs Branch Ottawa\n\nYour telegram of the ninth just received on return from Saskatoon regret to say we do not consider Miss Kastner suitable for Fairford.\n\nArchbishop Sherman\nDear Secretary,\n\nOn Sept. 1st, I left Fairford Reserve. Though having met with opposition when I first opened Lower Fairford School, I was encouraged, as time went on, by the increasing enthusiasm of the children attending. Before my departure I believe that most of parents were becoming a little more co-operative too. I will enclose a note received from Councillor C.J. Anderson, who was at first most opposed to the idea of a summer school.\n\nIn order that the children may continue...\nwith their studies, I do hope that a teacher has been secured for the Lower Fairford school, as there is a desperate need. A teacherage at the lower school would mean a great deal to a teacher there for the distance from the other residence is too great for walking. If the roads were even fair, the two mile hike would not seem so bad. However, I'm sorry to say that the roads have long been in need of repair. There was so much rain in August that at times they were almost impassable. It was only the realization of the great need, and because of the eagerness of the children, to whom school was still a novelty, that I managed to...\nattend each day in spite of unbelievable swarms of mosquitoes; very bad roads, often necessitating the carrying of logs to place across the water and mud holes before being able to cross; and the detours around the farm instructed non-too-friendly-looking, prized animals which were permitted to roam at large.\n\nMight I suggest that a well be dug either at the school or the new residence which I understand is to be erected soon. At present the children carry water from the river. Besides the distance to carry it, there is always the danger of typhoid resulting from the use of river water.\n\nAt present, I am\nat home for a few days before returning to Toronto for further study.\n\nAside from the physical discomfort, I count my four months experience on Manitoban Indian Reserve of very great value. Never having been on a reserve before, it was in many ways a revelation. If they could only become more independent, and realize that they could do much to help improve conditions on their reserve it would be a wonderful thing.\n\nInstead, they seem to be resigned to present conditions and run horses and break wagons, but make no attempt to improve the roads. May the Indian welfare teachers help educate them to\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 16th, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Sherman:\n\nWe have your telegram of the 13th instant in which you advise that you do not consider Miss Kastner suitable for Fairford.\n\nWe would appreciate it very much if you would nominate two teachers for the Fairford School. We wrote to Mr. Pook on August 13th, but have not received any reply.\n\nYou are probably aware that we are providing a teacher's residence at the Lower school this year. This means that residences are available at both schools and will obviate the difficulty of having to walk from one school to another, which was a cause of complaint by former teachers.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Rev.

Mackay Grade II - salary $1,900.00\n\nper academic year, effective October 1, 1947.

This will necessitate the removal of the partition and the building of a new chimney. I have asked for quotations on this work and as soon as received will forward them to the Department for consideration.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nMy wife, Mrs. J. F. Knuckey, was engaged as teacher for the above school. She started her teaching duties on October 1st last. She finds the classes too small and the strain too heavy to continue teaching and hereby quits her position at the end of the Christmas holidays.\n\nI am writing to you in order to make sure that my wife's resignation affects myself since I naturally gave up my school, the same reason she was engaged initially, on Oct 1st, at the same time. I am writing this before the end of the month and will send my letter by air mail so as to get it to you in time. I assure teachers for school re-opening after the Christmas holidays, and I further help you in any way I can. I am advising Mrs. Porter, Secretary of the Reserve Board, who does the advertising and receives the applications for teachers for the school. Similarly, I am advising Mrs. Knuckey, Indian Agent at Big Lake Reserve, whose agency needs reserve.\n\nI would add that if a teacher is not secured for Mrs. Knuckey's school (the Reserve school) and a very necessary Sunday School is needed for school re-opening after the Christmas holidays, I would be glad to assist for a reasonable length of time, and even hopefully stretch this a bit, in order to keep the school open until you secure a teacher for it.\n\nWould you kindly, in view of your resignation,\nTake the necessary adjustments as to deductions from our salaries as & Income Tax and Pension Fund, that is to say, try in order not to make any deductions from the October cheque if have been not been mailed early when you receive my letter, and (have them) refund if they have been mailed, and to send that no deductions be made from November and December cheques. I make this request as Miss MacKay will have earned only $468 these bringing me under her unearned status clause with total exceptions of $1500. (Salary $156.00 per mo.) and as I shall have earned only $468. Neither of us will be earning after January, though, as far as I can see, this would not affect deductions by your department.\n\nWe had hoped to be of greatest service together, and this includes the people and children here. Remember - but where health is involved you will understand it cannot be avoided.\n\nPersonally, I express my regret we cannot have faced tomorrow.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have decided to do so, this being, I think, the only fair thing to do in the circumstances in view of the scarcity of teachers and the greater difficulty there might probably be on this account in securing a teacher at this time of the year. It is understood, of course, that I return, as Mr. Pook has asked me, to the Main School. Conditions at the Lower Fairford School are most unhealthy and even dangerous for both pupils and teacher. A small school, a large enrolment, and a big stove will give you the picture.

I would like to make\nI would like to make it a condition of my returning to take charge of the Main School after the Christmas holidays that I be allowed to refuse admission of children from the Lower Sturford school to some families may attempt to have their children so admitted by moving up to live with relatives whose houses are perhaps too small to accommodate the larger number such action would render necessary.\n\nAllow me to express my appreciation of the personal form of salutation and the very kind tone in which you have written me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay I adopt a personal and friendly touch. Mr. Neary, have you ever been here? The road from Fairford to Lower Sturford, 3\u00bd miles, is as bad\u2014and I'm sure it's not exaggerating the matter\u2014as bad as in the days of the ox and cart. It's worn so unevenly placed ordinary every short distance with new stone removed even on country roads where the old roadway is a cottage or house at Lower Sturford will not hold a team.

Waite.\nSir,\n\nI regret to have to advise you that the work of painting the Fairfield Improved Indian Day School was commenced on or about July 15th by Mr. Alf. Johnston, who resides on the Reserve. The first intimation I had of this work was by the Farm Instructor's letter dated July 28th 1930 and received at this office on the 30th. Copy of the paragraph numbered 1, is attached herewith. I telephoned wire the Farm Instructor and enclosed copy of letter in reply, numbered 1, 2 and 3. During Treaty Payments on the Fairfield Reserve, I requested Mr. Bean to obtain a price for the renovating of the school, from one Alphonse Johnston, who resides on the Fairfield Reserve, for prices on paint from the local dealers. Johnston gave me no information during Treaty Payments. I went over the building with Mr. Bean and showed him the work required, so that he would be able to give Johnston an intelligent idea of what the work consisted of. On July 10th I received a letter from Mr. Johnston, which, and from his letter I was able to furnish approximate costs of the renovating to the Department, by letter No.10, dated July 21st. On the 5th instant, I proceeded to the Fairfield Reserve to see what work had been done. I interviewed Mr. Bean at the Home Farm and he claimed not having received my instructions. My instructions were given to Mr. Bean on the 26th of June, on July 1st Mr. Bean left the reserve for ten days holidays, returning to the reserve on the 11th, in the meantime no written instructions were received from me and Mr. Bean admitted that it was the first time he had come ahead with work without receiving instructions from me in writing. The paint was purchased from the Ashern Supply Company, Ashern, this being the only tender asked for, although he has been advised in writing that he must submit tenders to obtain tenders for all supplies over the sum of $15.00, and to obtain written authority before proceeding with any work. The bill for the paint in the neighbourhood of $175.00 and the following work was completed: Gilding in one room- one coat kalsomine, roof- shingle- stained black complete on main building, cut-side of building- one coat on South and West sides, work just commenced on the North side, medicine room- one coat kalsomine, kitchen- one coat of flat wall paint, cornice at the top of buildings- one coat of paint. The work is about half finished. Will you please advise what further action I am to take in this matter.\n\nYours obedient servant,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Asst. Deputy Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-5, part 5)\nOttawa, August 21, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, informing the Department of the action taken in painting the exterior and interior of the Fairford Improved Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that under the circumstances as mentioned in your letter the Department will approve of your arranging to have this work completed, if possible, before school reopens after the present summer holidays. Please see that all costs are kept as low as possible. When the work has been satisfactorily completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint and other materials used and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I therefore, regret that there are no funds available to carry out the above work this year.\n\nRegarding new boxes for the school toilets at the Fairford Day School, I have to say that, if you consider this work to be absolutely necessary, you may arrange to have the boxes built and installed. We note you estimate the cost to be $25, and this amount should not, if possible, be exceeded. If these boxes are supplied, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

G., Fairservice, Mrs. C. Beate, Mr. Robt. McLean and Mr. Robt. Cook for services in connection with the Fairford Indian Day School during the month of May, 1932.\n\nIn future, you should forward separate vouchers, in triplicate, for services rendered by Mrs. Beate, Mr. McLean and Mr. Cook. In issuing cheques for their services for the month of April, it was overlooked that 10% should have been deducted from each of them. The necessary adjustments, therefore, for the months of April and May are being made now and cheque for $16.00 will go forward for Mrs. Beate; $25.50 for Robert McLean and $42.24 for Robert Cook. The cheque for Robert Cook includes the amount of $8.04 for the milk supplied for the midday meal.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department allows $40 a month for janitor services at the Fairford School and it is noted that, in addition, accounts have been submitted for $6.00 a month for scrubbing the school. Our funds are so limited this year that it is necessary to curtail expenses as much as possible and I would request you to advise whether or not the caretaker could look after the scrubbing and thus avoid the extra payment of $6.00 a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is considered that the teachers, with the help of the older girl pupils, could prepare and serve the midday lunch, which now consists mainly of milk and a hot drink. Please give this matter your consideration and advise the Department if the kitchen help could not be dispensed with. Salary for this service for the month of September will be forwarded in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-5, part 5)\nFairford Improved Day School could also come into the category of a Day School and the mid-day meal be supplied only during the winter months. The cost of the mid-day meal at Fairford costs approximately .06 Cents per pupil for the ten teaching months this does not include the salary of the kitchen help of $20.00 per month. I strongly recommend that the undermentioned supplies be authorized:\n\nBeef\nRice\nPot-barley\nBeans\nSugar\nSalt\nCocoa.\nPotatoes for Lake Manitoba & Fairford Day Schools\n\nThe mid-day meal usually commences early in the month of November and continues until the 1st April or until the supplies give out.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the above noted letter in reference to supplies for mid-day meals at Fairford Indian Day School. During the past few years it has been the custom of the Department to supply materials for the making of soup on the reserves where a day school is operating; the soup is given the children at mid-day during the winter months. The supplies cost the Department in previous years in the neighbourhood of $175.00. The Fairford Improved Day School and Swan Lake Day School have been supplying the children with a mid-day meal summer and winter. I beg to suggest the mid-day meals be served at the following reserves during the winter as in many cases the children are walking a distance of from 3 to 5 miles to school.\n\nLake Manitoba Day School \u2014 3/15 (4)\nLittle Saskatchewan Day School \u2014 26.5/11 (4)\nLake St. Martins Day School \u2014 40.8/15 (4)\nFairford Improved Day School \u2014 49.9/9 (4)\nEbb and Flow Day School \u2014 22.6/2 (4)\nShoal River Day School \u2014 3/11 (4)\n\nThe cost of supplies for the above schools would be approximately $100.00 not including the milk.\n\nA mid-day meal is not necessary at Swan Lake School as the children have not a great distance to walk and the Indians are in fair circumstances. The children at the Waterhen live close to the school and a mid-day meal is not necessary. By stopping the meal at Swan Lake a saving would be made not only in supplies but the salary of the Field Matron could also be eliminated. On a number of reserves a school garden is grown and the supplies furnished by the Department could be kept as low as possible. The saving at Swan Lake over a period of 10 months would more than pay for the supplies for all the other day schools where a meal at noon is very necessary as not only would the health of the children be endangered, the attendance would also fall off.\nOttawa, October 25th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 10 of the 10th instant, with reference to the cost of midday meals at the schools in the Portage la Prairie Agency. During the fiscal year 1931-32, i.e., from April 1st, 1931, to March 31st, 1932, our books show the following expenditures:\n\n- Lake Manitoba: $31.15\n- Little Saskatchewan: $26.51\n- Lake St. Martin: $40.81\n- Ebb and Flow: $32.02\n- Shoal River: $31.11\n- Swan Lake: $85.47\n- Waterhen River: $9.84\n- Fairford (incl. $20 a mo. for kitchen help): $499.93\n\nAs pointed out in previous correspondence, the Department finds it necessary to reduce the cost of the midday meal. Comparing the attendance at Fairford and the other schools, I think you will agree that the expenditure at this school has been larger than it should have been. During the current fiscal year, the administration of the services of the kitchen help, as authorized by official letter of the 10th instant, will reduce the expenditure considerably but this is not a sufficient reduction. You should at once take up with the teachers the question of reducing the expenditure for midday meal purposes to an amount that will compare favourably with the expenditures at the other schools.\n\nThe expenditure at the Swan Lake School is also high and, as intimated in official letter of the 12th instant, the Department will expect the teacher and yourself to arrange for a considerable reduction.\n\nWith regard to the other schools in your agency, the Department considers that the amount expended for midday meal purposes this year should not exceed what was spent during the fiscal year for which the figures are given above.\n\nA decision as to what supplies are to be furnished will be left to yourself and the teachers concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You have not furnished any recommendation as to the needs or condition of the equipment asked for. Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year, as well as for the coming fiscal year, have been reduced to the lowest possible point, and teachers in your Agency should only requisition in future for supplies that are of an urgent nature.\n\nAmong other supplies asked for, it is noted that the teacher requests 40 yards striped flannelette, 5 gallons floor oil, a quantity of stove pipe, 2 shelves for stove and an axe handle. You should report as to the use of the above equipment, and state if the quantity of flannelette and floor oil cannot be reduced.\n\nIt is noted that the school closed account in January, last, for a new axe and handle. Why should it now be necessary to supply an axe handle?\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a copper boiler for use in the children's dining-room, 1 package sewing needles and the quantity of white thread absolutely necessary.\n\nRegarding refills for the fire extinguishers, I have to say that you may again purchase the chemicals required to recharge the extinguishers. When the refills are received at the school, you should see that they are installed in the extinguishers and that the extinguishers are placed in good condition and ready for immediate use in case of fire.\n\nAccounts, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the purchases which you are authorized to make.\n\nWe have no flags on hand at present. Another requisition should be forwarded early next Spring, when consideration will be given to supplying a flag.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

In this connection, I beg to say that the teachers have continued the services of the kitchen help, paying her wages between them. The services of a woman at the school are very necessary, the teachers being kept busy during the school hours, and the evenings are spent in the issuing of medicine and visiting the sick on the reserve. The present help, Mrs. Boat, is a white woman, very capable and well thought of by the Indians. Mrs. Boat is interested in the work, having spent several years in Indian Boarding Schools, but feels that she is imposing on the teachers as long as they pay her salary. I beg to recommend that $10.00 per month be paid this woman by the Department, the teachers would also contribute $10.00 per month. If this arrangement is approved by the Department, I am certain the women would be satisfied to stay. I also beg to say that from time to time Department Officials stay at the school also the Doctor on his visits to the reserve, the R.C.M.P. Police also use the school as a headquarters when any investigation is to be made on the reserve. Will you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 18, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to payment for the services of the woman who prepares and serves the mid-day lunch at the Fairford Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year has been considerably reduced, I regret that it will not be possible to establish the position of kitchen help and provide salary for the service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the above noted letter in reference to a requisition for materials forwarded by the teacher of the Fairford Improved Day School. In reply I beg to state that the stove pipes are required for the heater used in the basement. A number of the stove pipes became burnt through, and the stove pipes running across the basement had become shortened to such extent that the stove was too close to a lumber partition for safety. The two shelves are required for a camp comfort stove. These stoves are round and the teacher makes a practice of heating water on the stove, for washing the dishes after the children's midday meal, this is very dangerous unless the stove is equipped with shelves. An axe and handle were purchased for the school in the month of January, the handle was broken during the excessive frosty weather last month. Floor oil is sold in four gallon containers and is required as the school floor is of fir and is beginning to wear.\n\nIn my report to the Manitoba Inspectorate in reply to Department Circular of February 4th 1933, I stressed the need of undergarments for the school children and suggested that flannelette be supplied to the day schools on requisition. The underclothing could be made during the summer months and distributed to the children when the cold weather comes in the fall. A few years ago it was possible for the Indians to leave their reserves in the fall of the year and work during the harvesting and threshing periods and they would usually return with considerable clothing for the children. The last few years wages have been so low that it has not paid them to leave, the result is that the children are poorly supplied with underwear. I have suggested to a number of the teachers, that sewing classes be held in the school at periods during the week, in most cases the teachers fell in line with the suggestion. Flannelette can be purchased from the T.Eaton Co. at 15 cents per yard. The shelves for the stove would cost in the neighborhood of $3.25.\nOttawa, March 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with further reference to the requisition for materials from the teacher of the Fairford Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity of stove pipe and stove pipe wire required. It is noted that this is required for the heater used in the basement. You may also purchase two shelves for the Camp Comfort stove, one axe handle and a four gallon container of floor oil. Please obtain itemized accounts covering the cost of the above authorized purchases, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a quantity of flannelette, to be made into underclothing for the pupils under the instruction of the teachers, I have to say that you will be advised in a separate communication regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In addition to this amount, the milk cost $137.49. The Department considers that an expenditure of $100 for midday meal supplies should be sufficient, in view of the fact that, as stated in your letter of October 10, 1932, it is not necessary to supply a midday meal at the Swan Lake School, and the further fact that, at those schools where a midday meal is given, it should only be supplied from November 1st to April 1st.\n\nYou state that a limited amount of milk is required to make the cocoa palatable. Please state the approximate cost. It is presumed that you intend to use either milk powder or condensed milk. In either case, your estimate regarding the amount necessary should be considerably less than the amount paid for milk during the last academic year. On receipt of your reply, the Department will decide what amount can be allowed for milk.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nFortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nOctober 27th, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nRe: 126-5-5, Ottawa, May 18th, 1933.\n\nAs per instructions contained in the above noted letter, I have arranged for the van to transport the children from Lower Fairford to the Fairford Improved Day School. The arrangement will take effect from November 1st, 1933. I trust this is in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba,\nOctober 26th, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nRe: 126-5-5, Ottawa, August 8th, 1933.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the above noted letter, in regard to mid-day meals for the children of Day Schools in this Agency. The mid-day meal at Swan Lake was omitted last year as the Indian had a fair crop and I felt that the Indian could supply his children attending school with a meal at mid-day. This year the crop was practically a failure and very little was left after paying expenses. Owing to this condition, I beg to recommend that a meal be provided by the Department this year, if the school teacher is prepared to cook same without expense to the Department. I beg to make requisition for $125.00 for the mid-day meal supplies for the eight schools in this Agency and a further $75.00 for the purchase of Dry-milk powder. The powder will cost .14\u00a2 per lb at Portage la Prairie, 480 lbs being required, the balance of the money will be required for freight etc. The powder recommended is skim milk as the whole milk powder costs .33\u00a2 laid down at Portage. A quantity of vegetables will be required as the garden at Lake St. Martin was a complete failure. The Shoal River and Little Saskatchewan Day Schools had a fair crop of vegetables, Waterhen Day School can get through on the quantity harvested. The other Day Schools in the Agency have no land for growing a school garden and a small quantity of onions and potatoes should be purchased. I will keep all costs as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 31, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, regarding the supplies required for the pupils' mid-day meals at the eight day schools in your agency.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may incur an expenditure which must not exceed the sum of $200, in the purchase of the supplies required, including dry milk powder and vegetables. You should consult the teachers concerning the supplies required and apportion the expenditure equally in the purchase among the different schools. The Department will leave in your hands the purchasing of the supplies to be used for the midday lunch; but, as stated, the total cost must not exceed $200. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the expenditure for each of the schools separately, or you should state definitely on the accounts the cost of same for each school.\n\nOur funds this year are so limited, that the above amount is all that can be allowed for the purpose of providing supplies for the midday meals. With the biscuits that have been furnished, the sum allowed should provide a fair allowance for this purpose.\n\nI have also your letter of the 27th instant, stating that you have arranged for the van to transport the children from Lower Fairford to and from the Fairford Improved Indian Day School. It is presumed that the cost involved will be the same as previously paid for this service, viz.: $2.00 per day. It is considered that the driving of these children should be for a period of six months \u2014 until the end of April next. You should forward accounts, in triplicate, for the amount due for this service, at the end of each month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

D 592, amounting to $4.62 in favour of Rev. J. E. Cooper, Indian Springs, Manitoba, for milk supplied for mid-day meals at the Swan Lake Indian Day School, January 3rd to February 16th, 1934.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 126-5-5 dated October 31st, 1933.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nI have to advise that the drilled well at the Fairford Improved Day School has caved in and it has been necessary to haul ice a distance of six miles to keep the school going. I have had a well driller look at the well\u2014only driller in the district\u2014and he sets a price of $50.00 for the moving of his drill from Gypsumville, and states the probable cost of the well repair will be in the neighbourhood of $150.00.\n\nThe casing of this well has dropped to the bottom, shutting off the supply of water, the cave in being above the casing. I have had a man fish the casing out and clean the gravel out. The cost of this work will be in the neighbourhood of $25.00. A piece of pipe 4\" by 24 feet long is necessary to fit inside the casing. I have asked the Cadham Hardware Co., of Portage la Prairie to furnish me with a price on this casing f.o.b. Fairford. It is necessary that this casing be put in immediately.\n\nIt was imperative that the well be repaired at once, as the ice in the Fairford River is now flooded, the water not being fit to drink and it would be practically impossible to haul water that distance in sufficient quantities to keep the school going. The lake, the nearest point where good water can be obtained is eight miles away, making a sixteen mile trip.\n\nI trust the Department approve of my action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 13, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the third instant, with reference to the well at the Fairford Indian Day School. It is noted, from your letter, that it will be necessary to drill a new well, at an approximate cost of $150. You may proceed with this work as soon as weather conditions are suitable. Enclosed is R. R. No. 2067, authorizing the expenditure that is necessary.\n\nYou may also forward, for payment, accounts covering the cost of removing the old casing and for supplying the new pipe that is needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nThis school is a large building, with a full sized basement. It is heated by a furnace. Part of the basement is used for the children's dining room, part for a store room, and the rest as a furnace room.\n\nOn the first floor there is a large classroom, dispensary, living room, and kitchen. The upstairs consists of five bedrooms.\n\nA second classroom is located about 200 ft. from this building and is used for the senior pupils.\n\nMiss I. G. Fairbairn is in charge as senior teacher. Miss N. Shaftfeld is junior teacher, and Miss Pavel is cook and housekeeper. I understand Miss Pavel is paid by the two teachers in charge. Alex Letendre is caretaker and receives his pay from the Department.\n\nThe main building is in good repair, but some of the bedrooms badly need papering. They have not been re-papered for years and are very dark and gloomy. A new spring is needed for one of the beds - the cost should not exceed ten or twelve dollars. The kitchen oilcloth is entirely worn out and should be renewed. The room is about 16x20. A good grade of oilcloth is all that is required.\n\nIn the senior room Miss Fairbairn has 17 on the roll. I found 14 present. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| III   | 6      |\n| IV    | 7      |\n| V     | 3      |\n| VI    | 1      |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-5, part 6)\nThe children were all well dressed and neat in appearance. They were well along in their grades and are making good progress. Miss Fairweather is a qualified teacher and is greatly interested in her work. The children read well and are quick and accurate in their arithmetic and spelling. They write well and I found their exercise books well kept and all work neatly set down.\n\nThe school is modern in design. The exterior and interior is badly in need of paint and the work should certainly be done this year.\n\nMiss Skaffeld is in charge of the junior room. She is a qualified teacher and is doing splendid work. The roll calls for 32, and the attendance since the New Year has been good, ranging from 20 to 25. The grades are arranged with 27 in Grade I and 5 in Grade II.\n\nThe children respond readily and are not afraid to speak out and talk. They sing well and are able to do a number of song drills. I found no dull moments in this classroom and we are fortunate in having the services of such a splendid teacher.\n\nA noon meal is provided during the winter months. The meal consists of soup, biscuits, and tea. Miss Pavel prepares the meal, but the dishes are washed and put away by the children.\n\nThe attendance is somewhat improved by the operation of a van as some of the children live three and four miles from the school. I understand two vans were operated until last year, but I am of the opinion that only one is needed.\n\nThis is\nFAIRFORD IMPROVED INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThis is one of the best managed day schools we have in Manitoba and splendid results are being obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The furnace is a Warrior No.65 and the parts required is the top casting of the firebox and one eight inch flue. The local Hardware Merchant has tried to obtain these parts in Winnipeg but has been unsuccessful and requires further information as to the makers name etc. To the best of my knowledge the furnace was installed in the year 1927 and was purchased either direct from Ottawa or the Commissioner's office at Regina. The makers name is not on the furnace, and from what I can gather the furnace is manufactured in eastern Canada.\n\nI cannot find a voucher covering the purchase, neither does there appear to be any authority on file regarding the installation. If this furnace is manufactured in the east, and was purchased direct through the Department at Ottawa, will you please have the firm forward the parts as requested to the Farming Instructor, Fairford, Manitoba.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant regarding repairs required to the furnace at the Fairford Indian Day School, I beg to say that on December 27, 1927, the former Indian Commissioner, Mr. W. H. Graham, submitted to the Department an account covering the cost of one - #64 Jumbo wood furnace for the Fairford Indian Day School. This furnace had been purchased from the Gurney Northwest Foundry Co., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI presume that this firm is still in business in Winnipeg, and you can, no doubt, arrange to secure from them the parts that are absolutely necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-5, part 6)\nSir,\n\nI have to advise you that the furnace at the Fairford Indian Day School is beyond repair, and a new one will have to be furnished this fall.

I can find no vouchers on our office files showing the purchase. Certain repairs were made to this furnace last spring.\n\nI still believe that a wood furnace could be used in this school for quite a number of years, but an expert on heating should be allowed to visit the school, as the furnace has never been quite satisfactory. The old furnace is a 'warrior No.65'.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\"\n\nThe Department does not see any necessity for sending an expert on heating to the Fairford School. If the furnace in this building is in such condition that it cannot be repaired, I presume it will be necessary to purchase a new wood furnace. You might consult two or three firms in Winnipeg who supply furnaces for this type of building and let me know the approximate cost for the Fairford School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-5, part 6)\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 126-5-5 dated August 5th, and to submit the following quotations in connection with the installation of a furnace at the Fairford Indian Day School. You will note that the quotation submitted by McDonald Bros., on the 75,000 cu. ft. capacity furnace, is much less than that submitted by the Campbell Heating Company. If it is necessary to enlarge or add any extra warm or cold air pipes, this will entail extra expense.\n\n\"Campbell Heating Company\"\n#83 Pease Economy Wood Furnace, rated at 60,000 cu.ft. capacity installed for the sum of $358.00. The above furnace is a shade on the small size at very extreme temperatures, so we are also quoting you on a #6-65 Hilborn wood furnace, rated at 75,000 cu.ft. capacity installed for the sum of $458.00.\n\n\"MacDonald Bros. Sheet Metal & Roofing.\"\nReplying to your enquiry, we are pleased to quote you the sum of $363.00 to supply and erect one only Hilborn wood burning furnace, 75,000 cu.ft. capacity, including casing and smoke pipe, at Fairford, Man. This price also includes the taking out of the present furnace but does not include any extra hot or cold air ducts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

(RG 10, Volume 6232, file 510-5, part 7)\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, reports that the furnace at the Fairford Improved Day School is in need of certain alterations. The smoke pipe extends from the front of the furnace, passing around the furnace and into the chimney at the back.\n\nThis is not satisfactory and there is the constant danger of fire. The alterations required will necessitate changing some of the heating pipes. Mr. Waite recommends that McDonald Bros., Winnipeg, who installed the furnace be sent out to make the necessary alterations. The roads are open now, and I have no doubt the tinsmith will wish to make the trip by car. It will no doubt require the greater part of three days and the greatest expense would be in connection with labour.\n\nI would appreciate receiving authority in order that the work may be done as soon as the fires can be dispensed with.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.
