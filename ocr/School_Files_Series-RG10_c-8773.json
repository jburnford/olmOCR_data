In my letter of April 26th., 1918, I explained the necessity for making a change in the plans for the transmission line in order to avoid an excessive annual rental charge, and estimated the extra cost at $300.00. This brought the total estimate up to $3100.00.\n\nThe actual cost of the pumping plant, including the pipe line and transmission line, was $3336.58, so that we exceeded the estimates on the plant by $236.58, which is less than 8% of the estimated cost.\n\nIn addition to the pumping plant, with its transmission line and pipe line, we superintended the construction of the main distribution ditches. In the original report, there was no estimate included for this work, since the general opinion of everyone concerned seemed to be that earth ditches would be all that would be necessary, and that the pupils at the Industrial\nSchool would be able to dig them without much expense to the Department. Under the circumstances, and on account of the short length of time at our disposal, we did not make definite surveys for the distribution system, nor did we included an estimate of its cost in the preliminary report.\n\nThe small amount of the actual cash expenditure for the construction of the earth ditches is shown by the fact that only some $50.00 was spent on the 2 miles dug, since nearly all the work was done by the pupils of the Industrial School. If we had been able to use earth ditches entirely, as was originally supposed the cost of the distribution system would have been comparatively small.\n\nWhen we came to examine carefully the actual conditions, after work was started on the construction of the pumping plant, we found that a considerable length of flumes would be necessary, and that the expense for the distributing system would be quite a considerable item. However, the pumping plant would be useless without the distribution system, and there was no time to spare if the necessary work was to be done before the river rose, and if the water was to be ready in time to save this season's crop. Under these circumstances, we decided to proceed with the extra work and carry it out as speedily and economically as possible, consistent with good workmanship.\n\nThe accompanying plan shows the extent of the distribution system as actually built. There are 2 miles of earth ditches and 2260 feet of substantial lumber flumes supported on trestles from 1 to 5 feet high. The whole system is proportioned according to the amount of land to be served and the water to be carried. The actual cash outlay on the ditches, as already mentioned, was only about $50.00. The flumes, on the other hand, cost $470.00 for lumber and material and $440.00 for labor, making a total of $910.00, which was 40\u00a2 per lineal foot.\n\nSome outlying parts of the ditch system have not been finished yet, but the land they are to serve will not be irrigated this year.\nNearly all the surveys have been made, and with the exception of 2 road crossings the work will be all earth ditches which can be dug by the pupils at the Industrial School at little extra expense. The Provincial Public Works engineer is talking of moving the road, and if this is done before the ditches are needed, the road crossings will not be required.\n\nIn spite of our hurry, the river rose before the well could be dug as deep as our plans called for. This will prevent the use of the pumping plant when the river is very low. There will not likely be any trouble in the fall, but there might be in the early spring. During the low water period this fall or next spring, the well should be deepened 2 feet and the connecting box uncovered and lowered the same amount. This will probably cost less than $100.00.\n\nIn previous years, some 10 or 12 acres of the most favorably located land has been irrigated by the use of the following machinery, which will not be needed any more in its present location:\n\n- 1 - 4\" x 6\" Gasoline engine belt-connected to 3\" centrifugal pump.\n- 1 - 4\" x 6\" Gasoline engine belt-connected to 2\" centrifugal pump.\n- 2 - windmills and well pumps. One windmill wheel broken.\n\nOn June 14th., we made a test of the new pumping plant to determine its general capacity and efficiency. The plant was supposed to deliver 1000 gallons (U.S.) per minute or 2.2 cubic feet per second, at a static head of 50 feet. When the test was made the river was high and the head was only 41 feet. This decrease would be expected to cause an increase in the capacity and probably a decrease in the efficiency.\n\nThe actual test gave a discharge of 2.7 cubic feet per second or 1200 gallons per minute, which shows that the plant has the required capacity. The efficiency of the machinery, making an allowance of 16 feet for friction loss in the pipes and elbows,\nwas 59%, which is considered quite satisfactory for this type of pump, especially when operating under a varying head.\n\nThe actual ratio of the useful work done in lifting the water to the amount of power through the meter, which gives the over-all efficiency of the plant, was 42%. When the river is lower, there will be a smaller discharge and the friction loss will be less, so that the over-all efficiency will generally be somewhat higher.\n\nIn designing the plant, a higher efficiency could have been obtained by using larger pipe and more expensive machinery, but the extra expenditure could not be justified for a plant like this, where the annual power charges will probably not greatly exceed 10% on the first cost of the plant.\n\nThe amount of current consumed in delivering the 1200 gallons per minute, was 22 kilowatts per hour, so that at $1.37 per kilowatt-hour, the cost of operating the pump was 33 cents per hour. This season, with some 45 acres of land under cultivation, it should not be necessary to run the pump for more than 4 or 5 hours a day.\n\nIn contrasting the cost of supplying irrigation water by pumping with the cost by a gravity system, it should be remembered that the cost of the distribution system is the same in both cases and depends entirely on the general configuration of the land to be irrigated. In this case, however, it is unfortunate that no estimate was made of the cost of the distribution system, since it was a necessary part of the whole irrigation scheme. The omission only affected the preliminary report, and did not increase the actual cost of the work in any way.\n\nThe cost of the pumping plant itself, including the pipe line and transmission line, exceeded the estimates by less than 8%; the work on the flumes and ditches was done as economically\nas possible; and the whole plant and distribution system has been successfully completed in time to irrigate this season's crop.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDivision Engineer\n\nB.C.Hydrometric Survey\n\nJ.F.Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nCCC/M.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Vouchers covering complete cost of machinery and appliances in connection with the installation of the Power Pumping Plant at the Kamloops Industrial School, together with the report of the Engineer in charge, and to add that the plant is in operation and is a signal success.

You approved this expenditure by telegram of 12th April last.\n\nMr.Cline reports on the 18th ultimo that the work of installing the pump has been completed at a cost of $3336.58, that the pumping plant would be useless without a distribution system, also that there was no time to spare if the necessary work was to be done before the river rose if the water was to be ready in time to save this season's crops; they therefore decided to proceed with the extra work of constructing flumes and ditches for the purpose of distributing the water at an extra cost of $559.04, making a total cost of $4295.62.\n\nThere are still some outlying parts of the ditching system to be constructed but the land it is to serve will not be irrigated this year.\n\nThere are two gasoline engines, two wind-\n\nmills\nwindmills and well pumps which Mr. Cline reports are no longer required; I presume these may be sold and should be disposed of as soon as possible before they deteriorate in value from non-use.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, July 25th, 1918.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo forwarding vouchers covering the cost of machinery and appliances in connection with the installation of the power pumping plant for the Kamloops Industrial School. I would request you to advise me, for the information of the War Purchasing Commission, whether prices were obtained from different firms before the various materials were purchased. If so, I shall be glad to receive a memo of these prices, and if not, please advise me why a competition was not asked.\n\nWill you be kind enough to give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nJune 18th, 1916.\n\nConstruction Report and Accounts\nfor Irrigation Pumping Plant\nand Distribution System for the\nKamloops Industrial School.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn accordance with the instructions received through\nyou from the Indian Department on April 13th., last, we\nproceeded with the construction of the irrigation pumping\nplant for the Kamloops Industrial School.

In my letter of April 26th., 1916, I explained the necessity for making a change in the plans for the transmission line in order to avoid an excessive annual rental charge, and estimated the extra cost at $300.00. This brought the total estimate up to $3100.00.\n\nThe actual cost of the pumping plant, including the pipe line and transmission line, was $3336.58, so that we exceeded the estimates on the plant by $236.58, which is less than 8% of the estimated cost.\n\nIn addition to the pumping plant, with its transmission line and pipe line, we superintended the construction of the main distribution ditches. In the original report, there was no estimate included for this work, since the general opinion of everyone concerned seemed to be that earth ditches would be all that would be necessary, and that the pupils at the Industrial School would be able to dig them without much expense to the Department. Under the circumstances, and on account of the short length of time at our disposal, we did not make definite surveys for the distribution system, nor did we included an\nestimate of its cost in the preliminary report.\n\nThe small amount of the actual cash expenditure for the construction of the earth ditches is shown by the fact that only some $50.00 was spent on the 2 miles dug, since nearly all the work was done by the pupils of the Industrial School. If we had been able to use earth ditches entirely, as was originally supposed the cost of the distribution system would have been comparatively small.\n\nWhen we came to examine carefully the actual conditions, after work was started on the construction of the pumping plant, we found that a considerable length of flumes would be necessary, and that the expense for the distributing system would be quite a considerable item. However, the pumping plant would be useless without the distribution system, and there was no time to spare if the necessary work was to be done before the river rose, and if the water was to be ready in time to save this season's crop. Under these circumstances we decided to proceed with the extra work and carry it out as speedily and economically as possible, consistent with good workmanship.\n\nThe accompanying plan shows the extent of the distribution system as actually built. There are 2 miles of earth ditches and 2260 feet of substantial lumber flumes supported on trestles from 1 to 5 feet high. The whole system is proportioned according to the amount of land to be served and the water to be carried. The actual cash outlay on the ditches, as already mentioned, was only about $50.00. The flumes, on the other hand, cost $470.00 for lumber and material and $440.00 for labor, making a total of $910.00 which was 40\u00a2 per lineal foot.\n\nSome outlying parts of the ditch system have not been finished yet, but the land they are to serve will not be irrigated this year. Nearly all the surveys have been made, and with the exception of 2 road crossings the work will be all earth ditches which can be dug by the pupils at the Industrial School at little extra expense. The Provincial Public Works engineer is talking of moving\nmoving the road, and if this is done before the ditches are needed, the road crossings will not be required.\n\nIn spite of our hurry, the river rose before the well could be dug as deep as our plans called for. This will prevent the use of the pumping plant when the river is very low. There will not likely be any trouble in the fall, but there might be in the early spring. During the low water period this fall or next spring, the well should be deepened 2 feet and the connecting box uncovered and lowered the same amount. This will probably cost less than $100.00.\n\nIn previous years, some 10 or 12 acres of the most favorably located land has been irrigated by the use of the following machinery, which will not be needed any more in its present location:\n\n1 - 4\" x 8\" gasoline engine belt-connected to 3\" centrifugal pump.\n1 - 4\" x 6\" gasoline engine belt-connected to 2\" centrifugal pump.\n2 - windmills and well pumps.\nOne windmill wheel broken.\n\nOn June 14th., we made a test of the new pumping plant to determine its general capacity and efficiency.

Swan and Cline of the Hydrographic Survey. They arranged for the purchase of all the materials, giving of contracts and employment of labor.\n\nI might further state that instructions to me requiring the calling for tenders in the purchase of supplies were issued under date of May 8, File 505,265, reaching my office on the 13th of May, while the authority to proceed with the work of installation was issued under date of April 12th, File 116659/5, reaching here on the 17th, nearly one month prior to the regulations requiring quotations of the prices for goods required. However, the purchasing end was entirely in the hands of Messrs. Swan and Cline, Dominion Engineers, who have practical knowledge of the detailed requirements, with which I did not interfere.\n\nUpon receipt of Department letter today I called up Mr. Cline, who informed me that he had memo of some of the prices quoted for some of the articles purchased Duncan T. Scott, Esq., Deputy Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\npurchased and promised to furnish me with same, which will be forwarded to the Department as soon as they reach me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn F. Smith\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of Mr Scott's letter of the 25th July with reference to the cost of Machinery and appliances in connection with the installation of the pumping plant for the Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nWhen your department decided to go ahead with the pumping scheme the season was fairly well advanced and in order to bring the school lands under cultivation this year we were obliged to commence the work of installing the plant with the least possible delay. Under the circumstances I did not call for tenders in placing the order for machinery and appliances, but received verbal quotations from the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co., The A.R. Williams Machinery Co. and the B.C. Equipment Co. The prices quoted by the last mentioned Company were considerably below the others, and if the War Purchasing Commission will compare these prices with those of any Machinery Company in Ottawa they will find that the prices paid are quite reasonable.\nAs regards the Transformers, The Canadian Westinghouse Company quoted us a price of 5% less than any other Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nATM/RGS.\nSir:\n\nIn answer to your request for a statement for the information of the War Purchasing Commission about the methods adopted in getting prices and placing orders for the machinery and material for the irrigation pumping plant for the Kamloops Industrial School, I beg leave to submit the following statement:\n\nAccording to the arrangement made between the three of us when Mr. Swan was in Kamloops in connection with this matter, he undertook to see what equipment there was on hand in Vancouver that would suit our requirements and to get prices on it for delivery at an early date after the actual placing of the order. He was responsible for getting quotations on the pump, motor, pipes and fittings and the transformers. I am writing him for a memorandum on the matter.\n\nIn the meantime, I am enclosing a copy of the tender he received from the B.C. Equipment Co. which was used as a basis of the estimates and final placing of the order for the pump, motor and piping.\n\nI am enclosing also a copy of a letter from the Canadian Allis-Chalmers, in reply to enquiries I made of them myself. The machinery offered by this company was not of large enough capacity but the price was higher than the B.C. Equipment Co. tender, and the date of possible delivery was very uncertain.\nWith regard to the material and labor for the transmission line, the Water and Light department of the city of Kamloops undertook to supply it at actual cost plus 10% for superintendence, which is its ordinary method of doing such work for power users.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDivision Engineer.\n\nJ.

This work has been successfully carried through by Johnson & Co., Kamloops, with Mr. C. D. Cline, Division Engineer, and Mr. A. M. Phillips as surveyor. The ditches were dug by the boys of the school, the total cost to the Government will be in the neighborhood of $3,500. It is estimated that the plant, which is run by a 25-h.p. A. C. motor, is capable of supplying 1,000 gallons per minute sufficient to irrigate 100 acres. The electricity is supplied by the City at the rate of 1\u00bd cents per kilowatt hour. Up to the present the school officials, through lack of water, have not been able to cultivate more than four or five acres. But this year they are putting under cultivation 45 acres, and it is devoutly hoped that this area will be further increased next year. The soil around the school is excellent, so that the new plant will be of great benefit to the Institution.\n\nFather Welch, O.M.I., who happened to be on a visit to the school, came forward by the Engineer to push back the electric switch and set the machinery in motion. A few seconds later a stream of water was seen gushing from the six-inch pipe into the flume and ditch, and thence through a hundred little channels over the thirsty land. A ringing cheer from Mr. Calderwood\u2019s pupils announced the happy completion of an important and much appreciated undertaking.\n\nFather Desmarais, O.M.I., was absent at the time on business in Vancouver. We congratulate him on having acquired this splendid water system for his school farm. It will assuredly enable the children and staff of this well-conducted establishment to live in the years to come at least in frugal comfort.\nOttawa, 4th April 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the installation of the pumping plan for irrigation at the Kamloops Industrial School, I have the request you to be good enough to ascertain at the office of the Comptroller of Water Rights whether it is necessary in this case to obtain a license.

The Principal seems to think it is beyond the experimental stage. He would like to see it extended so that pupils leaving school would have an opportunity to go on the land and become producers at once.\n\nHe will likely bring his scheme to the attention of the Department.\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nJUN 17 1919\nARCHITECT.\n\nDate of Inspection, May 7th, 1919.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nLast year under the recommendation of Mr. Major Maclean and the Agency Agent, the Department furnished the lumber for the construction of a large flume across the upper part of the school property. It was hoped that in time it would revive the alfalfa previously seeded there.\n\nWhen watering our alfalfa at the beginning of May we thought the three cuttings would give us twenty-five or thirty tons. Of course, the flume enabled us to irrigate properly.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to learn that when the mower was turned about the first of July, the entire field stood about three feet high, some of it so thick that it was lodged. The first cutting gave us well over thirty tons!\n\nThere is only a small portion of the flat now in alfalfa, probably about five acres. Our intention is to seed about ten acres more next month. When we think of the number of cattle starved last winter on the prairies, and of hay being contracted for now in the field for some forty dollars a ton, it is easy to realize what this prolific crop, which flourished there under irrigation with tropical luxuries, means for the milk and meat supply of the children.\n\nThis letter, of course, calls for no an-\nwe: it merely presents another view of the\nirrigation system.\n\nHoping soon to be favored by your visit,\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames Macdonald, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Duncan E. Scott,\nDeputy Sup. General of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nit merely presents another view of the\nirrigation system.\n\nHoping soon to be favored by your visit,\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames McLean, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Duncan E. Scott,\nDeputy Sup. General of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nVernon, B.C.,\nMarch 12, 1920.\n\nSir:\n\nIt has been reported to me from Kamloops that the Indian Agent was getting the Indians to agitate for a pumping system on the Reserve to irrigate their lands, which are at present very much in need of more water, if cultivation of their land is to be prosecuted by them successfully.\n\nIt may be possible, however, that the Indians may have thought of it themselves as the result of what they have seen accomplished at the Industrial School, and the Agent may be in no way to blame for the question coming up at this time. I notice the Agent makes reference to the movement in his monthly report for February, but gives no hint of the origin.\n\nIn view of the possibility of the Department entertaining the proposition for taking over the Harper Ranch for the Indians of Kamloops band, who would be asked to give up their present holding on the flat, it would seem to be an unwise course, at the present time, to introduce an agitation for the expenditure of Indian funds for\na pumping plant, as it would tend to prejudice them against the course which would tend to their greater advancement, both morally and materially, and would solve their irrigation difficulties in quite another and more effective way.\n\nI shall endeavor, in the meanwhile, to ascertain from Mr. Smith the origin of the movement for pumping plant to which he makes reference in his report, and if the scheme was suggested to them by him, I think he should be given to understand that the proper course, under the circumstances, would have been to ascertain first the Department's wishes and intentions, before projecting any other course that would tend to forestall or embarrass. He has always opposed the policy of having the Indians give up their dwellings in the village and move on to their land and the pumping scheme takes on the appearance of an insidious move to give further effect to that opposition.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 11, 1921.\n\n551028\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a report received from our District Engineer at Vancouver upon the completion of the Domestic Water Supply System for the Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nIn Appendix \"A\" of this report are given the engineers' recommendations regarding the installation of equipment for fire protection.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.

H. Tredoroff\n\nActing Division Engineer,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nKamloops, B. C.,\nMarch 7th, 1921.\nREPORT\n\nRe- Installation of Domestic Water Supply System\nKamloops Industrial School\n\nSir:\n\nAt the request of Father McQuire, Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School, and after a thorough examination of existing conditions, this office prepared and submitted to the Indian Department, a report covering two alternative schemes, to provide the Industrial School with an adequate supply of water for domestic purposes.\n\nOn November 1st the Indian Department notified this office that they had selected one of the proposals, and requested us to proceed with the installation of the plant as soon as possible.\n\nActing upon this request tenders were called for as follows:\n1) The supply of the machinery\n2) The building of a pump house and the installation of the machinery\n3) The construction of 350 feet of 220-volt pole line and the supply of 2-7 kwh transformers.\n\nThe installation of this water supply system was duly completed and the plant placed in operation on January 7th 1921.\n\nOld Water Supply System\n\nPrevious to the installation of the new plant, the water supply for the Industrial School was obtained by means of a 5 H P gasoline engine, belt connected to a 6\" x 6\" reciprocating pump which supplied about 40 U.S. gallons per minute through a 2\" pipe line, 400 ft length delivering water into two wooden storage tanks located in the school building, and having a combined capacity of 4000 U.S. gallons.\n\n(a) The use of these tanks at such a low elevation was objectionable, as they supplied water at too low a pressure for satisfactory service, and were practically useless in case of fire; while in cold weather it was necessary to supply extra heating arrangements to prevent them from freezing.\n\n(b) The cost of operating this system with gasoline was expensive, and considerable trouble was experienced in keeping the pump operating successfully on account of the high suction lift.\n\n(c) The foundations of the tanks and machinery were found to be in a bad state of repair, and it was considered inadvisable to attempt any reconstruction of the existing system.\nPresent Water Supply System\n\n(Electric Hydro-pneumatic pumping plant)\n\nThe present water supply is obtained by means of a 4\" x 6\" reciprocating double acting pump, belted to a 2 H. P. A.C. 3 phase, 60 cycle, 220-volt induction motor, having a capacity of 1200 U.S. gallons per hour; and delivering water against a maximum pressure of 50 lbs per sq. in., to a steel pressure tank of 1200 U.S. gallons capacity, situated 400 feet from the main building of the Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nThe pump is automatically controlled by an air pressure pilot diaphragm switch operating an electric control switch, so regulated that the pump will commence to operate when the pressure in the tank falls below 22 lbs per sq. in., and pump water until the pressure in the tank reaches 50 lbs per sq. in.\n\nThe water from the pressure tank is delivered to the Industrial School service pipes, direct, by means of a 8\" supply pipe 400' in length, and without the use of any further storage tanks.\n\nThe pressure tank and pump are installed in a concrete and wood pump house near the South Thompson River and extra precautions have been taken to guard against freezing during cold weather by making all the walls of double thickness, the space between them being filled with sawdust.\n\nA shifting valve situated on the outside of the pump casing provides the correct amount of air necessary in the pressure tank and a safety relief valve has been installed in the line between the pressure tank and the supply pump.\n\nThe whole system which requires very little attention to keep it operating satisfactorily is compact and positive in action, and will deliver 20 U.S. gals per minute continuously.\n\nCost of Installation and Cost of Operation\n\nThe total cost of construction of the above water supply system amounted to $912.60 and the cost of operation for the first four weeks after its installation amounted to $2.85 or an average operating cost of $27.00 per year.\n\nRemarks\n\nUpon its completion the above plant was handed over to Father Mcuire for the use of the Kamloops Industrial School, and I understand from him that it has to date given every satisfaction.\n\nUp to the present no adequate provision has been made to guard against the possible outbreak of fire in the school premises and as the school itself and all the surrounding buildings are constructed entirely of wood I have attached to this report an appendix \"A\" dealing with this phase of the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H. MacCull\n\nActing Division Engineer\n\nK. C. Swan, M.E.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\n216 Hastings Street, East,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\nAPPENDIX \"A\"\n\nMemorandum re - Fire Protection\n\nKamloops Industrial School\n\nThe Kamloops Industrial School consists of several frame structures the largest of these being the two main school buildings of two stories each, occupied both night and day by some 40 or 50 pupils and members of the staff.\n\nThese buildings are situated 3 miles from the nearest fire engine station and depend at present for their fire protection on several small hand-operated chemical fire extinguishers located in various parts of the buildings. No hydrants of any kind have been installed for use in case of fire beyond the ordinary water taps in the wash basins and bathrooms.\n\nAny outbreak of fire under existing conditions unless noticed immediately and controlled by one or more of the chemical fire extinguishers would in all probability result in the buildings being completely destroyed, with a possible loss of life among the pupils, for the following reasons:\n\nThe buildings are constructed entirely of wood which has thoroughly dried out from being in use for a long period and are situated in an exposed position subject to high winds at all seasons of the year. They contain narrow passages and steep stairways, and the pupils being situated at night time on the second floor, many of them would be forced to use these means of exit in case of an emergency.\n\nThe first few minutes after the discovery of a fire often decide whether the building can be saved or is to become a total loss and under the present system the only water that would be available in case of fire would have to be obtained in buckets from one or more of the standard 3/8\" taps located in the wash basins and bathrooms.\n\nThe new water supply system can at very little extra expense be adapted for use in the event of fire, and the installation of 4 standard fire hydrants would more than double the present chances of successfully fighting any outbreak which may occur.\n\nThe capacity of the pump supplying water to the Industrial School is 20 U.S. gals. per min. on 2 - 3 inch nozzles so placed as to be available could deliver 80 U.S. gal. per min. from the storage tank, against a fire and maintain the flow for a period of 4 minutes; at the end of this time the pump would commence to operate and deliver a supply of 20 U.S. gals. per min. continuously.\nWith this system a total of 320 U.S. gals. would be available during the first 4 minutes and 20 U.S. gals. per min. thereafter.\n\nIn view of these facts I would recommend that 4 standard fire hoses equipped with 3\" fire fighting nozzles be installed, two in each building and suitably connected to the present water system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Division Engineer.\n\nR.

Deputy and Secretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, April 30, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the Dominion Water Power Branch on the installation of a domestic water supply system which was lately completed under the direction of this Branch at the Kamloops Industrial School, B.C. The report is a recapitulation of the correspondence between this Department and the District Engineer at Kamloops. The total cost of the installation has amounted to $2,912.80, which represents an average cost of $27.00 per year. The Principal of the School is up to date well satisfied with the results of the system.\n\nThe Acting Division Engineer reports that there is at present no adequate provision against a possible outbreak of fire at the school buildings which are entirely constructed of wood, although the new waterworks system can be made available to a certain extent. It is therefore recommended that four standpipes with four standard fire hose equipped with one-half inch fire-fighting nozzle be installed, two in each building. I estimate that the cost of this additional installation would amount to about $200. Will you please advise if this suggestion is to be given any consideration.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nApril 30, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a report which has just been received from the Division Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch at Kamloops with reference to the domestic water supply system at the Kamloops Industrial School, it is recommended that the school buildings be equipped with four standpipes and four standard fire hose, with one-half inch nozzles, two to be installed in each building as a fire protection. In view of the urgent need of this improvement, I would request you to obtain competitive prices for the furnishing of this apparatus and submit the quotations to the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

For the present number of pupils it suffices, but when we multiply by three it will not suffice.\n\nBesides the school land we have at present also the crops from about thirty acres belonging to Anthony Lorne to whom we gave water and for whom with two hundred dollars from the Dept. we have erected a pretty good house.\n\nThe fact is however, that we need more land both for crops and playgrounds.\n\nFor the moment we are leaving the matter in the hands of the Agent, who understands the situation and who is endeavoring to lease from Chief Alice Lorne, Anthony's Uncle, some fifty odd acres which, next to Anthony's place, have been lying idle for years.\n\nMrs. Dallin's idea, which coincided with my own, is that this vacant land be leased from the Chief either by the school or by some of the boys from the Reserve, who are now almost old enough to be discharged from School, and that they like Anthony would be supplied with water from the school pump.\n\nAs stated in previous letters we hold the strategic position in regard to this land for pumping.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McCauley M.S.\n\nDr. D.C. Scott,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\ndone. No does the Agent fare better. Without it his work is confined largely to the settling of little dog fights on different Reserves, but of progress he has practically nothing.\n\nMy interest at present is centered in this work. We are spending millions to bring in settlers from Europe. Why not look after our own who look for nothing else but farm work? This year we asked for a Farm Instructor to aid me and the smile and Agent, for it goes too fast for either him or me to follow. The Department do not see their way clear to do so this year. Very well; there is no rush. All the better probably if the Department seeing clearly the difficulty of securing land, would cooperate gently but solidly with the Agent, the work would proceed all the more rapidly; me, the Agent, the Department and Indians would be making progress in an orderly manner.\n\nIn regard to graduating pupils and land for the school I would be pleased to have your suggestions at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire\n\nDr. D.C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Doctor,\n\nThe question of lands brings to mind the important question of graduating pupils.\n\nWhat do we mean by progress? Or when is it made? Progress is made when a boy from school marries a girl from school and they settle on a well-defined piece of land on the Reserve and establish a family. Let me state my views and the difficulties, for at present this is the most important question facing both us and the Department.\n\nHere are four boys to be discharged in the course of the year:\n\nBasil Francis - no father - mother living - home Kamloops.\nLouis Stewart - mother living at Douglaston.\nRaymond Peters - all over.\nAntoine Michel - father living - no mother. Father doing well farming.\n\nIf discharged tomorrow the first three of these will go to the devil; and you see the reason. Doctor, can this be prevented? Not always, but frequently it can. And what is the first step or difficulty? The first step or difficulty is for the Agent to secure a well-defined piece of land. The Department should strengthen the hand of the Agent in this matter in every way possible.\n\nThe parents clamor for the boy to be discharged. The Principal and Agent agree, let me suppose. The boy goes home. The parents have no place...\nfor him to work and possibly not the means. Then\nthe boy hires out with white people and gives a few\ndollars occasionally to his parents. In other words,\nthe boy or his labor is being exploited both by\nhis parents and his employers. He is helpless.\nWhen thirty-five or so he thinks of settling down, or\nthe chief thinks of giving him some ill-defined corner\nof land, he returns to the Reserve, makes a few frantic\nefforts, and finally resigns to live in a hovel, he and\nhis wife and children ill fed, ill clothed, ill housed,\nand people wonder why children die or are tubercular.\nThere is no rhetoric about this; it happens daily before\nour eyes.\n\nThe sad part of it is that ex-pupils com-\nplain of it in general terms, but they can find nothing.\nWill they work? Why they will work their heads off.\nHere is Anthony Lane with me for nearly three years\nwith his first day yet to come! Louis Stewart\u2014his\nfirst cousin, also a nephew of Chief Elie Lane and Chief\nJohnny Chilhitea. Louis will kill himself working. Louis'\nbrother, Joe Stewart has now been out of school for about\nfour years and neither of his two uncles who are\nchiefs think of bothering about his land.\n\nThe remedy? The Department should use their\nauthority to support the Agent in securing land\nfor pupils. Mr. Dallin is now moving in this\ndirection. Let him do so quietly but effectively. This\nis constructive work; all our work is lost unless it\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\nOttawa, September 2, 1924.\n\nDear Father McGuire:\n\nYour letter of some weeks ago, with reference to the establishment of graduates on the reserve, has not been overlooked.

McGuire, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Sep 30, 1874\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nLet me say in reference to your letter of Sep 2nd-34-1874 that we like your way of dealing. We always know what we are doing; if you can grant a request you say \"yes,\" if you cannot grant it, you say just as emphatically \"no.\" We find this a great advantage; we always know the basis of action. There are no rash steps. Whatever progress is made is solid.\n\nLikewise we wish you to know our position and views. A pump thrown on the side of a river with an electric wire attached is not an irrigation system. The work of the engineers must be revised in view of local requirements and conditions, improved upon, solidified, turned into a permanent system. Who would do this for the Indian people? And who would pay for it?\n\n2. But supposing the pump running: Who should say, \"To-day we will start the pump running.\" Who will divide the water? And especially who will see that every man given water is there to do his irrigation?\n\n3. And at the end of each month who pays for the electric current? Installation is one thing; cost of current is quite a different thing.\n\nThere are difficulties that arise the moment the current is turned on and they mean expense. They call for business abilities not possessed by Indians. These difficulties, however, may be met and\novercome by the Department. And if you were dealing with pupils from the school the first two difficulties would disappear.\n\nBut for us: In a system of that kind could we do much to aid or supervise? I do not think so. To aid we would need under us both the pump and the people. We would then be responsible for all three difficulties. However, this is not connected with the last paragraph; emphatically it is not a suggestion for the Department to confer the pump or its supervision upon us.\n\nHowever, the land West of the school, as far as the main road running North, could be irrigated and supervised from the school, if school pupils were placed upon it. We would then have under us both the pumps and the people. This may look bad from the road, but business in business and facts\u2014well I suppose they are the brute beasts of the intellectual domain;\u2014we cannot control their looks.\n\nBut Kamloops Reserve is only one twelfth of the question. And on the other Reserves the difficulty is for the Indian Agent to secure for the pupil before he leaves school a well defined piece of land. We, then, as a rule can do the supervising. Is this always easy to secure? It is not. We know the difficulties with which you and the Agent have to contend. But as expressed in\na previous letter, any strength you can lend to the authority of the Indian Agent in this matter tends to the progress and betterment of our Indian people.\n\nThis letter goes by the hands of the Agent. Four big boys, and good ones, were discharged during the quarter without us being able to raise a hand to help them settle down on the land. We know the difficulties you and the Agent have; we are not complaining. We simply wish to make our position clear, so as to help you in any way we can to overcome these difficulties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McQuire O.M.I.\n\nDr. Duncan C.

It is possible to leave the present pumping plant as it stands and construct nearby at a cost of $4,200.00, which will bring the combined capacity of the two plants up to 3,000 U.S. gallons per minute; or it is possible to abolish the present pumping unit and remodel the existing pump house so that it will be large enough to house a new unit of 3,000 U.S. Gallons per minute capacity. This will entail a total expenditure of $4,800.00.\n\nIn either case the present well and intake pipe can be utilized, but new discharge pipe must be installed no matter which scheme is adopted. From an operating viewpoint the installation of one pump of 3,000 U.S. gallons per minute capacity will be more economical than the installation of a second pump to bring the capacity up to the required amount, as 75 H.P. will be required to operate a 3,000 gallon per minute pump, whereas the total H.P. required to operate two pumps (one 1,000 G.P.M. and one 2,000 G.P.M.) will amount to 85 H.P. From this it will be seen that if one unit is adopted a continuous saving of 10 H.P. in the operating costs can be effected over that of the double unit installation.\n\nMoreover, there will be available for disposal by sale or use on some other location,\n\n1 1,000 U.S. gallons per minute centrifugal pump;\n1 25 H.P. 200 volt, 3 phase, 60 cycle, squirrel cage, induction motor, complete with starter switches, overload and low voltage release; and\n1 set of 2200 volt--220 volt step-down transformers.\n\nA very conservative estimate of the value of the above equipment which will be available for disposal would be $500.00, as no pumping unit of 1,000 gallons per minute capacity similar to the above can be obtained at the present time in this locality, even second hand, for less than this amount.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter above referred to, I have the honour to submit the following report:\n\nThere is, approximately 160 acres, more or less, of land, which might be brought into the scheme suggested by Rev. Father McGuire. The Indians residing on, or owning these lands are: Anthony Larue, Elie Larue, Alex Leonard, Mrs. Lou Leonard and Old Maggie.\n\nAnthony Larue has, approximately 30 to 40 acres, upon which he has recently built himself a nice little house with the assistance rendered him by the Reverend Father.\n\nChief Elie Larue has 70 acres, more or less, which land lies absolutely dormant as Elie does nothing at all in the way of cultivating his land. He has on the place, a rather dilapidated log house.\n\nAlex Leonard owns some 40 acres, more or less, but has no buildings on the place. He advises me that he is willing to allow his land to be utilized for the benefit of the ex-pupils from the school.\n\nMrs. Lou Leonard has some 20 acres, more or less, from which she cuts hay.\n\nOld Maggie has some 10 to 15 acres, but no buildings, and uses this land for hay purposes.\n\nNow, in the event of the Department entering upon a scheme such as suggested by Father McGuire, I would suggest that Anthony Larue be allowed to remain on his own piece of land, which he would continue to work, under the supervision of the Reverend Father.\n\nElie Larue would not be willing to give his land, but I would suggest that, in view of the fact that Chief Elie is a sick man, and not liable to be able to do any work should he live very long, of which I am doubtful, I respectfully submit that in lieu of the land taken away from him for this scheme, that the Department allot him a small piece of land on the other side of the main road, and build for him on this piece of land, a small house, in which he and his wife might reside more comfortably than they can in the present building, which is far from sanitary or comfortable.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIt is possible that some objection may be raised to the installation of one unit in place of two, owing to the difficulty of apportioning the operating costs between the various water users and from the fact that a comparatively large amount of water must be handled any time irrigation takes place; but these objections are of minor importance and by careful arrangement can be easily avoided. Moreover, the efficiency and simplicity in operation of the one plant over that of the two combined plants is so great that I have no hesitation in recommending the installation of one 3,000 U.S. gallons per minute pumping plant in place of two smaller ones.\n\nAttached hereto are Appendix A and Appendix B showing estimate of cost of each proposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E.H. Tredcroft\nDivision Engineer.\n\nH.F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nMr. Scott,\n\nUpon your request of Nov. 5th the Dominion Water Power Branch have submitted an estimate of the cost of enlarging the present irrigation pumping plant at the Kamloops Industrial School, in order to irrigate a piece of land which has an area of approximately 160 acres, and which is owned by five Indians, where it is suggested to settle some of the pupils leaving the Kamloops School, in accordance with a scheme suggested by Rev. Father McGuire. To carry out this project it is necessary to purchase sixty acres of this land at a maximum cost of $15.00 per acre, and to expend a sum of about $300. for the removing of one of the Indians who is very old and sick to a more convenient location, where a small house will have to be erected for him.\n\nThe project which I consider the most satisfactory consists in the replacing of the present pump which has a capacity of 1000 U.S. gallons per minute, by one of 3000 U.S. gallons per minute. This will require the remodelling of the existing pump house, where the following machinery will have to be installed to take the place of the existing ones:\n\n1 - 75 H.P. motor, to operate a 3000 U.S. gallons per minute double suction centrifugal pump. The present water supply pipe will have to be replaced by a 16\" wood stove on a length of 800 feet. The cost of this new installation, including the repairs to the pump house, new fittings such as valves, increasers, etc., labour and freight, will amount to $4,800. By allowing this change it will enable the Department to dispose of by sale or otherwise the present motor, pump and transformers, which are estimated at a minimum price of $500.00.\n\nThe other scheme which has been considered by the Dominion Water Power consists in the construction nearby of an auxiliary pumping plant, having a capacity of 2000 U.S. gallons per minute, which can be operated jointly with the present one at a cost of $4,200.00.\n\nAfter considering both schemes I think that the latter would not prove an economical proposition.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nThe Secretary,\n\nAlex Leonard, I would respectfully submit, should be compensated for his land, if the Department decides to utilize this piece in the scheme, in the sum of from $10.00 to $15.00 per acre.\n\nMrs. Lou. Leonard, I submit, might be compensated in the same way.\n\nThe piece of land referred to as belonging to Old Maggie, the Reverend Father does not consider taking into the scheme at the present time, so that, for the time being, she would be out of the question.\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith, a copy of a report made by Mr. E.H. Tredcroft, Divisional Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Board, Kamloops, which is self explanatory, and from which you will notice he recommends the installation of a new pump in Appendix \"B\" attached, to replace the present pump at the school, otherwise, as you will notice, it will be necessary to have a dual pumping system, which Mr. Tredcroft explains would not be as efficient, although the same ends would ultimately be reached.\n\nTrusting that the information given is what is required, and awaiting your instructions in the matter,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Enclosed please find linen tracing of the proposed system and the land suggested to be brought under the scheme outlined.\nOttawa, Jan. 18, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, together with a copy of a report furnished you by Mr. Tredcroft, C.E., of the Dominion Water Power Branch at Kamloops, on the proposed enlargement of the present irrigation pumping plant at the Kamloops Industrial School, in order to irrigate a piece of land where it is suggested to settle some of the ex-pupils of the Kamloops School.\n\nIn view of the practical results which would be derived from the enlarging of this irrigation system you may again bring this question to my attention in the course of next year, when it might be possible to give the matter further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLennan,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the suggestion of appropriating a piece of land to the west of the Kamloops Residential School, for the purpose of establishing pupils on holdings of their own upon their discharge from school, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that Basil Francois, a pupil at present in the school is due for discharge on the First of April next, and Rev. Father McGuire is very anxious to have a piece of land laid aside for this boy, in order that he may establish himself before he leaves school and starts running amuck on the Reserve or in town, owing to the fact of his not having any definite place to settle upon.\n\nAs stated above, the Rev. Father is very anxious that this boy should be allotted a piece of land, forty (40) acres more or less, just west of the school, the same piece to be taken out of the 70 acres at present held by Chief Elie Larue, referred to by me in my letter of December 17th, 1924.\n\nRev. Father McGuire agrees to run irrigation water on to this piece of land from the school pump, until such time as the whole scheme is definitely decided upon, but before I can allot this piece of 40 acres to Basil Francois out of this 70 acres at present held by Chief Elie Larue, which at the present time is lying dormant, I must have some offer to make Chief Elie Larue in compensation for the piece of land which it is suggested should be taken into this scheme for ex-pupils.\n\nAs the Spring is fast drawing on, and the boy is due for discharge, I would appreciate it very much if something definite could be decided upon before it is too late, in order that we may place the boy and get him working before he allows himself to drift, as is the case with such a large number of ex-pupils.\n\nYour further instructions in this matter at an early date, will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe Rev. Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School and Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing are anxious to commence the colony of ex-pupils near the school. You will remember that the scheme as a whole demanded so heavy an expense for irrigation, that it has had to stand for a while. There is a promising graduate whom Father McGuire wants to settle on 40 acres close to the school and he is willing to irrigate this parcel from the school pump until such time as a decision is made concerning the general scheme. The 40 acres is at present held by an old chief, who is not working the land; and Mr. Helmsing in earlier communications intimated that we would have to allot the old man a parcel of land on the other side of the main road and build for him and his wife a small home, which would cost approximately $300. I expect there would be considerable expense also in the establishment of the graduate Basil Fran\u00e7ois. I should be pleased to have your instructions.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the proposal to establish Basil Francois, who is about to graduate from the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I note that the Rev. Principal is willing to irrigate 40 acres to the west of the school for this boy. I regret that the Department cannot give a decision until you estimate the cost of this undertaking. Please inform me what will be necessary to start this graduate and what will be the costs of placing Chief Elie Larue on another lot. The Deputy Superintendent General wants to give the Kamloops ex-pupil scheme very favourable consideration; but, as our funds are extremely limited, it will be necessary to know something concerning the expense before authority can be directed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDear Agent:\n\nBasil Francis and Raymond Peter of this Reserve are asking for land. Both wish to join us with Antoine Larue here at School. They want land from Chief Elie Larue west of the School so that we may give them water.\n\nElie has raised nothing on this land for ten years. If you take this land from him, which he is not working, and give him some compensation for it, surely you are doing him no wrong. You are simply giving the boys a chance to make good.\n\nWhat the compensation should be you know as well or better than I.\n\nWhat should you give these two boys? Give them enough to fence their land, probably about one hundred and fifty dollars. It is time enough to talk house when they are married and need it. They will appreciate things far more if they have to earn them as Antoine did.\n\nWill they succeed? I cannot say. But give the boys a chance. It costs little or nothing. If it succeeds; well and good. If it fails; there is nothing lost. We will provide water and supervision from the School.\n\nBut we do need a decision at once if we intend to do anything this year. If you can see your way clear to address these lines with your own ideas added, to Dr. Scott, I think we would be safe in leaving the decision in his hands. Any pumping or irrigation scheme could be discussed later. Let us try first with what we have.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the matter above referred to, and my letter of April 16th, enclosing copy of letter received from Rev. Father McGuire, C.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School, I have the honour to submit herewith copy of a second letter received this morning from Rev. Father, with the request that I forward it to the Deputy Superintendent General for his consideration.\n\nWith reference to the questions asked in your letter of April 9th, I beg to submit that upon receipt of your letter, I took the matter up with the Rev. Father, and ascertained from him that Daniel Francis has a small piece of land, comprising from 10 to 12 acres, situated on the west side of the main road, quite a distance from the industrial School. It is suggested that this piece of land might be given to Chief Elie Larue, together with a house 16'x 24' which might be built on this piece of land and occupied by Chief Elie Larue and his wife and family in return for the 70 acres lying immediately west of the School, which it is suggested might be taken into the scheme for the settling of ex-pupils.\n\nUpon taking the matter up with the Rev. Father, he assures me that a house 16'x 24', two storeys high with brick chimney, containing two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs, could be built for the sum of approximately $700.00, and this, in my opinion, together with the 10 or 12 acres of land mentioned, would be ample compensation for Chief Elie Larue for the 70 acres now held by him, and which I understand, he has not used in any way whatsoever for the past ten years, or thereabouts.\n\nI might further add that the log house referred to in my letter of December 17th, which was situated on this 70 acres belonging to Chief Elie, was completely destroyed by fire on New Year's Day last, so that he no longer even resides on the 70 acres.\n\nFor the time being this is the only piece of land which the Rev. Father suggests should be taken into the scheme, more or less as an experiment to find out as to whether or no the ex-pupils will take advantage of this opportunity offered them. Should the scheme work well, as we have no doubt it will, we might then go deeper into the question regarding the taking over of more land, and the installing of an irrigation plant at the school such as was suggested by Mr. E.H. Tredcroft, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, of December 13th, 1924, a copy of which was enclosed in my letter of December 17th, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, April 28, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to placing Basil Francis and Raymond Peter, graduates of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, on land near the institution.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 9th instant, the Deputy Superintendent General wishes to give this expupil scheme very favourable consideration; but it has been pointed out that a $700 home is too large a compensation to Chief Elie Larue for his improvements and rights to the 70 acres in question. Could you not arrange with this chief to give a quit claim deed in favour of the two graduates for a more reasonable amount? You might intimate how many there are in the family of Chief Larue and what arrangements have already been made for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nThe Secretary.\n\nApril 17, 1925\n\nWith reference to the two boys, Basil Francis and Raymond Peter, who are now discharged from the School, but who are remaining at the School under the supervision of the Rev. Father until such time as a decision can be reached in this matter.\n\nThe Rev. Father suggests that the 70 acres at present belonging to Chief Elie Larue might be divided into two 35 acre plots, more or less, and that assistance should be given to the two boys to fence their respective 35 acres. Rev. Father McGuire agrees to irrigate these two plots from his pump at the school for the time being, and put the boys under the instruction and supervision of Mr. Webb, who has been employed by the School as a Farming Instructor, pending the decision by the Department as to whether or no they are going to employ a man to instruct these ex-pupils set on these various lots.\n\nThe two boys, Basil Francis and Raymond Peter will work on their own places and in return for labour given to Rev. Father, he will lend them the school team and implements to work their respective places, and also assist them in the building of their houses when such time arrives that the two boys get married and live on their places. At such a time, an application might be made to the Department for financial assistance in the sum of $250 each towards the erection of a house, the building of which would be done by the boys with the assistance of the Rev. Father in return for any work in which they might assist him.\n\nIt will therefore be seen, provided the Department approves of the suggestion to appropriate the 70 acres belonging to Chief Elie Larue as suggested above, that a sum, not exceeding $1000.00 be granted, to be divided as follows:- $700.00 to Chief Elie Larue and the 10 or 12 acres at present owned by Basil Francis but distant from the School, the remaining $300.00 to be utilized in the fencing of the 2-35 acre plots to be made out of the division of the said 70 acres, one for Basil Francis and one for Raymond Peter.\n\nIf the Department can see its way clear to authorize me to go ahead along these lines and subdivide this land for the purposes above mentioned, we can then try out the experiment. Should the scheme fail, we need not go any farther, but on the other hand, should it prove successful, we might enlarge the proposition and extend it also to other Reserves, and thus place male ex-pupils on plots of land of their own before they get into indolent ways. Your instructions are awaited.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCOPY.\n\nINDIAN SCHOOL\n\nAt Kamloops, April 17, 1928.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nWe are forever asking you for lumber to repair irrigation flumes which fall apart in a few years. Every Spring brings its own story.\n\nWe secured forms for making cement twenty inch pipes, and where possible, we propose to put in cement, not only to replace flumes, but to prevent seepage in our main ditches. We will make these pipes ourselves from time to time. It costs thirty five cents a foot for cement.\n\nAt present we wish to put in about four hundred and twenty feet of it where the ditch passes through under the road leading to the main building. It would save us also the trouble of asking planks for the bridge. One Hundred and fifty dollars would pay for the cement.\n\nYou would oblige us by presenting a request to the Department for this amount at once as the flume and bridge are worse than we expected to find them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nMr.:\n\nI beg to attach herewith copy of letter received at this office from Rev.

Father estimates that if he were authorized to expend a sum of $100.00 in the purchase of cement, that he could repair all the culverts and parts of flumes referred to, providing the labour, gravel and sand himself.\n\nThe letter attached is self explanatory, and I submit the same for your consideration and trouble.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH.F.

There are three ways of securing it, viz: 1. To buy a ranch; 2. To secure some Reserve land west of the School; or 3. To increase our present arable land by draining the lake on our land in front (South) of the School. Of the last proposition I wish to speak at present.\n\nBy putting in a dike on the South river bank and another West of the Lake, the lake itself could be drained. At least we think so, and it would be worth trying as it would add some twenty-five acres to our arable land. The cost would be trifling as we could do the work ourselves.\n\nBoth dikes would be on the Reserve. It would necessitate buying of four or five acres from them.\n\nThe water comes into the Lake from the South Thompson and from the West from the North Thompson flooding most of the Reserve land west of the school and enabling the Indians to cut from it a little wild hay. They fear if the break in the bank at the south were diked, sufficient water to flood their land would not come in from the west. To my mind the water is of the same level at both ends.\n\nAs we have high water here in May and June when the flooding occurs, kindly request the Department to have the Water Power Branch here make the observations necessary here next month. It would furnish definite information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach herewith copy of letter received from Rev. James McGuire, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, which speaks for itself.\n\nIf possible, I would recommend that the Department request the Water Power Branch to make the observations referred to during the high water period this Spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, April 28, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter sent to Indian Agent Helmings by Rev.

It is high time to settle the point. You would oblige me much by letting me know the mind of the Department on this matter.\n\n1. There are some twenty acres in the Lake mostly on the school property, partly on Reserve land. It might be drained and used. I hope that before the end of the month the Water Power men will make the observations requested.\n\n2. There are some fifty acres West of the School belonging to Chief Elie Larue and some twenty more belonging to Mrs. Lew Leonard, which have not been worked for years; it lies under our height of pump line.\n\n3. There are some two hundred acres about a quarter of a mile up the South Thompson above our property, and on the opposite side of the River for sale. It could be had for something between eight and fifteen thousand. It would require the extension of our power line and the installation of a pump.\n\nLand is land to us, no matter from whom it is acquired, but land near the school like these three properties naturally has more value. However, you know the good relations which exist between the Indian people and the School and between them and the Indian Agent, and knowing moreover as you do, how very touchy the Indians here are in regard to their land, you realize why I should be pleased to learn the attitude of the Department in regard to a piece of land such as 3, which would obviate difficulties with the Indians.\n\nAny information on this subject would oblige me greatly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsley,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter this day received from the Rev. James McGuire, O.M.I., of the Kamloops Residential School, which speaks for itself.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nN.F.

Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School with reference to the advisability of securing more land for the institution. I should be pleased to have your recommendation also in this connection; and, so that the Department can give more intelligent consideration to the request, I am asking you to indicate on the enclosed plans the situation of the three parcels mentioned in the Rev. Principal's communication.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the above matter, I beg to state that I have, on several separate occasions, taken the matter up with Chief Elie Larue, regarding this piece of land in question, but he will not commit himself to any definite statement. He merely takes the \"dog in the manger\" attitude. He will not work the land, neither will he countenance any other parties working the land.\n\nIf the Department considers taking over this 70 acres in question, and compensating Chief Elie, I most respectfully submit that a sum not exceeding $700.00 is a very fair valuation, as land such as the land in question, cannot be purchased elsewhere for much less than $10.00 per acre.\n\nSince writing the Department, however, I have another suggestion to submit and that is, under Section 90, sub-section 3 of the Indian Act, the Superintendent General can grant authority for the leasing of lands which any individual Indian neglects to cultivate.\n\nIn this respect I beg to submit that Rev. Father McGuire, Principal of the Industrial School is willing to enter into a lease for the said 70 acres for a term of ten years at an annual rental of $240.00 per year payable at the Indian Office Kamloops. If the lease for ten years should be granted, the Rev. Father is willing to fence the 70 acres and irrigate the same and place the two boys, Basil Francis and Raymond Peter, mentioned in my previous correspondence on the piece of land. I most respectfully submit that I be authorized to enter into a lease with the Rev. Father McGuire, for a term of ten years on the above understanding.\n\nAs the season is advancing, I would ask you to advise me at as early a date as possible as to whether or not I am authorized to enter into this agreement or not.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, June 2, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you recommend that 70 acres held by Chief Elie Larue be leased to the Kamloops Indian Residential School for the use of ex-pupils for a term of 10 years, at an annual rental of $240, under Section 90 (3) of the Indian Act. This action commends itself to the Department and you may enter into this agreement without delay. Please explain to Chief Elie Larue the nature of the action, the authority for the same and the compensation of $240 per annum which will be paid to him by your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Father's letter of May 11th, are outlined in red and marked 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n\nAs suggested in the Rev. Father's letter, provided the Department can see its way clear, scheme No. 3, is more favoured than the other two, particularly No. 2, for the reasons stated in the Rev. Father's letter, as he does not wish to create any unpleasant feelings between the school and the Indians by taking land from Chief Elie Larue or anybody else.\n\nIn view of these circumstances, I most respectfully submit that the suggestions contained in my letter of May 26th be laid in abeyance until the Department has definitely decided which of the three plans it prefers to adopt.\n\nYou can readily see that as soon as the new school is completed, the land already allotted to the school will be insufficient for the upkeep of the full 250 pupils which it proposes to have in residence at the school, consequently more land must be obtained for the school sooner or later, and the best time to have this matter settled is before the actual time required, which I anticipate will not be more than twelve months hence.\n\nIf there is any further information required which I can give, I shall be only too pleased to do whatever I can to further the project either one way or the other.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F.

James McGuire, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, for the leasing of 70 acres, more or less of the holding of Chief Elie Larue of the Kamloops Band, which I was authorized to do by the wire and letter above referred to.\n\nYou will note that the lease is computed from the First of August, 1925, and renewable for a period of ten years. The date of expiration of November 1st, 1935. In explanation of these two dates not corresponding, I might state that the expiration date has been made the First of November, in order to give Rev. Father McGuire sufficient time to take off for the season 1935, as you will readily see that should the lease expire on the first of August, 1935, there is a possibility that his harvest might not be removed from the premises by that time, consequently, I have allowed three months' additional time for the removal of the crops, and as it is altogether likely that, with the sanction of the Department, the Rev. Principal will again renew the lease, it is really immaterial what date the lease expires.\n\nAs stated above, I am forwarding the lease in quadruplicate for the signature of the Deputy Superintendent General, and I would ask you to return three copies to this office after signature has been attached, in order that the Rev. Father might have a copy in his possession and one copy to Chief Elie Larue, and the third copy to keep on file in this office.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nN. F.

Three copies of this lease, properly signed by the Deputy Superintendent General and witnessed, are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nIndian School\n\nKamloops, B.C., August 31, 1925.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nWith our extra piece of land, and the land belonging to Antoine Larue, we need an extra water supply for irrigation. As we stand at present our pump gives only water enough for the school land of about seventy acres; with about one hundred acres extra, which are necessary for our huge increase of children, we require a plant which will deliver about three thousand gallons per minute.\n\nKnowing as you do, how our entire food supply depends on the water supply, you will realize why we request that this matter be given immediate attention. It would be a costly thing to postpone it until the Spring. It should all be complete in November. It will require two months after the order is given before this machinery can be delivered, hence the necessity of acting at once.\n\nHoping you may find your way clear to lend to this matter the consideration it demands,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCity.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, copy of a letter this day received from Rev. Father McGuire, Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, making application for additional water supply for irrigation purposes.\n\nI take it that this matter will have to be handed over to the Water Power Branch for investigation, and I might state that I have on hand, a considerable amount of data, collected by the Rev. Father, with reference to the question of pumps suitable for his purposes, which information I should be very pleased to hand over to the Water Power Branch if it would be of any value to them in coming to a decision in the matter.\n\nYou will note that the Rev. Father asks that the matter be given immediate attention, in order that he may have the necessary water available early next Spring for his crops, and I would therefore request the Department to cause early investigations to be made with this end in view.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication you have received from the Rev. Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, with reference to the advisability of increasing the pumping plant so that 5,000 gallons of water per minute can be used for irrigation purposes and relative to the necessity of securing permission to take the extra water. I am writing to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn today, asking him to make application for the water. A note will be made for next year's Estimates, in connection with the new machinery that will be necessary if the scheme is to be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, Sept. 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to official letter No. 116659-22 of April 4, 1919, in which you were requested to ascertain at the office of the Comptroller of Water Rights whether it is necessary to obtain a license to pump from the South Thompson River all the water required for irrigation purposes at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I regret that I am unable to find your answer to this letter, and, as the Department is considering increasing the capacity of the present plant from 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per minute, it will be necessary to have on our files a record concerning the success of the application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nW. H. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo referring to a letter written to me on the 4th of April, 1919, in which I was requested to ascertain from the Comptroller of Water Rights whether it was necessary to obtain a licence to pump water from the South Thompson River for irrigation purposes at the Kamloops Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in looking over my file on this matter I find that I did not answer your communication of the 4th of April, 1919, as after learning from the Water Comptroller that it would be necessary to obtain a licence, I wrote to Mr. R.G. Swan, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, Vancouver, furnishing him with a copy of your letter and also informed him that the Comptroller of Water Rights had stated that a licence would be necessary. I, therefore, asked him if he would have the necessary papers in connection with the obtaining of the licence made out.\n\nOn the 19th of April, Mr. Swan replied that the papers would be filled out and forwarded to me within the course of a few days and the advertising and posting of notices would be done in Kamloops. Upon enquiry at the Provincial Water Rights Branch, I learn that no application for the pumping of water from the South Thompson River was ever filed and, consequently, no licence would be issued. I have now asked Mr. Balls, Assistant Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, to attend to this matter and as soon as some information is received\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nreceived going to show just how much water is to be pumped and what area of land is to be irrigated, applications will be filed for water licences in this regard. If you can supply me with the necessary information I wish you would do so at once in order that the matter may receive early attention.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nOttawa, October 22, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the obtaining from the Comptroller of Water Rates a licence to pump from the South Thompson River the water required for irrigation purposes at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to inform you that the Department is giving consideration to a scheme involving the supplying of 3000 gallons of water per minute. Mr. Agent Helmsing can supply full information regarding the area of land to be irrigated. Please communicate with him with reference to the matter and arrange to obtain the necessary water licence as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.

There is an item in the estimated budget for it.\n\nIn a letter of concurrent date I am asking the Agent to consult with the Department and to devise ways and means calculated to insure its timely installment. The matter is of such vital importance to us that I am asking you to give it your personal attention. In a word, if the Department cannot order the pump, advise me to do so and reimburse me later. The idea is to order the pump at once, as delivery will require at least two months. Delay will be disastrous.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames McGuire O.M.S.\n\nMrs. J. D.

The Rev. Principal has now written, urging that a pump be ordered without delay as it will be some two months before delivery could be made. The Department cannot take this action until we are certain that the necessary water licence will be obtained. Please let me know how the matter stands at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, January 14, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to ordering a pump for the proposed enlarging of the irrigation system at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn has applied for the necessary water licence and I am today writing to ascertain how the matter stands at present. As soon as the Department is assured of water rights, consideration will be given to ordering machinery without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. James McGuire, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B. C.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Jan. 7, 1926.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nWe ploughed, fenced and put fertilizer on some sixty acres of rented land last fall, besides paying rent on it. Lack of water on this land during July would simply mean disaster; we would lose the rent, fencing, labor and a large part of necessary provisions. For many things we can afford to wait; for irrigation delay is disaster. Three years ago the Department gave us twenty inch pipe to form an intake to our well. So fundamental and vital is irrigation for us here that we spent over two hundred dollars besides over an entire month's labor in installing these intake pipes in cement and in digging a new well and cementing it to be ready for the increase in water supply which we knew would be necessary in the near future.\n\nIt seems that funds for the installation of a three thousand gallon pump will be forthcoming in the estimates. The question naturally arises: Will it be in time for this year? Now is the time to make sure of it. Delay here is disaster.\n\nThe prices and descriptions of these pumps are now in the hands of the Water Power Branch. The first step to take is to decide upon a pump, because it will require at least two months for the execution of the order. If the Department cannot see their way clear to place an order, it might be better for me to do so. If the order is given only in April, it will be too late.\n\nYou will oblige me by bringing this matter before the Department and asking them to give it due consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nM. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nSir,\n\nI beg to attach herewith copy of letter received from Rev. Father McGuire, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, for your information.\n\nYour instructions in the matter are awaited.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with further reference to the matter of acquiring a water licence from the Comptroller of Water Rights for water to be used at the Kamloops Residential School, and note that you say the Department can not take any action with regard to expenditure for the additional area proposed, until it is certain that the necessary water licence will be obtained.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there is not the slightest doubt but what a licence will be issued for as much water as required, as the pumping will have to be done from the South Thompson River which is one of large volume. It will be impossible, however, to obtain a licence until such time as we are in a position to show on our application how the water is to be delivered on to the land and how distributed. The area to be irrigated must also be shown on the application for a licence.\n\nUp to the present I am not in possession of any report from the Dominion Water Power Branch on this subject, though Father McGuire, the Principal of the School, some little time ago, furnished me with a pencil sketch showing an additional tract of 108 acres to be brought under cultivation through the enlargement of the present pumping plant, but no particulars were given. This area comprises two blocks of land of 75 and 30 acres respectively belonging to Chief Eli Larue and some arrangement was being made for the acquisition of this. This property is on the Indian Reserve which is West of the area set aside for the School.\n\nI understand that Engineer Tredcroft, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, at Kamloops, was instructed last year to make a report on proposed drainage of a small lake on the South West corner of the School property with the idea of bringing more land under cultivation, but this lake is not within the area which the Principal now desires irrigated. No report from Engineer Tredcroft for the draining of the lake has been received so far, as it was necessary to take observations at periods of both high and low water, but Chief Engineer Webb is now asking him to give this matter his immediate attention.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have today received from Chief Engineer Webb Engineer Tredcroft's report of June last on a proposed water supply for the School to augment the old system, but this is only for a supply of water for domestic and fire fighting purposes. This report was forwarded to the Department some months ago. Mr. Webb, however, has no knowledge of any further requirements for irrigation purposes, and I have been wondering if this matter has been taken up with the Dominion Water Power Branch by you as is customary. If this has not been done, it should be attended to without delay. In the meantime, in order that we may have some definite information to go on, I have asked Mr. Webb to instruct Engineer Tredcroft to go to the School and see just what the Principal requires and then to make up a sketch showing the land at present irrigated under the pumping plant installed some years ago as well as that which is proposed to be irrigated under an increased pumping plant. When this has been received, we will be in a position then to make application for a licence covering the necessary amount of water.\n\nWith regard to Engineer Tredcroft's report on the domestic and fire fighting system, I should like to know what conclusions you have come to regarding the installation of the proposed works, which will involve an expenditure of $8,500.00. If it is intended to go ahead with the work, a water licence will have to be obtained also to cover this and an application could then be made out for sufficient water for both irrigation and domestic purposes, though nothing would stand in the way of obtaining two licences, one for irrigation and one for domestic use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, Feb. 16, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has under consideration the enlargement of the irrigation system at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, B.C., also the installation of a domestic water supply system and fire fighting apparatus for this institution. According to a report submitted by Commissioner Ditchburn the additional area which it is proposed to irrigate comprises two blocks of land of 75 and 30 acres respectively. The quantity of water which will be required for the water supply system can be determined by referring to a report (No. 520) sent here last July, prepared by Mr. Swan in March 1921.\n\nBefore authority is given to Indian Commissioner Ditchburn to order the necessary machinery for the irrigation system, the Department would like to obtain the necessary license from the British Columbia government for the additional quantity of water which will be required for both systems. As I understand that some sketch plans will have to be furnished together with application for water rights, I would like to know whether your District Engineer would undertake the necessary procedure, in co-operation with Indian Commissioner Ditchburn, in order that this matter might be expedited.\n\nI might say that it is not the intention of the Department to proceed with the installation of the water work system this year, but it is intended to provide the necessary funds in the near future for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Further, it is likely that the Department will ask the Dominion Water Power Branch to have their District Engineer undertake the purchase and installation in this connection. I might state that I have officially requested the Director of the Dominion Water Power Branch to let me have a report concerning the proposed extension of the irrigation system.\n\nRelative to Engineer Tredcroft's report on the domestic and fire fighting system, I have to inform you that the Department hopes to carry out his recommendation when the last wing of the building is erected. At the present time there are no funds for the purpose. You may make application for the water required in this connection when you are dealing with the irrigation license.

(See accompanying plan)\n\nOf this total, an area of 82 acres only may be described as being suitable for agricultural purposes, and for the following reasons:\n\n(1) An area of land amounting to 97 acres is too steep and at too high an elevation to be irrigated economically.\n\n(2) An area of land comprising approximately 45 acres has too sandy soil to allow of profitable cultivation.\n\n(3) An area of land amounting to 42 acres is flooded at high water by the overflow from a small lake situated on the school property immediately north of the South Thompson River. (See accompanying plan)\n\n(4) An area of land amounting to 17 acres is occupied\nacres is occupied at the present time by the school buildings and for general farming purposes.\n\nKAMLOOPS INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL PROPERTY UNDER CULTIVATION\n\nThe total amount of land, the property of the Kamloops Industrial School, which is irrigated and under cultivation at the present time comprises an area of 75 acres.\n\nPRESENT WATER SUPPLY\n\nWater for irrigation purposes at the Industrial School is obtained at the present time by means of a 1,000 U.S. g.p.m. centrifugal pump, direct connected to one 25 H.P., 220 volt, 3 phase induction motor.\n\nThis pump, which is situated in a wooden pump house on the north bank of the South Thompson River, supplies water from the river through 340 feet of 8\" diameter wood stave pipe to distribution ditches, situated as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nThe capacity of this pump, i.e., 1,000 U.S. g.p.m., is sufficient to supply an area of 100 acres of land.\n\nADDITIONAL LANDS OPERATED BY THE KAMLOOPS INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nIn order to overcome the shortage of land and to provide a sufficient area for farming purposes, the principal of the above school (The Reverend Father McGuire) has entered into a private arrangement with two Indians who own land immediately adjoining the school property on the west boundary, whereby an area of land, amounting in all to 80 acres, is leased from them by the school and operated.\nschool and operated for the benefit of the above institution.\n\nThe Indians who have entered into this agreement are Eley and Anthony, and the areas leased to the school by each of them are as follows:\n\nEley 50 acres\nAnthony 30 acres.\n\nTOTAL AREA OF LAND AT PRESENT OPERATED BY THE KAMLOOPS INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nFrom the above it will be seen that a total area of agricultural land amounting to 162 acres is at the present time being operated by the Kamloops Industrial School for the benefit of this institution, and that in addition to the above certain lands surrounding the lake situated on the Kamloops Industrial School property, comprising an area of 25 acres and which are flooded during the high water period, are utilized for grazing purposes after the high water has receded.\n\nThese lands, while they are not suitable for agriculture on account of their being flooded annually, nevertheless afford good pasture during the late summer and fall months, and must be taken into consideration when the area of land available for mixed farming purposes is being considered.\n\nThe situation in this regard may therefore be summarized as follows:\n\nAgricultural Land\n\n| Description                          | Acres |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|\n| Industrial School property           | 62    |\n| Land leased from Eley                | 50    |\n| Land leased from Anthony             | 30    |\n\nGrazing land\n\n| Description                          | Acres |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|\n| Flooded lands adjoining lake         |       |\n| available for pasture during         |       |\n| summer and fall months               | 25    |\n| Total                                | 187   |\nTOTAL AMOUNT OF LAND NECESSARY FOR ABOVE INSTITUTION\n\nIn view of the fact that the Kamloops Industrial School is an educational institution and that the great majority of its residents are therefore pupils, it becomes necessary, when deciding on the amount of land which should be set aside for school use, to provide an area of sufficient size which will permit a herd of dairy cattle being maintained in order to supply milk for school consumption.\n\nAdditional land must also be set aside for the production of vegetables, small fruits, etc., for use in this institution.\n\nAssuming, then, a total of 250 persons (mostly children) resident in this school, the number of milk cows which must be maintained permanently throughout the year in order to supply sufficient milk each day for school needs will amount of 36 head, and the area of land required to grow feed for this number (alfalfa roots, silage, etc.) will amount to approximately 90 acres.\n\nThe area of land which should be provided for the raising of vegetables and small fruits (including potatoes, carrots, cabbage, corn, etc.) should not be less than 45 acres, making a net total in all of 135 acres.\n\nTaking into consideration that the labour used for farming purposes in this institution is supplied to a large extent by the pupils themselves, working under the direction\nworking under the direction of the members of\nthe staff, and therefore does not represent the\nmaximum in efficiency, and that the soil of the\nland available is not of the best quality, but\nmay be described as being \"rather light\" and\nthat a certain amount of rotation of crops, fall-\nowing of land, etc., must be practised in order\nto secure the best results, it would be advisable\nto increase the above amount by an additional 25%\nwhen calculating the area necessary to provide\nsustenance for the above institution.\n\nOn this basis, a total area of 162 acres\nshould be sufficient to provide all those commodi-\nties for school consumption which it would be\neconomical to produce, as follows:\n\n| Land necessary for the maintenance |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| of 35 head of dairy cattle         |\n| 90 acres                          |\n\n| Land necessary to produce vegeta-\n| bles, small fruits, etc. for     |\n| 250 persons                      |\n| 45 acres                         |\n\n| Additional 25% (rotation of      |\n| crops, fallowing of land, etc.)   |\n| 27 acres                         |\n\nTotal 162 acres\n\nFrom the above figures it will be\napparent that the total amount of irrigable land\nnecessary for the above institution will amount\nto 162 acres, whereas, under the present system\n(i.e., the leasing of lands from the Indians)\nthe total amount available at the present time\namounts to 162 acres, which area does not include\nthe 25 acres of pasture land situated immediately\nsurrounding the school lake, previously mentioned\nin this report.\n\nThe above statement of the amount of\nland necessary for the use of this institution\nmay be considered as being a conservative estimate.\n\nThe area recommended\nThe area recommended, 362 acres, is sufficiently large to permit of a certain amount of wastage in cultivating the land, which is only to be expected in the operation of an institution of this kind.\n\nIt should also be borne in mind that, as the produce grown is produced primarily for the use of the school, a poor or blemished crop of potatoes, corn, etc., need not necessarily be lost, as would be the case if same had to be offered for sale in the open market, but may be consumed in the above institution, with no appreciable wastage.\n\nShould the Department decide that the arrangement whereby additional lands are leased from the Indians for use of the school by the Reverend Father McGuire is unsatisfactory, and decide to provide sufficient land for school purposes, independent of outside arrangements, an additional area of 80 acres would have to be acquired.\n\nMETHODS WHEREBY AN ADDITIONAL AREA OF 80 ACRES MAY BE ACQUIRED FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES-\n\nFour methods by which an additional area of 80 acres of land can be provided for school purposes may be considered, as follows:\n\n(1) The purchase by the Department of 80 acres of land somewhere in the vicinity of Kamloops, outside the Indian Reserve property, and the irrigation of same by pumping or other means.\n\n(2) The purchase or appropriation of 80 acres of land, the property of Riley and Anthony, which is\nAnthony, which is situated on the Indian Reserve immediately west of the Industrial School property, and the transfer of Eley and Anthony to some other part of the reserve.\n\n(3) The allotment of 80 acres of any vacant lands situated on the Indian Reserve to the Industrial School for farming purposes, and the irrigation of same by means of pumping, etc.\n\n(4) To drain the lake situated on the school property and by this means to reclaim from flooding and render fit for cultivation an area of land including and immediately surrounding this lake amounting to 57 acres, 37 of which would be on school property, the remaining 20 acres being part of the Indian reserve, and to allot these 20 acres to the Industrial School.\n\nThe above proposals may be dealt with in their order, but as each proposal requires water for irrigation to be supplied by pumping, a study of the power situation in the Kamloops District and the bearing which this situation has on the supply of power for irrigation must first of all be considered.\n\nPOWER SITUATION\n\nPower is supplied to the City of Kamloops and vicinity by a municipal hydro-electric plant situated on the Barriere River at a distance of forty miles north of the City of Kamloops.\n\nThis plant, which has a rated capacity of 2,000 H.P. is assisted during peak loads by an auxiliary steam plant having a capacity of 1,000 H.P.\n1,000 H.P.\n\nThe hydro-electric plant, which has now been in use for a period of twelve years, is in very bad condition and considerable trouble is experienced each year in maintaining the water supply.\n\nThe wooden flume which carries this supply from the dam to the powerhouse has been in use longer than was originally intended, and is constantly being carried away, which necessitates the almost constant operation of the steam plant to supply the power which has already been contracted for by the city.\n\nFor this reason, the municipality has refused to enter into any further contracts for the supply of electric power for new enterprises, until such time as arrangements have been made to increase the present power supply.\n\nAt this date there does not appear to be any prospect of conditions improving for a period of at least two years.\n\nThese conditions apply most strictly to any new applications for power, but it is possible to make arrangements for a slight increase in the size of an existing plant where it can be shown that such an increase is necessary and desirable, but that increase in power will only be supplied at a rate equal to the cost of production by steam plant, i.e., $3 per Kilowatt hour in place of $1\u00bd per Kilowatt hour, usually charged for hydro-electric power in this vicinity when supplied for pumping purposes.\nPROPOSAL NO. 1 -\n\nThe purchase by the Department of 80 acres of land somewhere in the vicinity of Kamloops, and the irrigation of same by pumping.\n\nThe proposal would require the Department to purchase the land at an estimated cost of from forty to fifty dollars per acre and to provide water for irrigation by means of either a Beisel, semi-Beisel or gasoline engine, as no electric power is at present available for such an enterprise.\n\nThe first cost of these engines is high and their operation compared to electric power comparatively expensive.\n\nMoreover, pumping by this means must still be regarded as being in the experimental stage and it is extremely doubtful if farming operations could be carried out successfully under these conditions by this institution.\n\nThe purchase of a Beisel or other type of engine and the installation of pump, pipes, flumes, etc., to irrigate a small area of 80 acres would not, in my opinion, be an economical investment, and should not be undertaken by the Department at the present time.\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 2 -\n\nTo purchase or appropriate for school purposes 80 acres of land, the property of Eley and Anthony, situated on the Indian Reserve west of the Industrial School property, and the transfer of Eley and Anthony to some other part of the reserve.\nThis proposal is the one which, in my opinion, would eventually prove to be the most satisfactory.\n\nBy this means, the school would be provided with sufficient land for all agricultural requirements.\n\nThis land would be self-contained in one unit and possible of easy irrigation by means of an enlargement of the present pumping plant.\n\nThe power situation with regard to lack of power would not apply in this case, as the existing plant may be increased in size without any undue trouble.\n\nThe two Indians who are concerned in the case, Eley and Anthony, could be compensated financially by the Department for the loss of their present holdings and allotted land on some other part of the reserve where the operations which they would carry out (i.e., dry farming) would be exactly similar to those which they are practising at the present time.\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 3.\n\nThe allotment of 80 acres of vacant land situated on the Indian Reserve to the Industrial School for farming purposes, and the irrigation of same by means of pumping.\n\nThis proposal is open to the same objections as is Proposal No. 1, i.e.,\n\n(1) The lack of available power supply at the present time.\n\n(2) The high first cost of installing any other type of pumping plant to serve a small area of...\narea of 80 acres.\n\nThis proposal should not, in my opinion, be considered by the Department except as part of a general scheme to irrigate a large portion of the reserve.\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 4 -\n\nTo drain the lake situated on school property and by this means to reclaim from flooding and render fit for cultivation an area of land including and immediately surrounding the lake amounting to 57 acres, 37 of which would be on school property, the remaining 20 being part of the Indian Reserve, and to allot these extra 20 acres to the Industrial School.\n\nProposal No. 4, which is the one most strongly recommended by the principal of the Industrial School (The Reverend Father McGuire) would necessitate the construction of two dykes, one situated on the Indian Reserve and the other on the Industrial School property. (See accompanying plan).\n\nThe total area which would be reclaimed by this method would amount to 57 acres, or 23 acres less than the extra amount required for agricultural purposes by the Industrial School.\n\nThe above project, while it has the appearance of being feasible, is nevertheless open to many objections and no definite assurance could be given by an engineer with regard to its ultimate success.\n\nThis project may now be reviewed in detail as follows:\n\nThe lake situated on the Kamloops In-\n\ndustrial School\nIndustrial School property contains an area at low water of 17.5 acres and is subject to flooding at high water by the overflow from the North and South Thompson Rivers, which enters the low-lying ground on the Kamloops Indian Reserve through two channels, as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nThese channels, while they are comparatively narrow at their entrance, are situated a considerable distance apart, and a large area of land, comprising approximately 210 acres, is flooded at high water and rendered unfit for cultivation.\n\nA suggestion has been made that certain lands immediately surrounding and including this lake can be reclaimed by a system of dyking (see accompanying plan) and that the lands thus drained, comprising an area of 57 acres, can then be used for farming purposes by the Industrial School.\n\nWhile the engineering features involved in such a project would not in themselves present any special difficulty, (entailing only the construction of two earth dykes, the installation of drain pipes, outlet valves, etc.) certain other considerations affect the situation, and a study of the rise and fall of the South Thompson River and its relation with regard to the behaviour of the lake itself is necessary before this scheme can be proceeded with.\n\nFor purposes of comparison, the elevation of ordinary low water in the South Thompson River may be taken as 0.00 and the elevation of\n\nordinary high water\nordinary high water may be taken as 14.00, giving an average rise of 14 feet.\n\nThe elevation of ordinary high water in the lake itself is the same as that in the South Thompson River, i.e., 14.00, but the elevation of ordinary low water in the lake is 8.00, giving an average fall of only 5 feet.\n\nFrom this it will be seen that average low water in the lake remains at an elevation of 8 feet above the average low water in the South Thompson River.\n\nThat is to say, that after the water in the South Thompson River has receded or fallen below the elevation of the inlet channel, the water surface in the lake ceases to fall rapidly.\n\nThis condition of affairs would indicate that the lake bottom is impervious, i.e., will not be affected by sub-surface seepage after it has been drained.\n\nThis indication, however, cannot be taken as final, for test pits dug in the surrounding ground show that the soil surrounding this lake between the lake shore and the river bank and situated between low water elevation of the lake, 8.00, and high water elevation, 14.00, to be composed of a porous mixture of alluvial silt, i.e., sand, gravel and other sediment, which would not give the appearance of being water-tight.\n\nIt is quite possible, therefore, that after the dykes had been constructed, water might find its way through some underlying porous strata situated between and connecting the lake with the river shore, and render useless the reclamation work which had been carried out; or in any event make it necessary.\nmake it necessary for drainage by pumping to be resorted to during the high water period.\n\nWhile it is my opinion that this work if undertaken would prove satisfactory and no great amount of seepage would occur, as stated previously in this report, the condition of affairs is such that no engineer should be asked to give a definite assurance that the project would be a success, and any reclamation of this land by the methods proposed should be regarded by the Department in the nature of an experiment, and due allowance made for a possible loss.\n\nAnother feature which would have to be taken into consideration is that the average elevation of the surface of the river bank along the north shore of the South Thompson River is 18.00 and that the elevation of ordinary high water in the South Thompson River is 14.00, a difference of only 4 feet.\n\nShould we therefore experience at any time in the future a year of extreme high water (i.e., a rise of 5 feet above ordinary high water) such as has been experienced in the past, the water would overflow the banks in spite of any dykes which might have been constructed.\n\nAs these banks in the vicinity of the lake are extremely narrow, this flooding would undoubtedly result in other and larger channels being cut in them and these channels would require to be dyked again after the high water had receded, which would necessitate additional expenditure.\n\nAn examination of the accompanying plan will show that\nwill show that the logical method of reclaiming this land, if reclamation is going to be carried out, would be to dyke both channels, one dyke being situated near the east bank of the North Thompson River in the immediate vicinity of the Canadian National Railway right-of-way, the other being situated at the channel immediately south of the present lake.\n\nUnfortunately, no water for irrigation purposes is available for this part of the Indian reserve, and the Indians therefore depend upon the flooding of these lands in the spring for the raising of hay during the summer, and any suggestion which includes the installation of dykes near the Canadian National Railway or the closing of the culverts situated beneath the public highway has to date met with strong opposition from them, and for this reason has not been considered further.\n\nCOST OF PROPOSAL NO. 4 -\n\nThe cost of constructing two dykes as outlined in Proposal No. 4 (see accompanying plan) and the installation of drainage ditches, pipes, outlet valves, etc., would amount to $3,000.00, but this amount would be considerably exceeded should it be found after the dykes had been constructed that sub-surface seepage existed; for it would then be necessary to provide pumps for drainage purposes during the high water period, and the size of these pumps and their cost would depend upon the amount of water which it would be necessary to handle.\n\nREMARKS RE PROPOSAL NO. 4 -\n\nIn view of the above conditions, it is my opinion that\nmy opinion that Proposal No. 4 contains a certain element of risk with regard to possible sub-surface seepage; and while this element of risk should not be overrated, it would be well to give it due consideration, together with the possible expense which might be incurred should a year of extremely high water be experienced in the future, and the north bank of the South Thompson River be flooded, thus forming new channels between the river and the lake.\n\nIn addition to the above, the area which would be reclaimed by this means would amount in all to 57 acres and the estimated expenditure would be $3,000.00, equal to a net charge of over fifty dollars per acre, which amount does not include the expenditure necessary to provide water for irrigation purposes on this area.\n\nFor these reasons I would not recommend that this project be proceeded with unless it is considered by the Department to be the only one which would prove satisfactory to them.\n\nRECOMMENDATION-\n\nAfter careful consideration of the existing conditions, I would hereby recommend that Proposal No.2 as outlined in this report be adopted by the Department, and that the two Indians concerned, Eley and Anthony, be compensated for their loss and transferred to some other part of the reserve, and that their present holdings be allotted to the Kamloops Industrial School for use by that institution.\n\nShould the Department\nShould the Department, however, consider this arrangement to be unsatisfactory, I would respectfully recommend that the whole situation be allowed to remain in abeyance until additional electric power is available for pumping purposes in this vicinity, or until such time as some other portion of the reserve is placed under irrigation when additional land can then be provided for school use.\n\nIn addition to the above, I would also recommend that arrangements have now been entered into by the Kamloops Industrial School whereby additional land is leased from the Indians for agricultural purposes at this institution, thus making the total area of land available for cultivation 162 acres instead of 82 acres (school property), that the present pumping plant, which has a capacity of 1,000 U.S. G.P.M. only, be replaced by a pumping unit having a capacity of 2,000 U.S. G.P.M. at an estimated cost of $3,540.00, and that this work be carried out immediately in order that sufficient water for irrigation purposes may be available during the coming season.

March 10, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 154-0-9.\nAttention: Departmental Engineer.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of February 16 regarding the additional area required for irrigation purposes at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith a report prepared by Mr. Treforcroft regarding the lands available for agricultural purposes in the neighbourhood of this school.\n\nYou will note that a recommendation is made for an increase in the pumping equipment at an estimated expenditure of $3540. If it is the intention of your department to proceed with this pumping installation I shall be glad to have your instructions in regard thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving reference to the matter of increasing the pumping capacity at the Kemloops Indian School in order that an area of land comprising 80 acres, which Reverend Principal McGuire has leased from Chief Eli Larue and an Indian named Anthony, may be brought under irrigation, I beg to say that I have received from District Chief Engineer Webb, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, a very comprehensive report of Engineer Tredcroft on this subject. I expect by this time you will also have received a copy of this report from which you will observe the Engineer has gone into the matter from several different angles and has set forth four different proposals as hereunder.\n\n1. The purchase by the Department of 80 acres of land somewhere near Kamloops (apparently outside the Reserve) and irrigating the same by pumping.\n\n2. The purchase or expropriation of the 80 acres of land which the Rev. Principal already has under lease from the Indians above named, which land adjoins the Kemloops School allotment.\n\n3. The purchase of 80 acres of land in some other portion of the Reserve.\n\n4. To reclaim 57 acres of land at present covered by a small lake, 37 acres of which are on the School allotment and 20 acres on the Reserve proper.\n\nOf the four proposals, Engineer Tredcroft has given extremely good reasons why No. 2 is the most practical and economical at the present time, and I most certainly concur with him in his conclusions, except to say that it may be doubtful if the Department can afford to purchase the 80 acres of leased land at the present time. It would, however, be much more satisfactory to ultimately purchase this land outright.\n\nTo carry out this proposal it will involve the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ninstallation of a pump having a capacity of 2,000 U.S. g.p.m. to replace the present one which has a capacity of 1,000 U.S. g.p.m., which together with the necessary amount of wood stave pipe, other materials, labour, freight charges, etc. will cost $3,540.00. As against this amount, the Engineer estimates that $850.00 may be obtained by the Department for the pumping plant already in use.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, that proposal No. 2 be adopted and acted upon. As the expenditure to be created is in connection with the Kamloops Residential School, the charge should be against the Indian Education Vote, and if there are funds now available from this source, it would be most desirable to authorize the Dominion Water Power Branch to purchase the machinery and material before the end of the present month. The work of installation could then be taken in hand during April and May, and the land would be ready for irrigation early in June. This point, I think, is important in view of the fact that it is predicted that we are going to have a very dry summer in the irrigation districts, due to the lack of rain and snow during the winter and, consequently, there being little moisture in the ground.\n\nWith regard to obtaining a water licence for this School, I now beg to inform you that application has been filed with the Comptroller of Water Rights for 500 acre feet of water for the Kamloops School to be pumped from the South Thompson River. This amount will be ample to cover all requirements for irrigation as well as those for domestic use and fire-fighting purposes, when the last wing of the School has been constructed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Pitchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 24, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch has presented a report concerning the irrigation of more land at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. The recommendation, in which Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn concurs, is that the 80 acres of the reserve next to the school, now under lease, be irrigated. Mr. Ditchburn states there is not the slightest doubt that water licence, for which he has applied, will be granted, and he recommends the early purchase of machinery and installation, so that the additional acreage can be cropped this year.\n\nThe cost is stated by the Division Engineer to be $3540, less $850 which will result from the sale of the present pumping machinery. There is an item in the Estimates of $4000 for this purpose, and I wish to recommend that the Dominion Water Power Branch, which has already offered to do the work, be asked to proceed with it forthwith.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to thank you for your 30/4/6788 of the 8th instant, advising the Department to carry out the recommendation of District Engineer Tredoroff in connection with increasing the area of farm land at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, i.e., the securing of approximately 80 acres of the reserve to the west of the school, at present held by Chief Ellie Larue and Anthony Larue, and its irrigation by increasing the institution's pumping capacity. The Department Engineer concurs in the recommendation of Mr. Tredoroff, and the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that the work be proceeded with without delay. Funds for the purpose are available during the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch is being asked to undertake the purchase and installation of the larger pumping unit, at an estimated cost of $5,540, and to dispose of the present pump, motor, transformer, suction pipe and fittings. It is understood that the school authorities will be responsible for the labour necessary in the preparation of ditches and flumes. A copy of this communication is being directed to Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing for the information of the Rev. Principal and himself.\n\nAt a later date, steps can be taken to secure for the permanent use of the school the land on the reserve at present held by Anthony Larue (approximately 20 acres) and Chief Ellie Larue (approximately 50 acres). Section 11A of the Indian Act could be used in this connection, if necessary.\n\nI am pleased to learn that you have applied for a licence for sufficient water to cover all requirements for irrigation, and for domestic use and fire protection purposes for the completed building. I note in your 30/4/6800 of January 26th, last, that there is not the slightest doubt your application will be successful. As you have been informed, the Department hopes to carry out the District Engineer's recommendation concerning the domestic and fire fighting water system when the third wing of the building is erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School with the information therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Kelmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, March 31, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, together with a copy of a report on the area of land available for agricultural purposes in the vicinity of Kamloops Indian Residential School, etc.\n\nAfter giving the contents of this report due consideration, the Department has decided to proceed at once with this irrigation work, in the manner outlined in the last paragraph of this report, page 10, at the estimated cost of $5,540.00.\n\nShould it be possible for your District Engineer at Kamloops to undertake for this Department the supervision of this irrigation work, I would ask that arrangements be made as early as convenient for the purchasing of the necessary machinery and the disposal of that which will not be required in this new work. It will be necessary that tenders be invited for all materials, as mentioned in Appendix \"A\" of the report, and these should be submitted to this Department for consideration and the placing of the order.\n\nIt is understood that the school authorities will be responsible for the furnishing of the necessary labour for the construction of ditches and flumes and other manual labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean,\nActing Deputy\nand Secretary,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 7, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo advising me of the urgent need of proceeding with the installation of the proposed new irrigation work in connection with the Kasloeps Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware a report on this question was prepared by the Dominion Water Power Branch, which suggested four different proposals. After giving each scheme due consideration, the Department has decided to proceed with the proposal consisting of the replacing of the present pumping machinery by new units of greater capacity at a cost of $3,540.00. The necessary authority was therefore given on the 31st of March to the Director of the Dominion Water Power Branch to arrange with the District Engineer to obtain competitive prices for the purchasing of the necessary machinery and the disposal of the present ones which will not be required in the new work. This authorization was given with the understanding that the school authorities would take the responsibility for the furnishing of the necessary labour for the construction of the ditches and flumes, also for any other manual labour required for the above mentioned work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Holcomb,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nREV. FATHER JAMES MOGUINE, O. M. I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nKAMLOOPS, B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nAttention - Departmental Engineer.\n\nI have received your letter of March 31st, in which authority is given for the installation of an enlarged pumping unit in connection with irrigation requirements at Kamloops Industrial School and the disposal of the existing pumping machinery outlined in the report submitted to you on March 10th last.\n\nInstructions have been given to our District Chief Engineer at Vancouver to have the work put in hand in accordance with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter above referred to regarding extra land for the Kamloops Residential School, as far as taking the lands at present owned by Anthony Larue, is concerned, I have nothing to say, as Anthony is at present working at the school for wages, and the Rev. Father is working his (Anthony's) place on terms agreed upon between them both. Anthony has a house on his place and lives there with his family, so that I do not anticipate it will make much difference to him, at all events, as long as feelings between Anthony and the Rev. Principal are amicable. Should the feelings between them change at any future date, Anthony may cease to work at the school, and would then require his own place. Having this possibility in mind, suitable compensation should be allowed him.\n\nRegarding Chief Ellie Larue's land, it is different. In my letter of April 9th, 1925, I recommended compensation to Chief Ellie Larue in sum not exceeding $700.00, and $300.00 to fence off two acres which at that time the Rev. Father intended using for Basil Francis and Raymond Peter, two ex-pupils of the School. In addition to this $700.00, ten or twelve acres of land were to be allotted to Chief Ellie Larue in lieu of the land taken from him. This plan did not meet with the Department's approval.\n\nAgain, in my letter of May 26th, 1925, I recommended that a ten year lease be drawn between the Department and the Rev. Father, from which Chief Ellie Larue receives $20.00 per month rental for use of his lands. This suggestion was made upon the Rev. Father agreeing himself to the plan.\n\nI have had considerable trouble with the Chief over this lease, and only within the past two months have I been able to get him to actually agree to the same. Everything is now progressing very smoothly between this office and Chief Ellie Larue over this lease, and in my opinion, it would be very regrettable to upset the harmony by the land being taken from the Chief, at any rate before expiration of the 10 year lease on November 1st, 1935, and then, taken only after suitable compensation has been made to him.\n\nI am writing this letter, as I feel in my own mind that should this land be taken from these Indians, at any rate before expiration of the lease, there will be trouble between the Chief and this office. Respectfully submitted.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[N.F. Helminger]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your K-16-754 of the 31st ultimo, and I note that it is advisable not to take immediate steps to secure for the permanent use of the school the land on the reserve, at present held by Chief Elie Larue. There is no need for early action in this connection, as it can safely be left until the expiration of the ten year lease.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDear Doctor,\n\nI am writing to make a suggestion concerning the letter dated March 25, 1926.\n\nLet me begin by saying to you, who understand, instead of to others who might not, that if the land and improvements of Anthony Larue are taken for the school without first making proper provision for him, myself and the school will receive a blow from which we will never recover. Anthony cares little; he works hard; he stands for me; he stands for the school; he stands for the Department. He is a tower of strength for you and for me. Indian people, who fought him and his policy, which was inspired by me, of remaining at school, now come to him for advice.\n\nAnthony will do anything for you or for me. In substance, he has said to me repeatedly: \"Father, I don't care what land I have as long as it is under your ditch.\"\n\nChief Eley Larue and Mrs. Leonard are uncle and aunt respectively to Anthony. The latter has twelve acres lying West of Eley's land and under our ditch and which like Eley's land is lying idle owing to lack of water.\n\nMy suggestion is: Either take those twelve acres and Eley's for the school and leave...\nAnthony entirely alone; or, take Anthony's and Eley's for the school and give Anthony the twelve acres belonging to Mrs. Leonard and the eight acres off the West part of Eley's. The second alternative would entail the building of a house and digging of a well in lieu of those he would lose. If you supplied the material the school management would be responsible for the labor.\n\nYou can see the importance of dealing first and fairly with Anthony. Better by far for me to lose eight acres than to lose Anthony, good will and that of the Indian people.\n\nTrusting that you will give me protection in this matter,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\nJames McGuire O.M.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nOttawa.\n\nOut.\n\nIf time and my failing health serve me, I will write you further on cognate matters.\n\nJ.M.\nOttawa, April 15, 1926.\n\nDear Father McGuire:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, concerning the property near the Kamloops Indian Residential School, at present held by Anthony Larue. I wish to assure you that no steps will be taken to secure this land for the use of the school, without first conferring with you and without making adequate provision for Anthony. I believe that this land should some day be used solely for school purposes; but, for the time being, the Department will do nothing to interfere with your arrangements with this Indian.\n\nI have already informed Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing that there is no need to take immediate steps to secure the land of Chief Elie Larue. This action can safely be left until the expiration of the ten year lease.\n\nAfter the pumping machinery is installed and you are irrigating more land, if you find you require property still farther west of Elie's land, it is possible that steps to this end can be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Tredcroft\nDivision Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nKamloops, B.C.\nJanuary 20, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inform you that in accordance with instructions received from your office construction of a sewage disposal plant for the Kamloops Industrial School was undertaken by this office, and that the sewage plant has been duly completed, the following being my report thereon:\n\nINTRODUCTION -\n\nThe new Kamloops Industrial School, which is being built in three sections, is at the present time only partially completed, the east wing and centre portion having been finished, while the west wing has yet to be constructed. When finished, this institution will be capable of housing 250 persons.\n\nSEWAGE SYSTEM -\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION -\n\nThe sewage system was designed to take care of a flow of\nof a flow of sewage amounting to 10,000 U. S. gallons per day, or 40 U. S. gallons per capita per diem; this amount being equal to the average daily consumption of water per head in institutions of this kind. It is what is known as the septic tank sub-surface irrigation system, and consists of a reinforced concrete septic tank connected by means of a sewer pipe with two disposal beds composed of 4\" diameter open-jointed land tile, laid 3'6\" below the surface of the ground. The original intention was to lay this land tile at a depth of 18\" only below the surface to provide better aeration of the soil, but the nature of the ground was found after excavation had been commenced to be such that a greater depth was considered necessary.\n\nSEPTIC TANK -\n\nThe septic tank, which is constructed of reinforced concrete, is situated at a depth of 3 feet below the surface of the ground to avoid danger of freezing. It is divided by a wall into two compartments, one called a settling chamber, which is the septic part of the tank, and the other called a siphon chamber, in which the effluent is collected and intermittently discharged to the disposal beds.\n\nThe settling chamber is of the following dimensions: 15' x 7' x 9'6\" deep, and is connected by means of a 3 foot overflow weir with the siphon chamber having the following dimensions: 15' x 7' x 6'6\" deep. This siphon chamber is equipped with an automatic siphon which discharges when the effluent in the chamber reaches a depth of 3'6\"; and therefore discharges four times a day under normal load.\n\nThe settling\nThe settling chamber has a capacity of 5,900 U.S. gallons, equal to 13 hours flow, and the detention period is therefore 13 hours, with a rate of flow through the chamber of 6\" per hour.\n\nDrains have been provided in each chamber to permit of the tank being emptied and cleaned when required.\n\nVent pipes, manholes, ladders, overflow pipe, etc., have been provided and arranged as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\n**SEWER PIPES**\n\nThe sewage is carried from the school by means of four 4\" diameter vitrified sewer pipes to the main inspection chamber which is situated 85 feet from the school. From this point it is transferred by means of one 8\" diameter sewer pipe to the septic tank. On each of the two outside sewer lines additional concrete inspection chambers have been installed, close to the school building, to provide against a possible stoppage in the pipes at this point. (See accompanying plan).\n\n**INSPECTION CHAMBER**\n\nThe main inspection chamber is of reinforced concrete and so placed that it is equi-distant between the school and septic tank. All pipes entering this chamber are laid on straight lines and even grades to allow of easy cleaning should the pipes at any time become clogged.\n\n**DISCHARGE PIPE**\n\nThe discharge pipe from the septic tank to the disposal beds is 6\" diameter vitrified sewer pipe, 210 feet in length.\n210 feet in length, laid to a grade of .005 and is straight and free from bends. It is called upon to discharge approximately 2500 U.S. gallons every four hours and is large enough to ensure the effluent reaching the farthest part of the disposal beds, thus avoiding oversaturation of the ground at any place.\n\n**DISPOSAL BEDS**\n\nThe disposal beds, which are two in number, consist of 4\" diameter land tile laid to conform with the contours of the ground on a grade of .003 and 3'6\" below the surface of the ground.\n\nThe east bed consists of 2,000 lineal feet of land tile, while the west bed comprises 1,500 lineal feet. (See accompanying plan.) These two amounts in all make a total length of 3,500 lineal feet, which amount is less than it was originally proposed, the reason being that the excellent nature of the ground which was encountered at a depth of 3'6\" made it unnecessary to install the full amount.\n\n**CONSTRUCTION**\n\nConstruction of the above plant was carried out by contract under the supervision of this office, the contractors for the plant being The Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Company of Kamloops, B.C., and the time occupied in completing the work amounted in all to a total of 77 working days.\n\n**COST**\n\nThe total cost of the above project amounted to $3,313.28, whereas the original estimate called for an expenditure of $3,700.00\n\n**REMARKS**\n\nThe above work was carried out during the months of\nmonths of October, November and December, 1924, and has at this date been in constant use for a period of 12 months, during which time it has apparently given every satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H.

This work was completed in December 1924 at a total cost of $3315.28 and appears to have given every satisfaction to date. The estimated cost was $3700, the difference being due to the fact that it was found possible to reduce the area of the disposal beds owing to the nature of the soil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

H. Tredcroft,\nDivision Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and\nReclamation Service,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nApril 7th., 1926.\n\nINTRODUCTION-\n\nSir:-\n\nIn accordance with instructions contained in your telegram of the 15th ultimo, I visited the Kamloops Industrial School and carried out an investigation having reference to the unsatisfactory operation of the drainage system which was provided in the new building to take care of the drainage water from the laundry, and in this connection I would report to you as follows:\n\nPRESENT SYSTEM-\n\nDisposal of the drainage water from the laundry at the Kamloops Industrial School is carried out at the present time by means of a drainage pit.\na drainage pit situated on the west bank of the South Thompson River in close proximity to the school buildings (see accompanying plan), and which is connected with the laundry by means of a 4\" diameter drain pipe.\n\nThe drainage pit, which has the following dimensions: 6' x 4' x 4' deep, is situated at a depth of 4' below the surface of the ground, and is of concrete construction, with the exception of the roof, which is composed of 4\" x 6\" timbers.\n\nMETHOD OF OPERATION-\n\nDrainage water which gathers in the drainage gutter situated in the laundry itself is transferred by means of the 4\" drainage pipe to the drainage pit, in which compartment it is permitted to stand until such time as dissipation takes place by seepage.\n\nREASONS FOR OPERATION-\n\n1. Owing to the high concentration of soap which is present in this water after it has been used in the various washing machines, satisfactory operation of the drainage pit is prevented after a short time through the surface of the ground in the pit becoming covered with a film of soap which effectually prevents further seepage.\n\nWhen this occurs, the pit becomes filled with stagnant water which rises to the surface and, percolating through the ground, overflows into the South Thompson River in the immediate vicinity of the intake of the school domestic water supply.\nwater supply and at a short distance above the intake of the City of Kamloops water works.\n\n2. No method was provided by the designer whereby the drainage pit could be cleaned other than by removing the 4' of earth situated on the top of this pit and emptying same by means of buckets.\n\n3. The drainage pit is situated in a light clay soil which is unsuitable for good drainage.\n\n4. The pit is situated within 50' of the west bank of the South Thompson River, which distance is less than that which is required by the various health regulations relating to the pollution of streams, and, as stated above, is in close vicinity to the intake of the domestic water supply for the school.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS RE HANDLING OF LAUNDRY WATER:\n\nWaste water containing a high concentration of soap, as in the present instance, is extremely difficult to handle by sub-surface drainage.\n\nAny drainage pit which might be provided would require to be constantly cleaned at short intervals, the nature of the water being such that after a short period of use the ground through which seepage ordinarily takes place becomes covered with soap which penetrates as much as 6\" below the surface of the ground, thus preventing a satisfactory run-off.\n\nWhen this condition of affairs occurs during the winter months while the ground outside is frozen and covered to a depth of from one to three\none to three feet with snow, it is extremely difficult to provide a way whereby this water can be disposed of, and for this reason it would, in my opinion, be wise to abandon the sub-surface method of disposal and handle this drainage water by a system of surface irrigation, i.e., to transfer this water to some part of the Industrial School property at a safe distance from the school buildings so that it will not prove injurious to health or become unsightly and where it may be applied to land that is continuously under cultivation and which is being ploughed, harrowed, etc., regularly.\n\nThis method is the one that is most usually adopted for waters carrying a high percentage of soaps, fats, etc.\n\nA system of the proposed type, i.e., surface drainage, would cost but little more than the installation of additional and larger drainage pits and will require practically no attention.\n\nThis system will operate equally well during the winter as during the summer months, and if properly installed will be free from bad odours, will not become unsightly and will in no way affect the agricultural value of the land to which the water is applied, as the soap under such conditions acts only as a fertiliser.\n\nFor the above reasons I would hereby recommend that a system of surface irrigation be installed as outlined below.\n\nDESCRIPTION-\n\nThat a concrete drainage pit having the following\nthe following inside dimensions: 5' x 5' x 6',\nbe constructed below the school laundry immediately beneath the present floor and that this pit be connected by means of a 3\" diameter drain pipe with the present drainage gutter situated in the laundry.\n\nWaste water which will collect in this pit can then be handled by means of a small electrically-operated, submerged type sump pump which will deliver this waste water through 200 lineal feet of wood stove pipe to a point situated on the high ground in front of the school buildings and marked \"A\" on the accompanying plan.\n\nFrom this point the water will be conducted by gravity through 420 lineal feet of 4\" diameter drain tile and used for irrigation purposes on the school garden.\n\nThe pump, which will operate against a total head of 28', will have a capacity of 20 U.S. g.p.m., and will be controlled automatically by means of a float situated in the well and will commence and cease operation when the water in the well reaches a certain height.\n\nBoth the discharge pipe and the land tile will be buried at a depth of 2' below the surface of the ground in order that they may not become unsightly after long use.\n\nCOST-\n\nThe cost of the above system, including purchase of machinery, construction of concrete drainage pit and installation of discharge pipe and drain tile, etc., will amount to $425.00.\nCOST OF OPERATION-\n\nThe cost of power for operation of the above disposal plant, assuming 2,000 U.S. Gallons of laundry water to be handled each week, with power supplied at 1\u00bd per Kilowatt hour, will amount to approximately 6\u00bd per month.\n\nRECOMMENDATION-\n\nAfter a careful study of conditions at the Kamloops Industrial School, I would hereby recommend that a disposal system by pumping as outlined in this report be installed as soon as possible to take care of the waste water resulting from laundry operations at the above institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Our standard 8\" pump has the capacity you require and being a pump of the non overload type it is capable of handling the situation even should the discharge head be reduced to zero when connected to a 40 HP motor. You will note that whereas the maximum static head under which this pump will have to operate is 50 ft., we have allowed a total head of 55 ft. which we believe is sufficient to take care of pipe friction; at the same time we might mention that the pump and motor we are quoting on is capable of delivering the required quantity of water against a total head of 58 ft. when driven by 40 HP motor running at 1150 RPM.\n\nShould you desire 10\" pipe and fittings strictly in accordance with your specification, please add $185.00 to the above figure.\n\nThe equipment quoted on could be delivered at Kamloops within approximately seven (7) weeks from receipt of order.\n\nAt the time of writing we are unable to give you full characteristic curves for this pump but would say that these are now in the mail to us and will be forwarded to you immediately on receipt of same.\n\nTrusting that we may be favoured with your esteemed order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

Horizontal Split Case Double Suction, Single Stage Volute Pump with bronze runner rings and sleeves, mounted on cast iron extended base, and direct connected, by means of flexible coupling, to a 50 H.P., type H.S. Westinghouse Squirrel Cage Induction Motor, 3 phase 60 cycle, 2200 volts, 1750 R.P.M. full load speed, 1800 RPM no load speed, complete with type K.one pedestal auto starter equipped with no voltage release attachment, two pole, dash-pot type inverse time limit overload relay and oil.\n\n26 Lineal ft. 10\" diameter C.I. suction pipe with flanged connections, as follows:\n\n- 2 - 8' lengths\n- 1 - 10' length\n\n- 1 - 10\" 90 deg. long radius C.I. flanged elbow\n- 2 - 10\" 45 deg. standard C.I. flanged elbows.\n- 1 - 10\" to 12\" C.I. flanged increaser\n- 1 - 10\" iron body gate valve\n- 1 - 10\" foot valve and strainer\n\nall necessary bolts and gaskets for connecting above fittings.\n\nPrice f.o.b. Kamloops .................. $2160.00\n\nDelivery 7 to 9 weeks from receipt of order.\n\nThe attached specification sheets W-999-B fully describes the pump, and we have marked in the overall dimensions of the unit with motor attached.\n\nWe are also enclosing dimension sheet No.H-5010, and circulars No.H7003 and H-7002, applying to the motor and starter.\n\nWe have made the following computation of total head conditions as follows:-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9, part 2)\nSuction\n\n1 - 10\" Foot valve 2.35' Friction\n16' - 10\" C.I.

We would suggest that if possible at all the pump should be set at a lower elevation, preferably at a point so that the suction lift cannot exceed 18' to 20'.\n\nThis would put the floor of the pump-house below high water elevation, but the floor and walls of the pump-house could be made of concrete, and the walls raised high enough so that water could not enter under extreme high water conditions.\n\nWe believe this added expense would be many times paid for by the more satisfactory operation of the pump. We are most anxious to have the pump give utmost satisfaction, and what we have said applies to all centrifugal pumps, regardless of design or make.\n\nYou will note also that there is a friction loss of 2.35' in the 10\" foot valve. This amounts to almost\n10% of the total suction lift and is rather high. In order to avoid friction in foot valves we have found it good practice to use at least one size larger than the suction pipe calls for. In this case the difference in cost, between using a 10\" foot valve and a 12\" foot valve, would be $20.50.\n\nIt is quite possible, however, that the extreme low water condition will seldom come into effect during the pumping season, and if this is true, what we have said with regard to lowering the suction head may be disregarded.\n\nThe 10\" pump offered will deliver 2000 U.S. gallons per minute at 1750 RPM against a total head of 61' including not over 20' suction lift. The efficiency would be 75% requiring 40.6 brake H.P.\n\nIf it were possible for you to lower the pump where the suction lift would not exceed 18', we could offer you an 8\" Worthington, type O.S. Volute Pump, as described above, direct connected to the same motor equipment, with same fittings, price f.o.b. Kamloops ........................................... $2045.00\n\nDelivery 7 to 9 weeks from receipt of order.\n\nThis pump operating at a speed of 1750 RPM will deliver 2000 U.S. gallons per minute against a total head of 61' including not over 18' suction lift, and will develop 74% efficiency, requiring 41.2 brake H.P. for driving.\n\nThe operating conditions No.1 and No. 2, will have about the same head, the only difference will be the difference in friction head between 2000 gallons p.m. and 1000 gallons p.m. flowing through the 12\" pipe from the first outlet to the second. The total friction head in this pipe is only 3.17', and the difference will therefore be negligible.\n\nIt will not be necessary to throttle water in the main pipe as suggested in the specification. This will be taken care of by regulating the discharge of first opening, so as to take out only 1000 gallons per minute.\n\nWorthington Pumps are designed by the world's best centrifugal pump designers, are conservatively rated and have a high and lasting efficiency. Durability has not been sacrificed to extreme efficiency, as is the case with many centrifugal pumps on the market.\n\nWe trust that our quotation will meet with your approval.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nPUMPS & POWER LIMITED.\n\nJ.L. Marshall (Sig)\nSales Manager.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your enquiry of the 15th inst., we have pleasure in quoting:\n\n1 - 8\" Fairbanks-Morse Fig. 800E Horizontal Double Suction, Single Stage, Centrifugal Pump, with horizontally split casing, fitted with ring oiling outboard bearings, water sealed glands, bronze wearing rings, cast iron impeller, bronze shaft sleeves, as shown in bulletin which we are mailing you. This pump would be complete with base plate and coupling, having mounted one 50 H.P. Type \"B\" Fairbanks-Morse Induction Motor, 2300 Volts, 60 Cycles, 3 Phase, 1800 RPM, complete with Type \"CCOR\" Starter equipped with no-voltage release and overload relays, panel mounted; motor to be equipped with conduit fittings.\n\nAlso the following:\n\n2 - Pcs. 10\" ordinary black pipe, each 8' long, cut and threaded.\n1 - Pc. 10\" ordinary black pipe, 10' long, cut and threaded.\n1 - C.I.

Kamloops, B.C., $2,025.00\n\nWe figure that your total working head, including friction, would be in the neighbourhood of 60 feet, under which conditions this pumping outfit will deliver 2000 U.S. gallons per minute, the pump...\nefficiency being 70%, requiring 43 H.P. at the coupling.\n\nThe characteristics of the motor would be as follows:\n\n| Load     | Efficiency | Power Factor |\n|----------|------------|--------------|\n| 1/2      | 86%        | 78%          |\n| 3/4      | 89%        | 86%          |\n| Full Load| 95%        | 90%          |\n| 1 1/2    | 88%        | 91%          |\n\nWe could ship the pumping outfit complete from our factory in approximately seventy days from receipt of order. The time in transit to Kamloops would be approximately three weeks. Pipe and fittings would of course be shipped from Vancouver and could be landed in Kamloops earlier if necessary.\n\nYour operating condition No. 1, as you will note, corresponds to the characteristics of the pump. So far as operating condition No. 2 is concerned, we understand that you are to draw 1,000 gallons from the discharge pipe at elevation 30 and at the same time 1,000 gallons at the full elevation of 50. There is no reason why this cannot be done. There would, however, have to be a gate valve between the discharge pipe and the hydrant at elevation 30 so as you would of course have to carry the full 60 Ft. pressure at the pump, closing down this gate valve sufficiently so that the 30 Ft. hydrant would not hog the water.\n\nWe trust that we have interpreted your requirements correctly and that we may hear from you favourably in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE\n\nElec. & Hydr.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Oct. 5, 1926.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nSome time ago we asked you to give us some three or four acres of the Indian Reserve West of the little lake on our property which would enable us to drain the lake.\n\nThe Water Power Branch has no doubt given you a report.... It is a thing of which they cannot be very certain. The lake may have a little spring in the bottom...... And the cost of drainage?..... We have discussed it here several times. This is no criticism of their work or report.\n\nApart from all that, we present a request. Let us drain the lake, which means to block up the inlet from the river and build a dyke on the West - both of which operations would be on land occupied by the Reserve.\n\n1. Corn land is low lying land. We have little of it; even the land we rent from the Chief is not corn land. It is something we need and there are twenty acres in it.\n\n2. At present we get nothing from it save a little pasture at low water. Neither do the Indians except probably a ton or two of marsh hay at best.\n\n3. By taking this land we do little or no harm to the Indian people.\n\n4. The cost of draining, or trying to drain the lake, is labor and labor in our long suit. If we\nfail, we lose our labor. We might ask you for a few tiles or a little cement, but the expense would be trifling. Labor is the real cost.\n\nIf you could find your way clear to grant us this request during the present month, we would try to be ready for the high waters next June.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McCreery\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nNote:\nThis letter goes to you through the office of Col. Pragnell Inspector of Indian Agencies. I do not wish any of our plans to interfere with his. He may have some comments.\n\nJ.M.\nOctober 13, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose a letter from Rev. Father McGuire, Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, which is addressed to you and forwarded through me.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I have made careful investigation of the ground, in company with Mr. E.H. Tredcroft, and I have to say that I am quite in favour of the matter, having in view the fact that Father McGuire's letter apparently means that he himself is willing to supply the labour. If you will look at the report made by Mr. Tredcroft upon additional land for the Kamloops School, you will find this scheme mentioned as number 4. In this report, Mr. Tredcroft states that the scheme will cost $3000.00, but on questioning him I find that this was somewhat of a rough estimate, and that the principal cost would be labour. Mr. Tredcroft's idea also included a concrete dam, and I must say that in this I do not agree with the necessity of concrete. The river banks are earth, and are well reinforced with growth of willow and big timber, and I cannot see any reason, nor does past history show any signs of serious erosion. The inlet from the river is, to my mind, an ideal situation for the placing of an earth dam. It is very narrow and the dam can be set well back from the river bank, and if planted with willow, it would appear to me as though it would be equally as strong as the remainder of the bank. I cannot really see any reason for making one part stronger than another, which would be done if concrete works were put in.\n\nMy opinion is that if as little expenditure as possible were made by the Department for materials, and then if by any possibility it did not work, it would be very little loss. In fact, in case of piping for an outlet, it might be found that none is necessary and the piping could be used elsewhere.\n\nI quite agree with Father McGuire that it seems to be a great pity to allow all this good land to be practically wasted when the odds are, and Mr. Tredcroft agrees, that with drainage the land could be successfully reclaimed.\n\nOf course it would be necessary to make some arrangements about additional land which does not belong to the school, but I do not think there would be any difficulty about arranging for this, as it is not used by the Indians anyway.\n\nMy further reason for recommending this is because it will save all kinds of trouble in trying to get other lands for the School from the Indians, and also because this site is much closer to the school than any other land would be.\n\nDr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nI should advise that the Rev. Principal be informed that if he will supply and supervise all the necessary labour for embankment work, that piping, head gate material, etc., up to say, $500.00 will be supplied him by the Department, as the material is required, and ask him for a rough estimate as to what he does require. I should suggest that he be allowed to do this work entirely on his own.\n\nI really think that this work is such as could be undertaken by any ordinary farmer, and is hardly an engineering problem. Of course, he could, if necessary, get Mr. Tredoroff to run any levels or do anything technical, that is required.\n\nBy allowing Father McGuire to undertake this work himself, he is really the man who is running the risk, if there is any, and the Department would only be risking the probably slight cost of material.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Geo. S. Fragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOctober 25, 1926.\n\nDear Colonel Pragnell:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I note that it is proposed to reclaim 57 acres of land, at present covered by the small lake immediately southwest of the school - 37 acres of which are on the school allotment and 20 acres on the Indian reserve. As this scheme has been favourably reported on by the Dominion Water Power Engineer and as the cost to the Department would be not more than $600, I am quite favourably disposed. The Rev. Principal must consider it worthy of trial, or he would not be willing to supply all the labour.\n\nWith a view to proceeding with the activity, please arrange to have the Indian Band in Council release for school purposes the 20 acres which is on Reserve No. 1. You may then authorize Father McGuire to commence the work, which should be under your supervision whenever possible. If materials are required, they should be purchased by either you or Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing, after securing competitive prices.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt. Col. G. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 752,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nURGENT AND IMPORTANT.\n\nP.O. BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\nNovember 4, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the morning of this date, at the earnest request of Rev. Father McGuire, Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, I went over to look into some sanitary arrangements which are out of order.\n\nAs a preliminary, I might say that three of the children and one of the Sisters at the School are down with dysentery. The Rev. Principal, and, naturally, both the Agent and myself are anxious that no epidemic should break out in the school owing to neglect on our part.\n\nIt seems that the dirty water from the wash house and laundry runs into a small concrete tank, which has seepage pipes in it. Theoretically, this water is supposed to seep away through the sand but practically, it does not do so, and the water now overflows, and has done for many months, into a trench dug by the school authorities, in the hope that it would then seep away through the sand and gravel. However, this does not work, and at the present moment there is a very large pool of this dirty water which has run down quite close to the river bank, and appears to have overflowed the temporary banking made to contain it, and gone down into the river.\n\nIn connection with the fact that this water now flows into this river, I beg to draw your attention to the two following facts:\n\n1. This is illegal, as it is against the Municipal Regulations of Kamloops, being only a few hundred yards above the intake for the water supply of the town.\n\n2. The intake for the school drinking water is only about 100 feet above where this overflow has taken place down the river bank, and as it is situated in the bend of the river, it so happens that there is a back-water there, and both the Principal and myself are afraid that this is or may contaminate the drinking water.\n\nInstructions have been issued by myself and the medical men to the Principal to have a sample of the water analysed immediately.\n\nSeveral months ago, I understand, this matter was brought to the attention of the Indian Department, and a suggestion to rectify it made by Mr. Tredcroft, Department of Water Rights Engineer, which suggestion was submitted. The medical men also state that this overflow from the laundries is not only dangerous from the point of view that it may contaminate the drinking water, but it is also dangerous lying around in stale pools as it is right now, just beside the schoolhouse.\n\nDr. Duncan C.

In fact, so urgent do I consider the matter, that I think a wire ought to be sent authorizing its immediate construction.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the contents of Inspector Pragnell's letter to you, dated Nov. 4th, concerning the present condition of the drainage system from the laundry of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the above mentioned conditions were reported to this Department on the 11th of March of this year by Agent Helmsing. On the same date I requested the local office of the Dominion Water Power Branch by telephone to have the matter investigated. This request was confirmed by letter on the 13th of March, turned out hereunder. On April 23rd a report was sent in recommending that the present underground disposal system be replaced by a pumping outfit and underground pipe line, by which the waste water would be removed some 200 ft. from the School. From this point it is suggested that the water be conducted by gravity through 420 lineal feet of four inch drain tile, and used for irrigation purposes on the school garden. The pump will be automatically operated by electricity and the total cost of the system, including the machinery, construction of concrete drainage pit, and the installation of discharge pipe, drain tile, etc., will amount to $425.00. The cost of operation will only amount to about six cents per month. The present system has been in operation for a long time, and is reported to be entirely inadequate to meet the requirements of such an institution. I would, therefore, recommend that the engineer who prepared the report on the proposed new system be authorized to supervise the work.\n\nI may add for your information that the above mentioned report was placed on the site file, which has only reach me today, after I had searched through all the other files for the required correspondence.\n\nWill you please advise whether the necessary instructions can be sent by wire to Inspector Pragnell authorizing this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, Nov. 9, 1926.\n\nLt.

Pragnell, Kamloops, B.C., authorizing some alterations to the present drainage system from the laundry at Kamloops Indian Residential School, which work is to be carried out under the supervision of your local District Engineer who had charge of the preparation of a report on it. Should you have no objections to these instructions, I would ask you to kindly confirm same to this Department and advise your Kamloops Office accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

Pragnell,\nInspector Indian Agencies,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to call your attention to cases of dysentery which have been developing in the Industrial School here. So far there are three cases in the Hospital and there are several others, seven at least, in the School.\n\nIn company with Father McQuire and yourself, I went over the sanitary arrangements at the Industrial School and find as follows:\n\nThere are a number of outside closets, which are being used by the boys of the School. While these are as well taken care of as outside closets usually are, yet they are, through the breeding of flies, a very great menace to the health of the Institution. I went through the dining room and kitchen of the School and found a large number of flies. In an institution of this kind, it is very difficult to keep these pests out of the building, but it is the fact of outside sources of contamination that makes them dangerous.\n\nBesides the outside closets, there is a cesspool, which receives the water from the laundry. The soil about the cesspit has become completely saturated and the cesspool is constantly overflowing. This adds greatly to the other sources of infection.\n\nAs Health Officer to the School, I would urge you as Inspector to bring these matters before the Department at Ottawa and urge that immediate steps be taken to have them remedied; otherwise the Health Department will have to consider very radical measures with regard to the School. I might add that three, at least, of these children are very seriously ill and there is a grave doubt that they will recover. Your earnest and immediate attention to this matter is of the utmost urgency.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMGA/EM\n\nP.S.\n\nReferring to the overflowing cesspit, I might add that it is very close to the bank of the river and the intake for the City water supply is four or five hundred yards directly below.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nNovember 6, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nFollowing mine of the 4th inst., with reference to the unsanitary conditions at Kamloops Industrial School, I have to report that, yesterday, I accompanied Dr. Archibald, Medical Health Officer for the City of Kamloops, to the School. I beg to enclose the original of his letter to me.\n\nAfter our examination, we came to the conclusion that the cause of this dysentry is from flies breeding in the outside closets, or on pools of water from the laundry. We do not think that contamination has actually taken place in the water that is overflowing from this laundry waste into the river, but at the same time our conclusion is that this is also a grave possibility, and should be looked into immediately. The conclusions we arrived at, therefore, bear out my special report to you regarding school accommodation, and the necessity of putting up the Boys' Wing as quickly as possible.\n\nAs you will see, in the last paragraph of the doctor's letter, three of these children are very seriously ill, and there is grave doubt of their recovery. This is a very serious state of affairs, as you can readily gather, though I do not think that any blame is attachable to the Principal of the School, as things are kept as well as they can be under the present conditions, but as you know it is almost impossible to keep outside closets sanitary, even though much chloride of lime is used. In addition, he cannot help this overflow from the laundry, as the washing must, of necessity be done.\n\nI might point out that in the doctor's postscript, with reference to the overflowing cesspit, he means the cesspit that is used for laundry water, and not for the lavatories.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 12, 1926.\n\nDear Colonel Pragnell,\n\nI wish to acknowledge the receipt of your communications, dated November 4 and 6, advising me of the defective condition of the drainage system from the laundry at the Kamloops Indian Industrial School, B.C., also, Dr. Archibald's report of November 5, concerning the development of a number of dysentery cases amongst the pupils of this institution, resulting probably from the manner of disposal of the above mentioned drainage water.\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm my instructions given you in my telegram of the 9th instant, requesting that immediate action be taken by the local officer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, in order that the present condition might be remedied with the least possible delay in accordance with Mr. Fredroff's report. I might say that the work may be entrusted to one of the local engineers of the Dominion Water Power Branch whose services has been secured through the authority of the head office in Ottawa.\n\nReferring to Dr. Archibald's remarks concerning the maintenance of outside closets at this school, it is suggested that chloride of lime be used extensively in the closet boxes, especially whenever flies are noticeable in or around the building. This it is believed would relieve, to a certain extent, the unhealthy atmosphere resulting from the use of this type of sewage disposal.\n\nI have noticed your recommendation regarding the advisability of providing in the near future, additional accommodation for this school, also the necessity of erecting a new wing for the male pupils. I shall give these matters my earnest consideration as early as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLt. Col. G. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 752,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to alterations necessary for the disposal of laundry waste at the Kamloops Industrial School, I have advised Mr. Webb of the instructions telegraphed to Col. Pragnell on the 9th instant to arrange to have this work carried out under Mr. Tredcroft's supervision, in accordance with the report which he prepared on that subject.\n\nThe estimated cost of these alterations is Four Hundred and Twenty-five Dollars ($425.00) and I should be obliged if you would kindly arrange to have a cheque sent to me for that amount for transmission to Mr. Webb.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Principal seemed somewhat in doubt as to whether he wanted the scheme completed or not.\n\nThe real hitch, as I pointed out to Rev. Father McGuire at the time, was that the Indians would not relinquish the said twenty acres, and I asked him to try and see what he could do himself in the matter, as he was the party interested.\n\nI heard nothing further in the matter, and now that Rev. Father McGuire has left the School, I do not for a moment think that the new Principal, Rev. Father Duplanil, will want to reclaim more land for the School. I am of the belief that his attitude is that so much land is not required and cannot be worked without sacrificing the education of the boys. His contention is that to keep a herd of cattle going is a costly business, and that, apparently the agricultural land available is quite sufficient to raise ordinary crops for school use, and fodder crops for the milk herd.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo.

BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nFebruary 28th, 1928.\n\nW-16-2863.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to report that the pump for the laundry waste at Kamloops Residential School broke down suddenly yesterday. The Principal reported the matter to me, and as it was important that the said pump be in working order by next Monday, I called on Fernie and Co., electricians, to deal with the matter, and they have sent fresh parts from the makers at Vancouver.\n\nI went over this morning to see what was wrong, but the matter was too technical for me to deal with, so I approached the Dominion Water Power Branch who installed the pump, and asked that one of them go over there this afternoon to try to ascertain what was the cause of the break-down.\n\nThe Reverend Principal does not think that he should have to bear the whole cost of the break-down, and as the pump was only put in about a year ago, I think his contention has much in its favour. You will probably hear from him upon the matter, and if you wish me to, I can ask the Dominion Water Power Engineers to submit a report.\n\nIn connection with the various pumps and motors over at the school, I am of the opinion, and so is the Principal, that a regular monthly or two-monthly inspection of the nine motors in use should be undertaken by a proper electrician, who would be able to report as to whether these machines are kept in order, and that would perhaps save such break-downs as above mentioned. I think that for a fee, one of the local electricians would undertake the job of a regular inspection.\n\nI have further to report that apparently there is something wrong with the volume of water pumped from the river for domestic purposes. The engines and motors of the pump seem to have the capacity, but somehow or other the water does not seem to be coming and nobody seems to have any data as to the form of intake that was put in fifteen or twenty years ago. There may be something wrong with this intake, and I have asked the Dominion Water Power Engineers to also look into this matter and report to me, so that if there is anything wrong they can recommend what should be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your K-16-2863 of the 28th ultimo, with reference to a breakdown of the pump for laundry waste at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Your action in authorizing repairs is approved. A report from the Dominion Water Power Engineer, who examined the pump, should be forwarded when you are submitting an account.

C.\n\nExtent of Damage:\n\nAll bearings worn.\nShaft badly worn at all bearing points.\nShaft broken at coupling.\nImpeller slightly scraped.\nThrust collar badly worn.\nMotor entirely burned up.\n\nThis trouble was apparently due to the fact that the centre bearings on the vertical drive shaft not being greased.\n\nIt would appear that this bearing had been neglected from the original installation, as the top bearing and motor were well greased.\n\nThe bearings and the thrust collar were so badly worn and the shaft so much out of alignment, that the motor locked and burned up.\n\nWe shipped the entire pump to the manufacturer in Vancouver for repairs and expect it back in the course of a few days.\n\nWe would advise that we are making a proposition to the principal of the School to give a monthly inspection of all electrical and pump equipment, which should eliminate a further occurrence of this nature.\n\nYours truly, FERNIE BROS., per H. Fernie.\nSir:-\n\nRe Sump Pump & Domestic Water Supply Pump, Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nAt the request of Colonel Pragnell, I visited the Kamloops Industrial school for the purpose of inspecting the sump pump, whose bearings had been burned out.\n\nOn inspecting the various parts of the pump I found that the top of the brass shaft had been worn half through for a length of two inches. Also at another point on the shaft, halfway down, where there was a bearing, the shaft was badly worn.\n\nIt appears that no grease had been applied to these bearings since the original installation, as there was no grease in the feed pipe for some inches from the end.\n\nThe pump and motor had been completely dismantled when I visited the school.\n\nThe runners in the pump were badly worn at the tips, due, no doubt, to the bearings being\n\nburned out.\n\nE. H. Tredcroft, Esq.,\nKamloops, B. C.\nburned out, the shaft therefore being out of line.\n\nThe bearings in the motor had also burned out.\n\nFather Dupelnail said they had trouble in getting enough water into the domestic service tank as the pump would not supply the required quantity. On examining same, I found that the pump had lost its priming, and they had neglected to prime it again.\n\nWhen I showed them how to prime it, the pump worked all right, and I have been told since that it is operating satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) C.

Before the former lease on this parcel is cancelled, the Department believes that the circumstances concerning it should be placed before you and the Rev. Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School for consideration.\n\nIn 1926, it was believed that the school - 250 persons and considerable live stock - should have more land under cultivation. Several schemes were considered and the leasing of Chief Eli Larue's property was decided upon. At the time it was recommended that the permanent acquisition of this parcel for school purposes be considered in 1935, when the lease expired. In 1926, approximately $4,000 was expended increasing the capacity and efficiency of the irrigation system. I understand that there is in the vicinity of the school little arable land that can be irrigated, and very careful consideration should be given before this parcel is lost to the school for even a period of five years. Please discuss this carefully with Rev. Father Duplanil and let me have a further recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEwen MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to the leasing of the portion of land of Chief Eli Larue formerly leased by the Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nI have carefully noted your remarks, also discussed the matter over again with the Rev. Principal of the School. He is of the same opinion as he was before that he does not need this land for his school at any rate for some years to come as the school has more land of their own then they are now using. He further claims that he has lost money on the Chief's leased land the last two years and from the appearance of the crops, I noticed on the place I fully agree with the Rev. Principal that he must have lost money on the land.\n\nI carefully looked into the whole affair before I recommended to the Department that the lease should be abandoned by the school and granted to Mr. King.\n\nThere are several reasons for this I know that the former principal's idea was to keep a lot of range cattle and get hay where ever he could, he, on many occasions, I am informed, used the boys, pupils of the school, at various distances away from the school to put up the hay. The Indian parents strongly objected to this and it is possible that if the practice had been continued to this date that we would have more of our school buildings empty. The present Principal's idea is to run a good school where the pupils are getting as much education as possible under the circumstances and have the pupils in the class rooms as much as possible instead of running about the country chasing cattle and putting up hay. Then again the present principal informs me that he has more land now belonging to the school than he has under cultivation he has no range for cattle and he feels that if and as long as he has land enough to raise hay enough for his miling cows and to grow enough vegetables that he has enough, both the principal and myself also agreed that Chief Eli Larue is much better off getting the present offered rental than the $240.00 per annum which he was getting from the school.\n\nI think that covers the situation fully at this time, if it is favored after five years that the lease should not be renewed the matter could then be dealt with.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Ewen MacLeod)\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nOttawa, January 30, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your l-10-4 of the 20th ultimo, with reference to leasing the land of Chief Eli Larue, formerly leased by the Kamloops Indian Residential School. The lease of the Kamloops Indian Residential School may be cancelled, and I should be pleased if you would return to Ottawa the three copies, which were forwarded to the former Indian Agent, under cover of my letter of July 18, 1925. You will receive instructions concerning the proposal to grant a lease to the Chinaman Ah King, under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I do not speak of the grading. It did cost me a great deal more than I expected. It was my own mistake; it is my own loss. I am speaking of other improvements, viz., the tearing down of old buildings, the levelling of a hill back of the school for playground, the building of an implement shed and of a garage, the building of storage room for storm windows, etc. You remember the old approach to the school buildings. Most unsightly.\n\nCompare with the present appearance. The City of Kamloops and the Provincial Govt. were kind enough to help us and to lend us wheel scrapers and other tools. To finish to work properly I needed a grader which I bought at a cost of $175.00.\n\nIn buying this grader, I had in mind not only the ground but the children. We must keep the road between Kamloops and the School open winter and summer. We never know when the Doctor will be needed, we never know when a child will need the Doctor, the Clinic and the Hospital. The grader will help us in keeping the road clear no matter how much wind comes.\n\nThe grader will also help us to put under proper cultivation some ten or twelve acres of land. At present we cannot irrigate some portion of the school property. By grading the land it will be easily irrigated and therefore properly cultivated.\n\nWill you be kind enough to recommend to the Dept. that the purchase of the grader be approved and that compensation be given me. A new grader costs $300.00 plus freight. I paid $175.00.\n\nWith best wishes, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith original letter received from Rev. John Duplanil, O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, with reference to certain work being carried out at that Institution.\n\nAs you are aware, some time ago the Department had an estimate of the cost of levelling and filling in the grounds at the School, and the Reverend Principal agreed that upon receipt of a truck and scraper and a few other articles, that he would endeavour to do the work. His estimate for the same was less by $1000.00 than the other estimates submitted.\n\nHe has found out since that the work entailed a great deal more expense than he had anticipated, and the tearing down of the old school buildings, levelling a hill back of the school for a playground, the building of a large implement shed and a garage.\n\nAs you will note in perusing his letter, it has meant a great deal of work, and it is not completed yet. He had to purchase a grader in order to assist the work, as stated in his letter. I have examined this grader personally and have seen it at work. He is doing splendid work with it, and it is very reasonable at $175.00, and I can conscientiously recommend that the Department consider payment of same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 8, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 31st ultimo concerning the beautifying of the grounds at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. You might let me have an estimate of the cost of the necessary pipes and hose. The appropriation for Indian education is extremely limited this year, and I find it necessary to curtail expenditure as far as possible. I find that funds can be provided for the very necessary scraper which the Reverend Principal has been able to purchase second hand, and you may prepare a voucher in his favour for $175, and reimbursement will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEven MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 154-0-9 of the 8th April, with reference to the pipes which are needed for beautifying the grounds at Kamloops Indian Residential School, and would like to say that upon request, Rev. Father Duplanil has stated that 1500 feet of \u00bd\" pipe and 100 feet of hose pipe will be needed. He states that he thinks that this can be bought at a cost of $105.00, and is anxious to know how much the Department is willing to give him to assist in the purchase of this pipe and hose.\n\nIn this connection, I might state that it is certainly necessary that something be done regarding the school grounds, as when the winds blow, as they do in and around Kamloops, the sand in front of the building is very frequently raised, and a great deal of the said sand goes into the building and it is impossible to keep it out under present conditions. If grass can be made to grow, which it can be with the use of a great deal of water, this nuisance will be obviated.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Ewen MacLeod)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, June 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the piping, etc., required for the watering of the grounds around the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately $105 in the purchase of the quantity of 1/2\" piping and hose pipe required. It is expected that the school authorities will arrange for the installation of the piping without expense to the Department. After you have arranged for the purchase and delivery of the quantity of piping required, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.

I am unable to find any plan of this school site of record in the Department, other than that which you have and there does not appear to be any further information with regard to it. The plan which you forwarded with your letter is returned herewith. A copy has been retained for record in this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nEwen McLeod Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nKamloops, B.C., Dec. 30th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy inspection of this agency, as usual, extends over a considerable part of the year, as occasions arise to pass through certain portions of it.\n\nKAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nFinally the school acreage should be surveyed and fenced. Apparently, whilst old plans show the school as having an acreage of 320 acres, there are no corner posts to be found showing any previous survey. With the leasing of land around the school, and the claims of various Indians, the exact bearings of the land should be established to prevent dispute. The Reverend Principal has offered to erect the boundary fence with boy labour, as instructional work, provided the necessary wire and posts are supplied by the Department. This offer would save considerable expenditure to the Department.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nVictoria, B.C., Feb. 18, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor herewith to transmit the report of G. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies for British Columbia, dated December 30th last with respect to his inspection of the Kamloops Agency.\n\nIn regard to the survey of the school grounds as referred to, I beg to say that a report dated February 25, 1926, prepared by Mr. Engineer Tredoroft of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, at Kamloops, in connection with the lands of the Kamloops Industrial School, the area is given by him of 253 acres; while a letter on file received a few years ago from a former Principal of the school, Rev. James McGuire, the area is given as 320 acres, the latter also being furnished by ex-agent Smith in his sworn evidence before the Royal Commission in 1913. It is noted the Inspector refers to old plans which show 320 acres, but a recent letter from the Indian Agent indicated that there is no information in his office regarding the area about which he wrote the Department and this office for information. I have recently written to the Indian Agent asking him to consult with Mr. Engineer Tredoroft with a view to ascertaining the source of his information as to the area being 253 acres. It is thought that this may be the result of his survey of an area previously believed to stand at the larger figure. The Inspector will be asked further regarding the old plans to which he refers and it is thought that such information should be known to the Agent as well as to himself if their offices are working in harmony in these matters.\n\nW.

These files should show how this matter was dealt with, and what amount of land was set aside at the time that the location of the school site was made, and also if any subsequent allotments were made of the land to be appurtenant to the School.\n\nThe Indians of the Kamloops Band claim that the only knowledge they have is of the original allowance made to the school, and that they were never consulted nor compensated for any land taken subsequent to that allotted in 1888.\n\nIt does not appear that anyone is responsible for the sketch map which I forwarded to the Department in a previous letter. There is no name signed to it, as you will note, and so far, I have been unable to find out who made the survey.\n\nI think it advisable to get this matter straightened out once and for all, so that the school authorities and the Indians may know how the matter actually stands.\n\nI am enclosing copies of some more letters here on file, which may assist you in throwing some light on the subject, or be of value in making search of the files with the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. White, who was searching the records for information concerning the property which the Industrial School was entitled to in the Kamloops Indian reserve reports to me that he cannot find any definite information regarding this land other than in 1888 a parcel purporting to contain about 160 acres was recommended by Indian Superintendent Vowell. This property was owned by a woman known as Widow Leroux at the time payment was made to her in 1889 for her improvements on this property was known as Mary Kliklehkan, having married the Kamloops Chief Louis Kliklehkan in Feb. 1889. Payment of $165.00 was made to her in March of that year.\n\nA sketch showing the property to be acquired will be found in Mr. Vowell's letter of 30th July 1888, F.48432-1 herewith. Comparison of this sketch with the plan which is on file 154-0-9 accompanying Agent MacLeod's letter of 19th December last, would make it appear that at some subsequent time a survey had been made and the corners posted of a parcel containing 320 acres. This parcel shows an additional piece of land along the North and East of the property, although the S.W. corner apparently coincides with the S.W. corner of the parcel obtained from Widow Leroux. However, the original westerly boundary was only 15 chains and this tracing plan shows an additional length of nearly 37 chains to this boundary. The northerly boundary was originally 105 chains and this later plan shows it to be 11 chains long. The easterly boundary was originally 11 chains and the later plan shows an additional 5 chains.

No definite information can be obtained regarding this land other than that, in 1886, a parcel purporting to contain about 160 acres was recorded by Indian Superintendent Vowell. This property was owned by a woman known as Widow Lemieux who, at the time payment was made to her in 1889 for her improvements on this property, was known as Mary Kliklekhkan having married the Kamloops Chief Louis Kliklekhkan in February, 1889. Payment of $165.00 was made to her in March of that year.\n\nA sketch showing the property to be acquired was forwarded to the Department on July 30th, 1888.

C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 154-6-9 of May 21st last, with reference to the lands appurtenant to Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIt appears to me that every possible source of information has been exhausted in connection with the matter, and that it cannot be shown that any one was authorized to enlarge the grounds to 320 acres, nor that there was any authorized survey made of the original land under the Widow LeRoux purchase in 1888, which was purported to contain 160 acres.\n\nThe School Principals have placed new lands under cultivation in recent years\u2014in fact they have practically all the land under cultivation now that can be brought under the present pumping system.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the lands at present under cultivation be surveyed by a duly qualified engineer, commencing at the southwest corner of the Widow LeRoux parcel, thence north a sufficient number of chains to cover the lands under cultivation, thence east to cover the lands under cultivation, thence south to the South Thompson River.\n\nThis may be found to contain more or less than the original 160 acres intended to have been set aside in 1888. However, in discussing the situation with the principal men of the Kamloops Band of Indians, I find that this would be satisfactory to them.\n\nI cannot see where the School Management could have any serious objection, as the lands outside the cultivated lands are steep, rough hillsides, and whilst we are dealing with the question, we might as well finish it in proper order.

Later correspondence refers to this parcel, which is now occupied by the Kamloops Indian residential school, as 283 acres. There is on file a plan of a parcel containing 320 acres and although the S.W. corner of this parcel apparently coincides with the S.W. corner of the parcel obtained from the Indian owner in 1888, it increases the property on the North and East. The records do not show when or by whom this plan or survey was made, nor do they show that any definite arrangement was made to increase the school property from 160 acres to 320 acres.\n\nIndian Agent MacLeod, who has been corresponding in connection with the present site, has suggested that the lands at present under cultivation be surveyed and states that this survey may contain more or less than the original 160 acres, but that he has discussed the situation with the principal men of the Kamloops band, who said they would be satisfied to have the question settled in this way. He also states that he does not consider that the school management could have any serious objection to this solution, as the lands outside the cultivated lands are steep rough hillsides.\n\nI would recommend that a survey be made in order to definitely establish the limits of this school property. If you approve, may I be advised of the name of the surveyor to whom instructions could be issued to perform the survey? This reserve is situated in the Cariboo Electoral District, close to the City of Kamloops. The survey could be most economically performed by a surveyor from that city.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, July 17, 1931.\n\nCapt.

MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nEwen MacLeod Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nOttawa, 20th July 1931\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department requires a survey of the boundaries of the lands occupied by the Kamloops Indian residential school on the Kamloops Indian reserve. The survey of the parcel is to include all the land at present under cultivation by the school authorities but it is not considered desirable that the boundaries should be jogged in order to follow the limits of the actual cultivation but the parcel should be laid out in as regular a shape as possible to include this area.\n\nI am enclosing a blueprint of the survey of the Canadian Northern Pacific Railway right of way through this portion of the reserve and your field notes should show a connecting tie to either that corner of the reserve marked \"P\" on this blueprint, or to a monument at one of the lower corners on the other side of the South Thompson river, or if the Company have special hubs marking either the P.C.'s or the P.T.'s of their line, a tie to two consecutive hubs on the railway would be satisfactory.\n\nIf you are able to undertake this survey, kindly communicate with Mr. Ewen MacLeod, Indian Agent, Kamloops, who will be in a position to give you definite information as to the location of the boundaries.\n\nThe corners are to be marked with posts of the type shown on the enclosed blueprint which you can readily secure from a local blacksmith. Intermediate posts should also be planted every twenty chains.\n\nYou will be paid at the rate of $15.00 per day and all reasonable expenses. Your returns will consist of field notes and your account in duplicate, accompanied by duplicate vouchers for expenditures made. If you are unable to accept this survey kindly notify the Department at once, in order that instructions may be issued to another surveyor.\n\nE.O.

The area is found to be 258.3 acres. You will find attached the plan and blueprint of this survey which was made by E.O.Wood, B.C.L.S. The plan on tracing linen I think should be forwarded to the Indian Agent for record in his office.\n\nAs the Agent stated the Indians would be in favour of having this matter settled by having a survey made of the property actually occupied, it would seem to me to be advisable to now obtain a surrender from the Indians of this property for the purpose of the Industrial School. I am attaching a description which will be satisfactory for the surrender.\n\nYou will find on file under Mr. Wood's account for this survey amounting to $208.75, which I have certified as being fair and just, and I would suggest that as this would appear to be a proper charge against your portion of the Appropriation, that you advise the Accountant that it should be so paid. I am making this suggestion as I understand there is only about $1700.00 left in the share of the Appropriation to cover expenditure in connection with surveys, roads and irrigation and there is still a considerable charge to be made in connection with expenses of the irrigation surveys made by C.E.Webb.\n\nChief Surveyor.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6451)\n\nFile 882-11, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nVocational Training-Supplies-Accounts.\n1929 - 1938\n\nFile 882-11, part 2\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nVocational Training-Supplies-Accounts.\n1938 - 1946\n\nFile 882-11, part 3\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nVocational Training-Supplies-Accounts.\n1946 - 1950\n\nFile 882-14, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nLivestock-Supplies-Accounts.\n1920 - 1938\n\nFile 882-22, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nPayments of Grants.\n1946 - 1950\n\nFile 882-23, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nDeath of Pupils.\n1935 - 1945\n\nFile 883-1, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Boarding\nSchool - General Administration.\n1906 - 1932\n\nFile 883-1, part 2\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - General Administration.\n1933 - 1950\n\nFile 883-5, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1911 - 1938\n\nFile 883-5, part 2\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1939 - 1946\n\nFile 883-10, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - Admissions & Discharges.\n1936 - 1939\nFebruary 7, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn File 600234, Commissioner Ditchburn was authorized, on February 6th, to purchase manual training equipment as follows for this school.

Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 882-11 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 2, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is making special efforts to improve the instruction in manual and vocational training for boys in the Indian schools of British Columbia. If this phase of our educational programme can be made more effective, it will greatly benefit the Indians of the Province. Most residential schools have a workshop or other space that can be used for vocational training. If steps to improve the workshop facilities should be taken at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, please cooperate with Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod with a view to making a recommendation to the Department.\n\nA thorough course in carpentry is the present aim. To this end, Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn has been authorized to supply benches and tools and there has been directed to you a text on manual training, job sheets in woodworking and a publication on how to work with tools and wood. Further, you have been authorized to present reasonable accounts for materials with which to work to Mr. MacLeod.\n\nThe Department is desirous of having a qualified instructor for this work at all schools where this special training is being undertaken. Some schools have on the staff an officer who is well qualified for the activity and who can be released from other duties for the manual training classes. I understand there are summer courses for instructors in manual training in Vancouver and Victoria. Other Indian schools are so situated that they can secure the services of instructors from municipal schools. In this case, classes are held two or three times per week. The Department would like to know what arrangements you have made, or can make, for this important work. Do not hesitate to enlist the cooperation of Mr. MacLeod if the Department can be of any assistance.\n\nAt a later date, it is hoped to extend the vocational training to include gas engines and other machinery; and, whenever you believe this additional course should be given at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, you will please inform the Department. A copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. MacLeod for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Duplanil, O. M.

Materials with which to work, texts and benches have been directed to you, and the Department wishes to make this phase of the school activity a real success.

Will you be kind enough to write the Department and tell about the work done by the children.\n\nI am enclosing herewith the list of furniture made by the pupils, viz.:\n\n9 work benches------16 waste paper baskets\n123 wash stands for girls' dormitories.\n29 benches for play rooms-----1 book case\n3 laundry trucks-----2 additional dining room tables\n2 doors-------1 small cabinet\nshelves--------an implement shed 31'x 74' (not completed)\n\nYou have a copy of Mr. Osborne's report and you have seen the weekly report which comes to my office every Saturday. You are in a position to give a full description and an unbiased report on the manual training school in the Kamloops Indian School. You have seen it.\n\nWill you be kind enough to call the attention of the Department that more lumber will be needed to complete the furniture of the school. I have bought many things and I cannot go any further.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) John Duplanil.\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find herewith copy of letter received this date from Rev. Father Duplanil, O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, with reference to vocational training class at the school.\n\nI might state that on several occasions I have personally visited this class, and find that the boys are doing very good work. They have a careful and painstaking instructor in Mr. Osborne, who submits a weekly report to the Reverend Principal of the School.\n\nOf course the Department is aware that the class is a new one, and it will take some time to teach the children the various works. The reason they are able to construct a large implement and farm machinery shed which they are putting up, is because they are taking down some of the buildings in the vicinity of the old school. All this work will be useful to them when they have left the school.\n\nSo far, the call on the Department for lumber material has been light owing to the fact that a great deal of use has been made of the lumber for the old school buildings. However, as noted in the Principal's letter, it will be necessary to get some more lumber in the near future in order to keep the class going. I would like to have a schedule of the work of this nature carried on in other schools, so that we would be guided thereby in laying out and planning work ahead for the children.\n\nIn my opinion, while book learning is essential for the advancement of the Indian children, the manual training is equally, or probably more important to them in after life.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Ewen MacLeod)\nIndian Agent.\n\nK/L/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, March 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School with reference to vocational training classes, giving a list of the furniture made by the pupils and requesting that lumber material be supplied for use in this work.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will obtain from the Principal a list of the lumber and any other material required to carry on the vocational training, together with an estimate of the cost, and forward same to the Department, when consideration will be given as to whether this material can be furnished or not.\n\nI may add that the Department is pleased to note the work that has been done by the pupils in the course of the manual training instruction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nKamloops, B.C., Jan. 2 1930\n\nManual training school,\nKamloops Indian School\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nThis class was started Sept. the 21st 1929 with 20 children, ten in the morning class and ten in the afternoon class, each Saturday. In the very beginning they made their benches, complete, they made also the necessary numbers of saw-horses. In fact they equipped the school quite thoroughly and at present it looks very much like a shop well kept and equipped.\n\nThe children, then, made waste paper baskets for the class rooms and staff rooms, the morning class making octagonal baskets and the afternoon class, square baskets. Each basket was well made.\n\nAt present they are making sixty small tables for the girls' dormitories, to hold wash basin, tooth brush, tooth paste, slippers, etc. Each table is properly doweled and glued together. Each one is hand-planed very smoothly.\n\nEach and all the boys in the Manual training school know the name of the tools used. All the boys know how to sharpen the tools which they used. In this regard they are very good.\n\nIt gives me much pleasure to report well on the class work. They have done remarkable progress in such a short time.\n\nRobt.

Since then the boys made seven 6ft. stepladders, 2 20ft. ladders, one dining room table (9x2'6\"), 28 small benches 6 ft. long for the playrooms, one table 6ft. by 18 inc., three tables 24\"x24\" for play rooms also. They had a few odd jobs to teach to handle repair jobs, such as door repairing. They are doing it very well. These boys seem to be very interested in their work.\n\nThe place we are in is too small. We have nine benches we should have at least 12 to accommodate the number of boys in the class and give each one a bench.\n\nThe work done by the boys has been for the building. It gives them just the training that is needed to instruct them in the use of tools which they can easily obtain later on. It will help them to make their own furniture and handle their own repair jobs in their homes after leaving school. They know how to sharpen their tools.

According to the instructions I have received from Ottawa the report and vouchers have to be sent direct to Ottawa.\n\nYou have the list of material needed to carry on the work successfully in our Manual school. The purchase of these articles etc. will amount to approx. $580.50\n\nWe are equipping the school with the one hundred articles which are needed and which every home needs. The training given the children is really practical. Later on I might turn more artistic and sentimental.\n\nWith best wishes, I remain, dear Mr. MacLeod\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 882-11 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKamloops Indian Residential School\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nMarch 25 1930\n\nEwen MacLeod Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. MacLeod,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a list of material needed for the Manual training school at Kamloops Indian School. The list was handed over to me last Saturday by Mr. Osborne, the Instructor. You may truthfully state that I am well pleased with the progress of the children.\n\nI think that the Dept. should make some provision for enlarging the scope of the manual training of the children.

They made also three desks for the kindergarten class room with the necessary benches. Several other benches were made also by the boys and these are used in the sewing room for the little ones and in different rooms in the building.\n\nHalf of the pupils attending the classes are new ones, having come to the manual training school only in the beginning of the term. They have learned the names of their tools. They have learned how to sharpen them and how to take care of them.\n\nLast year's pupils are quicker to understand the work. Their progress is very satisfactory indeed as it shows that they not only have learned how to work, but they have retained the lessons given them.\n\nThe building is too small. We have eleven or twelve boys in each class and there is not enough room for them all. There are not enough benches, the room being already crowded, it is impossible to put more benches.\n\nAt the last Fall Fair, the work of the children, exhibited to the Public, not only won general praises from the public, but won the First Prize. Yet the objects exhibited did not represent the best work done by the children, and there were only a few articles on the stand.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Robert Osborne.\nKAMLOOPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nDecember 29th, 1930.\n\nEwen MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. McLeod:\n\nI am mailing you herewith Mr. Osborne's report about the work done and the success obtained in the manual training school. Will you be kind enough to send it to Ottawa with the enclosed bill for the Instructor's salary.\n\nOn two occasions I called the attention of the Indian Department to the necessity for material in order to continue the work in the manual training school. On March 25th last, I enclosed a list of material which was necessary and since then I have had no satisfactory answer as to the willingness of the Indian Department to purchase further lumber.\n\nWill you be kind enough to take the matter up with the Indian Department as soon as possible.\n\nWishing you a happy and prosperous New Year,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) John Duplanil.\n\nEnclosures.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received from Rev. John Duplanil, O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, also copy of Manual Training Quarterly Report of Mr. Osborne, the Instructor, together with voucher for his quarterly payment for this work.\n\nIn this connection dealing with correspondence with Mr. W.E. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner, Victoria, who advised that I again write the Department in connection with requisition for screws, nails, etc., which was sent you in my letter of April 8th last. No answer received.\n\nIn the meantime, as material for manual training is short at the School, I authorized the Rev. Principal to purchase up to $25.00 worth of lumber, if required, until it has been arranged by the Department as to what amount of materials is to be supplied annually for this purpose, and I trust the Department will approve my action in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEM/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, January 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, together with the quarterly report of the manual training instructor and a voucher for payment of the grant allowed for his services for the quarter ended December 31st, last.\n\nIn this connection it is noted the Principal and yourself refer to a former request for authority to purchase material for manual training work, as per a list prepared by the Principal and forwarded under cover of your letter dated April 8th, last, to an approximate cost of $560.50, to which no reply was received by you. The Department promptly replied in a letter to you dated April 17th, 1930, which, no doubt, went astray in the mail. For your information, I enclose herewith a copy.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the materials as listed by the Principal and forwarded under cover of your letter above referred to, provided you are satisfied that the same are needed and that the prices charged are fair. You have, no doubt, a copy of this list. After the purchase is made, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, which will be paid from B. C. Special Grant. The Department regrets the delay occasioned by the non-receipt of our letter of April 17th, last, and shall be pleased if you will explain the matter to the Reverend Principal.\n\nThe action taken by you in authorizing an expenditure of $25 in the purchase of lumber for the manual training classes is approved.\n\nA cheque in payment of the grant for the services of the instructor to the amount of $120 for the December quarter, last, has been sent the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The explanation is quite satisfactory insofar as the Principal is concerned. I have arranged with him to make a new list covering requirements as at present. This he has promised to do. In my opinion, it is not necessary to go to an expense of $580.00 at this time.\n\nI have further advised the Principal that progress in Manual Training is in no way to be curtailed for lack of the necessary material, and that the same would be supplied according to the Department's authority, and as required for the use of the pupils and the instructor training them.\n\nI wish to thank the Department for confirming my authority in expending the sum of $25.00 pending reply from the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEwen MacLeod\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs, British Columbia**\n\n**KAMLOOPS AGENCY**\n\nTo Messrs.

Osborne. This teacher is paid at the rate of $40.00 per teaching month by the Department. Mr. Osborne is, I understand, a cabinet maker in Kamloops and comes each Saturday to the school. Twenty-seven boys are taking the course and these are divided into two classes, working for half a day each. The type of work done is the construction of tables, bookcases, lockers, cabinets. There is not much of the scientific model making done; but there has been considerable work accomplished in the construction of buildings, repair work, and the making of small articles for use in the school.\n\nThere has been an addition to the Manual Training Shop since my last report. The room is now about 45 feet by 20 feet. There are two double and eight single benches in the Manual Training Shop.\n\nThe chicken house mentioned in my last report is now finished. It has been very well constructed.\n\nThe Principal informs me that he purchased five sets of tools for the use of the boys. This was some time ago. He now asks for an additional four sets of tools. About $100.00 worth of lumber for manual training purposes is required. I am more inclined to recommend the sanctioning of this last than I am to recommend the supply of more tools. I believe that the school will be able to get along with the tools they have for some time to come.\nOttawa, February 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his inspection of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, recommends, regarding the manual training classes, that about $100 worth of lumber be supplied. In this connection I have to request that you will consult the Rev. Principal and the Manual Training Instructor as to the materials required, and you may arrange for the purchase, from indicated sources, of a quantity of lumber not exceeding the sum of $100. After the purchase has been made, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. Please state on the voucher that same is to be paid from B. C. Special Appropriation.\n\nWe are not prepared to supply any additional sets of tools for the manual training work. It is considered that the school should be able to get along with the tools they have on hand for some time to come.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J.

I am not in a position to judge whether or not the children profit later on by the knowledge and experience they get in school but they are certainly well equipped when they leave school to succeed.\n\nNot having been in charge of this work for long, I am not in a very good position to make suggestions with regard to the manner in which the courses could be improved. If some recompense could be given to the children who show special interest and ability in their work, this would be an encouragement to all. If for instance equipment could be given them when they leave school so that they might continue at once to do the work they have learned in School, this, I think, would be great help. A Number of our boys won prizes as members of the Boys' and Girls' Calf club and this has been a great incentive to them ever since. Our boys did better than the white children of the club who should have had the same opportunities.\nKamloops Indian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nVocational Training.\n\nRe: Circular Letter of March 18, 1931.\n\nI can say that almost all the instructions contained in this circular are being faithfully carried out in this school. The girls receive a good training in all housework. They learn how to make bread and butter. I do not at the present time see any convenient way for the girls to receive much training in gardening. We are asking the Department for more land, in which case our present garden might be left to the girls for this purpose. It is also very difficult here to have the girls milk cows though most of the girls who come from homes where there are cows are already able to do so. All our milch cows are on the R.O.P. test and in this case the milkers must not be changed but as seldom as possible. We have no facilities for teaching boat making and the study of gasoline engines. I do not think there are many boys here who need this training though there may be some.\n\nWith regard to all the other directions of this circular, they are being carried out.\n\nHoping this report is satisfactory, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

However, last year the school estimate was prepared by the Department and possible provision has been made to take care of this expenditure.\n\nIn the past only material and tools were supplied for the woodwork of this training. This year, as you will note, the requisition covers a complete new outfit of blacksmithing equipment; and I would say that this is a step in the right direction. Training of this nature will put a young Indian in the position that when he returns to his Reserve, he will have some knowledge as to how to repair machinery and other equipment, with which he has to carry on his farm work. In fact I am much in favour of this class of education to the Indians.

Ferguson)\nIndian Agent\nK-S-2.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a requisition, complete with estimate, from the Kamloops Indian Residential School, for equipment and material in connection with the manual training branch of the school.\n\nThe requisition covers the following items:\n\n- Lumber........$140.35\n- Tools, etc.... 54.35\n- Drafting equipment..... 16.60\n- Blacksmith equipment..... $134.07\n\nIt has been the practice each year to assist the school in this respect to the extent of from $100.00 to $200.00, provision being made in my estimates each year. However, last year the school estimate was prepared by the Department and possible provision has been made to take care of this expenditure.\n\nIn the past only material and tools were supplied for the woodwork of this training. This year, as you will note, the requisition covers a complete new outfit of blacksmithing equipment, and I would say that this is a step in the right direction. Training of this nature will put a young Indian in the position that when he returns to his Reserve, he will have some knowledge as to how to repair machinery and other equipment, with which he has to carry on his farm work. In fact I am much in favour of this class of education to the Indians. Both courses are of equal importance and I would strongly recommend that the full requisition be allowed the School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J.F/S.\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent\n\nChas. C.

Novo Gas Engine available at the Department of Public Works here.\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. K. W. Morton, Acting District Engineer, tells me that this machine has not been in use for several years, although it was in perfect condition when it was put into storage.\n\nIt is of very large capacity, in fact much greater than those used for ordinary public buildings, and I do not see how it can be of any use to our Department. I certainly would have no use for it in this Agency.\n\nI understand that the Penitentiary are anxious to get it, and there is no doubt that such a machine would be of value to them for use in the large construction problems they undertake.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"A.

I. Love, Superintendent of the Elk Island National Park, Lamont, Alberta, has written advising us that he has arranged space in their Golf-Course Club House for a case of the following dimensions: height 7\u00bd ft., width 3\u00bd ft., and depth 1\u00bd ft. The case is to be placed in a room in which the wood-work is painted white. As we have not funds available from which to supply an ordinary showcase, it has occurred to me that we might take advantage of this opportunity to call attention to the skill of the boys in the manual training class of Kamloops Indian Residential School. I think it would be well to have the case made in two sections, and enclose a drawing with the suggested outline, which you might discuss with the manual training instructor. You will see in the specifications that it is necessary to arrange for moveable shelves, as the baskets to be displayed are different heights and sizes.\n\nPlease purchase good dressed lumber of a type which will not be too heavy and which will lend itself to a white enamel finish. You may send the account for the materials required for this case on a separate voucher, and it should be sent to Mr. Love, express prepaid, and the express voucher should be included and attached to your own voucher covering the cost of materials, etc.\n\nI shall appreciate your co-operation in this connection, and when the case is finished, it would be well to have a small neat card, suitably lettered, stating that the case was made by the boys in the manual training class of Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

When these were submitted to the Purchasing Branch the following comments were made:\n\n\"Will No. 2 shelving be suitable? If so, the tender of Inland Building Supplies Ltd., Kamloops, is the lower.\n\n\"In most cases the prices quoted are practically equal. It might be advisable to have the Agent inspect the lumber offered and to advise which is the better quality and the most suitable for the purpose required.\"\n\nYou may place the business to the best possible advantage of this Department. An encumbrance requisition will be obtained when you submit the account for payment. You should, of course, send a copy of your purchase order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKamloops Indian Residential School\nFOUNDED IN 1889\nIN CHARGE OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nKamloops, B.C., Dec. 29th, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with Manual Training instruction would you kindly send us the Rules, General Procedure, Job Sheets etc. and any other literature as prepared by Mr. Boucet of the Training Division.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. O'Grady, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 7, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to manual training instruction at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nThe programme outlined by Mr. Doucet is being used in the Province of Alberta only during the current academic year and as a result the Department is not prepared to forward it to the Kamloops School. May I point out that Indian residential schools in British Columbia have actually had preferred treatment for many years as regards vocational training. This was made possible by the B.C. Special appropriation which has permitted us to provide funds toward the salary of vocational instructors and the purchase of tools and material. The Indian residential schools in other provinces of Canada do not enjoy this advantage. We are carefully studying the progress of the work in the Alberta schools this year and it is quite possible that we will consider placing the programme in other residential schools during the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that I am in receipt of a requisition for tools and supplies for the Kamloops Indian Residential School, on which quotations have been secured as follows:\n\n|                | Power Tools | Hand Tools | Material |\n|----------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n| Woodwards Stores Ltd. | $354.15     | $82.85     | $32.19   |\n| McLennan, McFeely & Prior | $346.66     | $73.39     | $31.31   |\n\nI am informed by the Reverend Principal that he understands the Department has set aside sufficient funds for this purpose to cover the expenditure.\n\nIt has been found necessary to secure an amended quotation as the original price given by Woodwards Stores Ltd. is on a lathe that has since been sold out. Also, it was found that the lathe quoted on did not include the bench, which is considered a necessity with this tool.\n\nI consider the quotation of Woodwards Stores Ltd. of $354.15 for the machine tools should be considered as it covers Walker-Turner products, which are thought to be superior to the Delta tools quoted on by McLennan, McFeely & Prior at a cost of $346.66. The latter firm have quoted the lowest price on the hand tools and material of equal quality and, if accepted, would make the total cost $458.85.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\n\nJanuary 22, 1942.\n\nIn view of the increasing difficulty in securing tools of this nature due to war requirements, I would recommend consideration of the application and request advice by air mail if approved by the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to tools and supplies for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of the hand tools and material required for the vocational training class. It is noted that these can be secured at a total cost of $114.70.\n\nRegarding the power tools, I feel that Inspector Barry and yourself should study the list very carefully. It should be kept in mind that in the vocational classes at our residential schools we are endeavouring to give training which will fit the boys for carrying on work when they return to their home reserves. With this in mind, I believe that the use of hand tools should be stressed. It will only be in very rare cases that power tools will be available on any Indian reserve. The list of power tools should, therefore, be very carefully reviewed and if, due to special circumstances, you consider some or all of the power tools requested should be supplied you may arrange for their purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Dalgleish & Sons $62.73 \" \"\n\nMaterials:\nInland Building Supplies Ltd $168.01\nKamloops Lumber Co., Ltd. $168.01\n\nfrom which it will be observed that the quotation of Woodward Stores Ltd. for $607.79 is the lowest for the tools, and the two lumber firms in Kamloops quote exactly the same price for materials; namely, $168.01.\n\nIf funds are available for this purpose, I would recommend favourable consideration of the application, as the school has now under construction a very large manual training shop in which it should be possible to accommodate all of the boy pupils at one time, thus considerably extending the manual training instruction of the school. This building is two stories high, the ground floor to be used for instruction in repairs to machinery, etc., and the upper floor for woodworking. In my opinion, the quality of the instruction given these crafts by the school has been very good.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

If this is possible, it would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Woodward Stores Limited that it was ascertained by them that they could not secure replacement of this stock from the manufacturers under our priority rating of A.10, which they state is only for maintenance of major equipment already in use and that any new major equipment must have the proper rating attached to the order before they can secure such replacement, this rating requiring to be A.3 or higher.\n\nAs this question is also likely to arise in connection with supplies for other Residential Schools, it would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me if it is possible to secure the necessary priority in order to enable this firm to replace these articles on their shelves.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 25, 1942.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n- Re: Manual training tools, Kamloops Res. School -\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant in which you intimate that Messrs. Woodward Stores, Limited, have not succeeded in securing replacements for the tools supplied by them to the above-noted school.\n\nI must confess that I am personally incapable of following in any intelligent sense the rules and regulations issued from day to day in respect to preferences, priorities, priority ratings and thousands of other regulations that appear to be in force at the present time. However, the officials of the Purchasing Division, to whom your letter was referred, inform me that this firm can replenish their stocks by making application for and filling in Form PD-IX.\n\nR. A.

Special, and the Department will be advised immediately following the receipt of this information here.\n\nThe attached requisition for the Kamloops Indian Residential School was submitted early in January, but the school was requested to furnish information on certain items as the quantities asked for appeared excessive. Reductions have been made in certain cases. Prices have been secured on the materials, etc., required which indicate that the total cost involved would come in the neighbourhood of $625.00, of this amount, the power tools would cost $265.00.\n\nAn item of $600.00 was included in the current year's Estimates for manual training equipment and supplies for the Kamloops School and, as the Principal has reported that the equipment and materials are required for construction in connection with the manual training building itself and the completion of articles being made in the manual training classes, I would recommend that the purchase of as much as possible of this requisition be approved. If approval is given, it is intended to purchase the power tools from Woodwards Limited, Vancouver, who have earmarked items in stock for us, and\n\n(over)\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nJanuary 4, 1944\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nKAMLOOPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nVOTE...79.B.C..Special Allotment.\n\nSHIP TO...Reverend Principal, Kamloops Indian Residential School\n\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nPurpose for which required: Tools and supplies for manual training department.\n\nNote.\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nConsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Description                                      | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 1 doz.   | Thin Straight Nose Pliers                        |            |       |\n| 2 \"      | Nail Sets 3/32 C.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding material and equipment requested for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI have noted particularly the section of your letter which refers to the purchase of power tools. While the Department realizes that the use of such tools saves considerable time, we are also of the opinion that their use would not provide the training which it is most desirable for Indian boys to obtain. When all is said and done few, if any, of them will have power tools available when they return to their home reserve and, if they have got into the custom of using them, they will not be so likely to put forth the extra effort required in the use of hand tools.\n\nA further thought that I feel we should keep definitely in mind is whether we are operating a vocational room for the training of pupils or a repair room for work required around the school. I realize that for the latter use power tools would be very desirable, but I think you will agree with me that our definite purpose in encouraging vocational training is to prepare the Indian pupils for after life. With the above in mind the Department is not prepared, at the present time, to authorize the purchase of power tools for the vocational training building at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I note from your letter\nthat the cost of the materials and equipment, other than power tools, would be approximately $360 and authority is granted for an expenditure of that amount. The account, to which your purchase order should be attached, should reach us before the end of March and should read \"Pay from B.C. Special.\"\n\nOn reviewing the requisition it is noted that the school authorities are considering the purchase of flake glue and glue pot. I feel that the manual training instructor at this school should carefully consider the advantages of using casein glue.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKamloops Indian Residential School\n\nKamloops, B.C.\nFebruary 13th 1944.\n\nMr. H.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor:\n\nWith reference to the requisition, dated December 21st last, for a Drill Press, a built-in Motor Grindstone and a Disk Sander Machine for the Manual Training Division of this School, I would like to point out that this equipment is necessary along with the other power tools given by the Department two years ago. While the technical training of the boys consists chiefly in the proper use of hand tools, the older among them are very anxious to learn the operation of power tools, the knowledge of which will be very useful to them after School. This year, the boys, under the direction of the Manual Trainer, have undertaken the project of making twenty spinning wheels, which will be given to the senior girls graduating in June. The girls have become very proficient in the carding and spinning of wool and it is felt that if they are given spinning wheels to take home with them, they will make good use of them and will benefit by the training they acquired in School. For the construction of the spinning wheels the Drill Press and Sander Machine are necessary. The built-in Motor Grindstone is necessary for the proper care and sharpening of tools which cannot be done thoroughly by hand.\n\nFor the above reasons I would be grateful if the Department would give us the tools in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"F. O'GRADY\" O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 154-0-11\n\nI have to refer to your letter of February 7th regarding the application submitted by Reverend Father O'Grady for equipment and power tools for the manual training division of the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal was advised of the Department's views with respect to the purchase of power tools and I enclose for your information a copy of his letter of February 18th requesting that further consideration be given to this particular matter for the reasons stated.\n\nAlthough it is true that in the great majority of cases Indians will not for some years have power equipment for use in their homes and workshops, nevertheless, where power is available the tendency to provide themselves with such equipment is quite noticeable and as the use expands in white settlements there will, no doubt, be a proportionate increase in this direction on neighbouring Reserves. Apart from this, however, instruction in the use of power equipment should be helpful to them in seeking employment off their Reserves, especially where such equipment is in use.\n\nThe extent to which the instruction in the use of hand tools should be given is, of course, the responsibility of the Principal of the school and manual training instructor who should see to it that emphasis is laid on this particular division of the training. The presence of power equipment in the manual\ntraining division need not to any important extent interfere with the course of instruction desired by the Department, but could be employed in such a way that instruction in its use could be very helpful to the students when they return to their homes.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the instruction in the use of power tools would be of considerable benefit to the Indian student and I should appreciate the Department's further consideration of this application and also the one submitted on behalf of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, reference your letter 167-18-11 of February 18th. Please let me have a reply by air mail at your early convenience.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant\nand, in view of your recommendation and the\ncontents of your letter it has been decided to\napprove the purchase of the motor grindstone,\ndisk sander machine and drill press. While\napproval for the purchase of these machines is\nbeing given, the Department is still strongly\nof the opinion contained in my letter of February\n7. It is, therefore, hoped that the Principal\nwill keep our wishes in mind and make certain\nthat the use of power tools will not interfere\nwith the other instruction that we consider\nshould be given to the vocational training\nclass.\n\nR.A.

W. Truitt\n- Vice-President: Mr. H. B. Hartney\n- Secretary-Treasurer: Mr. W. M. Smith\n- Chairman: Mr. W. M. Smith\n\nThese figures are the minimum obligations in each case. Finances will be discussed at length and he would not look on this as a successful form until such time as the party has been organized.\n\nEvery section of the unit has been represented by Mr. J. W. Truitt, who has been working hard throughout the year, and he has found that local Victory Loan workers are very enthusiastic and interested in the quota.\n\nLiberals at Coast Meeting\n\nKamloops Liberal Association was represented at the meeting of the Liberal party at Vancouver Tuesday by Keith Maclellan, Mr. E. D. Murray, Mr. R. H. Carson, M.L.A., and Mr. T. J. O'Neil, M.P.\n\nNow in India\n\nMr. D. E. McPherson, 334 Nicola Street, has just returned from overseas after three and one-half years abroad. Mr. McPherson, of the Provincial Police city detachment, was stationed in India, where he was charged with breaking and entering, and was arrested for the first time. He probably assisted the robbery of the store.\n\nComing down Victoria Street about noon yesterday afternoon, Const. MacColl saw a man on the sidewalk near the Mallery Drug Store who appeared to be drunk. As he drew near the man, another man came out of the drug store. Const. MacColl tried to arrest the man, but found him to be drunk. He called the police, but his companions were not there.\n\nMurdah was broken into sometime between midnight and 2:30 this morning by burglars or burglars apparently using an axe to break (Continued on Page Two)\n\nGreater Emphasis Being Placed at Indian School on Technical Training: Boys Learn Farming, Mechanics; Girls, Home Arts\n\nMany accounts of the many accomplishments of the boys and girls attending the Kamloops Indian Residential School have been received. The school offers technical training classes for the boys and girls who attend the school. The boys are trained in farming, mechanics, and shoe repairing. The girls are trained in home arts, such as sewing, knitting, and cooking.\n\n1000 Indians Visit Children at School Here; Enjoy Concert\n\nFrom raw wool to finished sweaters, the students at the Kamloops Indian Residential School have been busy during the Easter concert. The Indian girls have been busy shearing sheep, washing them, feeding them, and spinning yarn on spinning wheels, and weaving it into fabric.\n\nTag Day Saturday for Merchant Seamen\n\nTag Day will be held Saturday for merchant seamen. The Tag Day Committee will give the general public an opportunity to purchase tickets for the benefit of the merchant marine by purchasing tickets.\n\nReducing Hazards\n\nThe whole subject,\" said the letter writer, \"is a big one, and will need a good deal of thought.\"\n\nNorth Kamloops is growing fast and is definitely a valuable area.\n\nNo Criminal Cases For Kamloops Assizes\n\nThere are no criminal cases for the Kamloops assizes. The Kamloops assizes will be held on May 6th.\n\nPromotion for Murray Barbour\n\nMurray Barbour, who has been associated with the branch of Mackenzie, White & Dunsmuir, wholesale concern, for many years, has been promoted to sales representative for the company. He will continue to make his home here.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG LO Volume 6451, file 882-11 part 2)\nCanada's Indians Nobly Upholding Traditions\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 Canada's Indians are nobly upholding the traditions of their race in the war effort. According to preliminary figures compiled by the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, over 1,400 Indians have already enlisted in the armed forces. The number is expected to be increased considerably as more Indians come forward throughout the country. There are approximately 600 Indian enlistments reported so far, according to the department. Some Canadians, Indians say, are serving in the American air force and may be striking down the enemy with bombs dropped from the tomahawk which they forbore to use in battle.\n\nAccording to the official records of the department, more than 4,000 Indians have served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the war. These Indians represented approximately 30 per cent of the Indian male population of military age.\n\nThe first recruit of the Indians to the war was appointed in a particularly fine manner. The Indians remembered that their services were entirely voluntary and that they were exempted from the provisions of the military service act.\n\nThe Indians, who gave an excellent account of themselves at the Royal Military College, distinguished themselves most highly for their courage, intelligence, efficiency, thoroughness, loyalty, enthusiasm, and impartiality. They were second to none in their work and their civil life and in consequence were most magnificent. As a result of this excellent record, they rendered valuable service as officers and men in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.\n\nMany Indians in Canada's Forces; Brave Fighters\n\nC.P.R. Has Many Projects Ready for Post-War Days\n\nVANCOUVER \u2014 Quite confident of his mission, though uncertain in the outcome of the war and in its aftermath, Mr. W. M. Neel, O.B.E., president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Montreal, has returned from Europe and the British Isles (London). Mr. Neel's mission was to make certain that there would be no prevarication concerning the young people of Canada and the United States. His belief is that rural electrification will play a part in the post-war period, the latter being made possible by the saving of energy in the form of hydroelectric power.\n\nIn northern British Columbia and Alberta, he said, they have vast areas of arable land where crops can be grown under more comfortable conditions than they are on the prairies. You have more coal and better transportation facilities than ever before. You have everything to make life abundant and worthwhile and you are able to hold your own in the world.\n\nNOW SHIPPING LAMB TO UNITED KINGDOM\n\nHon. James O. Chipperfield, minister of Agriculture, announced that the Meat Board is now making shipments of a quantity of lamb to the United Kingdom in response to a recent order from the Ministry of Food. The shipments, which were made last week, included considerable quantities of mutton.\n\nUnder the present arrangement, the government is able to dispose of surplus stocks of meat for shipment to the United Kingdom, and the market for Canadian mutton has been strengthened.

The mill is nearing completion but we still require a power unit for its operation. I have obtained prices on different types of equipment and whether an electric or mechanical unit is installed it will cost $1500. We are at present building a root cellar and will need approximately $500 more for materials to complete it. If the sawmill were in operation we could cut lumber to finish the root cellar and the $500 could thus be saved.\n\nWhatever assistance the Department can give us at this date towards the installation of the equipment necessary for the completion of the mill will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 14, 1945.\n\nDear Father O'Grady:\n\nI discussed your letter of the first instant with Mr. Hoey and we are writing to Indian Commissioner MacKay, authorizing an expenditure of $500.00 for a power unit for the sawmill. You should therefore supply Commissioner MacKay with full particulars regarding the equipment you require.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend F.

We promised to give him what assistance we could, and on receipt of a recent letter from him it was decided to allow an amount of $500.00.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIn connection with the Manual Training Extension Project from this School, which will take the form of constructing new houses chiefly for ex-pupils on the Reserves, I would advise that we will be prepared to construct twenty of these houses in the next fiscal year. At present, at the request of Major MacKay the Indian Commissioner for B.C., we are undertaking to build two three room houses on the Douglas Indian Reserve No.8 according to the following specifications, which would be the same for the twenty houses in question:\n\n- Foundations sills 6 x 6 set on cement blocks 8' apart\n- Floor joists 2 x 6\n- Floor to be double ply shiplap with paper between inside sheathing, shiplap\n- Outside shiplap and \"V\" joint siding with paper between\n- Four windows size 24\" x 24\" sections, 2 lights each\n- Four doors, main door being 216\" x 618\" with a window light\n- Three doors 216\" x 616\"\n- Brick chimney set on wall bracket with minimum 22\" outside\n- Solid sheeted roof with cedar shingles\n- Porch roof over main entrance\n- Inside and outside trim on doors and windows\n- Two coats of white paint with green trim on exterior\n- Roof to be shingle stained and oiled.\n- Cement steps to main entrance.\n\nThe cost of these houses, as for those on the Douglas I. R. No.8, would be $1700.00 per completed unit. We had to allow a certain amount to cover transportation to the above Reserve because of the distance but that would be offset by the recent rise in the price of materials making the cost of construction now in this area approximately the same.\n\nWhen preparing the estimates for the next fiscal year I would appreciate your including the amount required for the building of these twenty houses as a Manual Training Extension Project from this School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 6, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter from the Reverend Father O'Grady, Principal of the Kamloops Residential School. It would be appreciated if we could have your comments on Father O'Grady's proposal. As you allocate our Housing Appropriation money for B.C., it is felt that we might benefit from your experience.\n\nAs you are aware, it is the policy of the Department that the individual Indian who benefits from the house, should contribute as much as possible to his new home in the way of labour, materials, etc. Our programme in the Maritimes calls for the benefiting Indian to do everything possible to construct his own home.\n\nBernard F.

Father O'Grady, Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, with respect to the construction of Indian homes, it is felt that although we should take advantage of the facilities available for the construction of homes by the Kamloops Residential School we should not make any commitment with regard to a definite number of homes or an expenditure of a definite amount as we are not in a position at the moment to assess the housing needs of the province as a whole. Moreover I am unable to see the need of doing this as whatever is possible along the lines suggested could be arranged when the extent of the funds available for housing is made known.\n\nI would not recommend, therefore, that any portion of the amount allotted to the housing division of the Welfare Vote in the 1948-49 Estimates be earmarked for the Manual Training Extension Project of the Kamloops School as requested by the Principal.\n\nD.

These items are of a type which would be found only in a very well equipped garage and would require in some cases expert knowledge for their operation.\n\nAlthough the Kamloops School has a considerable amount of mechanical equipment it is doubtful if the Department would be warranted in supplying this elaborate equipment, even for the amount of maintenance work which is likely to be done at the School.\n\nW.S.

This Report is to be sent to the Department of Mines and Resources, Training Division, at the end of each teaching month.\n\n2. Operations Learned and Grade obtained is secured from the Student Record Sheet. Use the number of the operation - not the name.

The Report is signed by the Instructor and the Principal.\n\nNote: If no instruction has been given during the month, state so on the report and give the reason for not being able to give any instruction.\n\nThis Report is to be used for all manual training activities: Sewing, Cooking, Metal Work, Gardening, Woodwork, etc.\n\n(a) Label the Report according to the activity on which you are reporting. Insert the activity just before the \"Month\".\n\n(b) In the space provided for the year insert 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, representing the year on the Basic Chart on which the pupil is working.\n\n(c) Write the number only of the basic operation satisfactorily mastered and the grade obtained. Example: IB, GA, 12C, etc., as the case may be.

Operations Learned and Grade obtained is secured from the Student Record Sheet. Use the number of the operation - not the name. Example: John Jones 4A-6B-8C-10, etc. The 4 stands for the operation; the A for the standing obtained; B would stand for the operation; B for the grade or standing obtained, and so on (see Foreword for Job Sheets).\n\n3. The Report is signed by the Instructor and the Principal.\n\nNote: If no instruction has been given during the month, state so on the report and give the reason for not being able to give any instruction.\n\nThis Report is to be used for all manual training activities: Sewing, Cooking, Metal Work, Gardening, Woodwork, etc.\n\n(a) Label the Report according to the activity on which you are reporting. Insert the activity just before the \"Month\".\n\n(b) In the space provided for the year insert 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, representing the year on the basic Chart on which the pupil is working.\n\n(c) Write the number only of the basic operation satisfactorily mastered and the grade obtained. Example: IB, SA, 12C, etc., as the case may be.

This Report is to be sent to the Department of Mines and Resources, Training Division, at the end of each teaching month.\n\n2. Operations Learned and Grade obtained is secured from the Student Record Sheet. Use the number of the operation - not the name. Example: John Jones 4A-6B-8C-10 etc. The 4 stands for the operation; the A for the standing obtained; 6 would stand for the operation; B for the grade or standing obtained, and so on (see Foreword for Job Sheets).\n\n3. The Report is signed by the Instructor and the Principal.\n\nNote: If no instruction has been given during the month, state so on the report and give the reason for not being able to give any instruction.\n\nThis Report is to be used for all manual training activities: Sewing, Cooking, Metal Work, Gardening, Woodwork, etc.\n\n(a) Label the Report according to the activity on which you are reporting. Insert the activity just before the \"Month\".\n\n(b) In the space provided for the year insert 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, representing the year on the Basic Chart on which the pupil is working.\n\n(c) Write the number only of the basic operation satisfactorily mastered and the grade obtained. Example: IB, 8A, 12C, etc., as the case may be. A stands for excellent, very good; B for good, fair; and C for poor.\n| Registration No | Pupils' Names       | Age | Grade | Operations Learned & Grade | Time Devoted | Objects Made - If Any |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----|-------|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| 746             | Walter S.

This type of equipment is recommended by this office not only because it has been suggested for the Vancouver schools but also because of the limited space in the room provided for a Science Laboratory. Provision of a work bench of this type will make possible the use of the Science Laboratory for other purposes. Authorization of the purchase of these is strongly recommended.\n\nIn view of the limited time before the opening of the school term, an early decision by the Department will be appreciated.\n\nW. S.

Mclean, Esq.,\nacting Deputy Minister,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mclean:\n\nI had some talk with Mr. Fulton, M.P.,\nand the principal of the Kamloops School, about the\npurchase of a bull. I would be favourable to this\npurchase under the circumstances. The irrigation\nplant which we installed there has given them such\na quantity of feed that they must improve their\nstock, similarly at the Lytton School I would be in\nfavour of giving them another team of horses, as they\ncannot now work their farm to advantage, and an in-\ncrease in the produce of the farm, simply means that\nwe will have to give them less cash.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan G.

Dr. Tolmie suggesting that his Department might either make a gift of the bull or reduce its price to your Department, and enclose for your information a copy of my letter to him.\n\nAbout a week ago I went over to the Industrial School and was shown over the barn and the crops by Father McGuire, and what I saw there was a revelation. He has I should think, over 80 acres in crop,\u2014alfalfa, oats, barley, corn, potatoes etc. all looking well. At the time I was over he was cutting his second crop of alfalfa, which was about as heavy a crop as I have seen. He tells me he has already filled the barn with the alfalfa and has to stack his oats and barley outside. The corn he intends to cut for ensilage.\nand I would think he will easily fill his silo with same. The root crops were looking splendid. There is a little alkali in the soil in places and potatoes do not seem to do well where this shows, but with the irrigation the alkali is being washed out. He certainly has made a wonderful change at the Industrial School.\n\nThe barn was clean and well kept, and he had a few head of cattle in same but only three or four. His idea is to increase the number of stock, and he certainly has far more feed on hand than he can use with the present number and unless he gets more stock he will have to sell the greater part of the feed on hand.\n\nI would urge that your Department should comply with Father McGuire's request with regard to this bull. If the Department of Agriculture can see their way to make a concession to your Department with regard to the price, it would probably help.\n\nI understand from Father McGuire that you purpose coming out this way, possibly next month, and hope I shall see you here if you do come.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFJF/D\n\nEnc\nKamloops, B.C., 542546\n\n19th Aug. 1920.\n\nHon.

The oldest one was born November 3rd, 1929 and will be fit for use in a herd of say a dozen cows during the coming winter. I enclose herewith an extended pedigree of this young bull which contains considerable information about his ancestors. I also enclose a photo of his sire, his sire's dam and his dam's dam. These two cows are two of the best cows we ever owned in the herd. The dam of this calf is at present on test and in 271 days has given 13,766 pounds of milk. She is also testing exceedingly well and is doing well at present. She has a maternal sister that gave over 19,000 pounds of milk as a two year old and 842 pounds of butter.\n\nOur dam, Lady Lyons Fairfort, is a fine, big, strong, robust cow, as her picture denotes and will easily make over 20,000 pounds of milk this year. The breeding of this calf I consider is of the very best. You will notice that he is line bred in the blood of Sir Canary Macintosh. This is the old bull that used to be owned by Mr. J. H. Steves, and one of the best that was ever owned in Canada. The price on this calf is $300.00, cash, crated, f.o.b. Agassiz and registered in the purchaser's name.\n\nThe second calf we have for sale was born on February 9th, 1929, and will be old enough for limited service after Christmas.

Agassiz and registered in the purchaser's name.\n\nThe second calf we have for sale was born on February 9th, 1920, and will be old enough for limited service after Christmas. His dam, as a two year old, produced 12,707 pounds of\nmilk and 492 pounds of butter in 340 days. She has just recently completed a seven day four year old record of 536.4 pounds of milk and 19.25 pounds of butter. She is a fine, big, straight young cow but has not the record behind her that some of our other cows have. The sire of her calf is a son of Lady Lyons Faforit, the cow of which I enclose a photo. He is sired in turn by Inka Sylvia Beets Ponch, the sire of the famous May Echo Sylvia. From this you will see that the sire of this second calf is a half brother to May Echo Sylvia. We are retaining this sire in our herd at present. On account of this calf being somewhat younger than the first mentioned calf and not having quite as strong a pedigree on the dam's side the price on him is $200. cash, crated, f. o. b. Agassiz and registered in the purchaser's name.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the fact that our herd is on the Accredited list and has not had tuberculosis now for over seven years. I consider this a great factor to take into consideration when purchasing breeding stock. I should like to know at your earliest convenience whether you decide to buy one of these bulls or not so that if not, I shall be able to offer them elsewhere. The breeding is good and the animals are fit to go at the head of most pure bred herds.\n\nWe have no females for sale at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. H. Hicks\n\nH/A Superintendent.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nSeptember 3rd, 1920.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nacting Deputy Minister,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear McLean:\n\nI had some talk with Mr. Fulton, M.P., and the principal of the Kamloops school, about the purchase of a bull. I would be favourable to this purchase under the circumstances. The irrigation plant which we installed there has given them such a quantity of feed that they must improve their stock; similarly at the Lytton School I would be in favour of giving them another team of horses, as they cannot now work their farm to advantage, and an increase in the produce of the farm, simply means that we will have to give them less cash.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan Cl Scott.\nOttawa, September 14, 1920.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nSome time ago the Department received through Mr. Fulton a request that you be allowed to purchase a Holstein Bull from the Experimental Farm for British Columbia. It was not considered advisable to deal with this matter in Mr. Scott's absence, but he now writes that he is favourable to the purchase. If the two animals to which Mr. Hicks, the Superintendent of the Farm, referred in his letter to you of August 13, last, are still available, you may purchase whichever you consider the more suitable, and forward the account to the Department for payment through the Indian Agent.\n\nMr. Fulton, when writing to the Department, made the suggestion that the Department of Agriculture might make some concession to this Department by way of reduction in the price of this animal, in view of the purpose for which it was to be used. You will endeavour to obtain the very best terms possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

We need this animal, but we hope to coax him along quietly.\n\nThanking you kindly,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\nJames McQuire, M.D.\n\nMr. A. F.

When the value of milk is taken into consideration, you can easily grasp the value of this animal to us as foundation and continuation of our milking herd.\n\nThrough the kind intervention of Mr. Fulton M.P., the price fell from three to one hundred. I have written to thank him for it. You will oblige me much by assuring Mr. A.H. MacKenzie of your office that his suggestions of Sep. 4th have been complied with with the above result.\n\nWith renewal of thanks,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames McCauley O.M.S.\n\nMr. Duncan E.

S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. James McGuire, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKamloops Industrial School,\nKamloops, B.C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn January 5th we lost eight calves into the Thompson River. Our Farm Instructor, Mr. Hutchings, a good stockman, was taking fifty cattle up to his own ranch to winter. With the boys he proceeded about ten miles and feeding the cattle left them overnight. Being range stock they jumped down a ten foot bank in the morning and went to the open water to drink. Twenty-four of them broke through and went under, eight of them being ours; calves fortunately.\n\nA couple of days later, the Bull which you gave us dropped dead as the boys were leading him to water! He was bled and dressed for examination. Upon opening him they found a small piece of steel wire, evidently from the stable iron; it had pierced his stomach and touched his heart. \"Carelessness?\" I asked the Veterinary. \"Not at all; go on and use the broom; it may not happen again in a hundred years.\"\n\nBoth of these were losses, but fortunately we have felt neither of them because we owe nothing on our cattle. In buying we are conservative. Besides, the calves now coming replace the others.\n\nIt would prove expensive to buy a Holstein Bull now fit for service. See enclosure. We might try to shift in some way for this season. Would the Department help us to the extent of fifty dollars? We would\nbuy a calf a few months old, pay the balance ourselves,\nand bide our time.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to know that\nwe are satisfied with all our stock; it is well\nand improving daily.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\nJames McQuire & Co.\n\nMr. Duncan E. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOTTAWA, March 1st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nAt the request of Rev. Jas. McGuire, Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School, this Department will pay the sum of $50.00 towards the cost of purchasing a bull calf to replace the animal which died.\n\nThe Reverend Principal is being informed that this grant can only be paid when funds are available from the appropriation for the new fiscal year, and that he is to forward to you accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the calf. You will be good enough to attach these to proper vouchers forms for the amount of the Department's grant to the extent of $50.00, and forward to the Department when payment will be made.\n\nRev. Father McGuire has been informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn F.

Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn of the loss occasioned the Kamloops Industrial School by the death of 3 calves and the death of the bull.\n\nRegarding your request that a grant of $50.00 be allowed to purchase a Holstein bull calf, I beg to say that the Department will provide this amount as soon as funds are available from the appropriations for the new fiscal year.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to forward accounts, in duplicate, to Mr. Agent Smith, covering the expenditure incurred by you in the purchase of this animal, and the Department will pay $50.00 as its share of the cost. As stated, this amount cannot be paid until the new fiscal year, or after April 1st, next.\n\nMr. Agent Smith is being informed of the allowance being made for the purchase of this calf.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The price is Twenty Five Dollars. He had the kindness to assure us the use of his Bull for this season. For the sake of economy we will accept his offer and put up with the inconvenience this summer. The account will come through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nWe are both satisfied and pleased with the arrangement made for us by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire o.m.s.\n\nMr. J.D.

I can hardly consider this misfortune as inaptable to us, as all stockmen assure us that this will happen once in a thousand cases.\n\nThis animal is very cheap; the milk required to raise him would be worth almost the price. We lay great stress upon milk for our children. We have been very fortunate in having a good supply so far, and we feel that the only way of being sure of a constant supply is to keep the breeding up to a good standard. It is with this end in view that I am presenting this request through you to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter this day received from Rev.

In reply I have to inform you that, in 1920, the Department purchased for this institution a young bull and, in 1922, a bull calf. It is the practice to ask schools to make replacements from their per capita or other earnings. Please inform the Rev. Principal.

Casilda.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Feb. 18, 1926.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nThe enclosed clipping from the Catholic Register has nothing unusual about it; but it does bring to our mind the value set upon milk by children's welfare societies, and the difficulty encountered by honest working men in having milk for their children.\n\nIn view of that value, and of that difficulty, and in view of the pains and expense met by the Department in supplying us with a pump and dairy barn, the enclosed figures regarding butter made at the school possess a certain eloquence. I have some vague recollection of a certain disaster a year ago sweeping away beds, clothes, churns, dishes and separator, which explains the low rate of January and February.\n\nThere are now coming into the house about four hundred pounds, or forty gallons, or one hundred and sixty quarts of milk daily. This provides about one quart a day for each individual. We consider this supply very satisfactory. I think that if the Department could see the pale little faces coming into school, and like us, a month later see the rounded cheeks and bright eyes of our little wards, they would know how we appreciate this supply of fresh milk; they would feel some satisfaction in realizing that their efforts to supply this abundance have not been in vain.\n\nOn his tours of inspection Mr. Cairns has always complimented us on the healthy looks of our children and encouraged us to continue to adhere to milk as an important factor in maintaining health among our pupils. And Colonel Pragnell, the Inspector of Indian Agencies, likewise, has always held that we could make no mistake in giving milk a prominent place in our commissariat. All our Officers, in fact, have a good word for milk.\n\nThis letter is late, Agent, owing to my search for more copies of the enclosure.\n\nIf you could give this letter and clipping a circuitous route to the Department through the offices of the offices mentioned, and that of our Indian Commissioner, we would be pleased indeed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr' Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nSir,\n\nAt the request of Rev. Father McGuire, Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, I beg to forward you copy of a letter recently received, together with a statement of the amount of butter made at the School during the year 1925, together with a newspaper cutting, which he has also requested me to forward to you.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F.

I have obtained a price of 60\u00a2 per cubic yard for this work from the J. Milton Estate which I consider very reasonable indeed.\n\nIn addition to this it is probable that the Indians would require some payment for the earth, but, no doubt, you can arrange this with them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) J.

For the information of the Department, I beg to enclose copy of Mr. Hodgson's report.\n\nYou will note that he states it will be necessary to haul about 3500 cubic yards of earth for this fill, and the price he has obtained is sixty cents per cubic yard. Mr. Hodgson states that he considers this a reasonable figure. In the last paragraph of his letter he remarks that extra payments to the Indians would be required for the earth. This earth would have to be taken off the portion of the Indian Reserve adjoining the School. The total cost in this case, would be $2100.00 for the earth, and if the Indians were allowed ten cents a load for the earth, it would entail a further cost of $350.00, making a total cost of $2450.00.\n\nThis matter was also discussed with Rev. Father John Duplanil, O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, and he has also submitted conditions under which he would be willing to do the work. Copy of his letter is also herewith attached. You will note that with all the material required to be purchased, according to the Rev. Father's letter, the cost will be approximately $1350. This would mean a saving of at least $1000.00 in connection with the work.\n\nAfter receiving the reports from Mr. John Hodgson and Rev. Father Duplanil, I interviewed Kamloops Motor Co., with reference to the price of Chevrolet Utility Express Truck, the kind that was decided on by Father Duplanil. I submit herewith copy of a letter from Kamloops Motor Co., covering the price of the truck.\n\nIf the Department is prepared to accept Rev. Father Duplanil's offer to do the work on the conditions outlined, I would strongly recommend same, in view of the saving detailed to the Department. I am satisfied that the work will be well done and to our entire satisfaction if the Rev. Principal does the work, as he has a personal interest in seeing that it is well and properly done.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nShould the Department take advantage of his offer, I would recommend that the Department authorize me to purchase this truck by wiring me to that effect, as it is getting late in the season, and all of this work that can be done before the frost commences here will be of great advantage.\n\nThere is no doubt that the work has to be done in order to complete the building at the School, and I do not know of any way in which it can be done at a lower figure than that quoted by Rev. Father John Duplanil, Principal of the School.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Ewen MacLeod]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEM/S.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nDec. 3, 1928.\n\nIn connection with the boys' wing nearing completion at the Kamloops School a large quantity of filling will be required along the front of the building, in order to maintain the grade line of the existing buildings. The Indian agent has obtained a price for the supplying and hauling of the necessary filling which amounts to $2,500.00. He also interviewed the Rev. Father Duplanil, Principal of the School, who states that he is willing to undertake this work without cost to the Department, providing he is supplied with a Chevrolet one ton truck, a scraper, shovels, picks, etc., the total cost of which would be $1,350.00. After the completion of the filling work the truck would be of great assistance to the School to enable them to haul coal, wood, and for other work around the school. Father Duplanil's offer appears to me to be very reasonable, and as it is necessary that the filling be provided I beg to recommend that the Indian Agent be authorized to purchase the truck and other equipment required.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAre there any special instructions in purchase of truck.\n\nArchitect.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 832-14 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDec. 6, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to the filling necessary in front of the new wing of the Kamloops School, and I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation that the Principal be supplied with a truck and other equipment necessary to enable him to do the grading.

A similar question has been raised at practically all Indian Residential Schools and the same policy as mentioned in the preceding sentence has been adopted.\n\nRegarding the question asked in the third and fourth paragraphs of your letter I believe that as the school management owns the car they will have to make necessary arrangements to protect themselves from any liability as a result of an accident. I may add that the Crown does not accept the responsibility for accidents occasioned by Government owned motor vehicles as it takes the position that in any wrongful act of the driver the Crown is not responsible for the torts of its agents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

April 22, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nFor the past five years many of our graduating students have expressed the desire of continuing their studies beyond the eighth grade but due to lack of classroom space we have not been able to accede to their requests except in individual cases. By September of this year we shall have thirty-two students who could follow a high school course. To accommodate these numbers we feel now that it is urgent to have a separate high school building where a complete course of studies could be given equal to what is being given in regular high schools attended by white pupils. The building should be large enough to provide for the needs, not only of the first year pupils but also for those who wish to complete the twelfth grade. It also should be of a style and structure in keeping with the modern main building.\n\nIn view of the above it is proposed that a building of approximately the same size and construction as the Cowichan Indian Consolidated Day School at Duncan, B.C., be erected here on the school property. I submitted the plans of this school to an architect requesting that he estimate the cost of constructing a similar building with running water, washrooms and lavatories and radiators in all rooms fed from our main heating system. The total cost, he said, would be $2200.00. There is difficulty, of course in these times, to secure materials but since we have a sawmill the lumber for the forms and framework could be cut here. If it is agreeable to the Department we could supervise the construction of the building in the same manner as the new barn six years ago.\n\nBecause of the added expense in conducting a high school and of the larger number of pupils in attendance it would be necessary to allow an increase of thirty in the per capita grant and make provision for the salaries of high school teachers. Although we realize that, in the current year's estimates no provision has been made for these expenses\nand the construction of the building still we hope that the Department will be able to find the necessary funds. We should like, if possible, to have the classrooms ready for September.\n\nBecause of the need of higher education for our Indian boys and girls it is hoped the Department will favorably consider the high school and proceed to the construction of it at an early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"F. O'Grady, O.M.I.\"\nPrincipal\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will no doubt recall that during a recent visit Reverend Father O'Grady, Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, made to the Department the matter of extending the work at Kamloops to include high school instruction was discussed. In recent weeks the Principal has on two occasions discussed this matter with me and has followed these discussions up with a letter requesting that action be taken to erect a suitable building for the purpose, the building suggested being along the lines of the St. Catherine's Indian Day School at Duncan. A copy of Reverend Father O'Grady's letter is attached hereto.\n\nI should say that this is a move that has been contemplated for some time and now that the Indians are demanding high schools and receiving firm support from the public in this regard, the matter is one that should receive early attention. However, unless funds could be provided in the current fiscal year for the construction of a suitable building there would be no point in going fully into the matter at this time. On the other hand if it is possible to secure the amount required or a substantial portion of it this year the Principal would be prepared to undertake construction on a straight cost basis along the lines he employed in connection with the school barn, a project that was carried out at very reasonable cost and with much credit to the Principal and the school. Nearly all the ordinary lumber required in the construction could be purchased from the school mill, thus ensuring the supply of materials so difficult to get from local lumber dealers.\nI am convinced that accommodation for advanced education should be provided as soon as possible and would appreciate being advised if there is any likelihood of the Department being in a position to undertake construction of a suitable high school building at Kamloops this year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFor the past several years we felt we should have had a high school for our graduating students most of whom expressed the desire to continue further with their studies. The Indian parents frequently have mentioned to me that they would like their children to go to high school so that they would be able to compete with white boys and girls of their own age who have had the benefits of higher education. In general I would say the desire to proceed with higher studies has, in late years, become widespread throughout this Province. I discussed in detail with Indian Commissioner Mackay the matter of erecting a high school in connection with this residential school. He was very much taken with the idea and will submit a plan for the approval of the Department. It was suggested that a building similar in size and construction to the Cowichan Indian Day School at Duncan B.C. be erected here on the school property. It would provide a full high school course up to and including grade XII for all the students who graduate from this school and also for any from the nearby reserves who wish to attend as day pupils. If the Department will provide the funds I will supervise the construction of the building at cost.\n\nI am very interested in having a high school in this area for the benefit of the Indian children and also to meet the criticism of many organizations and public men who say we do not provide high school facilities in general for Indian children. I should like, if possible, to begin the construction of the building at an early date to allow our graduates of this year to commence their high school studies in September.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

Allison Glen,\nMinister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nFor several years we have felt the need of a high school for our graduating students, many of whom have expressed the desire to continue further with their studies. I would say that this need has become more pronounced each year due to the fact that the Indians themselves feel they require higher education in order to take their place among white people today. Their organizations, The Native Brotherhood of B.C. in particular, and other organizations in the Province have been critical of Indian education because no high school facilities at the residential schools are provided for their children. I think the time has come when an effort should be made to provide high school education in this area for the large number of graduates who leave school each year. I discussed the matter in detail with Indian Commissioner MacKay and he is very much in favour of having a high school constructed in connection with this school. It was proposed that a building be erected similar to the Cowichan Indian Day School at Duncan, B.C. It would be large enough to provide for the needs of all the pupils who graduate from this school and also for any who wish to attend as day students from the nearby reserves. It would have classroom space for all the grades up to and including Grade XII. The students could then take a full high school course. I understand Indian Commissioner MacKay will submit the plan in detail for your approval.\n\nI am keenly interested in this high school project. This is the largest Indian Residential School in Canada and I feel\nwe should show leadership in the development of our educational system for the good of our students and also to prove to the public in general that we are doing all in our power for the advancement of the Indians.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 6/46\n\nTo the Acting Deputy Minister:\n\nAtt n: Director of Indian Affairs\n\n---\n\nAttached is a letter to the Minister dated May 2nd (air) from Rev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B.C., dealing with the need for high school facilities for the Indian students in the district.\n\nPlease have a draft letter prepared for the Minister's signature to Father O'Grady.\n\nPrivate Secretary\n\nMr. Hoey:\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, May 10, 1946.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kamloops School, with reference to providing high school facilities at that institution.\n\nThis Branch is sympathetically disposed towards Father O'Grady's suggestion, but, as you realize, it is a distinct change in our former policy and, consequently, the matter will have to receive very careful consideration.\n\nIf the Principal's recommendation were followed, it would involve keeping both boys and girls to a much older age than at present. As you will realize, this would present certain difficulties. It would not be advisable to keep children of high school age in dormitories with younger children. It appears to me that special living accommodation would be necessary. This would involve additional staff, not only during classroom hours but during their free hours. There are many other phases of the situation that would have to receive very careful consideration before we could proceed along the lines Father O'Grady suggests.\n\nI have always felt that when Indian children wish to take high school work it is preferable to have them attend a white high school, provided of course that we can secure some supervision for them in their free hours. Is there a high school in the city of Kamloops? Has any consideration been given to having children reside at the Kamloops Residential School but attend the white high school? Such procedure has been adopted at several Indian residential schools in Manitoba and Ontario and has been satisfactory. In such cases the Department allows an advanced educational grant to cover the extra expense incurred.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would again\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.

Mr. Roey intends to communicate with Major MacKay, and I feel certain that your suggestion will receive very careful consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend F.

Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nOriginal on File 154-0-5\n\nRe: Kamloops Residential School and Reserve\n\n\"The last request of Father O'Grady is for a High School. He claims that Kamloops is sufficiently central for this purpose and he also states that his own school would provide, on the present basis of 8th grade graduates, about 20 pupils per year. As Williams Lake, Lejac, Mission City and Sechelt Schools could also send their 8th Grade pupils to Kamloops, without very great expense, the pupilage of this High School could easily reach from 110 to 130 pupils. This number would provide four classes of about 30 pupils each.\n\n\"Of course, a High School would mean the building of a complete unit and would be fairly costly, but I think it is a practical solution of the High School problem, as far as our B.C. Indians are concerned and one which should receive the immediate attention of the Department.\"\nOttawa, September 6, 1947.\n\nDear Father O'Grady:\n\nWe have received a voucher for $225.00 covering a grant for three High School pupils for the past academic year.

STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Leslie Lewis from September 23rd, 1935 to September 24th, 1935. The immediate cause of death was Status Epilepticus.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was Boy was recovering from measles which probably determined the onset of epileptic attack.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nThe boy was given all possible attention while ill in the school.\n\nAutopsy performed and autopsy report submitted by Dr. A.G. Naismith.\n\nP.S. Tennant M.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of Leslie Lewis have been recorded? Yes. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\nRemarks: The Father, Joe Lewis, in the presence of Dr. Tennant and myself gave his consent to the autopsy being performed. The parents were not present at the enquiry.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nAs an epidemic of measles was indirectly responsible for this death, it might be well to point out that the sleeping accommodation for 285 pupils in the school consists of five dormitories, which are crowded. During an epidemic it is impossible to properly isolate the patients and contacts. The need for separate quarters to house sick children is evident.\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nCopy of notes on Autopsy. Body of Indian boy Leslie Lewis.

This pupil has no school number and did not appear on the quarterly return, ending March 31st last, for the following reason.\n\nThe Principal advises that this girl is a member of the Salmon River Reserve in the Okanagan Agency. Her three sisters are pupils of the School and they returned very late last winter after being home for the summer holidays. Their younger sister, Arcelle, came back with them, but no request had been made for her admission into the school.\n\nThe mother is dead and the father works around and is unable to properly supervise his family. For this reason, efforts to get an application form signed had been unsuccessful, and the child had been carried on the school roster as an extra. When the child took sick, the father was immediately notified and came to Kamloops on the 12th instant, remaining until the 15th, when he returned home. He was immediately notified of the death of his daughter on the 19th instant, and the body was taken, on the 20th instant, by the school car, to the Salmon River Reserve.\n\nThe father was quite satisfied, whilst here, that everything possible was done for his daughter.\n\nH.

Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of Pearl Joe have been recorded? If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\nPearl Joe was paddling in the North Thompson River which flows past the School property. She was with the other school pupils who were under the supervision of one of the sisters. The Principal had issued orders that none of the pupils were to be permitted to swim or to wade beyond shallow water.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nThe Principal concurs with my opinion that no paddling or bathing be permitted under any circumstances in the North Thompson River by the school pupils. A rowboat manned by a competent swimmer should have been in use to patrol the area where the pupils were paddling.\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nKamloops, B.C.\nOctober 14, 1944\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI enclose herewith memorandum of an inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of Pearl JOE, pupil No. O-751 of the Kamloops Indian Residential School and a member of the Hope Band in the Lytton Agency.\n\nThe delay in forwarding this report is due to my being absent on statutory leave when the death took place on September 4th, 1944. Upon my return from leave on September 26th, Dr. Smillie, who was called to attend the child, was absent on his holidays and only returned to duty today.\n\nIn the presence of Dr. Smillie and the Reverend Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential school, the attached report was compiled and signed. The parents of the girl were notified immediately by the school principal and they appeared to be quite satisfied with the explanation given of the cause of death and offered no criticism. The principal forwarded the body to the parents for burial and paid all expenses in connection therewith. It would appear that no one was able to prevent this girl from suddenly swimming beyond her depth, contrary to the instructions issued. The principal admits that a boat should have been in use when the children were paddling and he has forbidden any future use of the river by school pupils. The Coroner did not consider it necessary to hold an inquest or an inquiry. Dr. Smillie was called immediately and answered so promptly that he was at the river when the girl's body was brought ashore. She was apparently a good swimmer and had she kept her head and swum with the current it would have brought her into shore, a short distance down stream from the school. She apparently got panicky and the body was brought ashore by...\nIndian Affairs Branch October 14, 1944\n\nsome soldiers who were swimming from the opposite bank.\n\nH. E.

On Sunday, September 2nd, she complained of headache and vomited. This was attributed by the school staff to over-eating the day before. During Sunday night, the child vomited several times and headache increased. Vomitus was green and mixed with mucus.\n\nThe doctor was notified at 8:30 a.m. on Monday morning, September 3rd, and the child was seen at 9:00 a.m. and sent into hospital, at 9:30 a.m. The child's condition suggested a toxemia. She was complaining of severe headache and pain in the abdomen. She answered questions but was irrational in her replies at times.\n\nNo opisthotonos was present. Tendon reflexes were increased. No Kernig present. Abdomen was flat with generalized tenderness, but no area of acute local tenderness. No pathological signs present in lung examination except an air hunger suggesting a diabetic coma. On sending to hospital, the urine was examined for sugar but only showed a faint positive reaction. The pulse was slow, breathing rapid with apparent air hunger. Temperature 100 degrees F. 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The child died 24 hours after admission to hospital. The main cause of death appeared to be gastro enteritis and cerebral toxemia, probably from poisoning from ingested food.\n\nA family history indicates that other children in the family at home in the Penticton area were suffering from similar symptoms. Enquiries are being made re their condition and food supplies through Dr. George Payne at Penticton.\n\nOn the morning of September 3rd, the patient was seen by Dr. H.B. Burris of Kamloops. Cause of death was given as food poisoning.\n\nF.S.

Two lady instructors are in charge, caring for them physically and morally, training them on domestic lines besides seeing that their daily studies are maintained.\n\nNo other Home is open for them anywhere near that locality; it has been in operation long enough to demonstrate its usefulness. It has received commendation from visitors, including Government officials, and we feel that in asking a per capita grant we are only bringing to your notice one of the objects which it is your desire to help being in what is apparently the most hopeful line for the uplifting of the Indians.\n\nThere is also pressing need of a supply of iron bedsteads, the dormitory capacity of the Home being for thirty-five. Kitamaat having very infrequent communication by sea, we find the procuring of supplies and freight charges excessively heavy, so that we shall be very grateful if the Department can grant...\nthe per capita annual allowance, and also furnish our dormitories.\n\nTrusting that this appeal may meet with early consideration and a generous response\n\nI remain\n\nHonorable Sir\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\n50 Markland Street\nHamilton, Ont.\nNovember 27th, 1905.\nVancouver, January 5th, 1906.\n\nTo the Honorable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed communication was sent to me from the Woman's Missionary Society to be forwarded to you as soon as I felt that I was in a position to do so. It is their desire that I should negotiate this matter to a conclusion as I am on the ground and know the situation. I always visit the home at Kitamaat when on my rounds and I have always found everything connected with this home in perfect order. The girls are thoroughly well cared for and I think it is high time that the W.M.S. should have some help from your Department in carrying on this excellent work.\n\nThere are no regular boats into Kitamaat so that thus far they go in only as they are chartered. It is this that the Ladies refer to when they speak of the charges as being exorbitant. They state that they have had twenty-five girls in residence and that this is about the usual number. As they have stated the case very accurately and have not made any specific request, I would suggest that after seven years of such service as they have rendered that they receive the Boarding School per Capita for twenty girls and that in consideration of the fact that they have built and equipped the school and carried it so far without help from the Department that they have the thirty-five iron beds laid down for them at Kitamaat.\n\nI am sending a copy of this application in triplicate to Mr. Morrow the Indian Agent, so that in due course both he and the Indian Superintendent Mr. Vowell may be in a position to express themselves to you on the matter which will I am sure receive your most favorable consideration.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHon.

Whittington,\nSupt. of Methodist Missions,\nVancouver, B.C.\nTo the honorable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed communication was sent to me by the Roman Catholic Missionary Society to be forwarded to you as soon as I felt that I was in a position to do so. It is their desire that I should negotiate this matter to a conclusion as I am on the ground and know the situation. I always visit the home at Kitamaat when on my rounds and I have always found everything connected with this home in perfect order. The girls are thoroughly well cared for and I think it is high time that the R.M.S. should have some help from your Department in carrying on this excellent work.\n\nThere are no regular boats into Kitamaat so that thus far they go in only as they are chartered. It is this that the Ladies refer to when they speak of the fares rates as being exorbitant. They state that they have had twenty-five girls in residence and that this is about the usual number. As they have stated the case very nicely and have not made any specific request, I would suggest that after seven years of such service as they have rendered that they receive the Boarding School per Capita for twenty girls and that in consideration of the fact that they have built and equipped the school and carried it so far without help from the Department that they have the thirty-five iron beds laid down for them at Kitamaat.\n\nI am sending a copy of this application in triplicate to Mr. Morrow the Indian Agent, so that in his course both he and the Indian Superintendent Mr. Vowell may be in a position to express themselves to you on the matter which will I am sure receive your most favorable consideration.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\nWomen's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church.\n\nTo the Honorable the Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nSir:\n\nOn behalf of the Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, Canada, allow me to present the following facts and plea.\n\nFor seven years the said Society has maintained a Home for Indian girls at Kitamaat B.C., at a cost of about $20,000.00. This past year there have been twenty-five in residence, about the usual number. Two lady instructors are in charge, caring for them physically and morally, training them on domestic lines besides seeing that their daily studies are maintained.\n\nNo other Home is open for them anywhere near that locality; it has been in operation long enough to demonstrate its usefulness; it has received commendation from visitors, including Government officials, and we feel that in asking a per capita grant we are only bringing to your notice one of the objects which it is your desire to help, being in what is apparently the most hopeful line for the uplifting of the Indians.\n\nThere is also pressing need of a supply of iron bedsteads, the dormitory capacity of the Home being for thirty-five beds.\n\nKitamaat having very infrequent communication by steamer, we find the procuring of supplies and freight charges excessively heavy, so that we shall be grateful if the Department can grant us the per capita annual allowance, and also furnish the dormitories.\n\nFrustrating that this appeal may meet with early consideration and a generous response,\n\n50 Markland Street,\nHamilton, Ont.\nNov. 27th, 1906.\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Wm.) S. Sutherland Strachan\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose you copy of letter and correspondence received from Rev Dr Whittington, M.A., regarding the Kitimat Girls' Home and making application for the boarding school per capita grant for this Institution for twenty pupils.\n\nThis Institution is doing the same class of work as the Crosby Girls' Home Port Simpson, and the Girls' branch of the Metlakatla Industrial School. They have very good buildings, nice grounds, and on my visits to Kitimat I have always found everything in connection with this school in a most satisfactory condition.\n\nThe children are taught in the Day School during school hours, and show fair progress and they compare favourably in every way with the pupils of the schools referred to.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department to further assist boarding schools in this Agency I can strongly recommend this Institution to favourable consideration.\n\nThe Indian Girls' from this part of my Agency do not attend either the Port Simpson or the Metlakatla Schools.\n\nRegarding the iron beds asked for, I think if a per capita grant, for (20) twenty pupils at ($60.00) sixty dollars per year is made the Ladies Missionary Society would possible make a grant for this purpose, or this question could stand over for another year, without injury to the school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith a letter, dated the 15th ultimo, received from Mr. Agent Morrow, of the North West Coast Agency, with enclosures referred to therein in which application is made for a grant for 20 pupils at $60.00 per capita per annum for the Kitimat Indian Girls' Home, also for the purchase of 36 iron bedsteads, which would cost, approximately, $420.00 laid down at Kitimat.\n\nAs the Agent has placed the matter under consideration very fully and clearly before the Department I do not see that there is anything for me to add thereto further than to express my approval of the work done at the school by its competent and painstaking management who are deserving of the aid of the Department in the direction sought.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nHon. W. Sloan, Esq., M.P.,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn January the 5th, I sent you a copy of a petition re a grant for the Indian Girl Girls Home at Kitamaat. Mr. Morrow writes me that he has sent the same on to the Dept. and as I presume that Mr. Vowell has done the same I beg to remind you of the fact and again to ask you for your influence in securing this grant.\n\nThanking you in anticipation and hoping that you will drop me a note as to the result,\n\nI remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nR. Whittington.\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose you communication from Rev. Dr. Whittington, of Vancouver, re the petition which was sent to the department some months ago for a grant for the Indian Girls' Home at Kitamaat.\n\nI should be pleased if this would receive your attention.\n\nIn the meantime, Believe me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, March 30, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. Sloan, M.P., forwards a letter from the Rev. Dr. Whittington with regard to a petition which was sent to the Department some time ago for a grant to the Indian Girls' Home at Kitamaat.\n\nThe Department provides for the salary of a day school teacher at this place, and in Mr. Inspector Green's report on the day school there is no mention of boarders being kept there. The school is in charge of Miss Dorothea Bower, M.D.\n\nThe Inspector states that the people strongly wish for a boarding school to remedy the unsatisfactory attendance, which is caused by the pupils having to leave with their parents in the summer months. He also states that the school-house is crude and altogether inadequate for the large number of children, as it allows only twenty cubic feet of air-space for the number in attendance. An addition is contemplated, which will give the necessary room.\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary of the Woman's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church in applying for a grant for the maintenance of twenty pupils states that for seven years the said society has maintained a home for Indian girls at Kitamaat at a cost of about $20,000, and that they have had twenty-five pupils in\nresidence, with two lady instructors in charge.\n\nKitamaat is an out-of-the-way place having irregular communication, and freight charges are very heavy and makes a corresponding increase in the cost of the maintenance of these children.\n\nThey ask also for assistance to purchase thirty-five iron beds, which would cost laid down at Kitamaat about $420, as well as an annual grant of $1,200 for the maintenance of 20 pupils.\n\nMr. Agent Merrow, writing to the Superintendent on this application, states that the institution is doing the same class of work as is done in the Crosby Girls' Home at Port Simpson and the Girls' branch of the Metlakatla Industrial School. He says they have good buildings and nice grounds and on his visits to Kitamaat he has always found everything in connection with the school in a most satisfactory condition. They are taught in the day school during school hours and show fair progress and compare favorably in every way with the pupils in the schools above referred to.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department to increase the number of boarding schools in British Columbia, this application would appear to be worthy of consideration.\nOttawa, April 3, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult., inclosing a communication from the Rev. Dr. Whittington with reference to a petition which was sent to this Department some time ago for a grant to the Indian Girls' Home at Kitamaat, and in reply I beg to say that the petition referred to is under consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWilliam Sloan, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nRev.

The Department has not recognized this School, and pays no grant toward its maintenance; but I would be glad if you would report upon the necessity for medical attendance for the Kitimat Reserve. The claims of the School may be considered later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo, No. 601 L-5, requesting a report upon the necessity for medical attendance for the Kitamiat reserve; replying I beg to report that Miss D. Bower, M.D., informed me on my visit to Kitamiat in June last that considerable sickness prevails among the Indians of this village and that tuberculosis is the predominant disease. Dr. Bower left Kitamiat on Nov. 1st last, after attending to the Indians as medical adviser and school teacher for the last 4 years, and dispensing the drugs supplied by the Department for the use of Indians during that time, since the departure of the Doctor from Kitamiat the Indians have been without a medical attendant to keep this dreaded disease of tuberculosis in check, to do this a visit from a doctor at least once a month is necessary to examine the patients and instruct the present dispenser of the drugs, Rev. J.C. Reddie, who is not a medical man, regarding the treatment of the Indians so afflicted.\n\nTrusting that you will approve of a doctor visiting Kitamiat once a month and that the Department will favorably consider same,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th ultimo asking for a report upon the necessity for medical attendance for the Indians of the Kitimat reserve, North West Coast Agency, B.C., I have the honor to enclose herewith, for the information and consideration of the Department, a communication of the 16th instant, received from Mr. Agent Lorenz stating that since the departure from Kitimat of Dr. Bower the Indians have been without a medical attendant to keep the dreaded disease of tuberculosis in check, to do which he considers a visit from a doctor once a month is necessary to examine the patients and to instruct the present dispenser of drugs, Rev. J. C. Reddick, who is not, he states, a medical man, regarding the treatment of the Indians so afflicted. The Agent omits to state the name of the doctor and his address, who would likely be called upon to make the monthly visit recommended by him. I presume he had in mind when writing the sending to Kitimat of either the department's salaried medical officer at Port Essington or the one at Prince Rupert, these being the medical\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, File 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nmedical practitioners at present the least remote from Kitimat.\n\nIn the absence of having a medical officer permanently on the ground which, perhaps, the Department may not be prepared to sanction, in view of the expense thereby involved, it would appear that the Agent's suggestion of a monthly visit from a physician is possibly the best that can now be thought of under the circumstances, the resident missionary to have on hand for dispensing as required a stock of necessary medicines and appliances of a simple nature to treat cases between visits of the doctor.\n\nIt is expected that within the next year or two a railway will be in operation between Kitimat and Kitselas Canon, to connect with the main line of the proposed Grand Trunk Pacific Railway when, in all probability, a doctor may be induced by the white residents of the locality to take up his abode at Kitimat, in which event the Indians could receive treatment whenever necessary.\n\nWhatever arrangement is entered into with a medical man I think it would be well to include in the scope thereof the Indians of Kitlope who number some 67 souls, those at Kitimat being about 268 in number, according to the Agent's last census.\n\nMr. Lorenz has been asked to state the name of the nearest doctor willing to undertake, as a temporary arrangement, a monthly visit to Kitimat and Kitlope and the charge therefor, including all expenses of travel, board, etc.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\nOttawa, February 23, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to your verbal application for a boarding school grant to the Kitimat Girls' Home, B.C., which is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared at present to increase the number of schools of this class paid a per capita grant in British Columbia.\n\nIn view of lack of information regarding the work carried on at this school it is difficult for the Department to decide what form assistance to it should take, if any be given. It might be possible to aid the institution by bringing it into the improved day school class, provided the work performed, not only in the school but also on the reserve, is of the nature contemplated to be done by this type of school.\n\nIt is noticed with reference to the actual conditions existing in this village that the Indians are reported to have good dwellings but they are not kept very clean inside, and the Department would like to know what efforts are being made by the staff of the school to improve the domestic condition of the Indians on the reserve in respect to sanitation.\n\nThe Rev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\ncleanliness, etc.\n\nYou will be good enough to let the Department have a full report on the work being carried on in the institution and on the reserve, and an officer of the Department will be asked to furnish a report along the same lines.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, February 15, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Methodist Church is conducting a boarding school for girls at Kitimat, B.C., in your agency, and the Department would like you on the occasion of your first visit to the reserve at that point to investigate fully the work of this school and report thereon.\n\nThis report should deal not only with the work carried on in the school but also by the staff on the reserve. In your last annual report, speaking of the homes of the Indians, you said, \"They have very good dwellings, but these are not kept very clean inside\". The Department would like to know what efforts, if any, are being made by those in charge of the school to improve the condition of the Indians' homes in respect to sanitation, cleanliness, etc., and also whether any instruction in domestic science has been given to the Indian women on the reserve. You should also deal with the buildings, equipment, etc.\n\nAs stated above the Department wishes to have as full information as possible regarding the institution and in your report you should touch on all phases of their work so far as you are able to judge of the same from your inspection.\n\nErnest Lorenz, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n\nIt.\nIt is not desired that you should make a special trip for this purpose, but the Department would like you to arrange your tour of inspection so as to visit this reserve as soon as possible with a view to reporting as above requested. In the meantime it would be glad to have an interim report based upon any information you may have at hand now and you might state the probable date of your next visit to the reserve.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 28th last, No. 291 M-5, concerning the name and address of the medical officer I had in mind to make the monthly visits to Kitimat, the distance his office is from Kitimat, and by what means he would travel from his headquarters to Kitimat, and the charge he would likely make for each monthly visit including a call at Kitlope.\n\nReplying I beg to state that Rev. R.W. Large, M.D., of Bella Bella, B.C., is the doctor I had in mind; his headquarters are a distance of 134 miles from Kitimat, to call likewise at Kitlope a distance of another 48 miles will have to be covered. The doctor could only reach these two places by launch, as no steamers call at Kitlope, for which his charges, including travelling expenses, would net be less than $50.00 for each visit to these two places.\n\nSince receipt of your letter the Methodist Mission Society has secured a 40 horse power gasoline launch, called the \"Udal,\" which will call at intervals at all the different Indian villages in this agency; I have been informed by the Rev. S.D. Shew, D.D., Captain Oliver, the Master of the launch, and others connected with the Methodist Mission work in this agency, that a good doctor would be engaged for the launch, providing the Department would assist the Methodist Mission Society to pay his salary; this doctor would attend all the Indians at the villages where no medical man resides. It was intimated to me by the Rev. Mr. Shew and several others connected with the Mission work, that for a grant of $100.00 per month\n\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nIncluding travelling expenses, the doctor would visit at least once a month the following villages, viz.,\n\nHartley Bay with an Indian population of 856\n\n| Village   | Population |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Kitimat   | 268        |\n| Kilepe    | 67         |\n| China Hat | 78         |\n| Kimsquit  | 63         |\n| Gwakane   | 102        |\n\nTotal 656\n\nThese 6 villages, with a population of 656, have no resident doctor. It would be a great benefit to the Indians of these villages to have a medical officer visit them at least once a month.\n\nI beg to recommend that the doctor, when appointed by the Methodist Mission Society, for the launch Wdal, be granted a salary of $100.- a month, to attend the Indians of the named villages; and I trust that you will approve of same and the Department will favorably consider it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 4th of November last, File No. I30906/I, on the subject of the necessity of arranging for a Doctor to visit the Kitimat Indians and the Methodist Boarding School at that place, once a month, I have the honour to enclose herewith a report in the premises dated the 9th inst. from Mr. Agent Lorenz of the North West Coast Agency, B.C., in which he recommends an arrangement suggested by the Methodist Missionary Society whereby Dr. R.W. Large would visit and treat the Indians at Hartley Bay, Kitimat, Kitlope, China Hat, Mingsquit and Owekano, comprising 658 souls, for a monthly stipend of $100.00. In view of the expense of travelling, the distance to cover and the large number of Indians to be treated by the suggested arrangement, I would recommend that the Agent's letter be given favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th ultimo, No. 132906/1, concerning a report on the work of the staff of the Kitimat Boarding School at the school as well as on the reserve; I have the honor to report that Kitimat was not visited by me since the completion of the Boarding School building and the opening of that Institution for admittance of pupils; twice I started out for that point in this large agency, but was the first time prevented by the only steamer available foundering the night before the start was to be made, the other time the stormy weather compelled me to abandon the trip and return home; therefore I am unable to make a detailed report on the work of this school.\n\nI beg to state that I have been informed by a number of persons that Miss Jackson, the matron of the new Boarding School, has had a large experience in Home work and is very capable of supervising an Institution of this kind.\n\nOnly lately it was stated to me by people who came from Kitimat and had occasion to visit some of the Indian homes, that the rooms in these houses were kept clean and tidy, and that the sanitary conditions in the village are fairly good, showing considerable advancement since last year. There is no doubt that the Indians have not done so of their own accord, but that it has been accomplished by the interest taken in the welfare and progress of the Indians by the Staff of the Boarding School and the resident Missionary.\n\nThe Kitimat Indians are away from home and will not return from trapping, hunting and logging until the middle of April.\n\nThe Secretary Dep. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nwhen I intend to visit that reserve, immediately on my return home from there I will forward to you a detailed report concerning the work of this school as outlined in your letter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

It appears from this that the church will be entitled to the usual grant for day school teachers at Kitamaat, etc.\n\nI think that an officer in the school who could do the work of a nurse and cleaner would be a good thing for the children & people on the reserve. If the W.M.S. of the church put in such an officer, would the Department pay the salary?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nBritish Columbia Inspectorate,\n1076 Pender St., Vancouver, B.C.,\nFrank Pedley Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit the following report of my inspection of the Kitamaat Boarding School (Methodist) North West Coast Agency; inspected on April 1st and 2nd, 1909.\n\nSTAFF:\nMiss Jackson, Principal and Matron, Salary $450 Per annum.\nMiss Mary E.

Their songs and physical exercises were also very good.\n\nGENERAL CONDITION OF SCHOOL WORK:\nThe general condition of school work is good. The pupils, with the exception of two girls who by turns assist in the cooking, attend two sessions a day, and have an hour's preparation in the evening.\n\nEQUIPMENT OF CLASS ROOMS:\nThey have all necessary material for carrying on successful work.\n\nGARDENING:\nHalf an acre is cultivated in which small vegetables are grown.\n\nLIVE STOCK:\nThere is one cow, and a good stable for its accommodation.\nDAIRY:\n\nOne cow is milked but no butter is made as the milk is used by the pupils and staff.\n\nINDUSTRIES:\n\nThe girls are taught bread-making, cooking, general house-work, sewing, laundry work and fancy work.\n\nThe boys cut up and carry in the wood.\n\nSANITARY CONDITIONS:\n\nThe children all appear to be in good health.\n\nFOOD:\n\nThe food is good, well prepared and sufficient.\n\nCLOTHING:\n\nThe children were all dressed neatly and suitably for the winter. At the time of my visit there were four feet of snow on the ground.\n\nDRAINAGE:\n\nThe drainage is very good.\n\nVENTILATION:\n\nThe ventilation is good, better than at any other school in the Province. There are pipes to carry off the foul air and others to let in the fresh air in every room.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION:\n\nPipes with taps and hose are laid on each floor. On the third floor there is a balcony with a door leading from the halls, with ladders outside to the ground. There are two outside entrances on the main floor, and a door and windows in the basement. Fire-hose on a reel is attached to an hydrant just outside of the building.\n\nThe pressure is sufficient to throw a stream over the roof of the building.\n\nRECREATION & EXERCISE:\n\nCalisthenics are taught and the pupils play ball and engage in all kinds of games.\n\nDISCIPLINE & PUNISHMENTS:\n\nThe discipline is good and there is no need for any severe punishment.\nREWARDS:\n\nPrizes are given for good conduct, for proficiency in classwork and for work cheerfully and well done.\n\nBUILDINGS:\n\nThe building is an entirely new one, built by the Woman's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church to replace the one burned on May 20th, 1906. It is a frame building with all modern conveniences, hot and cold water, is heated by furnace, and has two cooking, and one Laundry range. The institution has been furnished throughout by the same Society, and the children's dormitories are furnished with iron beds and cots, mattresses, and good warm bedding.

The size of the building 40' x 70', three stories, basement, ground floor, and second floor, with accommodation for thirty-five pupils, twenty-five girls and ten small boys.\n\nThe institution was opened on December 10th, 1908. I went carefully over the building and found it very complete. An air-shaft up through the centre of the building makes the ventilation perfect in every room.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that this school be given a Boarding School Grant for thirty pupils.\n\nThe Staff is a good one and they expect to add another member when they take in more pupils.\n\nAs the Indians of Kitamaat are so often away from their Village the boarding School was much needed.\n\nEverything was neat and in good order in this new school.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nSir:\u2014\n\nWith reference to my letter of March 9th last, and your letter of February 15th last, No. 132906/I, concerning the work at the boarding school at Kitimat, which is conducted by the Methodist Mission Society; I have the honor to report that the Kitimat boarding school is a two story and one half wooden structure, erected on a bench about 150 feet above the village street; the building has also a basement, which contains a bathroom and toilet for the girls, a laundry, a compartment for the fuel, and the furnace for the hot-air heating of the building, a pipe supplying the fresh air for that purpose.

Scott  \nIndian Department  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nA copy of the agreement re the Boarding School at Kitamaat is enclosed. Also an objection from the Secretary of the W.M.S. of our church who have charge of the management of this school and the girls' home at Port Simpson. The following is the objection: \"If it were meant that the grant was to be limited to 30, there could be no objection, but if we can properly care for more children, and there are plenty ready once who would come, the reason for that limit seems lacking, and we would like to be freed from that restriction.\"\n\nOur women built this school with accommodation for 30 pupils. The actual attendance for 1910 was an average of 26. They have dormitory room for 33. Under these conditions they do not...\nwish their sphere of operation and usefulness diminished to a maximum of 21 pupils. In my judgment, the objection is well taken, and it may be removed in one of the following ways:\n\n1st. By changing the number from 20 to 30 in both places where it appears in the Contract.\n\n2nd. By changing 20 to 30 in the first part, and leaving it at 20 in the second part.\n\n3rd. If there is any serious objection to No. 1, a compromise might be made by changing 21 almost to 30; and the Girls Home to 40.\n\nHaving drawn your attention to the objection, I leave it in your good judgment to make the adjustment.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, June 16, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to the number of pupils provided for in the agreement with the authorities of the Kitimat Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay a grant at this school for thirty pupils instead of twenty, provided the accommodation is adequate. In view of the fact that an architect will not be able to visit the institution for sometime I would ask you to inform the Department as to the dimensions of the dormitory and class-rooms. As soon as this information is received and satisfactory the necessary alterations will be made in the contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. T.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant giving the dimensions of the dormitories at the Kitammat School as requested in official letter of June 16th, last, in which you were informed that the Department would be prepared to pay a grant to this school for thirty pupils instead of twenty provided the accommodation was adequate.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the measurements of the dormitories given in your letter show that they only contain 11,324 cubic feet, which is only sufficient air space for twenty pupils. The last return shows an enrollment of forty-five pupils, which is more than double the number for which accommodation is provided in the present dormitories, and unless more dormitory space is furnished no more than twenty pupils can be allowed to remain in the school. If your Church wishes to avail itself of the Department's offer to pay for thirty pupils it will have to provide adequate dormitory space for ten more pupils.\n\nFive hundred cubic feet of air space in the dormitories is required for each pupil under the new arrangement and the Department must see that this rule is complied with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nGupt.

As this school, however, has only accommodation at the present time, for twenty pupils, a grant can only be paid for that number.\n\nThe June quarterly return forwarded by you is returned herewith as it is impossible to compute the grant due the school. A new return, to be made out by the Principal on the proper form for boarding schools, a supply of which is also enclosed. All the columns of the return should be filled in properly, under the various headings, with exception of the column under the heading, \"Amount payable for each pupil\".\n\nAs this is now a boarding school it is presumed that the pupils are in residence continuously, while the\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nreturn received only shows the pupils to have been in attendance for varied periods, ranging from nine to fifty seven days, out of a total of ninety one days in the quarter. When preparing the return the principal should be careful to state, in the columns for that purpose, under the heading \"Attendance\" the number of days of attendance in the school during the quarter of each pupil and the number of school days each attended in the class room.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the principal of the Department's requirements with respect to the preparation of the quarterly returns and also instruct her to have a new return made out for the June quarter and to forward it as soon as possible so that the grant due the school may be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nThe Secretary Department\nOf Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying by your of Aug 11\nNo 132906/1 There must be some\nmistake somewhere. They have\n32 pupils in the house and as far\nas I know they are not overcrowded.\nI have written a carpenter to\nmeasure the house for me and\nsend the result to me, when this\ncomes I will report.\n\nThe Department seems to\nremember that this building is\nheated by a system that only uses\nthe air etc. Which is far better\nthan cabinet for a guide.\n\nYours sincerely,\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, November 15, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the June and September quarters returns from the Kitamaat Boarding School forwarded to the Department through the office of Mr. Agent Fougerie.\n\nThe return for the September quarter is returned to you herewith for amendment, as it is impossible from the information supplied to compute the amount of grant due the school for that quarter. As this is now a boarding school it is presumed the pupils are in residence continuously, while the return received only shows, in the column \"Number of days attendance during quarter,\" the pupils to have been present for various periods from two to sixty days out of a total of 92 days in that quarter.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement for the maintenance and management of this school, a copy of which together with the correspondence relating thereto printed in pamphlet form has been sent you, one month's summer holidays (31 days) are allowed with full grant during this quarter.\n\nUnder the general heading \"Attendance\" the column headed \"Number of days attendance during quarter\" means the total number of days each pupil was actually in residence at the school during the quarter and the column \"Total number of school days in quarter\" means the total days of attendance of each pupil in the class-room. You will, therefore, be good enough to amend the enclosed return accordingly and also give in the column for remarks the dates of the holidays taken in the case of each pupil.\n\nMiss L. J. Donogh,\nMatron,\nKitamaat Boarding School,\nKitamaat, B.C.\nThe grant is allowed for twenty pupils at $100.00 per capita and is computed and paid on the average attendance up to that number and in future it will not be necessary to fill in the column under the heading \"Amount payable for each pupil\".\n\nWhen giving the register number the boys are to be number 1, 2, 3 and following numbers consecutively and the girls 01, 02 and 03 consecutively and in no case is a number given to a pupil upon entering the school to be taken by any other pupil and each pupil should retain the number given when entering the school. When a new pupil enters the school the register number to be given should follow immediately that given to the previously admitted pupil.\n\nAll the columns of the return should be added and the total entered at the foot of the different columns and all totals should be carried forward when more than one sheet is required to complete the return. None but pupils in residence are to be shown on the quarterly returns from the boarding school.\n\nThe full grant for twenty pupils for the June quarter amounting to $500.00 is being sent to Miss Wilkes, Treasurer of the Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, and you will be good enough to make the necessary corrections on the enclosed return as soon as possible and forward it to the Department so that the grant can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Sec. Dept. Indian Affairs\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of November 15th No. 389700-1 also report returned for correction.\n\nI have with enclosed corrected copy hoping it will be satisfactory and very much regretting errors previously made.\n\nWe allowed the children 30 days in their own homes for holidays.\n\nWhen the day for opening came only two little boys returned. The others came when they got ready\u2014as I understand they have been in the habit of doing\u2014\ndid not return at all so we filled up our dormitory space with new comers.\n\nIf there is any possible way of inducing or forcing them to return on the day of opening we will be delighted to hear of it. I wrote to the Indian Agent in the mean time received his reply Nov. 29th so received no assistance from him.\n\nIf the Department can aid us in securing about a more prompt return we shall be very grateful.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.

As you are aware the regulations make provision for the return by force, if necessary, of children under these conditions. The Department does not, however, wish to resort to these means, if it can be avoided, at the same time the school should be protected and I hope that you will be able to assist the school authorities in having these pupils sent back.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fouaner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 4th instant, No. 389700/I, I have the honor to say that I visited Kitimat in the latter part of November.

She is a properly qualified teacher, though as Matron that will not be one of her regular duties. These have been assigned to the Rev. Mr. Swann. Miss Clark is a good all-round house-keeper. She understands the Indian character. The service she rendered at Port Simpson was sufficient recommendation for the officers of the W.M.S. of our church to appoint her.

Molean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. E. Green,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n3616 Point Grey Road,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSPECIAL REPORT.\n\nJ.B. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward my report on the application made to have the Kitamaat Boarding School graded in Class \"A\" instead of Class \"C\" as at present, in accordance with Departmental letter No. 389760/1, dated February 26th., 1913.\n\nI visited this school on the 8th. and 9th. of April, and very carefully inspected the school, and find in regard to the \"eight clauses\" mentioned in your letter which set forth the requirements for schools in Class \"A\" are as follows:\n\n1. They have a substantial wood building erected in 1908 at a cost of $12,000.00, size 40x70, three stories with basement under the whole building. All is in good repair.\n\n2. The foundation on posts or piles. Two thicknesses of boards have been placed as a lining inside these posts since last inspection, so that the basement is now tight and warm. These foundation posts or piles are inclined to sink but the Principal informs me that the Woman's Missionary Society is ready to put in a cement foundation immediately.\n\n3. There is a plentiful supply of water, water taps on each floor. This has been changed and greatly improved since my last report. Pipes are underground, well covered so safe from frost.\n\n4. Sanitary closets and drains are up-to-date. Sewage is carried to tide water. Baths are in perfect order and constantly flushed.\n\n5. There is an isolation ward meeting all requirements for a hospital. This can be cut off from the other part of the house and has a verandah or sleeping porch attached thereto.\n\n6. Ventilation in connection with the cold air shaft is very good, indeed it is one of the best ventilated schools on the coast. There is accommodation for thirty-four pupils. The dormitories\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe dormitories give the necessary air space of five hundred cubic feet for each child. The dormitory built since former inspection is a good one with accommodation for twelve beds. It is well finished. Class room accommodation is provided for in a fine new day school building, which all the pupils attend.\n\nVII. The hot air furnace is in good order, the building is well heated, the heat being well distributed by pipes throughout the building.\n\nVIII. One acre of land, which will be cultivated for garden purposes. They increase the clearing each year, but it is very hard to clear as Kitimat is not a farming district.\n\nThe improvement made lately to the water system, the new dormitory and basement cost two thousand dollars and was paid by the Woman's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada.\n\nThis school really comes up to the requirements of class \"A\" now, but will be better with a cement foundation; this they intend to do. I therefore respectfully recommend that the Department notify them that they will be placed in class \"A\", when the cement foundation is completed.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nB.C.

I herewith enclose a general report of my inspection and a special report on the eight clauses governing the grading of Class \"A\". I also enclose a report on the Kitamaat Day School.\n\nI have only just returned from visiting the schools in the Babine and Bella Coola Agencies, and will forward reports later when completed.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 6, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to grade the Kitamaat Indian Boarding School in Class \"A\" instead of Class \"C\" as at present and from the first of April the per capita allowance will be $125.00 per annum instead of $100.00 as previously. This is upon condition that a cement foundation is put under the building. You will be good enough to inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Green on the Kitamaat Boarding School, which you have asked to have graded in Class \"A\" instead of Class \"C\" as at present.\n\nMr. Green's report shows the building to be in a very satisfactory condition and entitled to be ranked as requested, provided a cement foundation is put under it. It has, therefore, been decided to increase the per capita allowance from $100.00 to $125.00 per annum from the first of April, upon condition that the work on the foundation is undertaken and completed during the coming summer. Kindly let the Department have assurance that this will be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, May 9, 1913.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Redley,\n\nReplying to your question regarding the grading of the Kitamaat Boarding School I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Green in his report states that the school authorities have carried out all the clauses governing the grading in Class \"A\" with the exception of the cement foundation, which he says the Women's Missionary Society is prepared to put in immediately. It would have been done no doubt before this had the season permitted this work being carried out. The reason for granting the increase from the first of April was to start the school year with the new grant. The Women's Missionary Society has been put to large expense in fitting up this school and they are anxious to receive all the pay they are entitled to and were we have received assurance that any work remaining to be done to raise the grade of a school will be undertaken at once the Department has followed this course. I may say that it has been done in the case of a number of the\nthe Presbyterian schools and it is only fair that the Methodist schools should receive similar treatment.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 14, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nProvision is made in the Estimates for the current year for a pupilage of thirty instead of twenty as formerly at the Kitamaat Boarding School. Payment will, therefore, be made on the average attendance up to this number from the first of this quarter and you will be good enough to advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThe Executive of the Women's Missionary Society has received from Dr. Large of Port Simpson, B.C. a report of his visit to Kitamaat Mission during the Spring. I wish on behalf of our Society to thank you most sincerely for acceding to our request and making it possible for Dr. Large to go to Kitamaat.\n\nThe examination of the children in the Home by an experienced medical man has been a great relief to the staff and will be of benefit to the inmates in improved methods of treatment, as well as in enabling the Superintendent to refuse applicants whose condition of health would be detrimental to those already in the Institution.\n\nOur Society entertains the hope that the Department will provide for a similar examination of the pupils twice each year.\n\nAgain thanking you, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHome secretary, W.M.S.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from Miss Ida M. Clarke, principal of the boarding school at Kitimat, in which she asks that permission be granted to cut down trees on the Indian reserve 100 ft. or preferably 100 yds. on the east and south side of the school in order to let in air and sunlight during the rainy season, and to protect the school from forest fires during the dry season of the year.\n\nI have replied that I do not think that the Department will object; but that it is desirable to get the consent of the Indians. I do not infer from the letter that she expects the Department to bear the expense.\n\nI recommend that the request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Sir,\n\nI wrote to the Chief Justice Macdonald when he was about having the tree cut down around the Home. He advised me to write the Department about the matter.\n\nWe want the trees cut down for 100 ft. (would prefer 100 yds., but will be satisfied if we get the 100 ft.) on the east & south side of the W.M.S. property. Owing to the increasing height (these trees are second growth) the trees are excluding light from the Home. During the winter months the sun cannot shine on the building, which is detrimental to the health of the children & the staff. The drying shed is also shaded, where the clothes are dried.\n\nThe dampness caused by continual shade in a climate where the rain falls nearly 150 ins., is detrimental to people with tubercular tendencies. (Recently it rained 26 days out of 32.)\n\nIn addition to this, another reason is that an open right to be cleared for fire protection. A couple of summers ago, forest fires caused great uneasiness to the teachers in the Home.\n\nResolving the matter will be looked into, our request granted.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Nov. 15, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing a communication from Miss Clarke, Principal of the Kitimat Boarding School asking that the Reserve on the East and South side of the school may be cleared so as to admit light and air to the building and as a protection against forest fires.\n\nIn reply, I have to say that the Department will not object to the trees to the distance of 100 ft. on the two sides of the school above mentioned being cut down if the Indians are willing, and you should submit this proposition to them and obtain their written consent. If this is given, you may issue permits to any Indians who are willing to do the work for the wood without payment of dues, and you can blaze the line they are to follow which should not embrace more ground than is necessary for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This is not an ideal condition as it is difficult to work the pupils together on account of the irregular attendance of the day school pupils.\"\n\nWhen you were at Ottawa last week you suggested that the day pupils should attend school half a day and the boarding school pupils half a day.

Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools, who was at the Department last week, suggested that the day pupils should attend school half a day and the boarding school pupils half a day.

Miss Clark was transferred to the Port Simpson Girl's Home and Miss Unice Heather was appointed to the school at Kitamaat. Miss Heather is a properly qualified teacher. Miss Clark was entitled to the war bonus for the September Quarter. She has written me asking if it should not be continued as she is still teaching in an Indian School. As the Department will understand she is not teaching Reserve children but the pupils of the Boarding School. I would like to know whether under these circumstances the war bonus could be continued to Miss Clark. If so the cheque should be sent her for the December Quarter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nOttawa, February 27, 1919.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, in which you inform the Department that Miss Clarke, former teacher of the Kitamaat Bay school, has been transferred to the Port Simpson Girl's Home and that Miss Bunice Heather, a properly qualified teacher was appointed to succeed her.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this change in the teachers at Kitamaat is approved.\n\nWith reference to the war bonus to Miss Clarke, I beg to say that, as she is not now teaching a day school she is not entitled to any further bonus and the bonus was not paid her for the quarter ending December 31st, last. This bonus was granted to teachers in the day schools only.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that during the early part of May there was serious disturbance in the Boarding School at Kitimat. Miss Ida M. Clarke, the principal was at the time in Vancouver for a month's holiday; and the school was in charge of one of the teachers, Miss Hortop.\n\nThe immediate cause of the trouble was that a pupil, Hannah Maclean, adopted daughter of Wm. Grant, became ill, and the parents alleging ill-treatment took the girl to their own home in the village: here she died two days afterward, namely on May the 8th.\n\nThe whole village became greatly excited; and, when the pupils were allowed to go for a visit to their homes, as has been the custom every Saturday afternoon, the children did not return to the school.\n\nNotice of this was sent to the principal in Vancouver, and to this office, said information arriving here May 28th. Miss Clarke at the same time came to Bella Coola from Vancouver; and we left for Kitimat on the 31st, calling at Ocean Falls for\n\nSecretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCorpl. Clearwater, R.C.M.P.\n\nWe arrived at Kitimat June 4th, and found only five pupils in the Boarding School.\n\nThe next day a meeting was held with the natives, at which also were present: Miss Ida Clarke, the principal, Miss S.E. Alton, field matron, Rev. E. Coulgray, missionary, constables Clearwater and Sutherland, besides the Indian agent.\n\nSeveral Indians spoke and complained that the school was injurious to the health of the pupils, that there was not proper medical service, and that the children were not properly fed or clothed. One made the statement that of all the girls who had attended the school 49 have died, and 50 are alive.\n\nMiss Clarke, the principal, and Miss Alton, the field matron replied to the charges of the Indians. Corpl. Clearwater, and the Indian agent also spoke to the meeting of the rights of the Indians to make complaints, if they had cause for it; but they should not take the matter in their own hands: that both the Indians and the school had rights that must be respected. On behalf of the Department I promised the natives that a physician would visit the school after the fishing season, and examine the children, and sanitary conditions in the school.\n\nThe Indians at last agreed to return the children to the school, if the principal would sign a paper that the children would be properly fed.\n\nMiss Clarke signed a paper to this effect; and, on behalf of the Indians two of them signed a statement that they would give the school proper support. Corpl. Clearwater and the Indian agent examined into the death of Hannah Maitland. Sworn statements were made by Miss Alton, field matron, and Miss Hortop, teacher. It was the opinion of\nMiss Alton that the child had died of spinal meningitis. It would appear from the evidence that they had given the child care and attention to the best of their knowledge, and ability. No physician is nearer than Prince Rupert, 125 miles away, by water.\n\nWe went through the whole school from the basement to the attic, and also inquired into the question of food given the children. The principal explained that it was often impossible to obtain fresh meat or fish; but the children always had sufficient food to eat, and three meals were served every day.\n\nBefore leaving the school we addressed the children, and asked them if they had any complaints to offer, as to food or treatment. As could be expected they remained silent. Indian children, in such circumstances, from diffidence, seldom or never speak, when questioned by white people.\n\nThe school, upon inspection, appears cleanly and sanitary, and the children appear well clothed and fed.\n\nAn Indian, John Adams was convicted of having used insulting language to Miss Hortop, and sentenced to pay a fine of $20.00 with the option of two months in jail; he paid the fine.\n\nThe Indians seemed to have taken a strong dislike to one of the teachers. Such feeling, however unreasonable or unmerited, is hard to remove from an Indian's mind. It is understood that at the end of the present year, this teacher's term of service will end, and she will then leave the school.\nThis report of a matter, delicate to handle, and difficult to set right, is most respectfully submitted, one copy being forwarded to Mr. R.C. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 27, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 15th instant, reporting the serious disturbance which occurred at the Kitamaat Indian Boarding School in the early part of May, last. It is noted that the immediate cause of the trouble was the serious illness and death of one of the pupils, and that the Indian parents considered that proper medical treatment had not been applied.\n\nThe action taken to explain matters to the Indians is approved.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher, to whom the Indians have taken such a strong dislike, will terminate her services at the end of the present year. It is presumed that this means the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th.\n\nWe notice that upon inspection the school was found to be cleanly and sanitary and that the children were well clothed and fed. It is hoped that the dissatisfaction of the Indian parents will gradually die out and that, when the change in teachers is made, there will be no further cause for any complaints regarding the management of this school.\n\nYou should arrange for the visit of a physician to this school at an early date, and he should examine all the children and give instructions to the staff regarding any treatment required. He should also inquire thoroughly into the sanitary conditions and the nutritious value of the food supplied to ascertain whether any change in diet should be made.\n\nI shall be pleased, at a later date, to receive the report of the doctor after his visit and inspection of the pupils and the school, generally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She told me that she had a headache, so I told her that she had better remain in bed, so she stayed in bed all day Friday the 29th of April 1922, and the only time she got out of bed after this was on Saturday morning April 30th from about ten A.M. until about 1:00 P.M. She appeared to be too ill to sit up, as she was lying on a sofa most of the time, so at last I requested her to go back to bed, which she did. There was no Doctor available, but Miss Alton, Field Matron (Nurse) gave her medical attention from the time she became ill until Saturday May 5th at which time she was removed from the home by her parents.\n\nMiss Alton's directions were carefully followed, and we (meaning the Ladies in charge of and residing at the 'Home') did all that was possible to save the child's life, and from the time her illness became serious someone was in attendance day and night.\n\nFor the first two or three days she lay very quiet and complained of a headache most of the time, after that she could not seem to keep anything on her stomach. She vomited several times during the last few days she remained in the Home. She appeared to suffer from a severe attack of \"La Grippe\". The parents came for the child about ten O'clock May 6th (A.M.), and we could not very well prevent them from taking her. They took her to their home in the village of Kitimat, where she died on the 8th day of May 1922.\n\nThe parents made no complaint at the time regarding the treatment which their child had received while an inmate of the 'Home', but thought that they should have been notified regarding her illness sooner. We thought that they knew about the child being ill. I believe that the removal of the child from the 'Home' at least hastened her death.\n\nSigned .......

I visited this patient twice, and sometimes three times daily, until she was removed from the home by her parents on the 6th day of May 1922. I was unable to visit her home in the village owing to the fact that I was suffering from an injured ankle at the time. Had she have been left at the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home I would have continued my medical attention. However, Rev. Gouldrey, who has had medical experience, visited her at her home and did all he could.\n\nIt was reported to me early Monday morning May 6th, 1922, that Hanna Grant had died about 6:00 A.M. There is no doubt that this girl would have received better treatment had she have remained in the Home, however her mother would not consent to have her remain there. I understand that the Mother permitted this patient to have any food she desired, including many solid foods which should not have been given to her while she had such a high fever. Her fever varied from 100 degrees to 102 degrees. There was certainly no neglect on the part of the Officials at the home regarding the care of Hanna Grant while she remained an inmate of that institution.\n\n(Sgd.)

We also found that a petition had been drawn up by the natives of the village, and signed by practically every one of them old enough to sign, demanding the dismissal of all teachers of the aforementioned boarding school, it being alleged in this petition that the Indian children inmates of the Home had been compelled to eat rotten fish and eat meal with worms in it. I did not take a copy of this petition, but I understand that Indian Agent Iver Fougner is forwarding the same to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nOn Monday June 5th, 1922, a meeting was held by the Indians in their Hall on the Kitimat Reserve at which the Indians invited Mr. Fougner and I to preside, table and chairs being arranged accordingly. Mr. Fougner, acting as chairman of the meeting took down (in writing) the minutes of the meeting in detail. I, acting as Mr. Fougner's assistant, entered notes of all important statements in my note-book; I beg to quote a summary of the same hereunder.\n\nMeeting called to order by Indian Agent Iver Fougner at 10:45 A.M. Edward Grey, Indian, states: \"Last year I saw my child getting pale. I asked those at the Home if they had examined them (apparently he had two children in the Home at this time). They said no. I spoke them again. Later she died in the night. Then another child of mine, an older daughter became ill at the Home. She was pale and thin. I took her away and believe I saved her life by doing so. When Hanna Grant died this year, it was considered by the Indians that her death came as the result of neglect at the Home. Another reason which caused dissatisfaction among the Indians was the fact that Hanna Grant's Parents were not notified sooner.\"\n\nMiss Alton, Field Matron, then stated that the parents were notified on Wednesday prior to the child's death on the following Monday.\n\nAt this stage of the meeting a letter was handed to the Indian Agent from the parents of Hanna Grant in which it was alleged that the child died as the result of chloroform administered by Miss Alton in order to put her to sleep. Miss Alton: \"I have no chloroform in my possession, I never use it.\"\nEdward Grey, continuing stated that the Ladies at the Home complained about Hanna Grant screaming during the night thereby disturbing their sleep during the last few nights she remained there, and that the said Ladies administered a Narcotic or sleeping draught in order to keep her quiet. He said the Indians called it chloroform because they knew no better. He would not say it was chloroform, but it was some drug which had a similar effect.\n\nMr. Willie Grant, father of the deceased child, stated that his daughter informed him the day he removed her from the School (Home) that she had not been receiving sufficient food. He also stated that he called at the Home one night about 11:00 O'clock and Miss Hortop told him that Miss Alton had given the child a powder to make her sleep, as she was getting tired of looking after her. She had not recovered from the effects of drugs when he removed her from the Home.\n\nMiss Alton: \"I believe the child died of Spinal Meningitis with complications, and with that disease the patient usually goes into a coma or stupor during the last few days of their life.\"\n\nHerbert McMillan, Indian, stated that Miss Alton admitted to Mrs. Grant, the child's Mother, that she gave Hanna sleeping powders. In reply Miss Alton stated that she gave the child a powder to ease her pain, not to make her sleep.\n\nJacob Duncan, Indian, stated that after the death of Hanna Grant the parents of those children remaining at the Home held a meeting and talked about the girls that had attended the Home. Since the Home started forty nine had died, and fifty were still alive, and the Indians did not understand why these deaths occurred. They did not know what caused the deaths. Duncan then went on to say that at the conclusion of their meeting those present wrote a word to the Council, who took the matter up and called some of the children from the home, and asked them how they were fed. The children stated that they were forced to eat rotten fish and rat meal with worms in it. Gertrude Grant, and all the big girls told this story. The Council decided that they themselves could not close the Home, so they called a meeting of all the people in the village, and all the parents of the children agreed to have their children removed from the Home, and keep them at their own homes, because of the ill treatment at the Home, in the way of not getting sufficient clothing and food, and they agreed to keep their children at their own homes until all Ladies, (Teachers, etc.) at the Home are discharged, and new appointments made.\n\nMr. Fouquer then made a brief speech, informing the Indians that he did not think they could get better teachers, and that there were several other Indian Reserves in his Agency where such a school would be appreciated. Interruption by the Indians: \"They are welcome to it!\" followed by great applause on the part of the Indians.\n\nHerbert McMillan, Indian, then stated that the Indians did not wish to close the school, if the children were treated right. We only want people to treat our children right. We want our children educated, and we are always willing to help.\"\nTimothy Starr, Indian, stated that he was a pupil in a Boarding School at ? (near Port Simpson, I believe) and was far better treated there. No one ever went short of food.\n\nDavid Grant, Indian, stated that the children required a better education. The boarding school at Kitimat had been the same for the past twenty years. The children were learning nothing.\n\nMr. Fougner then informed the Indians that they had no authority whatever to withdraw their children from the home, after having signed a contract for them to remain there.\n\nIn reply the Indians claimed that the contract with the school was to the effect that the children would be well cared for, provided with sufficient clothing, food, etc. One of the Indians stated he had supplied all the clothing for his child. He asked Miss Clarke, head teacher who was present, if this was true. She replied that it might be so if the Indians wished to supply clothing for their children the school did not duplicate, but that they were not compelled to supply clothing.\n\nThe Indians still seemed to be in a very hostile mood, so I decided to address them. My speech took up about half an hour's time. I outlined the situation, as best I knew how, explaining that we were not out to persecute the Indians, that I desired to see them get a fair deal at all times, but that they must abide by the law of the country the same as white people had to. They were certainly not authorized to take the law in their own hands, as they had done in this case, and furthermore if the matter went any farther it would have to be brought up in Court, which I felt sure was not desired by anyone present, besides the matter had to go to Court, then practically all that they had told Mr. Fougner would be useless as most of it was hearsay. I emphasized the fact that if they went to Court they must state facts and nothing else. I informed them that they might be given up to six months with Hard Labour for the unlawful acts which they had committed, however, I sincerely hoped that there would be no necessity for imprisonment, especially at this time of the year when they had such great opportunities to make big money logging and fishing. I mentioned that there was no country in the world where Indians were treated better than they were under the British Flag. I also called their attention to the fact that the Canadian Government had become very poor owing to the Great War, in which white people fought and gave their lives, while the Indians were allowed to live in peace, enjoying the privileges and protection of the British Flag. The Canadian Government had spent a large sum of money during the last few years endeavouring to educate the Indians, and help them to lead better lives in every way, but that there was a limit to what the Government could do for them. The Government could not give them something new in the way of schools etc., every day.\nI pointed out that there was nothing wrong about them making a complaint if they did so in the proper manner, in writing through their Indian Agent to the Department of Indian Affairs, but by taking the law in their own hands they had committed a serious offence, and they could consider themselves lucky that they were not all in gaol.\n\nReferring then to the subject of food, I asked Miss Clark if she was willing to admit the parents of the children to the Home at meal times so that they might see for themselves just what their children were eating. She stated that she had no objections. I then questioned her regarding the amount of clothing allowed her, as to whether she was allowed sufficient to clothe the children properly. One of the principal complaints of the Indians had been in connection with the shoes supplied to the children at the Home. Miss Clark admitted that the shoes she had received during the past year were not the best, and that there had been a shortage of them, but stated that she had bought new rubbers for every girl in the school in order that they might keep their feet dry.\n\nThen after advising the Indians that they had nothing to gain by keeping their children out of school, I asked for a vote to be taken among themselves as to what they intended to do. They agreed to send the children back to school provided that Miss Clark would sign her name to a paper before us that she would see that the children got all the food they wanted, that they would be well cared for, and be supplied with sufficient clothing. Miss Clark agreed to sign and did sign the required paper. I then gave instructions to the Indians that every child was to be returned to the school that day.\n\nThe meeting closed at two P.M.\n\nReturning from Kitlohe on the 7th day of June 1922, I again called at Kitimat and found that all children in the village except that of Edward Grey had been returned to the Home. He had just arrived in from camp, and sent his child to the Home as he arrived there on the understanding that he was to be allowed to take her with him to see Doctor Bailey at Rivers Inlet when he goes fishing at that place. Miss Alton agreed to let the child go when the time comes as the glands in her throat should be removed. Miss Alton informed me that the other child which Grey complained about dying in the Home had the same complaint, (swollen glands) she did all she could for the child, which Grey admitted. He agreed to leave his child at the Home until his departure for Rivers Inlet. I might mention here that Grey is a very well educated Indian, and that he has some knowledge of Law.\n\nI attach hereto the Sworn Statements of Miss Hortop and Miss Alton regarding the death of Hanna Grant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCorpl.

District, together with copies of statements referred to therein regarding the case of a pupil, named Hanna Grant, of the Kitamaat Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I may state that our Indian Agent forwarded a full report regarding the illness and death of this pupil.\n\nWe have arranged with our Agent to have a physician visit this school at an early date to examine all the children and give instructions to the staff regarding any treatment required. He is also to enquire thoroughly into the sanitary conditions and the diet furnished the pupils, and to report whether or not any changes in the same should be made.\n\nIt is hoped that the action taken by Corpl. Clearwater and the Indian Agent to fully explain matters to the Indians will produce good results, and that the dissatisfaction of the Indian parents as to the conditions they complain of at the school will gradually die out, and that there will be no further cause for any complaint regarding the management of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

At that time the quarters were clean and in good order.\n\nI took special care to examine the fish and oat meal on hand at the Home on the above mentioned date. There were three barrels of fish in brine, in the basement. The fish looked clean and suitable for table use. I would mention here that Miss Clark (who had been absent when the trouble occurred, returning to Kitimat with us) explained how some tainted fish might have been placed on the table. She stated that just before leaving, some fresh fish were brought to the Home, which she ordered placed in some old brine, expecting that these fish would be used in a few days. She stated that the brine in question was quite good enough to have kept the fish for a few days, but not for any great length of time. She had expected that these fish would be used as quickly as possible. Apparently the fish referred to were left in the brine for several days, and it is quite possible that they became somewhat tainted. However, Miss Clark went on to say that the children were certainly not compelled to eat them. It appears that the Indian girls do their own cooking, and consequently they should not have cooked any bad fish, as there was plenty of others in good condition.\nRegarding the oat meal Miss Clark stated that she never saw any worms in it. I noticed that this oat meal was in a large wooden bin, in the kitchen cabinet, and from enquiries made among several cooks since that date, aboard boats and elsewhere, I have obtained the information that it is not unusual to find a worm in such cereal. However, I do not believe that the Indian Children at the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home would be asked to eat any article of food in which a worm had been found.\n\nI mentioned to Miss Clark that should a worm be found in any article of food supplied to the Indian Children that particular article should be thrown away. The children should not be asked to eat it, even though the worm had been removed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCorpl. Reg.

Darby, of Bella Bella, in connection with the trip which he made to Kitimat Indian Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that the account in question is being paid at $200.00, which is considered a fair amount to allow for the services rendered, particularly in view of the fact that Dr. Darby is a salaried officer of the Department.

Would it be possible that you furnish me with a report as to the best means which might be considered, in order to provide some sort of waterworks system which would meet the requirements of the Indian villages.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.

I may say that I agree with Dr. Darby's recommendations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReferring to your letter of 14th instant, I have the honor to report as follows:\n\nSome years ago our Department established a water system at Bella Coola where there is a hospital. Since then the other villages in the Agency have been asking for a similar system, and also means to furnish electric lights, where the water power allowed it.\n\nBella Coola.\n\nThe Indian village here is built on what was once tide flats; it is now situated about four or five feet above high tide level. The Indians have wells. Some years ago samples of water from three of these were sent to Ottawa. The analyst stated that while the water was not free from foreign matter, it was not considered dangerous to health. Fine pure water could be obtained here from a glacial stream; but the distance particularly, would make it a relatively expensive undertaking. Bella Coola has cold winters, and the pipe line must be kept from freezing.\n\nChina Hat.\n\nThis village is compactly built on sloping, wet, moss-covered ground close to salt water. The Indians get their water from surface streams; wells could not be dug. Good water from nearby streams could be obtained by a pipe line. This village, like most villages in the Agency, is practically empty during July, August, and September. The Indians are then away at the salmon canneries.\n\nHartley Bay.\n\n(Skeena River Agency.)\n\nConditions here are similar to those at China Hat.\n\nKitimat.\n\nThese Indians use surface water, and have no wells. Here is a fine, glacial stream not far from the village. The pipe line would have to be dug down through land heavily wooded.\n\nIn the summer of 1915 Robt. Cucksey of Vancouver was sent by the Department to Kitimat and Hartley Bay to examine into the feasibility of establishing a water system for these villages. He sent in his reports; but the Department found the expense too great and the matter was dropped. His report for Hartley Bay is dated August 31, 1915; the estimated cost of the work is $1,755.00, the same as at Kitimat. Prices are...\nhigher now. I do not think that Mr. Cucksey was an engineer; but was what people generally call a \"practical\" man.\n\nAll the villages mentioned want water for domestic purposes, and also power to develop electric light.\n\nI might suggest that the Department next summer send to Bella Coola a fit engineer to examine the matter of water systems. He could then be taken to the other villages in our laun the \"Chas.Todd\"\n\nI believe the Indians would be willing, if able, to bear one half of the expenses in connection with the establishing of water and power systems for their villages. The sole deficiency is the matter of money. With the exception of the Bella Coola Indians none have money to their credit at Ottawa; but I understand that the Kitimats, and the China Hats have collected some money to attain the end in view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nUpon receipt of various reports from medical inspectors, etc., on the question of domestic water supplies in various Reserves in British Columbia, Indian Agent Fouger was requested to investigate this matter and report on same. The report he sent in is very brief and incomplete, and refers to the following reserves:\n\nBELLA COOLA: The present water supply consists of wells which are exposed to contamination. A reliable water supply could be provided by building a wooden pipe line from a stream located in the vicinity of the village. The water could be conveyed to a distribution hydrant in the village where the Indians could regularly obtain their supply of water.\n\nCHINA HAT: The Indians are now using surface water from streams on the reserve. On account of the impossibility of boring wells on this reserve, a reliable water supply could be obtained in the manner suggested for Bella Coola.\n\nHARTLEY BAY: Conditions are similar to those at China Hat.\n\nKITIMAT: Surface water is now being used by the Indians for domestic purposes. The question of installing an adequate water supply in this village has already been investigated in 1915, by a reliable man who reported that good water could be easily obtained from a glacial stream not far from the village. The cost of the pipe line, etc., was then estimated to cost $1,755.00.\n\nAll the above mentioned villages would also like to have electric lighting systems which would be operated by a small Hydro electric plant similar to those already in operation in other Indian villages in the agency.\nThese Indian bands, with the exception of Bella Coola and China Hat, have no funds to pay for an installation of this kind.\n\nI cannot give any estimates of the cost of any of the above mentioned systems, and it is suggested by Mr. Fouger that these reserves be visited by a Civil Engineer to fully investigate the question of water supply systems, especially. There are also other villages in the agency which are in the same conditions as those above referred to which could take advantage of the engineer's presence in that district.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is impossible to perform this kind of work until next spring, I would suggest that the matter be left in abeyance, and that Indian Agent Fouger be informed that this question will be taken into consideration early next spring.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nOttawa, January 12, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of December 23rd, regarding the question of providing domestic water supplies in Bella Coola, China Hat, Hartley Bay and Kitimat Indian Reserves, I beg to say that it has been decided to leave this matter in abeyance until next spring when you may again bring same to the attention of the Department for further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI beg to enclose reports for the March Quarter from the day schools at Bella Coola and China Hat; also reports for the same period from the Boarding School at Kitimat with Admission Sheet, and Application for Admission of Mary Williams, Charles Wilson, James Green.\n\nThe attendance for the Bella Coola school was the best, since the school was established, for China Hat a little below the corresponding period last year; for the Boarding School at Kitimat a little above past year's. Reports from other schools not arrived yet.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nP.S. I also enclose a medical report of the day school at Bella Bella.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nMr. I. Fougner,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to state that I visited the day school here on the 21st of March and examined the fifteen pupils present. The following day, I examined two more.\n\nWith one exception, I found that there children were in very good physical condition. This one, a little girl, had a slight temperature and a bad \"cold\" but I could not make out any serious lesion in her chest. I am keeping her under observation.\n\nThere were four with scabies, four had slight enlargement of some cervical glands, and nearly all had more or less hypertrophic tonsillitis. One or two should have their tonsils removed.\n\nThere is only one child in the village that I can think of who has discharging glands of neck or elsewhere and she has a discharging ear. I did not exclude her from the school when she was at home as I did not think her condition was such that she was a menace to the health of the others. Her brother also has a discharging ear. So far as I know, these are the only children of school age with these complaints. On the whole the children have had very good health this year.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a great deal of scabies amongst the people and though some will follow directions, the majority are indifferent and will not keep up prolonged treatment. As they live in their launches, in cabins at the canneries or their camps, as well as in their homes, it is especially difficult to eradicate the pest.\n\nRegarding tuberculosis, there are no recent cases of bone or gland infections, except the ones mentioned above and comparatively few cases of the pulmonary form. Three boys died of it in 1922. The youngest of them, a boy about 11 years old, had never attended school more than a few days. The next came home from the Boarding School in good health, the Principal thought, but his father had him examined here and definite signs were found. The father would not put him in the hospital as he was logging some eighty miles away and the boy died about six months later. The third boy, about 19, of a very tuberculous family was away at school for several years. Though not...\nMr. I. Fouger - S.\n\nshowing active signs, when he first came home, he lived only about fourteen months. I do not know enough about the school to attach any blame to it, though I do think that the one boy's condition should have been suspected before it became so far advanced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge E. Darby\n\nP.S. The enclosed forms bring me up to date, I think, at least for the last twelve months. I have used all you sent me, so please send some more. Do you want them in triplicate?\nOttawa, May 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing the March quarter reports of the Bella Coola, China Hat and Kitimat schools, also a medical report on the condition of the pupils at the Bella Bella school.\n\nIt is noted that, with the exception of one case, the children at the Bella Bella school were found to be in very good physical condition. It is also noted that the doctor will keep this case under observation. You should give any cases requiring the same, the necessary attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on December 1st I visited and inspected the Boarding School, and the Day School at Kitimat. Both of these institutions were found to be in good working order. On the day of my visit the attendance at the Day School was 23 boys and 10 girls. Here is a new teacher, Miss Dimmock; she is young, and does not have much experience, but I believe she is well fitted for the work. The principal of the Boarding School is Miss Clarke, who has had long experience in the work, and is an able, hard-working woman.\n\nOn December 3rd, the Day School at Klemtu (China Hat) was visited. The attendance on the day of my visit was 11 boys and 9 girls. The enrollment for November was 26 with an average attendance of 20. The teacher here is an Indian of mixed blood, Flora Robinson. She declared that another teacher was now needed for this school, and that she was going to give up the work at the end of December. I understand she contemplates to get married.\n\nOn December 5th, I visited the Day School at Bella Coola; the attendance was 11 boys and 13 girls. The average attendance for November was 29 with an enrollment of 32. The teacher here is Miss Lillian Shore, an English girl well qualified and interested in her work.\n\nSpeaking of all the schools in the Bella Coola Agency, I can say that it is my impression that they are in charge of teachers who are well qualified for the work, and who take the proper interest in their work of advancing education among the Indian children. All these schools are under the auspices of the Methodist Church.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 5th, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe September quarter return of the Kitimat Residential School, which has just been received, is signed by Miss T. B. Anderson as Principal. The Department has received no intimation that Miss Ida M. Clarke had given up duties at this school. Please inform us in the matter at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

B. Anderson is acting principal for the time being.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nGRD\nOttawa, April 27th, 1926.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Indian Missions, reports that the belligerent attitude of the Indians at Kitamaat has a disturbing influence on the workers in the Residential School. Since the difficulty in the summer of 1922, following the death of one of the pupils, the Indian Band has made the lady workers uncomfortable by their attitude. At present they are creating an unpleasant situation by their insistence upon a right of way through the Mission property. There appears to be nothing on file in this connection, however.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Report of Inspector Cairns on the Kitimat Residential School - dated April 19th, 1926.\n\nMiss Leila Empey - Teacher\n\nMiss Empey has a Second Class Certificate for B.C. She has attended Normal School in Victoria for one year and for one and one-half years she taught in a white school. Notwithstanding these advantages her work is not at all satisfactory. I would recommend that the W.M.S. be notified so that they may have another teacher to begin work September, 1926.\n\n-------------------\n\nClassroom Work -\n\nThis work of the classroom was not at all satisfactory. The discipline is poor, classroom untidy, pupils not interested in the work.\n\n-------------------\n\nFood -\n\nMr. Agent Fougner and I went into the dining-room at noon and I must say that I was not satisfied with the food, neither as to quality or quantity.\n\nWe had a conference with the Superintendent of the school during the afternoon. She produced a book with the weights of the children taken at intervals during the year. During the last quarter nearly every child enrolled had gained in weight, some of them by five and six pounds. Miss Anderson maintained that in her opinion the pupils were being well-fed. She gave us a long list of articles of food, but as we had not the quantities before us this was not at all convincing. I asked her to go into the whole matter thoroughly and revise her menu if necessary.\n\n-------------------\n\nGeneral Remarks -\n\nMrs. H. Schulstad is the Field Matron; Rev. R.H. Goodridge is the Missionary. Parents complain of food. They also asked that they be allowed to take their children with them when they go fishing.\nOttawa, May 17, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret that it is necessary to draw to your attention certain matters arising out of the report of Mr. Inspector Cairns on the Kitimat Residential School. It is stated that Miss L. Empey, the classroom teacher, is not at all satisfactory and I should be grateful if you would arrange with those in charge to have her replaced before the next academic year.\n\nThe rather unfortunate attitude of the Indian parents on the reserve makes it imperative that this school be conducted in an exemplary manner. Department officers are convinced there is room for improvement in the food that is supplied on the children's tables. Please bring this question, also, to the attention of those responsible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Fervier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report as follows, on the schools in the Bella Coola Agency:\n\nBella Coola Day School.\n\nThis school has good buildings with ample play-grounds, and a teacher's residence. The teacher, Mrs. Snodgrass, is an able woman, and takes interest in her work. She has a small baby to look after; but with the assistance of a grown-up sister, she ought to be able to manage. The attendance has been good; primary work only.\n\nBella Bella Day School.\n\nThis school has a good building; play-grounds are wild, somewhat wet land with small trees. The teacher is Miss Bertha Spencer, daughter of the missionary. She has good education, and is interested in her work. The attendance has not been what could be desired, as the Indians with their children stay away from the village a great deal of the time, at canneries, and fishing camps.\n\nKlemtu Day School.\n\nThis school was visited by me twice during November. The building is old, and small. It has been proposed to erect a new building at this place; but the work could not be done this year, as the funds had been otherwise assigned. The teacher, Miss Blanche Randle, is young and inexperienced; but she likes her work, and the Indians spoke well of her. The attendance has been very good.\n\nKitimat Day School.\n\nThis school was visited by me in November. The teacher, Miss Helena J. Hare, is a woman of mature years, and has had a great deal of experience. She teaches both children from the village, and from the Residential school; the attendance of the former is not so good; of the latter it is perfect. The building is good, well lighted, and properly kept.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nKitimat Residential School.\n\nThis school was visited by me during November. The buildings are good, and well kept, situated on a hill, with a fine view of the sea. The teachers are: Principal, Miss Theo. B. Anderson; assistants, Misses; Miller, and Pasche. They are able, conscientious women.\n\nAs some of the children had not returned to the school after the holidays, the Principal, Miss Anderson, an Indian Truant Officer, John Bolton, went with me to see the parents. These gave as reason for the non-return of their children that unsuitable, and insufficient food was given to the pupils. After having talked the matter over with us, the parents promised to send the children back; and in event of further complaints by the pupils, to go up to the school, and see for themselves, instead of listening to the complaints of children.\n\nI regret to report that Miss Anderson has not had the best of health. She went with us, on board, launch \"Chas. Todd\", to Bella Bella to consult Dr. Darby. If her health will not permit her to remain at Kitimat, her position will be taken over by Miss Miller.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Copy of this report will be sent to the Inspector of Indian schools, Mr. R.H.Cairns, Vancouver.\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith Returns for the March Quarter from the day schools at; Bella Bella, Bella Coola, Klemtu, and Kitimat; also from the residential school at Kitimat, with Discharge Sheet for the Quarter.\n\nAs will be seen the attendance at the residential school at Kitimat has fallen off considerably. This school has received pupils from the local village only on account of its isolation. The Indians have been somewhat dissatisfied lately, and the principal, and one of the teachers have not been in good health. A new principal is now in charge, and we hope conditions will improve after the summer holidays.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Agent Fougner, in forwarding the March quarter return of the Kitimat Indian Residential School, states that a new principal is now in charge and that it is hoped, as a result, the conditions which existed at this school regarding attendance and the attitude of the Indian parents towards the school will improve after the coming summer holidays. The Department has received no intimation regarding the change in principal at this school. The return is signed by Mrs. Sanna Runacres, who states she was appointed on February 15, last. I shall be pleased to have full particulars regarding the qualifications and experience which Mrs. Runacres possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nBrandon, Man.\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector of\nIndian Schools and Hospitals\nfor the Church of Canada.\n\nBrandon, Man. June 9th, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of May 31st, No. 162-1-1 re a change in the superintendent at Kitsamaat Boarding School:\n\nMiss Anderson's health was such that she was obliged to leave during the winter. The W.M.S. who manage this school, sent in Mrs. S. Runacres to take charge. Mrs. Runacres has been the matron of the Round Lake Residential School and well qualified for the work at Kitsamaat. I trust the appointment will be approved by the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Residential school is under the supervision of Mrs. Runacres. At the time of my visit the teachers were recovering from severe colds, and two of the children had the measles in a mild form. The principal and the field matron were doing what they could by quarantine and otherwise to keep the disease from spreading. A difficulty with this school is that the children during summer holidays go with their parents to distant canneries to work, and do not return on time, as the parents stay at the canneries till the fishing season is completed.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nJ. Touguer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nKitamaat Home\nKitamaat B.C.\nJune 30th 1928\n\nMr. Jnr. Fougner\nBella Coola\nB.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find quarterly report.\nIn your letter dated June 1st, you wrote your remarks re. extension of holidays granted to the pupils at Alert Bay, and I do think that we at Kitamaat should be granted the same extension. It is impossible for these children to get out and return in forty-three days. The people are always anxious to get away by the fifteenth of June; indeed, I have to stand firm to hold the children that long, and to get back in forty-three days would mean they would have to return by the end of July, and their people are not then through the fishing.\nI think for another year we should be paid that extension. Would you or would you write to Ottawa explaining this.\n\nRegarding John Bolson's cheque it came along after I had written you. He brought\nit to me asking if I would cash it.\n\nYes, I have no doubt there are others who would like to serve in Johns place, one impartially and, if at any time I find he is not giving satisfaction I will write you.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nSamia Pinares.\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith Quarterly Return from the residential school at Kitimat, for the June quarter, also discharge sheet for the quarter.\n\nA letter from the Principal is enclosed, in which she expresses the desire that the pupils be granted extended holidays, and gives her reasons therefor.\n\nThe Kitimat Indians, the entire village, leave for the canneries in June, the men to fish, and the women and children to work inside the canneries. They go as far as 200 miles from home, and stay away at least two or three months. For the school children to return in 43 days is thus very difficult. One reason is that steamers call at Kitimat only once every month, and the day of call is not fixed. In my opinion the summer holidays could well be extended to two months, or more.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kitimat Indian Residential School in which she applies for an extension of the annual holiday period for the pupils.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to say that we are referring this request to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and informing him that, if he considers it advisable, he may grant an extended holiday period. The Commissioner will communicate with you regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI.

It is stated that the Indians of the entire village at Kitimat leave for the canneries in June and stay away at least two or three months, and that for the school children to return within the forty-three day period usually allowed for summer holidays would be very difficult.\n\nIf you consider it advisable to grant this school the same holiday period as the Alert Bay School, viz. two months, I shall be pleased if you will so inform Mr. Agent Fougner.

There is a small boarding school, conducted by the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church. As the pupils of this boarding school receive their classroom instruction along with day scholars from the Indian village at the day school, the classroom has become very crowded. There are 52 enrolled at the present time and there will shortly be an additional four. I believe that the privilege granted to the pupils of the boarding school will have to be discontinued, and I have to request that the boarding school management provide a classroom and teacher in residence. The usual residential school per capita grant is paid at Kitamaat, and this should include all teaching services. Will you please, therefore, ask the W. M. S. to arrange, at their earliest convenience, for a separate classroom for the boarding school pupils and for a separate teacher. This will leave the day school building for the day pupils and the Department will continue meeting the expense of this separate activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nJanuary 31st\n1931\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nThank you for your letter of January 27th, calling our attention to the unsatisfactory situation in connection with the classroom accommodation at Kitamaat. I have already communicated with Mrs. Anson Spotton, the Executive Secretary of the Woman's Missionary Society, and have a reply from her in which she says that they have forwarded a copy of your letter to their British Columbia Advisory Committee and intimates that they hope within a short time to be in a position to make plans for carrying on the school work within the School Home itself in so far as it affects the boarding pupils.\n\nI may say that I am expecting to visit Port Simpson and the other Indian Missions on the coast during the first week in May, but I hope to be in Ottawa for a couple of days in March and to have the privilege of discussing all such problems with the officials of the Department.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\nMy Dear Mrs. Spotton:\n\nI would emphasize Mrs. Wicken's point that the overcrowding of the day school would exist for only a few weeks of the year when all the people are home for the winter activities immediately before and after Christmas. During many months of the year the children of the Home would comprise nearly the whole attendance of the school. There would be no work for a second teacher for longer than these couple of busy months.\n\nBy this date (end of February) the emergency for this year will have passed.\n\nA possible solution for another year might be that during the period of overcrowding the children of the Home be divided into two sections attending alternate sessions, juniors in the morning and seniors in the afternoon, those not at school receiving some other branch of instructions during those hours. In some schools the permanent time table is arranged in this way.\n\nThe sewing room or play room of the Home might be used as a primary or kindergarten under one of the present staff for the short period of overcrowding.\n\nIf there is not room for a second school room in the present school house, it might be possible to partially relieve conditions by the addition of a few desks or benches.\n\nIn view of the larger industrial school to be built shortly on the coast it would not seem advisable to make any larger expenditure in Kitamaat.\n\nIn regard to accommodations for teacher. On most of the reserves the school teacher boards with the missionary family and the mission houses are all large enough to admit of this\u2014only some special local condition might make this unwise.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n(sgd) L. M. Large.\n\n(Mrs. R.W. Large)\nApril 1st,\n1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is my privilege to forward to you the following recommendation of the Executive Committee of our Woman's Missionary Society:\n\n\"That during the short period of the year when over-crowding exists in the village school, our Matron at Kitamaat be advised that the children should be divided into two sections attending school in alternate sessions; that if necessary the sewing room or playroom of the Home be used as a Primary or Kindergarten with one of the present staff in charge. - This information to be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, through the Board of Home Missions.\"\n\nIn addition, they have already written to Miss Pollett, the Matron at Kitamaat, and to Mrs. C. A. Wickens, President of the British Columbia branch of their organization, asking that they do everything in their power to ensure the proper carrying out of the plans as mentioned above.\n\nFor details, please refer to the letter from Mrs. R. W. Large, a copy of which I left with Mr. Russell Ferrier on the occasion of my recent visit.\n\nHoping that this will be satisfactory to the Department, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that a letter dated March 16th from Miss Julia Follett, Principal of the Residential school at Kitimat, from which I beg to quote, as follows:\n\n\"When a child in attendance at the school stays out on account of sickness, do we lose our grant for that time? I mean if they are away for a few days or a week. And then the matter of Bonds. Are we supposed to have one for each child, and do we send them to the Department or keep them here for reference? I haven't any forms for Bonds. An what about the Financial report to the Department. Do they forward the form, or do you send it to me? It has to be in at the end of this quarter, has it not?\n\nAs \"Bonds\" or \"Financial Statements\" have not passed through this office in former years, I shall ask you to be good enough to reply to above quotation direct to Kitimat, sending copy to this office. Kindly send necessary blank forms to Kitimat. Kitimat has irregular monthly mail service only.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, April 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the communication which you received from Miss Follett, Principal of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is communicating with Miss Follett, and I enclose for your information a copy of our letter to her. We are not aware as to what is meant by \"bonds\" for each pupil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nI. Bougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, April 21, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nMr. I. Fougner, Indian Agent, Bella Coola, has forwarded to the Department a quotation from your letter to him of the 16th ultimo, requesting to be informed if the per capita grant will be allowed in the case of a pupil who is absent on account of sickness. In this connection I have to say that no per capita grant will be allowed in the case of a pupil who is absent on account of sickness or for any reason other than for the annual summer holiday period of 45 days.\n\nThe Department does not understand your request regarding \"bonds.\" Do you mean the usual application for admission and certificate of health forms, a copy of which is enclosed for your information? Should you require any of these forms, it is thought that you can obtain same from Mr. Agent Fougner.\n\nRegarding your annual report and financial statement, I have to say that a blank form for the purpose was mailed to you on the 19th of March, last. In case you have not received same, I enclose another copy for your use.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMiss Julia Follett,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nKitamaat, B.C.\nA second schoolroom is needed at Kitamaat to take care of the increased attendance. If the children from the Residential School did not attend the Day School there would be no need for the extra room. There is no room at the Residential School that could be used as a schoolroom. It has been suggested that the sewing room be used as a schoolroom. This is impossible as it would not accommodate the 36 children, perhaps not more than 12. In any case it is not suitable as a schoolroom. It seems possible that the Residential School may be closed. The children at the Residential School come for the most part from Kitamaat Village. If the Residential School closes we shall have these children in the Day School. The teacher of the Day School is apparently a member of the Staff of the Residential School. I fail to see why the Residential School, while in receipt of per capita grant for the children living there, does not provide for their education at the Residential School.\nOttawa, May 30, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, and note that in due course the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church will nominate a teacher to succeed Miss Guild, who is resigning at the end of the present school year as teacher of the Kitimat Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the arrangements that will be made to provide classroom accommodation for the pupils of the residential school, I have to say that the recommendation of the Executive Committee of the Woman's Missionary Society that the pupils of the residential school be divided into two sections, attending school in alternate sessions, and that the sewing room or play room be used as a primary classroom, will be satisfactory to the Department. If this arrangement to provide classroom accommodation for the pupils of the residential school is carried out, it would relieve the situation regarding overcrowding at the day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. H. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Agent's Report respecting the following Day Schools, for the month of November: Bella Bella, Bella Coola, Alertu, and Kitimat.\n\nOn November 24th and 25th, I visited the Residential School at Kitimat. I am sorry not to have had the required report forms with me, and cannot give statistical information as fully, or accurately as indicated on forms. This is a school for girls; but boys are also kept till they are 12 years old. The total enrollment was 40 or 41. The pupils of this school are given class-room work in a separate building together with the village children, and taught by the day school teacher. Some time ago this caused correspondence between the Department, and United Church Authorities, apparently without results.\n\nThe school has a separate room for sick pupils; none was sick at the time of visit. The cleanliness of children, and school was very good. Playgrounds are small, but high and dry, and clean. I saw the children at meals, and they appeared well fed. Indians made no complaints relating to meals, or other matters. The children are having regular fire-drills, and fire-escapes appeared in good order. Instruction is given in cooking, household work, and sewing. There is no manual training, or farming; grounds are not suitable for gardening, being on a gravelly hill-side. Together with the Principal, I went over the building from basement to the upper story. The building is frame-work, and lighted by a delco electrical plant.\n\nPrincipal, and staff are all women, and they appeared to keep the school in good order. But I understood that the staff do not think the Principal has sufficient executive ability. She is of a nervous temperament, and perhaps does not think anything is well done, unless she does it herself. I know she has had difficulty in making her reports to the Department correct, or on time. There is a likelihood of a change of Principal next year.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n162-1-1 CLOSED\n\nFROM 12/1/06\n\nTO 16/12/32\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6451)\n\nFile 882-11, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nVocational Training-Supplies-Accounts.\n1929 - 1938\n\nFile 882-11, part 2\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nVocational Training-Supplies-Accounts.\n1938 - 1946\n\nFile 882-11, part 3\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nVocational Training-Supplies-Accounts.\n1946 - 1950\n\nFile 882-14, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nLivestock-Supplies-Accounts.\n1920 - 1938\n\nFile 882-22, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nPayments of Grants.\n1946 - 1950\n\nFile 882-23, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nDeath of Pupils.\n1935 - 1945\n\nFile 883-1, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Boarding\nSchool - General Administration.\n1906 - 1932\n\nFile 883-1, part 2\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - General Administration.\n1933 - 1950\n\nFile 883-5, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1911 - 1938\n\nFile 883-5, part 2\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1939 - 1946\n\nFile 883-10, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat Residential\nSchool - Admissions & Discharges.\n1936 - 1939\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\u2014 INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH \u2014\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 8831-1 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT GENERAL\n\nKITAMALT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM OCT 1933\nTO OCT 1950\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\n\nFILE ........................................

C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 6th,\n1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Kitamaat Residential School.\n\nAs you will recall, Inspector Barry has been somewhat dissatisfied with the condition of the boys' playroom and washroom at Kitamaat. Improvements have been made during the course of this last year which the Matron hopes may satisfy him on his next visit.\n\nThere are ten boys in residence, ranging in age from eight to eleven years, the oldest of whom will be twelve in April. I am informed by Dr. Raley that there is an agreement between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Church whereby boys who receive their early education in the Kitamaat Residential School on arriving at the age of twelve should be transferred to Coqualeetza. I am wondering if it would not be possible to transfer the boys at the age of ten rather than twelve years. This should help in solving the problem of over-crowding at Kitamaat and would place the boys under the influence of a staff where men are in the majority rather than leaving them to a staff which is composed entirely of women.\n\nWill you please let me know what the reaction of the Department is to such a suggestion.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, March 15, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the overcrowded condition at the Kitamaat Indian Residential School.\n\nProvided there is accommodation for them at Coqualeetza, the Department approves of the transfer of those boys who have reached the age of 10 years. I presume that these boys will not be sent to Coqualeetza until after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nKitsimat Boarding Home and Day School.\n\nI went over the home with Mrs. Durnan and found everything exceedingly clean and in good order. There were 32 children in residence. I ordered fire extinguishers refilled.\n\nSchools General\n\nOne thing has struck me in connection with the day schools in this agency and that is the large increase in attendance, really beyond the accommodation we have and the number of teachers.\n\nHowever, this agency is not alone in this as I have found the same large increase in nearly all the day schools I have visited this year. Day school accommodation is now one of the most pressing and urgent necessities before the Department.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOwing to an outbreak of measles in the Bella Coola Agency, the children returning to the residential school were delayed by Doctor's orders until such time as there was no risk of infection.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nKitamaat Indian Residential and Day Schools\n\nThe Kitamaat schools were last inspected on September 28th 1936.\n\nThe buildings are the property of the United Church of Canada. The day school in fact forms the classroom for the residential school pupils, almost the whole of whom in any case come from the Kitamaat Indian village.\n\nOf the 52 children on the roll of the day school when I last visited it some 13 boys and 25 girls or 38 in all were in fact per capita drawing pupils of the residential school, while only 12 boys and 2 girls were registered as day pupils.\n\nIt has been pointed out by me on a number of occasions that at this school we pay the teacher some such salary as $90.00 or $100.00 a month to do the work for the residential school pupils which should be provided by the school from its per capita grant. If it is urged that the teacher in addition teaches the village day pupils I can only suggest that this particular activity is highly unsatisfactory for the needs of these children as has also been pointed out previously are sacrificed to those of the residential school.\n\nDay pupils here do not always attend for the full day's session. The school is used at least partly as a step towards the residential school. Older pupils, boys for the most part and too old to continue at the residential school and for whom there may be no room at the Coqualeetza Residential School drift away from school. These older pupils boys and girls would attend a modern well organized day school of several separate Divisions, for their educational needs in the more senior Grades would then be met.\n\nThere are always a number of pupils from Kitamaat at Coqualeetza. A few may come from poor homes, but the greater number could very well be taught at an improved day school in Kitamaat. In my distribution suggestions for the pupils of Coqualeetza it was suggested that children from poor homes in Kitamaat, orphans and others, might well be sent to the Kitamaat Residential School and the pupils now at that school who come from good homes sent to either a new or enlarged day school in Kitamaat.\n\nI am prepared to go a little further now and say that with the exception of the very few pupils who must have residential school treatment, and who could be provided for at the new Alberni Residential School the whole of the remaining Kitamaat children should be accommodated at a new Improved Indian Day School in the Kitamaat Indian village and located on Indian Reserve.\n\nThe average attendance at the present so called Kitamaat Indian Day School is quite high. This is due to the fact that the children for the greater part are those from the near by residential school.\n\nThe average quarterly attendance is given below.\n\n| Month     | 1935-36 | 1936-37 | 1937-38 |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| September | 38.7    | 39.1    | 39.7    |\n| December  | 52.8    | 48.6    | 46.9    |\n| March     | 46.0    | 39.9    | 45.3    |\n| June      | 32.5    | 38.8    | 39.9    |\n\nThe lowest monthly average for the academic year 1937-38 was 37.3 and the highest 46.9.\nThe present teacher is Miss L Nelson, who would not satisfy me as to her correct age. She must be between 50 and 60 years of age. She has an Ontario Second Class Certificate. When last seen in September 1938 she appeared to have greatly aged, and it is fairly obvious that she will not be able for the active work of this large school for very much longer.\n\nMiss Nelson lives at the Residential School and in some ways may be said to form a part of the staff. She now receives her monthly cheque direct from the Department but is called on to pay for her room and board at the Residential School.\n\nThere is a very simple solution to the present unsatisfactory conditions at Kitamaat, and I would recommend that consideration be given to the closing of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School as such.\n\nThe very few children who must have residential school treatment could be sent to either St. Michael's School Alert Bay or to the new Alberni Residential School when this is opened.\n\nThe very great majority of the Kitamaat children, including those now in the village who do not regularly attend the day school, and those who will return to Kitamaat if the Coqualestza School is closed, could well be accommodated in a new and improved day school in that village.\n\nSuch a school should have two academic class rooms for it must be able to accommodate at least 80 children. A school of somewhat the same type as St. Catherine's School, Duncan, but about half the size of that school would in my opinion be highly satisfactory.\n\nSuch a school might well be erected for less than $8,000.00. The staff would not need to include more than two classroom teachers, a janitor, a part time manual training instructor, and possibly a girls' vocational instructor. This suggestion includes what might be called a maximum staff and it would of course be under war conditions possible to operate a successful school without the girls' vocational instructor by having the classroom teachers take this subject.\n\nAn approximate saving of around $8,000.00 per year might thus be possible for as far as I can learn the total per capita allowance at the present residential school together with teacher's salary and other expenses at the day school must at present come to well over $8,000.00 per year.\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nYou will recall that on the occasion of your recent visit to Ottawa we discussed the possibility of closing the Kitamaat Indian Residential School.\n\nI have received a very complete report from Indian Commissioner Mackay regarding the situation at Kitamaat and it is his opinion that the great majority of the Kitamaat children, including those now in the village who do not regularly attend the day school and those who will return to Kitamaat when the Coqualeetza Residential School is closed, could be accommodated in a new improved day school in that village.\n\nProvision was made in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new two-roomed day school with living quarters at Kitamaat and at the present time I am arranging with Indian Commissioner Mackay to have the construction of this building commence next month.\n\nI am also informed that the very few children of Kitamaat who require residential school care could be sent to the Alberni Residential School when it is opened.\n\nTaking everything into consideration I feel that the time has now arrived to close the Kitamaat Residential School and it would be appreciated if you would take up this matter with the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

T. Perrier,\n\nUpon my arrival at Kitimat in company with the Rev. C. S. Reddick I made a thorough examination of the pipe line and dam; before going up the pipe line I tested the supply in the building of the W.M.S. home, and found a very strong pressure. I then tested the fire appliances and found the whole apparatus in a good working order with a tremendous force. I had 150 feet of 1\u00bd\" hose and I could throw a 1\" stream from fifty to sixty feet into the air, and such a powerful force of water that I could scarcely hold the nozzle on the end of the hose. This hose with the present supply of water would throw a 1\" stream around the Home, Mission House, the two school houses and Mr. Robinson's store all of which could be successfully reached in case of fire. After making this test I followed up the pipe line and found it well laid and protected from falling trees, etc., and only in three or four places did I find the pipe uncovered. I found the pipe line had been cleared from six to eight feet wide, trenches dug where possible and crib work with poles on either side filled with earth to protect the pipes. These pipes in some places are exposed or uncovered and can easily be covered but I consider they are covered as deep as I expected them to be or as deep as could be expected for the estimate I gave for the work, viz. $200.00 for digging ditch for pipes and clearing right of way, and I consider that when the pipes are covered that the work will be very satisfactory. At the dam I found that a new pipe and elbow had been put in and it was working very well, but I think when this pipe had been put into a large square box, the packing through the dam had worked loose and it leaked in two places.\n\nI found the water in the reservoir about 4' deep with a good supply running in and a small creek running over a rocky and gravelly bottom, one coming into the reservoir out of the rock crevices\u2014 I should say it was a spring\u2014either of these supplies or streams are sufficient to supply the Home, the larger of the two at the time of my visit was sufficient to supply a village of from 100 to 200 people. The dam has been well built and has stood the spring frosts. The Rev. Mr. Reddick assured me that until recently the dam had held the reservoir full of water, so that it ran over at the outlet or overflow provided. This being the case it can be repaired and the pipes covered then I think they will have a water supply well worth the money invested.\n\nI shall make arrangements to have the pipes covered and the leaks stopped in the dam, either sending up the contractor, or as suggested by Miss Jackson and Rev. Mr. Reddick, get it done by Mr. Moore who resides at Kitimat, a thoroughly practical man as I can see by some odd jobs he has done at the Home for the W.M.S. Mr. Moore was not at home when I was there but he is expected back by the 10th. or 12th. of September, and I am in hopes of getting him to do this work at once, but there is no immediate necessity as the supply is ample, but I propose to have it put in good condition as soon as possible, and before I make final payment to the contractor.\n\nRe the water supply for the Indians of the village, there is a three inch pipe brought from the Home down to the sidewalk line, just in front of the picket fence at the north west corner of the Mission house property, at this point we have put a stand pipe with tap for the use of the Indians but they take no care whatever of it, they have destroyed one or two. I had a new one put in before I left.\n\nI understand the Indians want the pipes carried down the main street and stand pipes put to each house, if you did that for the Indians they would want their homes piped. Personally, I think they have been treated very generously, particularly as they refuse to render any assistance to help clear the right of way or pack any of the materials up onto the premises when the work was being done.\n\nRe the supply giving out last winter from what I gathered from Rev. Mr. C. S. Reddick and other I should say it was not that the supply gave out but that it froze up in the pipes. I am sure had the main line pipe been left open at the lower end they would hav...\nhad water all winter, for with the amount of snow they have up there there is little or no frost in the ground in the winter time and the small streams as a general thing do not freeze up dry and one of the streams I think is large enough to run all winter. Our main line of pipe are of wood and therefore not so liable to freeze as iron pipes and the pipes being covered with at least four to six inches of dirt and generally about five feet of snow should not freeze up if left open at the lower end. If a little careful attention were given at the fall of the year at the dam end to watch the intake and see that it is properly covered and protected and that the overflow of the reservoir has not uncovered or washed away the covering of the main supply pipe during the summer season. By following these instructions the pipes would not get full of ice as they did last winter and stay full until late in the month of June. There was abundance of water and the reservoir was overflowing long before the pipes were thawed out. The streams run under the snow all winter in this Province (that is along the coast) and although last winter was the most severe in 20 years I am of the opinion that had the outlet at the lower end of our main line of pipe been left open we should have had water all through the winter. It might have stopped running during the few days of the most severe weather, but it would have been a very short time, if at all.\n\nIn addition to leaving the lower end open and protecting the intake and the dam, all the valves or iron connections should be well protected by being covered securely against frost.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd) Thomas Hopper.\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your favor of the 9th re the water supply for Kitimat, the church spent $1500 putting in this water system, and at the time it was fully expected that this would give us an abundance of water in a workable system the year round. I enclose you a copy of the report made by Mr. Thomas Hooper, the architect. You will see from this that we had every reason to believe that the question of a suitable water supply was settled. What Mr. Green means by placing the pipe under ground, I presume is that the pipe has got uncovered in certain places. My own judgment, at the time the system was installed, was that the pipe should have been laid at least two feet under ground, but the architect claimed that there was no danger of frost in the B.C. climate if it had any kind of protection as the frost never went into the ground. While I have never been at Kitimat since the school was built and the water system installed, I am well aware that the water system has not been satisfactory. At the time it was installed there was considerable correspondence between myself and the Department re the necessary expenditure. My contention at the time was that, in-as-much as the overflow of water was to be for use by the people of the village, the Department should pay some portion of the outlay. It is just possible that if the Department were to make a grant of a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars for this purpose the system could be made satisfactory for both the school and the village. It is very\nevident that something ought to be done. Personally, I would not make any recommendations without being on the ground and making an inspection of the whole situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-5, part 1)\n| DATE       | DETAIL                        | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------|--------|\n| March 5    | Slate pencils                 | 90     |\n|            | Slates                        | 120    |\n|            | Lock for school house door    | 210    |\n|            | Padlock for woodshed          | 40     |\n\nI hereby Certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed, and that the charges are fair and just; also that all the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 833-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that I inspected the Boarding School for girls at Kitimat, on Jan. 28.\n\nI visited the class room which is in a separate building; here the pupils of the boarding school and the children from the village sit side by side.\n\nMiss Isabella Clarke is the teacher, and she is doing her work well.

Wagner,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nSirs:\n\nI beg to submit the following report of my visit to China Hat, Hartley Bay and Kitamaat in September.\n\nIn order to leave an assistant in charge while I was away it was necessary for me to make this trip early in September. Unfortunately, as this was a time when a great many of the Indians were away at their salmon smoking camps, I only saw a few of them. In fact, at Hartley Bay there were only three at home - an old couple and a boy who was helping them. I extracted a tooth for the old man and prescribed for the old blind lady who had hurt her back. Mr. Matthews, the teacher missionary, was glad to see me, as he had been sick for several weeks.\n\nAt China Hat, I saw a number of people, prescribing for some and extracting teeth for others.\n\nI left Bella Bella on September 11th, in the hospital launch \"Kia-quack\", reaching China Hat the same night. I made what calls were necessary the next morning and then proceeded, anchoring for the night in Ursula channel. I arrived at Kitamaat the afternoon of the 13th and remained there until the morning of the 16th.\n\nMany of the Kitamaat people were at the Prince Rupert fair in which their football team takes a prominent part, and some were up river smoking salmon. When word got up that I was there, a number came down for consultations and I was able to examine one or two of the children for admission to the \"Home\".\n\nI found the staff and pupils at the \"Home\" quite well, having had no serious cases of illness recently. As a number had had trouble with their throats, I examined them at once and prepared to operate on four the following morning.\n\nWith Nurse Alton's help and that of the nurse whom I had taken with me, I removed the tonsils and adenoids of these four girls Thursday morning and spent the rest of the day examining...\nher pupils. On Friday, I inspected the \"Home\", finished my examinations there, and made several calls in the village. I found one child dying with pulmonary tuberculosis and gave the Mother necessary directions for helping the child and at the same time safeguarding the rest of the family.\n\nOn the whole, I found conditions fairly satisfactory, though, of course, with so many people away from home, my observations were necessarily limited.\n\nIt is fortunate that these villages are unoccupied to such a large extent during the summer months, as none of them have an adequate water supply. At Kitamaat, they depend upon shallow wells dug near their houses, while at China Hat and Hartley Bay, they use rain water from their roofs or carry from the nearby creeks. In a dry season, such as this has been, what little water was available was hardly safe to use. The people should be encouraged to install running water systems, as soon as they can manage it.\n\nChiefly for its educational value, I made a nominal charge of $2.00 an examination outside of the \"Home\" and collected $15.50.\n\nWith special reference to the Boarding School, I think that the children were in very good condition. However, I made some suggestions to Miss Clarke in regard to giving the children raw fruit, raisins or something of that sort, etc., regularly during the winter, as well as a little more butter. Several of the pupils have pyorrhea in spite of regular teeth brushing with Colgate's paste. I would suggest that the Department consult a dentist and if possible use something more preventative than this, and also give Miss Alton instructions for treating the present cases.\n\nI think a lung meter, such as is used in some gymnasiums, would be a good investment. Routine exercises become a bore, unless the children can see that they are accomplishing something. By blowing in this instrument, the lung capacity can be measured and in trying to excel one another, each child will be benefitted.\n\nAnother thing which would be of assistance in keeping track of the welfare of the pupils would be a regular printed chart for recording the weekly temperatures and weights. By having these\nrecorded graphically, any tendency to decline would be noticed much more readily than if they were merely written down and perhaps before anything would be observed in the child herself. I attach herewith a specimen for illustration.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend that the men of the village be asked to cut down all the trees on the knoll behind the \"Home\". It would not take them more than a few hours and the children would have at least an extra hour of sunlight in their dormitories. That may not sound a great deal, but in this climate where the sun may not be seen for days and even weeks at a time, every hour is very very important.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge E. Darby\nMedical Superintendent, The R.W. Large Memorial Hospital, Bella Bella, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith vouchers No. 26/61 for $274.50 in favor of the R.W. Large Memorial Hospital.\n\nDr. Darby informs me that all this will go to the hospital, and nothing to him personally; his salary is fixed. The charges seem reasonable.\n\nThe account for $100.00, removing tonsils and adenoids, four Indian girls, is for operations on four girls, pupils of the Boarding School at Kitimat.\n\nI have heard from Kitimat that they were well pleased with the visit of Dr. Darby. His report of the trip with recommendations, and a blank form of Health Chart are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Dec. 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, enclosing the report of Dr. Darby of Bella Bella in connection with the visit he made to the Kitimat Indian Boarding School, I beg to say that the Department is not in a position to issue any instructions to Nurse Alton regarding the treatment of pyorrhea. It is noted that the pupils regularly brush their teeth, using Colgate's paste. We are not prepared to supply a lung meter or printed charts, as recommended by Dr. Darby.\n\nAs this school is the property of the Woman's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, we are taking up with Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, the suggestion of Dr. Darby that all the trees on the knoll behind the \"Home\" be cut down, to provide extra sunlight in the children's dormitories.\n\nWe note that the Doctor found the staff and pupils at the school in good health, with no serious cases of illness lately, and that he operated on the cases of tonsils and adenoids where required.\n\nWe hope that, as a result of the Doctor's visit, there will be no further cause for complaint against this school by the Indian parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIver Foughner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nOttawa, Dec. 9, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nDr. G. E. Darby, of Bella Bella, B. C., who visited the Kitimat Indian Boarding School at the special request of the Department, to inquire into the health conditions among the pupils, diet, etc., among other suggestions recommends that the men of the village be asked to cut down all the trees on the knoll behind the \"Home\". He states that this would give the children at least an extra hour's sunlight in the dormitories.

She complained of the difficulty of collecting the children from the various canneries at the end of the holidays. The building was well kept and in good order. I found, however, that they were still using oil lamps, a dangerous thing in a school so out of the way, and where the water supply for fire purposes is low at certain times of the year. This building should have a delco installed. Having in view the danger from fire I thoroughly inspected the building from that point of view. I found that the fire extinguishers ought to be refilled. There is no system of fire alarm bells. The fire escape for the girls is well situated. For the boys, who are all quite young, the fire escape from the small dormitory is very difficult to get at and hard for small children to use, being only an iron ladder set to one side of the window. The third story where other small boys are, has no fire escape. The furnace, a good one, was situated in the basement; concrete sides and part of the floor. This basement was kept tidy. I instructed the principal to keep the ends of the fire hose screwed to the stand pipes knowing the difficulty of adjusting them in the dark. However as I said before the supply of water is very doubtful and they would probably have to depend upon extinguishers. I found, like so many schools, that no fire drill had been organized, and I commented to the principal upon this.\n\nG.S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 27, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to quote from a report of Mr. G. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, following his recent visit to the Kitimat Indian Residential School:\n\n\"The building was well kept and in good order.

You will please note the recommendation that an electric light plant be installed and that suitable fire escapes be provided. Please instruct the Principal to organize fire drill and to see that it is practised regularly.\n\nI am today writing to Mr. Indian Agent Fougner, instructing him to recharge the fire extinguishers if such action has not already been taken. However, the question of fire escapes is apparently so urgent, that I should be grateful if you would take immediate steps to have rope ladders or some other temporary equipment supplied. As soon as you hear from those responsible for this building, I shall be glad if you will let me know what remedial measures are contemplated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIver Founger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of 27th ult. I beg to report that I visited Kitimat on November 6th & 7th. I then called at the Residential School, and the Principal, Mrs. Runacres informed me that they were having fire-drills, and that she had ordered material for the fire-escapes, as suggested by Inspector Col. Pragnell. One of the old fire escapes was awkwardly located, and another did not quite reach the ground. Unless my memory is entirely at fault, I would also say that the Principal told me that the chemical fire-extinguishers had been re-filled with fresh liquid. I am writing a letter to the school informing her of the wishes of the Department pertaining to these matters.\n\nThe work of putting up the new fire escapes will be done by Mr. C. Moore, and experienced man who has done a great deal of work for the school. The Principal wondered who would pay for the material and the work, whether it would be the Department or the Church. I told her it would most likely be the Church, as owner of the building. As to who is to pay, the Department will be in position to decide definitely.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nDec. 11,\n1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nKitamaat, B.C.\n\nPursuant to our conversation when I was in Ottawa last week in which we discussed the need of a Delco Light Plant and fire escapes for the Kitamaat School, - the estimated cost being $1,500.00, - we will appreciate it if this sum can be provided for in the Estimates that come before the next session of Parliament.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF:AMA.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nDec. 12,\n1928.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Indian School - Kitamaat, B.C.\n\nI met with a Committee of the ladies of the Woman's Missionary Society and they have requested me to take charge of the business required on their part for the installation of a Delco light plant and erection of fire escapes which the Department have so kindly provided for at the Kitamaat Home, B.C.\n\nWould you kindly let me know what you would wish me to do in this capacity. I have written to the Matron asking for the number and sizes of the rooms that she wishes to light, and I am expecting to be in Vancouver in the month of February or March and could look over machines that would be necessary for the lighting of this building. Personally I would prefer that the Department would put the responsibility of overseeing the installation of this lighting system upon your agent in charge of that field, and any assistance that I can render will be gladly given.\n\nThe wishes of the Department in this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF:ALM.\nOttawa, December 14, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to fire escapes at the Kitimat Indian Residential School. The church authorities have urged the Department to secure an appropriation in this connection, and I should be pleased if you would have the accounts forwarded to you for your certificate. You may then present them to the Department, when consideration to their payment will be given. The principal should be informed of this arrangement and should be instructed to incur no unnecessary expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

A recent report from Mr. Indian Agent Fougner, of Bella Coola, announces that the Principal has already ordered material for the fire escapes. I will inform him that when the work has been satisfactorily completed, he should forward the accounts to the Department for consideration.\n\nI am securing the name of a responsible electric contractor, and, if Parliament provides the necessary funds, the work will be done under the supervision of our representative. It will not be necessary for you to take any action at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

I am so informing the president of the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nAs soon as I hear from the matron of the school re size of rooms and number of lights required, I will let you know.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGRD\nBrandon Industrial School,\nJanuary 18th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received word from the matron of the Indian Residential School at Kitamaat, British Columbia, that a maximum of 35 lights is all that need be provided for. I presume that this is to be interpreted that the lights will be from 25 to 40 about half of each.\n\nThe matron also states that Mr. Moore, (I know Mr. Moore and would rely on his judgment) has made sketches for what would be suitable for fire escapes. They have secured an estimate of the cost and report $327.00 P. O. B. Vancouver. This information may assist the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nGRD\nOttawa, January 23, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of October 24th, concerning fire escapes at the Kitimat Indian Residential School. The Department wishes that the necessary protection be provided at an early date, and, if the Principal has not ordered the material and arranged for the erection, please see that this is done without delay. I may say the Inspector of Indian Schools and Hospitals for the United Church states that an estimate of the cost of the material is $327.00, f. o. b. Vancouver. When the work has been satisfactorily completed, have the accounts presented to you for your certificate. You may then forward them to the Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nOttawa, January 23, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, concerning the number of lights required at the Kitimat Indian Residential School. Further, I note that Mr. Moore, who is reliable, estimates the cost of fire escapes at $327.00, f. o. b. Vancouver. As I informed you in my letter of the 14th ultimo, Mr. Indian Agent Fougner states the Principal has already ordered the material for the fire escapes. I am writing him today, to make sure that this is done, so that there will be no delay in giving the necessary protection. At a later date, arrangements will be made for the electric lighting, if Parliament provides the necessary funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nBrandon Industrial School,\nJanuary 25th, 1929.\n\nMrs. Sanna Runacres,\nKitimat, B. C.\n\nDear Mrs. Runacres,\n\nThanks for yours of the 16th inst. This contains the information. I placed the need of Delco light plant and fire escapes before the Department and they are assuming all responsibility. Kindly give the agent all assistance you can and all construction and installation, also bills and accounts will be looked after by him. The Department will see that a qualified man will put in the Delco plant.\n\nThe question of lighting the mission house and nurses home was not included in my request to the Department. These should be considered on their merits. If the nurse's residence is only for the nurse appointed by the Department of Indian Affairs, it might be included providing the light plant is strong enough to carry it. The expense of wiring and lighting the mission house should be met by the Home Board of Missions and ought not be a part of this proposition unless the Board provides for the extra power required in the Delco plant, and for all expense of putting it into the mission house. If this were done, the question of meeting the cost of running the plant would have to be settled by the management of the school and the Missionary in charge according to the amount used in each. As no authority has been asked or received from the Board of Home Missions, I would advise leaving the mission out of the present proposition. Could not the mission house be lighted from the proposed village plant?\n\nI expect to see Dr. Young of the Home Board and will obtain his views on your proposal and let you know the result.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGRD\nBrandon Industrial School,\nJanuary 28th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a sketch of the Kitamaat Residential School sent me by the matron, also my reply to a proposal she makes to include the nurses' home and the mission house in the light plant.\n\nThese are simply for the information of the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGRD\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of 14th ult., I beg to report that a letter was sent by me to Mrs. S. Rumacres, Principal of the Residential School asking her to have the work done as economically as possible, and send the bills to this office.\n\nNow I have a letter from her stating that she sent a drawing, and full particulars about the proposed fire escape, to the Pearson Wire & Iron Works, Vancouver, asking for prices. She also sent a drawing and explanations to the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church in Toronto.\n\nI enclose herewith the reply of the firm in Vancouver. It will be seen that the price quoted is $327.00 f.o.b. Vancouver. What the freight and labor will cost we do not know; but I should think the total cost would be about $400.00. If this is satisfactory to the Department I would suggest that the order be given direct to the firm from Ottawa. Kitimat has monthly mail service only, and it takes such a long time to exchange letters. There is a good man at Kitimat, Mr. C. E. Moore, who is well qualified to do this and other work for the school.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 11, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with enclosure, with reference to a fire escape at the Kitamaat Indian Residential School. I wrote to you on the 23rd ultimo, asking that you arrange to have the material ordered without delay. Our letters have crossed, and I presume that you have taken the necessary steps.

As Kitimat has boat service only once a month, the bills may not reach the Department before the end of March.\n\nAs no tenders have been called for, and I was not sure that the Department would approve of the price quoted, the order could not be sent before, from this office.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nDuncan C.

There are some very dangerous holes in the present walk and it has been mended and re-mended until the whole structure is very shaky and bad. Enclosed you will an estimate from Mr. Moore, as to cost and construction. Hoping something can be done I am - with thanks.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nMary A.

Moore\nOttawa, March 24, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School requesting that the necessary expenditure be authorized to have a new sidewalk built from the Indian village to the day and residential schools, and giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour.\n\nIn this connection it is regretted that there are no funds available at the present time to provide for the cost of this work. Would it not be possible for the school management to effect this improvement and provide the cost from per capita earnings or other receipts?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 24th I beg to report that Kitimat was visited by me the first part of this month. I could not see the Principal of the Residential school, as she had had to go to Vancouver on account of her health.\n\nI examined the side-walk, and spoke to the other workers about needed repairs. It appears that since this walk serves the dispensary of the field matron and the day school, as well as the residential school, the latter is not prepared to bear cost of renewal.\n\nIt is hoped that the Department will see its way clear to have this work done; and if needed funds are not available this year, it will allow the work to be done during the coming fiscal year.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, May 27th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with further reference to the request that the necessary expenditure be authorized to have a new sidewalk built from the Indian village to the day and residential schools at Kitimat. It is noted that the school management is unable to meet the expenditure required to carry out this work and the Department will, therefore, provide the funds necessary for the purchase of the material and for the labour in taking down the old and building the new walk to the amount mentioned in your letter of March 11th, last. You should arrange to have this work carried out at an early date and, when completed to your satisfaction, you should forward properly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nI have your letter of May 27th, re side walk at Kitamaat school. I am writing to Kitamaat today, asking them to forward to this office, bill of material needed for this work. I am of the opinion that they have underestimated the cost of material and labour for this work, but they may be able to utilize some of the old material, and thus save buying new.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nT.A. Levelton\nActing Agent\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing asst. Deputy and secretary.\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of May 27th re sidewalk to Residential School at Kitamaat, I beg to report as follows.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I immediately wrote to Kitamaat and asked them to forward to this office an estimate of material needed for this work. I am today in receipt of a letter from C.E. Moore, who is in charge there during the holidays, and who, I understand, gave the estimate of the approximate cost of building this walk. He encloses a bill of material needed for this work, and I am today writing to various firms in Vancouver who handle the lumber and material needed for this work, as I believe it is the policy of the Department to ask for competitive bids on all material supplied to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.A.

The amount of wages is $93.20, and this has been paid to the Indian workmen by the Principal, Miss J. Fohlett, of the Residential school. I regret that the amount chargeable to both material and labor, somewhat exceeded the estimate given by Mr. C.E. Moore. This carpenter could not do the work at the time, and Indians only were employed.\n\nWhen I visited Kitimat early this month the work was completed, and satisfactorily done. As this walk is up a steep hill, and in places some feet above the ground, the safety of the children makes it of great importance that it is strong, and in good state of repair.\n\nAuthority to construct this walk was given in letter of May 27th, No. I62-I-5.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n| DATE       | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------|\n| Oct.4,'30. | $6.90  |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDate, 1928\n\nSold to\n\nAmount\nForward\n\n16 ft. 2\u00bd nails $1.00\n5 ft. 2\u00bd nails $3.00\n10 ft. 4 nails $1.00\nTotal $6.90\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, File 383-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 9/123, amounting to $6.90 in favour of Residential School, Kitimat, B.C., for nails for side-walk to day and residential school, Kitimat.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 162-1-6 dated May 27th, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF G.H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS,\nDATED APRIL 30 & May 1, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KITAMAAT\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL. - Original on File 162-1-6.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThere are 4 inside stand pipes, with a length of 1\u00bd inch hose attached to each. There are 12 Diamond dry extinguishers and 4 soda type extinguishers. There is a reel of hose on a portable stand. As I considered the pressure in the ordinary water pipes to be very small, less than five pounds, I had the hose in the basement of the school taken down, and the water turned on. The basement hose was chosen as the pressure in it would be greater than in those on the floors above. Mr. Indian Agent Founger was present at this test.\n\nThe result was just as I had expected. The water just managed to get through the hose and to rise to a height of about a foot above the nozzle. It may be taken as a fact that the standpipes and hose are quite useless in the case of a fire.\n\nIn two cases stove pipes pass through the interior walls of the building. This of course tends to increase the fire risk.\n\nAbout two years ago a very fine fire escape was provided. It serves the boys' dormitory and the senior girls' dormitory. The junior girls are expected to cross a corridor, go into the Principal's room and then down a very dangerous escape which ends for no sensible reason 8 feet above the ground. The iron platform at the top of this escape should be extended to pass under the window of the Junior Girls' Dormitory. Another iron strap rail should be added to this escape to prevent small children falling through, and the escape should be continued to the ground. There is, however, another solution of the problem of escape from the Junior Girls' Dormitory which would not cost more than a few dollars.\n\nAt present there is an old iron fire ladder on the ground beside the school. I have measured the ladder and the height of the windows in this junior dormitory. The iron fire ladder could be bolted to the wall of the school with six large bolts. The ladder would reach from about two feet above the bottom of the window to within three feet of the ground. It should be placed so that the ladder\nladder was at the side of the window. I think that even small children would be able to climb down by this ladder if absolutely necessary. This latter solution though in some ways not quite as good as the more expensive one of an addition to the present escape is the one that I wish to recommend to the Department.\n\nThe window leading from the Senior Girls' room to the fire escape has a small nail in it to prevent boys opening the window from outside. As there is an axe hung in clips beside the window, I do not think there is any danger.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nThe source of the water supply is in a small stream through the woods on the hill at the back of the school. This stream, which is dry in the summer, is led through a wooden pipe into a small shallow pool. The pool is about 50 yards in circumference and perhaps 6 feet deep in the centre. The nature of the soil is heavy clay, and the pool rapidly shelves to the banks. The pipe that conveys the water to the school is now about three feet below the normal level of the surface.\n\nLast year the school was without water for some time during the summer, as the pool had dried up.\n\nTo give a proper supply of water to the school, a cement dam and a fairly large tank should be constructed. To save money and still increase the amount of water available during the summer months, I would suggest that a day's work be done on the present spillway. The spillway is about two feet below the top of the retaining bank or dam. This spillway could very easily be raised another foot, by filling in with earth and boards. This would increase the amount of water retained in the pool and would not cost much.\nOttawa, May 26th, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School, states as follows regarding the fire protection and water supply:\n\n\"About two years ago a very fine fire escape was provided.

G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS, ON HIS VISIT TO THE KITAMAAT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON MAY 16TH, LAST.\n\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATION:\n\nI do not consider that the children from this residential school should be permitted to crowd the village children out of the day school. At present the only way to keep the number of children attending the Indian day school within bounds is to send a number of the boys to Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. Even then the day school is overcrowded and I am not convinced that all the boys from the village are attending this day school when still of school age.\n\nAs has been reported previously, please see the report on Kitamaat Indian Day School dated May 17, 1932, there is a definite need for a second classroom at Kitamaat. To save the Department the expense of erecting such a room and providing a teacher for the Second Division thus formed, I would ask that consideration be given to the following recommendation:\n\nI would recommend that the United Church of Canada be asked to consider building an addition to the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home. This addition should be large enough to give a good sized schoolroom on the ground floor, and a fair sized dormitory with an additional teacher's room above it. The addition suggested is much the same as that lately added to the Port Simpson Indian Residential School.\n\nI would ask that consideration be given to increasing the number of children authorized to draw Per Capita Grants from 42 to 50 on the understanding that the Church Authorities provided the salary for the teacher for the proposed schoolroom. This would free the Indian Day School for its rightful purpose of accommodating the village children, who should not be sent to Coqualeetza except in exceptional circumstances. The above is submitted for the information of the Department, as it is believed that economy might thereby be effected.\nMr. R. A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the retaining wall at the Kitamaat Indian Residential School.\n\nIn your letter of April 21 you stated that the Indian Agent had reported that instead of erecting a new wall the present wall and playground could be lowered two feet and that this improvement would only require an expenditure of $250. In our appropriation for the present fiscal year, provision was made for an amount of $500.00 for repairs and improvements at the Kitamaat Residential School. If you consider that the $250 expenditure is sufficient, you may proceed with the work at once. However, if you find it necessary to expend $500.00 on this work, you may do so.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood that the Department cannot allow an amount larger than $500.00. I understand from your previous communication that the major portion of the expenditure will be for labour, and it is presumed that Indians will be employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

It is not our general practice to supply electric light at any Indian day school in the Dominion. Besides, although the machinery referred to by Inspector Barry may be in good condition at the present time there is no question that it will require careful handling and would be a continual source of expense in order to keep it operating properly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Our understanding of the matter is that in 1937, or early in 1938, after the original lighting plant had been destroyed by fire, your Department bought a new one and installed it.\n\nAs you know, the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home has been closed, or, at any rate, is no longer in use, and we should like to know what you wish done with the lighting plant - whether you want it removed or whether it could not be used to some advantage in the village. Could it not be used for lighting the new school, if you have not already made provision for that?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6451, file 883-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn November, 1937, a 750 watt, 32 volt, Type \"A\" lighting plant with batteries was purchased by you from the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company and installed in the Kitamaat Residential School. As you are aware, this school is not in operation and will not be re-opened. Is there any other building where you consider this installation could be used? I do not favour installing it in any Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the lighting plant in the former Kitamaat Residential School. I am communicating with Indian Commissioner MacKay with a view to ascertaining if there is any other place where this equipment could be used. On receipt of his reply I will write to you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the disposal of a 750 watt, 32 volt, Type A Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company lighting plant at the Kitimat Indian Residential School.\n\nWhile it is noted that you do not favor installing it in any Indian Day School, I would advise that the new two-room school and residence at Kitimat is fully wired for electric light, other than drop cords, sockets and globes. During the winter months this school is sufficiently far north and subject to almost continually overcast sky to make work in the class rooms most difficult without some form of lighting, particularly in the two basement rooms set aside for manual training and domestic science. As the old residential school is not more than about one hundred yards distant from the new school and the Agent and his engineer are familiar with these plants, one having been in operation for some years in the Agency office, the plant could no doubt be moved over to the school for a small amount for labor. In addition, drop cords, globes, etc. would be required.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it would appear that an exception might be made in this case, provided the change over could be carried out without much cost and the Agent, or the engineer, agreed to make a regular check on the plant and batteries in order to avoid unnecessary cost of replacements and repairs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nJanuary 13, 1942.\n\nIf the Department is not prepared to entertain this recommendation, which is fully endorsed by the Inspector of Schools and Inspector of Agencies, I would recommend transfer of the equipment to Massett for use in the Queen Charlotte Agency house or office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n:GR\nOttawa,\nJanuary 23, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the disposal of the lighting plant at the Kitimat Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation the Department approves the installation of this equipment in the new Kitimat Day School. This authority is issued on the understanding that the change can be made without much cost and that either the Agent or the engineer agrees to make a regular check on the plant and batteries in order to avoid unnecessary cost of replacements and repairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, you may inform the Principal of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School that the admission of Belva Nyce and John Amos is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nJanuary 5, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith report for the Agency for December, 1936.\n\nAs noted in my diary, several outside Bands were visited. It will also be noted that several cases were held at Kitimaat regarding immorality. I find that throughout this Agency a large number of people are living together who are not married, and there are a number of illegitimate children. I have notified all Bands that from now on action will be taken in all cases brought to my notice.\n\nAt Kitimaat I found it necessary to send a fourteen year old girl, with the alleged father of her unborn child, to the County Court to get a special marriage licence. I considered this a better procedure than making a charge under Section 301 (unlawful carnal knowledge). A young man was fined $50.00 and costs for contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. This case should have come under Section 301, but I thought it better to make the charge as above, as the offender is a tubercular case and it would not have been wise to send him to jail.\n\nThree young girls at the Residential School at Kitimaat were involved in similar cases to the above. One girl was committed to Coqualeetza Residential School and will not be allowed home on holidays. Two others are not to be given any of the customary freedom for the balance of the term at Kitimaat School, and will required to stay in the school during the coming summer holidays. They will then be transferred to Coqualeetza in September, with the Department's approval. A Mrs. Hall from Kitasu (Klemtu) had left her husband and was at Kitimaat with another man. I had them both brought before me and ordered Mrs. Hall to return to Klemtu at the first opportunity. She has since gone back there.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to that paragraph of your December report which refers to the immoral actions of three pupils of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School, the Department would appreciate your advising whether these cases occurred at the time they were in attendance at the school or when they were at home.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.

The food should be plain, good, and well cooked. Hours for meals 7 A.M., 12 Noon, 6 P.M. Quiet talking should be allowed at meals, but it should be conducted exclusively in the English language.\n\nCLOTHING\n\n15. Pupils should not be allowed to wear clothes that are not in every respect in good state of repair and clean. The clothing of all the pupils should be inspected at least once a week, and any repairs required to prevent further rents &c., should be promptly made. All clothes when issued should be entered in the Clothing Book under the pupil's name, with\nwith date of issue; only a limited quantity should be allowed to each pupil.\n\nSANITARY\n\n15. Each pupil should be required to wash thoroughly with soap and water his face, hands, arms and neck thrice a day before each meal, and he should be washed all over at least once a week. New pupils should have a thorough bath immediately on their arrival and the clothing, if from its condition it is considered advisable, should be taken from them and replaced with school clothing. Their heads and bodies should be carefully examined, and, if the presence of vermin is discovered, effectual means should at once be taken to destroy them, and constant examination of all pupils with this end in view should be made.\n\n16. Underclothing should be regularly changed, and bed linen not less frequently.\n\n17. All rooms should be kept well ventilated, especially the sleeping apartments and school room.\n\n18. Refuse and slops should be deposited at a sufficient distance from the premises to prevent all possibility of the latter being affected thereby. All closets inside and outside must be kept scrupulously clean, and in the case of privies and sheds disinfectants such as chloride of lime, carbolic acid, or what is better still, a solution of copperas should be used very liberally.\n\nPRECAUTIONARY\n\n19. Ashes should be emptied at a long distance from the buildings. Pails filled with water should be constantly kept in suitable convenient places throughout the buildings. Boys should be carefully trained how to act in case of fire.\nBritish Columbia\n\nIndian Office\nVictoria Aug 28th 1888.\n\nSir,\n\nI am glad to have the honor to report that there is no trouble at present or to be anticipated so far as I can observe in the administration of Indian Affairs in Kootenay.

The most central locality in the district is, however, on the St. Mary's Reserve adjoining which is an important Roman Catholic Mission. A good site can be secured here with sufficient land for farming purposes, and the irrigating ditch recently made by the Department passes through.

Macdonald, G.C.B.,\nPresident of the Privy Council,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to forward herewith my annual report for the past year, together with the annual reports of the following officers for the same period:\n\nThe Assistant Commissioner,\nSuperintendent, J. Cotton,\ndo J. H. McIlrath,\ndo R. B. Deane,\ndo P. K. Neale,\ndo S. B. Macdonell,\ndo A. H. Perry,\ndo A. H. Griesbach,\ndo A. R. Macdonell,\ndo E. W. Jarvis,\n\nInspector, T. Wattam,\nSenior Surgeon Jukes,\nAssistant Surgeon, Baldwin,\ndo Aylen\ndo Pat\u00e9\ndo Powell\ndo Dodd\n\nActing Assistant Surg.on, Bain,\ndo do Tulloch,\nAssistant Veterinary Surgeon, Burnett.\n\nPATROLS.\n\nThe system of patrols established last year has been continued on a more extended scale with most satisfactory results, very few cases of horse stealing having occurred where the offenders were not brought to justice. Very early in the spring before it was practicable to start the regular patrols, some horses had been stolen from Medicine Hat, and it was thought they had been taken across the boundary line, but they were ultimately found on the Blood Reserve. Two Blood Indians \"The Dog\" and \"Big R.h.\" were arrested on the reserve by a party under Inspector Sanders, were tried, convicted and sentenced to five years in the Penitentiary by Mr. Justice Macleod, but unfortunately escaped from the custody of the Sheriff while awaiting the train at Dunmore. As both are well known to the Police they are certain, sooner or later to be captured.\n\nDuring the year numbers of horses have been reported stolen, but have nearly always been accounted for, many having only strayed off a few miles, and where no trace of them could be found it has always been on account of the delay in notifying the Police. Accurately descriptions of horses stolen on the other side of the line have been sent to us, the few that have turned up on this side being seized and returned to their owners, in fact the speedy justice that is invariably meted out to...\nparties bringing stolen horses into Canada has rendered our territories so dangerous to this kind of criminals that they find it safer to get rid of their stolen horses in United States Territory.\n\nA good many deserters from the American Army have come over with their horses and arms, which have been taken from them and returned to the Authorities, who decided to keep them here, thus doing them a real service.\n\nLarge buildings with stables and corrals have been built at convenient places along the frontier, particularly along the base of the Cypress Hills; these afford shelter to our men in bad weather, and enable our patrols to go out earlier and stay later in the season than they otherwise could, and if allowed the necessary small amount of money, I propose next season to build at convenient situations all along the frontier, the labor being done by the Police, and by putting up hay at these posts, a great saving of horse flesh will result.\n\nA new element in our patrols this season has been introduced in the engagement of some full-blood Indians as scouts who are attached to the patrols and so far have done very good service, being invaluable as trailers, and able and willing to travel excessive distances in an almost incredible space of time. I would recommend to your favourable consideration the increasing the number of these scouts, as their employment will not only greatly assist the Police in patrol duty, but will tend to strengthen the good understanding between the Indians and Police. On several occasions this summer these scouts arrested members of their own tribes, and when they get more accustomed to the life, will be still more efficient. Their tendency at present is to serve a short time and then return home, which is not always convenient. Their pay is $25 per month and rations, and they horse themselves, the Police furnishing arms and saddles.\n\nAll the main trails in the Territories have been watched by police patrols, and at convenient places along them, parties have been stationed during the year. The outposts along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway have been increased, and it has been found necessary now that the Manitoba and North Western Railway has entered the Territories, to establish a post at Langenburg on that road. This party patrols Fort Garry and the York Colony districts, which are remote from headquarters of police divisions.\n\nThe railway service has now assumed such proportions, that I propose with your consent to establish a division of railway police, selected from our ablest and steadiest men, whose special duty it will be to perform all police duties along the lines of railway.\n\nThe unfortunate murders that were committed in the vicinity of Qu'Appelle early in the spring kept a large number of our men employed for a considerable time patrolling the country along the Qu'Appelle and Upper Assiniboine Rivers, but owing to the rough country and the snow and the difficulties (it is shown by the Halibeds concerned in the murder of Hector McLeish, our endeavours only resulted in their being obliged to leave their hiding places, and seek refuge in the United States, where descriptions having been sent, they were promptly arrested by the authorities, and, after the usual formalities, turned over to a detachment of police, and conveyed to Regina where they now await trial. The murderers of McLean have not yet been identified, but it is generally supposed that the same men murdered both McLean and McLeish, both murders occurring at almost the same time.\n\nOne Poole, a settler living north of Whitewood was also found murdered and tied up near the river, several days afterwards his body was discovered, and although a detective was employed, no clue has as yet been found to assist in identifying the assassins. Smith who kept a stopping house on the edge of the Salt Plain, north of Touchwood, was also murdered, and his body found in the bushes, several days after his death. Suspicion pointed strongly to an Indian of that vicinity who had worked for some time for deceased, and he was arrested by Sergeant Macpherson, and the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, above the amount an Indian would be likely to possess in summer, was against him, but he made a statement that he received the money from a squaw of bad character who might have\npossessed that amount, and who having gone to the States, we were unable to secure as a witness; he was therefore released later on for want of evidence.\n\nConsiderable discredit was endeavored to be attached to the police for the failure to arrest in those cases, but the enormous tract of country, the sparse settlement, the time that elapsed before the victims were found, and the facility with which the murderers could travel for several days without being seen by a human being, are sufficient reasons for our bad luck.\n\nIt was found necessary on several occasions during the past year to employ special trains for the rapid transit of police, rendered advisable by the alarming rumours in circulation and the consequent uneasiness of the settlers.\n\nI enclose a map which correctly shows the country patrolled by the police during the past year. (Map will be distributed in a separate cover).\n\n**INDIANS.**\n\nThe conduct of the Indians throughout the Territories during the past year has been remarkably good, those in the North and East having generally stayed at home and worked their farms with the most gratifying results.\n\nAt Red River a large quantity of hay has been supplied the Police under contract by the Indians in the vicinity, the quality being first class, and the requirements of the contract carried out satisfactorily.\n\nEarly in the Spring the Bloods caused a good deal of trouble. A number of their young men, tired of the reserve, and anxious to distinguish themselves, made a dash on Medicine Hat and vicinity and on U.S. Territory, stealing a number of horses. During the summer too we had occasional trouble with them. Occasionally cattle have been killed in the neighbourhood of their reserves, but the arrest, speedy trial and punishment of \"Good Rider,\" a Blood, stopped this practice.\n\nThe capture of a large band of horses stolen from them by U.S. Indians, has had a most beneficial effect, and rendered them much quieter, and lately we have had no trouble with them.\n\nThe Piegan and Sarcees have given no trouble, and with the exception of a few cases of breaking into houses in the vicinity of their reserves, one of which resulted in the shooting of an Indian by a settler named Thompson, who was tried and acquitted, and another case which resulted in the \"Deaffoot\" escape, there have been no difficulties with the Blackfeet.\n\nThe rapid settlement of the country in the vicinity of these tribes, and the system of allowing the Indians on their reserves, practically when they please, together with their being permitted to carry arms (mostly of repeating pattern) is liable sooner or later to result in serious trouble, involving not only the cattle business in the West, but the settlers.\n\nThere is no game requiring rifles to shoot, and if it is impossible to prevent Indians owning repeating rifles, I would suggest that they be compelled to leave them on their reserves.\n\nThe Police have been frequently blamed for not displaying their old firmness and daring when dealing with criminal Indians, but it must be remembered in the old days the Indians could only retaliate on the Police themselves, and on a few traders, quite able and only too ready to take care of themselves. Nowadays the people are scattered all over the country, and rashness on the part of the Police might at any time result in the murder and insult of settlers and their families. There is no deficiency of pluck in the Force I have the honour to command, and when necessary and advisable, I have no doubt the same dash will be found as formerly.\n\nThe scarcity of rabbits throughout the whole Territories, which will now exist for about three years, and the great decrease in the number of deer, will be hard on those Indians who do not receive regular rations, it will however be certain to make them the more anxious to work on their farms, and as they have generally had good crops, and have taken many prizes at the shows this Fall, I have no doubt that next year great progress will be made.\n\n28\u201413\nASSISTANCE TO THE INDIAN DEPARTMENT.\n\nEscorts have been furnished to the Indian Department for attendance at Treaty payments, in many instances the money having been carried by our men, and on several occasions escorts have been provided to convey Indians who had left their reserves back to them. Late in the fall the U.S. authorities notified us that they were about to drive some Indians across the line, and acting on instructions from the Indian Department, parties were sent down to take charge of them and distribute them at their reserves, but the U.S. Troops only took them to the vicinity of the line, and turned them loose, very few crossing the line and falling into our hands. Those that did were escorted to their reserves as directed.\n\nLIQUOR LAWS.\n\nThe enforcement of the North West prohibitory law is more difficult than ever, the sympathy of many of the settlers being generally against us in this matter. Large quantities of liquor have been seized and split, but a great deal more illicit liquor has undoubtedly been used under the cloak of the permit system. Liquor is run into the country in every conceivable manner, in barrels of sugar, salt, and as ginger ale, and even in neatly constructed imitation eggs, and respectable people, who otherwise are honest, will resort to every device to evade the liquor laws, and when caught they have generally the quantity covered by their permits, it is really curious the extraordinary length of time some holders of permits can keep their liquor.\n\nThe permit system should be done away with in the first place if the law is to be enforced, and the law itself should be cleared of the technicalities that have enabled so many to escape punishment this past year.\n\nThe importation and manufacture of a good article of lager beer, under stringent Ireland Revenue regulations, would, in my opinion greatly assist the satisfactory settlement of this vexed question. Nearly all the opprobrium that has been cast upon the Police generally, and my management in particular, can be directly traced to public sentiment on the attempt to enforce this law.\n\nAlthough it has been stated by parties interested in free liquor, that great facilities for drunkenness occur, I can say that there has been no crime of any consequence during the year in this country attributable to whisky, and that the towns and villages throughout the Territories are as quiet and orderly and free from outrage as any place of the same size in the world, which is saying a great deal when it is taken into consideration that we have the usual amount of unsettled population common to all new and frontier countries.\n\nASSISTANCE TO RAILWAY COMPANIES.\n\nDuring the year we have not been called upon by the Canadian Pacific Railway for any unusual assistance, but every endeavour has been made to protect the company as far as possible by suppressing the sale of intoxicants along the line.\n\nIt has been found necessary to discharge a large number of miners at Lethbridge, the North West Coal and Navigation Company, called upon us for assistance, and prompt action being taken, no serious disturbances were made without any loss to property, and both at Lethbridge and Anthracite coal mines every assistance has been given to the proprietors in enforcing law and order.\n\nDetachments of police have been constantly on duty at all the important points on these roads in the Territories, but with the exception of the capture of considerable illicit whisky on several occasions from train hands and others, nothing of any moment has occurred.\n\nHORSES.\n\nDuring the year no eastern horses have been added to our strength, we have been re-horsed entirely with western horses, even the team horses hitherto supplied\nfrom the east have this year been augmented by the selection of the largest and coarsest horses in the ranks, which having been broken to harness have made excellent wagon horses, and I propose in future to follow this practice, as I find a great many horses which are at first fair saddle horses, after a short time under police care and rations, become too heavy for the work, and make excellent teamers. It has been found advisable to cast and sell a good many horses, but good prices have generally been obtained, and their sale has saved serious future loss. A number of deaths have occurred from causes generally incidental to patrolling in countries badly watered, which entail excessive journeys and exposure, but the horses have been taken excellent care of by both officers and men.\n\nAt Prince Albert, where we had no stables during an exceptionally wet summer, a lung disease broke out among our horses, which, in spite of every care, carried off a number, but the same disease proved very fatal to the horses of the settlers in that district, several losing all they had. It is satisfactory to know, however, that the erection of new stables at most of our posts this year will give a better chance of taking care of our horses in future, and if my suggestions about building log posts at convenient distances along the frontier be carried out, our horses will have a better chance, as after a hard ride, exposure is the cause of a great deal of sickness and subsequent death.\n\nThe number of horses now on the strength is 321, and with some exceptions they are a young, sound, powerful and useful lot, and I am now able to report that all the divisions are well provided.\n\nIt will be advisable, however, to purchase 100 horses from time to time next spring as opportunity offers of securing first-class animals at a reasonable figure, to be distributed among the various divisions, and thus enable us to turn out the same number of horses, which will become slightly stale, for a run which will make them capable of much longer service, while if kept at steady work they would, in all probability, collapse before next winter and be a total loss.\n\nSADDLERY AND HARNESS.\n\nThe saddlery of all the divisions is generally in good order, and with the exception of \"H\" division which lost a great deal unavoidably when the riding school was burned at Regina, will require but little expenditure during the coming year; only the ordinary wear and tear replacement being required. It having been found necessary to supply \"D\" Division, in British Columbia, with double cinch saddles, I was able to outfit \"G\" Division hitherto supplied with Canadian saddles, with the single cinch saddles handed over by \"D.\" I propose to buy no more single cinch saddles as the double are better in every way.\n\nThe harness is generally in good order, but about thirty sets of medium light will be required. The harness has so far given general satisfaction, being both light and serviceable and at the same time of good appearance. Very heavy harness is not required in this force, our loads being generally more liable than heavy.\n\nThe halters supplied this year are a great improvement on former issues; many have been made in our own shops. The new bandoliers and buckets have been found most useful, and I would suggest that fifty of each be supplied to each Division at once.\n\nThe present issue of horse blankets is most satisfactory. We are still very short of numnahs, caused by the difficulty of procuring suitable felt, saddle blankets being generally used in default.\n\nFORAGE.\n\nI am pleased to report that there will be a reduction this year in the cost of forage generally, oats having fallen to a reasonable figure at all the posts in the Territories with the exception of Edmonton, owing to the good crops. At Edmonton, a severe frost just at the time the tenders were called for, frightened the sellers, and\nthe tenders though very reasonable for imported oats were too high, as in spite of the frost, a fair crop was threshed out.\n\nHay this year has been plentiful in nearly every District except at Macleod, and has been obtained at reasonable rates, but the general scarcity in the Macleod District, and the quantities the ranchers now consider it necessary to save for their own use, render it extremely doubtful if much further reduction can be expected.\n\nVery little straw is now in use in this force, the waste in hay being with good management quite sufficient for bedding.\n\nThe failure of the oat crop in the Kootenay District has entailed the freighting in of a large quantity, which has necessarily been expensive; the price of hay there is also enormous. Great care however has been exercised by Superintendent Steele, commanding the police in that District, and the horses are kept on the range as much as possible to save expenses.\n\nAt all posts there is marked improvement in the construction of haystacks, but at many of the posts the granaries are not calculated for the economical storage of oats.\n\nTRANSPORT.\n\nThe transport of all the Divisions is generally sufficient, and a few waggons to supply the ordinary wear and tear will only be required next year. Very strong double-backboards have been introduced which with a few alterations have been found very useful, and the adoption of a half-spring axle and thimble skewing, has been found to meet our requirements admirably for patrol purposes. These waggons are deficient in a few minor details which will be altered in our next supply. The repairs to transport, including painting, has in almost every instance been done by our own men.\n\nTo insure the proper care of transport, all posts should at once be supplied with waggon sheds, the outlay in paint alone being good interest on the cost of construction. The disastrous fire at Regina caused the loss of some light transport and sleighs, but the energy of the men saved the greater part. Our commodious waggon sheds being part of the Riding School, perished also.\n\nARMS.\n\nThe whole force is now supplied with Enfield revolvers which are well adapted for our work. I propose to arm the Railway Police with a smaller weapon which can be carried in a less conspicuous manner.\n\nThe Winchester carbine so long the favourite arm with western prairie men is not giving good satisfaction in the Force, the ease with which it gets out of order and its liability to break off at the stock, are serious drawbacks to its efficiency. The advantages of the magazine in this carbine are quite neutralised by the difficulty experienced in keeping it in order, and the great expenditure it offers, especially to young recruits, to waste their time. For a Military weapon the trajectory is very much too high. A good many of the first issues are gradually wearing out, and I would suggest that as soon as it can be settled which is the best carbine now made, one Division be supplied with it, when if satisfactory it can be issued to the rest of the Force.\n\nI would suggest that the repayment price of ammunition be reduced as low as possible that the men may be encouraged to practice independently of their annual drill, and that two marksmen in each Division, receive extra pay and badges.\n\nBARRACKS.\n\nThe new barracks have been completed at Regina and are well suited to our requirements, the difficulty in obtaining seasoned wood however will cause considerable repairs from time to time. The necessity of appointing a competent architect to take charge of Mounted Police improvements is very apparent, as the\nordinary clerk of works does not understand our wants. The loss by fire of the Riding School on November 26, has been a great blow to us and it will be almost impossible to train recruits this winter; its re-erection at an early date is imperative.\n\nThis post is now in good order, and with the exception of a new Riding School and Oat house, the only outlay necessary will be for a few repairs and painting.\n\nEarly in the spring, one of the old log barrack rooms at Calgary was burned down, and since then the division at that post has been very uncomfortable and crowded. In fact when not on duty the men have had no place to spend their evenings, and have been compelled to put in their spare time in the town, which has got several of them into serious trouble. The proposed erection of new barracks to the Regina plan will remedy this, but I regret that it has not been considered advisable to build a brick or stone. Considerable improvements have been made at that post during the winter, the stables being best sided, which will save serious annual expense, and a neat wire fence has been put round the post.\n\nAt Prince Albert an entirely new post has been built, and when finished and fenced in will be most complete. When I inspected it in November, I considered it the best finished, best laid out, and most convenient post under my command, and great credit is due to the clerk of the works, Mr. Peters, and to Superintendent Perry commanding the force there.\n\nAt Battleford the temporary buildings erected last year are in use still, and with the improvements suggested in my previous report to you, will be amply sufficient for the force I propose to keep at that post.\n\nNew barracks are required at Edmonton, our present headquarters at Fort Saskatchewan being out of the way. I would strongly recommend that a new post be commenced in the immediate vicinity of Edmonton, where the main body of the division doing duty in that district should be quartered. This action I should have strongly recommended before if I could have got a suitable site, which can now be found on the surrendered Indian reserve, south of the town.\n\nOnly $2,000 was allowed Superintendent Griesbach to repair and alter Fort Saskatchewan, the division's headquarters, and the assistant commissioner reports very highly of the judicious manner in which he has laid out this money. This is the only post I have not been able to inspect personally this year, but I propose to do so at an early date, when I will select a suitable site for the barracks.\n\nThe post at Macleod is in good order and only the usual painting and repairs will be required next year, unless \"D\" Division returns from Kootenay, when another large stable will be required.\n\nAt Lethbridge the new barracks are rapidly approaching completion and when finished the men will be very comfortable. The site is commanding and dry, but at present the water supply is bad; a pipe and tank from the Galt water system is proposed, the construction of which will remove the difficulty.\n\nAt Medicine Hat the barracks are now in excellent order, but we are badly handicapped in consequence of their position, as when most wanted we are often prevented from crossing the river. The erection of a log outpost at Bulls Head at the Head of the Cypress mountain where a party will be kept at all times except in the dead of winter, and a small town attachment (which for want of building of our own, was badly) is the least I can do at present to counteract the bad situation of the Post, which should be pulled down and re-erected on the south side of the Saskatchewan River, as Indians on horse stealing intent always make for Medicine Hat.\n\nAt Maple Creek, the headquarters of \"A\" Division which supplies the detachment for Medicine Hat, the barracks are in a bad state, they are small, crowded together and most inconvenient, and it is quite impossible to keep a division in good shape. The hospital is a shell, and there is neither recreation room, saddle room or subalterns' quarters. If Maple Creek is to remain the headquarters of a division, a new post should be commenced at an early date.\nAt Wood Mountain, which is the summer headquarters of \"B\" Division (Regina being their winter quarters) a small building and stable costing $1,500, has been erected which affords good accommodation to the small detachment it is necessary to keep there in winter, and additions to this post at an early date would ensure great comfort to the division in summer. $2,000, would cover the cost.\n\nIt having been found advisable to send \"D\" Division under Superintendent Steele to Kootenay last June, it was necessary to construct complete barracks and accommodation for a full division in a country where neither mechanics or finished material could be obtained. These difficulties have been ably overcome by Superintendent Steele, and his division now occupies very comfortable quarters with hospital, stables, &c., complete, entirely constructed by his men, and this done in the face of a virulent outbreak of fever in the division. Too much credit cannot be given to this officer, and indeed to the whole division for these results when opposed by enormous difficulties.\n\nOur greatest weakness at all posts is inadequate fire protection. In winter the inclement nature of the climate renders fire engines, Babbocks and other appliances considered efficacious in more temperate climes, comparatively useless here, and our only safety lies in constant vigilance, for let a fire once start, the best equipped fire brigade in the world would be unable to conquer it with the temperature at 40, and a breeze blowing.\n\nI must again draw your attention to the advisability of at once supplying this force with suitable iron bedsteads in place of the untidy and uncomfortable bed boards and trestle still in use. Every other force in the Dominion has now comfortable iron bedsteads supplied, and even the convicts in the gaols are also supplied with them, while my men sleep on hay palliasses on hard boards.\n\nFUEL.\n\nIn the North, wood is still generally used as fuel although coal has been issued at Edmonton, but wood is generally so reasonable that we find it more economical, besides distributing the money more evenly among the settlers.\n\nIn the South, and along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, we use coal almost entirely, the larger portion of which comes from the Galt Mines. We are trying Medicine Hat coal at that post, and some Bauff anthracite has been used, but until a crusher is employed at that mine it is not yet attempting to test the coal.\n\nThe hard coal used at Regina, in limited quantities, comes from Pennsylvania, but four fifths of the coal used here is from the Galt Mines. This coal burns well but dirties the pipes very soon, and entails constant care.\n\nCoal is still too high, and I hope by next winter to see it considerably reduced in price.\n\nKITS AND INCREASED RATES OF PAY.\n\nThe kits of the men are now generally very complete, and the articles of clothing issued satisfactory, with the exception of the great coats which neither possess the strength nor are sufficiently waterproof for the use of a Force exposed to so much hard work and weather. The disappearance of the buffalo and the difficulty in replacing the coat of that fur hitherto in use with a suitable substitute has rendered us short of fur coats. At present we are trying an article called \"Mountain Calif,\" and if natural black skin of this quality could be used instead of dyed ones, I think this want would be met. The coats supplied this year are long and split-tailed, affording good protection to the men's legs either riding or driving.\n\nCompensation for the kits not required by the men has been introduced lately and is a great boon to the men, while at the same time it will do away with excessive kits, and consequently cause a reduction in transport required, and be a great saving to the Government, the compensation allowance being two thirds of the value.\n\nThe pay of artisans can now be increased when I consider it advisable, and there\nis no doubt the services of a better class of artizans will be secured and retained in the future.\n\nDRILL.\n\nDuring the year every opportunity has been taken to perfect the various divisions in both foot and mounted drill; target practice being completed were practicable. So much patrolling, however, has been necessary that there has not been as much time for drill as formerly.\n\nThe recruits have had a great deal of drill, and have been well instructed in police duties, and with very few exceptions, all the force are good riders. The horses have been well trained to lead and stand fire in addition to regular drill movements.\n\nCONDUCT, DISCIPLINE, &c.\n\nThe conduct of the men in the force has generally been very good indeed during the last year. Nearly every instance of bad conduct has been directly attributable to whisky, and I have found it necessary to summarily dismiss several men. I propose in future with your consent to dismiss all men with dissolute habits as they are only an encumbrance to the force. As soon as the Pension Bill, now under consideration by the force, is carried into effect, there will be no occasion for imprisonment, the imposition of fines and dismissal will cover all cases.\n\nThe energy and good conduct of the non-commissioned officers throughout the force has been a bright example to the men, and I am happy to say that I have no cause to regret any promotions that I have made during the year.\n\nA great deal has been written in the newspapers about dissatisfaction among the men, caused by my bad management and favoritism for Old Countrymen when making promotions. This is not the case as the men are generally well satisfied, strict impartiality having been invariably shown in promotions. Being a Canadian myself of United Empire Loyalist stock, it is hardly likely that I should pass over Canadians, in fact the records of the force in your possession clearly show that there are more Canadian non-commissioned officers in proportion to the number of Canadians in the force than is the case of other nationalities.\n\nDuring the year 179 men became entitled to their discharge by expiration of service. Of these, no less than 85 immediately re-engaged for a further term; 20 who took their discharge have since re-engaged, and 11 men who were discharged in previous years have rejoined the force. Many others would re-engage if there was no objection to married men, but the difficulty of providing married quarters and many other reasons, render the engagement of married constables undesirable.\n\nPHYSIQUE.\n\nThe general physique of the force is of a very high standard, and there are very few men who are not in the prime of life, they are well set up and are generally fit for the arduous work they are liable at any time to be called upon to perform.\n\nHEALTH OF THE FORCE.\n\nWith the exception of malarial fever in Kootenay, which carried off four constables, and at Wood Mountain, which resulted in the death of one constable after the division had moved into winter quarters at Regina, the health of the force has been remarkably good.\n\nIt has been found necessary to invalid a good many men during the year, but with the exception of one or two accidentally injured, all those invalided were suffering from complaints with which they had joined the force.\nRATIONS.\n\nThe patent process flour now issued to the force is giving general satisfaction, and the only article requiring improvement is the coffee which is issued in the bean, and is not of as good quality as the other rations, and it is only with the greatest skill and care that it can be made a pleasant beverage.\n\nThe compressed tea still continues to give the highest satisfaction.\n\nDESERTION.\n\nMost of the deserters were as usual of very short service and were generally town-bred men who were not suited to the lonely life incidental to a policeman's duty in this country.\n\nGreater care is necessary in selecting recruits for this force. Many of the certificates on which men are engaged are written by friends who are anxious to get them out of their neighbourhood, and hope that the discipline of the police will reclaim their proteges.\n\nThe difficulty of getting out of the force is also a great cause of desertion. Offers of more lucrative employment, the illness or death of their parents, legacies left to them, and other causes of a like nature, constantly require some of them to leave the force. Only three or four (out of a thousand men) allowed to purchase their discharge, and as frequently their future depends on a speedy release, they desert. I would suggest that men be allowed to purchase their discharge at 30 days notice, provided that such a course be compatible with the safety of the country.\n\nRANCHING PROSPECTS.\n\nLast winter was generally most disastrous to cattle on the ranges all over America, in our North-West however although the loss was much higher than usual, the best managed ranches suffered but little. A great many cattle died but these were for the most part those that arrived in the country late in the fall and in poor condition, and their owners having no shelter for them, they generally were unable to stand the exceptional weather. There has been a considerable fall in the value of beef this season, and the ranchers have been obliged to seek a market in the Eastern Provinces for their surplus animals. Many of these animals were afterwards shipped to England with very gratifying results, and I think it has now been clearly demonstrated that a fair profit can be obtained in the old country on cattle sent from our extreme west, provided they are of the best quality.\n\nHay in enormous quantities has been put up this year on most of the ranches, and so far the season has been propitious.\n\nCROPS.\n\nThe crops in the agricultural districts of the North-West Territories have generally been extremely good this year. At Edmonton early frosts destroyed a portion of the grain crop and almost entirely ruined potatoes. In the Qu'Appelle Valley district, a great deal of damage was done by hoppers, particularly in light soil. In the ranching country the crop was not a very good one, the season having been late and cold, but hay all over has been an excellent crop, and farmers generally are endeavouring to get into mixed farming as fast as their means will allow.\n\nGAME.\n\nThe late severe winter was disastrous to the antelopes, large bands seeking the vicinity of the settlements in search of food and falling an easy prey, and deer of\nall sorts are now very scarce in the country. The usual supply of most fur-bearing animals is reported to exist, but the almost total extermination of the rabbits from throat disease, that comes regularly every seven years, has been followed by the corresponding scarcity of lynx.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation of the support I have generally received from all ranks during the year, and while quite aware that in many points we are still deficient and capable of improvement, I think that in all respects the efficiency of the force has improved during the past year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nL. W. HERCHMER,\nCommissioner, N.W.M.P.\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE, 1887.\n\nNORTH WEST MOUNTED POLICE,\nCALGARY, N.W.T., 30th November, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report for the year ending 30th November, 1887.\n\nBeing the only inspecting officer at present, my duties necessarily kept me on the road the greater part of my time, and consequently I will have little to say about Calgary which is my head quarters.\n\nAll magisterial work done by me is embraced in the return furnished by the officer commanding \"E\" Division.\n\nIn connection with my duties as assistant commissioner I have travelled a great number of miles during the year, as below:\n\n| Method          | Miles |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| By rail         | 10,461|\n| By water        | 900   |\n| With horses overland | 3,620 |\n| On foot, snow-shoes | 200   |\n\nTotal........................................... 15,181\n\nDuring the year, I have visited every station, including outposts, at which we have men stationed.\n\nReports having been forwarded to the Honourable the Minister that the Indians in the Kootenay District of British Columbia were very uneasy, and likely to give serious trouble to the settlers who are entirely unprotected, I received confidential instructions from you to proceed to Kootenay at once and make a report on the state of the country, the necessity for sending in police, and the best route by which to get them in and the cheapest and best way to provision them while there.\n\nI accordingly started on 1st January accompanied by sergeant Macdonnell, and finding it impracticable, owing to the depth of snow and the impossibility of hiring Indian packers, to get in by Golden City, I proceeded via Victoria and Tocoomah to Sand Point on the United States side of the boundary line, where finding a settler just in from Bonner's Ferry on the Kootenay, I engaged him to take me to that place although there was no good waggon trail from Kootenay Station, six miles east of Sand Point, to Bonner's Ferry, a distance of forty miles, owing to the depth of snow it took us two days to make the distance, and finally it became necessary to leave all our kit, except a change of underclothing and a pair of blankets each, and travel on snow-shoes to Cranbrook, Colonel Baker's place on Joseph Prairie. We travelled up an old pack trail which follows the Magic River for a good part of the distance; it has not been used very much since the trail from Kootenay now going in from Golden City, instead of from Sand Point on the Northern Pacific Railway. The trail was very rough, and having a deal of fallen timber and deep soft snow made the work rather hard. I had Kootenay Indians packing our blankets and provisions, they carried about 35 pounds each, and proved to be capital fellows, very willing and obliging. The Indians did our cooking and baking and were very clean about it; we only carried bacon, flour, tea and sugar.\n\nAt Cranbrook, I hired saddle horses, and visited the settlers, making all possible enquiries, and reported to you that I considered it necessary to send in Police, for the\nreason that I found a very uneasy feeling existing among the settlers as to the Indian question. The older Indians, having a number of cattle, are anxious for peace, but the young men, who are all great gamblers and have no stake in the country are a bad lot, and ready for mischief at any moment.\n\nThe Kootenay Indians are a fine race physically and are Christians of Catholic persuasion. They have an idea of the boundary line and state that they cannot understand why they should not have the run of the Kootenay River as in the past, and which they claim as their country. They strongly protest against being placed on reserves, particularly Nos. 3 and 4 Bands, the former saying that they want to live where they always have lived, a number of them having cattle.\n\nThey also say that the reserve is in no way suited for their purposes; they also object strongly to Colonel Baker taking up a portion of land, which he purchased from Mr. Galbraith, or the Government, on Joseph's Prairie, and which is claimed as being inherited from old Joseph, in his lifetime a notable chief of the Kootenays.\n\nNo. 4 Band live principally on the American side of the line, and object to their reserve. They are, from what I hear, a bad lot. There are always a number of renegade whites and Indians living with this Band and traders openly sell whiskey which, of course, makes matters much worse.\n\nThere are about three hundred and fifty fighting men in the various bands, all well armed and with plenty of ammunition.\n\nAt the same time I forwarded you a map of the country and a report of the best routes into it and the easiest way to station the force sent in.\n\nI returned to Calgary early in February, visited High River on the 19th inst. and inspected the Detachment there.\n\nOn the 25th I proceeded to Regina, remaining there until the 5th March (being employed on a board examining non-commissioned officers who had put in a course of instruction) when I returned to Calgary.\n\nOn the 16th I again started for Regina to take over command during your absence on duty at Ottawa, but had to go to Calgary again on the 20th to hold an investigation into the cause of a fire by which one of the barrack buildings was destroyed; I returned to Regina on the 24th and remained in command until your return on 1st May.\n\nI left for Calgary on 2nd May.\n\nI omitted to state that in December 1886 I inspected \"A\" Division at Maple Creek and Medicine Hat.\n\nOn the 11th May I proceeded on special duty to Golden City.\n\nOn the 24th I started overland to the Governor General's Crossing of the Red Deer for the purpose of making arrangements for \"K\" Division and seeing them safely over the Red Deer River, which fortunately was just fordable. This Division arrived at the River in capital form, both men and horses.\n\nIn June, having been ordered to accompany the Commissioners Vowell and Powell, I proceeded to Kootenay via Golden City, taking the steamer \"Duchess\" as far as the Lower Columbia Lake; from there we took horses to Wild Horse Creek, an old mining camp. Chief Isadore was sent for, and after several days interview, he agreed to hand over Kapula to the British Columbian authorities, wherever called upon to do so.\n\nThis Kapula had been arrested on suspicion of murder, and Isadore and his band had released him.\n\nI found, as suggested in my former report, that the United States Government had sent 25 men to Tobacco Plains from their camp at Missoula.\n\nThe Indians I found well armed and have about 500 cattle and 2,000 ponies.\n\nThe settlers have about 1,000 head of cattle and a few horses.\n\nThere are some \"Stoneys\" in the Valley ostensibly on a trading visit, but I have reason to suspect their object was to give assistance, if any row had occurred with the Kootenays.\n\nFrom appearances I considered that most of the oats could be supplied in the\ncountry, but the crop was destroyed almost entirely and it was necessary to send in nearly all the grain required.\n\nI made arrangements for Superintendent Steele's Division as far as possible, and gave him all the information I had acquired.\n\nI returned to Calgary on the 6th July and proceeded to Regina on the 9th, remaining there until the 16th.\n\nOn the 21st I started from Calgary on a tour of inspection through the Northern Posts. I inspected the detachments of \"Q\" Division at Red Deer and Edmonton and the head-quarters of the division at Fort Saskatchewan. I found the division in good order, the buildings very comfortable. I proceeded on to Battleford, going by way of Vipine, Saddle Lake, Onion Lake and Fort Pitt, inspecting the detachment at Onion Lake.\n\nI was astonished at the change I found in the country, in many places ponds, which used to be quite deep, were dry, there was also a great scarcity of small game.\n\nI inspected \"C\" Division and reported that the buildings required to be made wind and weather tight, before they would be fit for winter.\n\nI then proceeded to Prince Albert and inspected headquarters of \"P\" Division. I was much pleased with the situation of the new barracks, both in a strategical as well as a sanitary point of view; the buildings are splendidly constructed, and will be warm and comfortable, they are the best arranged barracks I have seen in Canada.\n\nI inspected the detachments of \"F\" Division at Batoche and Touchwood Hills and reached Regina on the 17th August, having made 1,000 miles on the prairie. I then returned by rail to Calgary. On the 3rd September Deerfoot, a Blackfoot Indian, was arrested for larceny and escaped. By your instructions on the 4th September, I visited the Blackfoot camp, for the purpose of interviewing chief Crowfoot, and had a long talk with him, but finding it impossible to get the surrender of Deerfoot, wired you to that effect.\n\nTrembling Man, who was shot by Thompson, died that day in the upper camp; there seems considerable discontent amongst the Indians over it, particularly as at that time Thompson was on bail, and Bad-Dried-Meat, who shot Thompson's comrade, Peach, was in confinement. The Indians did not understand the difference. I explained the law of bail as well as I could and Crowfoot was perfectly satisfied.\n\nMy subsequent failure to arrest Deerfoot I have already reported to you, but if we were unsuccessful, we had a good opportunity to learn all about the reserve, part of which is very much cut up with sand hills and ravines and a difficult country to operate in. An opportunity was also given to us to make a show in force, and this undoubtedly, has had a good effect on the Indians generally.\n\nOn the 11th September I started for Regina, and on the 14th I left with horses to visit the outposts to the east and south, and inspected all of them, viz:\n\n\"B.\"\u2014Qu'Appelle, Langenburg.\nDepot Moosomin.\n\"B.\"\u2014Wood End, Willow Bunch, Wood Mountain.\n\"A.\"\u2014East End Post, Farwell, Ten Mile Crossing, Graburn, Bull's Head, Willow Creek.\n\"E.\"\u2014Pen d'Oreille, Writing Rock, Milk River Ridge, Kipps Coulee.\n\"H.\"\u2014Stand Off, St. Mary's, Dry Forks Kootenai, Pincher Creek, Crow's Nest, The Leavings.\n\"E.\"\u2014High River.\n\nI am of opinion that it would be expedient to put up houses and stables at all the different outposts, also to have hay put up so that detachments could, if necessary, remain out all winter, even if they did not, men could periodically be sent out along the line and would make a house every night.\n\nI would recommend also that detachments be established between Wood End and East End Post; it is a rather long distance to cover.\n\nFrom all I could gather the patrol system has given general satisfaction, and, I\nam positive, prevented a great deal of crime. Horse stealing has been reduced to a minimum.\n\nI found the horses everywhere of excellent quality and in capital condition; of course there were necessarily some which had broken down, this may be expected from the severe work which our horses frequently called upon to perform.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that I consider the Broncho horses are the most suitable in every way for our service, both teaming and saddles. Of course we have a number of Canadian horses, which have turned out well, but taking all things into consideration, I give the preference to the Broncho.\n\nI found everywhere that all articles of Government property were being well taken care of; however some of the stations urgently require waggon sheds and harness racks, as many of these it is very hard on transport, &c.\n\nThe physique of the men is very fine.\n\nThe food I have seen this year has been of first class quality.\n\nI attach a table of distances which might be of service if printed and distributed among the different divisions.\n\nTrusting this report may prove satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Commissioner.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nNorth West Mounted Police,\nRegina.\n### TABLE OF DISTANCES\n\n| Route Description                                                                 | Miles

COTTON, 1887.\n\nNORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE,\nBATTLEFORD, 30th November, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report for 1887.\n\nThe past winter was a quiet and uneventful one as far as the Battleford district was concerned. The weather was exceptionally severe, but, notwithstanding this, patrolling was regularly kept up. The different Indian reserves in this agency, viz., Mo-quito (Assiniboine), Red Earth Pheasant's (Cree) in the Eagle Hills; Sweet Grass, Poulmakin's and Little Pines (all Cree) on the Battle River, and Moosomin's (Saulteaux) and Thunder Child's (Cree) on the Saskatchewan River, were visited monthly by our patrols. In all cases careful enquiry was made as to the general state of the Indians and the nature of the employment they were engaged in. These enquiries, as shown from the substance of the monthly reports submitted to you, were eminently satisfactory. One of the benefits arising from systematic patrolling was the making manifest to Indians that a watchful police supervision was maintained over their actions.\n\nOn representations made to you by the Indian Department it was decided to establish a permanent outpost from Battleford at Onion Lake, 12 miles north-west of Fort Pitt. The strength of the detachment stationed at this place was 1 non-commissioned officer and 10 constables, supplied from \"C\" and \"K\" divisions. Accommodation for the men was obtained from the Indian Department, by its placing a small building at our disposal. A suitable stable was erected with our own labor at a more nominal cost. This detachment was inspected monthly by an officer sent for that purpose from this post. By the purchase of such provisions and forage as were obtainable on the spot, very material assistance was rendered to Indians willing to work. Of the services rendered by this detachment I have always had exceedingly good reports. Every assistance in our power was given to the Indian Department. Law and order were efficiently maintained, and the presence of a small body of police in a distant isolated portion of the Territories was not without its good effects. At a comparatively speaking recent date the Indian Department notified me that the building which has been in occupation, was required for their departmental use. I represented this to you, and on your authority I rented a suitable building from Mr. Gibson, of Onion Lake, which building the detachment now occupies. It affords comfortable and healthy quarters. The stable built near the Indian Department building we had formerly used, I had removed with police labor to a convenient position immediately adjoining Mr. Gibson's building. Since the removal of \"K\" division from Battleford to Lethbridge, the Onion Lake detachment has been composed solely of non-commissioned officers and constables from \"C\" Division. The usual monthly inspections are still continued. In making these inspections the officers detailed for that duty have at different times experienced very considerable difficulty in forcing their parties across the Saskatchewan River opposite Fort Pitt. The only means of crossing the river is by the employment of an old scow, the property of the Hudson's Bay Company. As a considerable quantity of Government freight, for both the Indian and Police departments, has to be landed at this point, I would bring to your notice with a view to its receiving favorable consideration, a proposition recently made by the Hudson's Bay Company to the effect that if the Indian and Police Departments would each contribute one-third of the cost, the company would build and\nkeep in repair a good scow and cable across the Saskatchewan. I trust you will consider yourself in a position to bring this matter to the notice of the Honorable the Indian Commissioner.\n\nAnother outpost was established in the half-breed settlement of Bressaylor, which is situated between the Saskatchewan and Battle Rivers at a point about 24 miles west of Battleford. Quarters for the men and stabling for the horses were rented from some of the half-breed residents. The detachment comprising this outpost was also inspected monthly by an officer sent from Battleford. The departure of \"K\" Division from Battleford reduced by half the force under my command. This brought about the compulsory abandonment of the Bressaylor outpost. The settlement is now visited weekly by our patrols.\n\nA small detachment was stationed for duty on the trail from Battleford to Swift Current, with its headquarters at the 60-mile bush, south from here. This detachment has just been recalled for the winter months.\n\nThe large extent of country covered by patrolling parties sent from here will be seen on reference to the enclosed map. (Included in Commissioner's Map.)\n\nI very recently furnished transport and escort for a party of 36 Cree Indians returning from south of the International boundary line, to their reserves in this district.\n\nOn the 18th May, in accordance with orders received from you, \"K\" Division marched from Battleford en route to Lethbridge. The route taken being via the Red Deer River (Governor General's Crossing,) Blackfoot Crossing and Macleod. A portion of the transport required was furnished from \"C\" Division. This transport returned from the Red Deer River. \"K\" Division served under my command for a period extending over eight months, during which time the conduct of the non-commissioned officers and men was exemplary.\n\nIn my annual report of last year I gave a detailed statement of the additional barracks accommodation erected at this post by the Department of Public Works in the autumn of 1886. You are aware that the buildings used as quarters for the non-commissioned officers and men were regarded as for temporary use, the intention being to ultimately utilise them as permanent stables. As no new barracks were built at Battleford this year, it was found necessary to effect minor repairs in order to ensure the present buildings being made comfortable for the winter; and an appropriation of $5,000 was made for this purpose. The original estimate for this expenditure is as follows:\n\n| Officers' Quarters\u2014 |\n|---------------------|\n| Porch, front door... | $20.00 |\n\n| Married Officers' Quarters\u2014 |\n|-----------------------------|\n| Repairing roofs............. | $39.50 |\n\n| Mess cottage\u2014 |\n|---------------|\n| Repairing roof and plaster, painting roof, &c........ | $287.65 |\n\n| Guard room and cells\u2014 |\n|-----------------------|\n| Old barrack room proposed to be turned into guard room, to be pulled down, roof taken off in sections, and re-erected in a convenient place to present barracks... | $983.45 |\n\n| Bake oven\u2014 |\n|------------|\n| Building up oven................................. | $200.00 |\n\n| Well House\u2014 |\n|-------------|\n| Clap boarding and building, making a floor and ceiling, sheathing walls, traps in ceiling, double doors and windows, painting, &c.................................. | $314.00 |\n\n| Old Stable\u2014 |\n|------------|\n| Beams and flooring stalls.......................... | $384.40 |\nNew Stable\u2014\nMaking ceiling, painting roof and doors, and making traps ........................................... $563.23\n\nBarrack Rooms\u2014\nRepairing roofs and cornices, papering walls and ceilings, making porches and painting roofs .................. $836.20\n\nMess Room\u2014\nRepairing roofs, cornices, painting same, papering kitchens and ceilings .................................... $331.57\n\nHospital\u2014\nMaking porches, double windows, painting roof, plastering inside ............................................. $900.00\nLumber for making shelves ......................................................... $200.00\n\n$5,000.00\n\nThe repairs were to be done under the direction of the Clerk of Public Works, stationed at this place. After the appropriation, I have alluded to, was made, orders were received from the Department of Public Works, at Ottawa, to advertise for tenders for the construction of a new guard room in accordance with plans and specifications provided. Tenders were called for and contracts subsequently let by the Clerk of Public Works. The new guard room is now being proceeded with, and will, I think, be ready for use in a month's time. The site upon which this building is placed was selected by me, and is in conformity with the position in which the buildings erected last fall were placed.\n\nI would again remind you that the buildings comprising the old post proper are for much the greater part positively uninhabitable. I trust the completion of a new post will not be postponed. On this head I would renew my recommendations of last year. Whatever decision is arrived at, I have to impress upon you the importance of letting contracts and having the work done early in the season. The employment of carpenters and other artisans at outside work during the winter months is certainly neither expeditions nor economical, and the work performed is often not as serviceable as is otherwise would be. The repairs shown in the original estimate enumerated above are now being carried out by the Clerk of Public Works. Of course the erection of a new guardroom does away with the necessity for utilizing old material in the manner previously contemplated. Another exception. Instead of building an oil bake oven, as originally intended, the construction of a perfectly dry one outside the post was authorized. Over this oven a thoroughly good and substantial log building was erected by the judicious use of such material as we had at hand. The lateness of the season will preclude the possibility of completing the repairs estimated for.\n\nWhen completed, the hospital at this post, which is well laid out and amply suited to our requirements, will be thoroughly serviceable and an exceedingly comfortable building. This building should, next year, be sided with tongued and grooved lumber, and painted.\n\nAs I pointed out last year, the pump then in use in well house at this post proved of very limited power. On representing this to you a good serviceable pump was supplied. This pump is now up and working order. Although our well is nearly 80 feet deep, the supply of water is not as great as I should desire. We are now constructing a reservoir tank capable of holding about 400 barrels of water. This tank will always be kept filled, and thus, in case of fire we shall at all times have a reserve supply of water at command. I trust we will soon be in a position to deepen the well and so increase what I may term our permanent water supply.\n\nIn July last I received the hand fire engine for use at this post. This engine is fully equipped with good stout hose; and is well calculated to meet our wants.\nThough small, it is one of very considerable power. The performances made at fire drill have been most satisfactory. At a recent date a fire which originated in the hay corral was, by use of this engine, promptly extinguished without any loss to property.\n\nI am thankful to be able to say that the medical history of this post during the past year has been a most favorable one\u2014a marked contrast with that of 1886. During the summer and autumn months of that year typho-malarial fever of most serious form was prevalent throughout this district. This year we have to record but two cases (one of these being a prisoner in the guard room) neither of which were serious. The cleanliness and proper ventilation of all buildings was made the subject of constant care and attention. The sanitary arrangements were put into the disposal of all slops and refuse were carefully carried out, and I doubt not we have materially profited thereby. On the 18th June, in accordance with your instructions, the divisions was moved into camp about a mile from the barracks, where it remained until the 5th August.\n\nThe transport of my division consists of\n\n- 1 ambulance\n- 5 buckboards\n- 6 wagons, heavy\n- 3 \" light\n- 2 \" half spring\n- 2 \" light\n\nWinter transport:\n\n- 10 heavy bob sleighs\n- 1 box sleigh\n\nFour of the buckboards represent little more than mere waste material. They are the remnants of buckboards supplied at various dates to the different divisions previously serving at this post, and taken over by me from \"K\" Division. I now have your authority to condemn them by a Board of officers. This will shortly be done and the returns no longer have a tendency to mislead. The balance of the transport is in thoroughly serviceable condition. The repairs necessary from time to time have been effected by our own artisans. The double buckboards supplied last summer are exactly what we require. I trust two more may be issued to us in the spring, as well as two lighter ones of the same make to drive with one horse. I might mention that I had to put new axles in one of the Minchinton wagons. There is no doubt that this was rendered necessary by the maker having made use of inferior material in the manufacture. The half-spring pack wagons which we received last summer meet our requirements well, and supply a long felt want. Such additions to the winter transport as were necessary have already been added by you.\n\nMy harness and saddlery has been kept in exceptionally good order. On the \"stitch in time\" principle, repairs when necessary have been done in a workmanlike manner by constable Hollister, who takes much interest in his work, and who is a very efficient saddler. The artillery harness for the 9-pr. M. L. R. guns I have had thoroughly overhauled under my own supervision. Such slight repairs as were necessary I had made. This harness presents an appearance which would do credit to any Battery of Artillery. I am in need of a full supply of numnahs. I also require 75 Whitman bits. The Pelham bit I dislike. Of whatever use it may be deemed in other countries, it is to my mind absolutely unsuited to our brown saddle horses.\n\nDuring the summer my division went through a course of musketry. Taking the average of the scores made at target practice, the shooting on the whole was very fair. Our Winchester carbines are in many cases badly sighted, and I have no doubt the experience gained in other divisions on this head is in keeping with my own.\nMy division has gone through a very thorough course of drills\u2014mounted and dismounted. I think I have every reason to be proud of the state of efficiency arrived at. A special class for the instruction of non-commissioned officers was formed under Sergeant Major White. Skeleton or rope drill enables non-commissioned officers to acquire a knowledge of divisional movements, even when the number of men on parade is small, which, except when a general parade is ordered, is usually the case from the nature of the daily duties demanded of us.\n\nI have also carefully drilled a M. L. R. gun detachment, and instructed the non-commissioned officers and men in the use and application of projectiles and stores. I would recommend, for the use of divisions having 9 pr. M. L. R. guns attached to them, a more liberal issue of the drill book known as the \"Canadian Field Artillery Manual\"; or perhaps a still better plan would be to make such extracts from this book as would be ample for our requirements. These extracts, including range tables, could be cheaply published in pamphlet form.\n\nWe have at this Post two 9-pr. M. L. R. guns and two 7-pr. mountain guns (bronze). I have given personal supervision to the care of the general stores appertaining to these guns. With regard to our artillery branch, which in time of trouble would be of paramount importance, the 9-pr. M. L. R. guns, though a suitable arm for ordinary field batteries, are certainly not what we require. In the first place, any division to which 9-pr. guns were attached would require to be largely augmented in horses. One of these guns in travelling any distance requires six horses and harness. At the lowest estimation one spare horse for each gun would be required. At least three gunners (including the No. 1) would require to be mounted on saddle horses. We are without ammunition waggons, which on active service would have to be supplied. For this purpose I have no doubt we should improve some of our heavy waggons. For each waggon a horse and harness would be necessary. The 9-pr. guns weigh 8 cwt (English standard). They could not be moved as rapidly as would be required if an attempt made to have them act in unison with a purely cavalry force. The Royal Horse Artillery gun of the same calibre is lighter than those we have. Even the Royal Horse Artillery gun is heavier than we require. We would never need so formidable an arm in Indian warfare. With a much lighter gun our artillery branch would attain all the efficiency and power desirable. I would recommend that a Nordenfeldt machine gun be attached to each division. Of course what I have said of the 9-pr. M. L. R. guns applies to the difficulties arising in their transport. I have no doubt that in some cases they might be transported about our posts.\n\nNow with regard to the 7-pr. mountain guns it must be conceded that as mountain guns we will not require to use them. The carriages and limbers now in use should be replaced by carriages and limbers of field gun pattern. They could be made considerably lighter than those used with the old pattern 3-pr. S. B. gun. Such carriages and limbers could be manufactured in this country. A special estimate would have to be made of the material required. An estimate of this nature I will prepare and forward you. These 7-pr. mountain guns weigh but 224 lbs. They can be readily moved with a mounted division. These little guns are sighted up to 2600 yards. At 1,200 yards I have made excellent practice with them.\n\nI have at various times borne testimony to the excellence of the different articles of clothing and kit supplied to the non-commissioned officers and men. I regret to say that, while this is still generally the case, there are this year some exceptions which I think should be brought to your notice.\n\nI am of opinion that the tunic material should be of better quality.\n\nThe last issue of cloaks (grey) cannot be compared with the blue ones of the same pattern previously supplied. A cloak which is not thoroughly waterproof, and which affords little warmth to the wearer, cannot be regarded as serviceable for prairie use.\n\nFor years I have been in favor of discarding helmets and forage caps. To my mind both furnish wretched head dress. I think the forage caps may be replaced by large soft felt hats. Such a hat is in general use by the United States troops serving in the West. The overshirt material is good, but should be more thoroughly\nshrunk before the shirts are made up. Our underclothing is excellent though the socks are decidedly longer than they need be, particularly when it is borne in mind that they are worn with riding breeches.\n\nIt appears to me the day has arrived when anything in the shape of a \"red coat\" for prairie work should be discarded. I am in sympathy with the recommendations made last year by Superintendent Jarvis, and I hope a prairie suit may yet be issued to us. Such suit should be of a neutral color made of material which is commonly known as \"velveteen cord\" and consisting of riding breeches and loose coat with pockets\u2014the old fashioned Norfolk jacket is, I think, the most suitable shape. The cost of such a suit as I have roughly described could, as I notice Superintendent Jarvis recommends, easily be defrayed by dispensing with some of the articles of clothing now issued.\n\nI quote the following paragraph taken from my previous annual report. As I have previously stated it still applies with equal force: \"During your recent inspection I pointed out to you the serious discomfort which non-commissioned officers and men experience from the fact of their not being supplied with bedsteads. The old boards and trestles still in use have become sadly dilapidated through wear and tear. Even when new they make a very poor substitute for a bed, and, in addition to this present a sorry appearance in a barrack yard.\"\n\nI have to bring to your notice the advisability of letting during the coming winter, a contract for the getting out of canvas or posts for the purpose of enclosing the new buildings at this place. This enclosure might be made by building either a palisade or a barbed wire fence with top rail. The wire fence would be the least expensive.\n\nI trust it is the intention of the Government to erect a permanent bridge over the Battle River during the coming year. Up to this time the removal of the temporary bridge in winter and its re-erection in the spring has always been compulsory.\n\nThis represents the useless expenditure of the interest on a large sum of money. All freight coming in, and nearly all going out from Battleford, must cross this bridge, which is in fact one of the greatest embarrassments in the Territories.\n\nWith a view of having the matter brought to the notice of the Post Office authorities, I would request you that there is no direct mail communication between Battleford and Prince Albert. The distance between the two places is 135 miles (shortest route), yet a letter mailed in Battleford for Prince Albert has to travel overland to Swift Current, a distance of 200 miles. From Swift Current it goes by the Canadian Pacific Railway to Qu'Appelle Station, a distance of 40 miles, and then overland again from Qu'Appelle to Prince Albert\u2014another 80 miles. In other words, a reply to a letter cannot be received from Prince Albert, in much less time than one month. I believe a change in the Prince Albert mail route is in contemplation. I am informed that the new route will be from Moose Jaw to Prince Albert via Saskatoon. If this is the case special mail will, I trust, be established between Battleford and Saskatoon. The distance between these two last named places is less than 90 miles. I am aware, also, that a proposition has been made to the effect that mail communication between Battleford and the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway should also be from Moose Jaw via Saskatoon. Such a route would be very objectionable to the residents of the Battleford district. From Battleford to Swift Current is much the more direct route. It is the better road of the two and one on which freight will always be brought in. At present Battleford has but one mail a week. I am of opinion that when tenders are called for a new mail contract, it will be found that a semi-weekly mail service to Swift Current can be established at little more than the present cost. I trust this will be taken into consideration in calling for new tenders.\n\nI think you will agree with me that a money order office is urgently required in Battleford.\n\nThere is a fortnightly mail service between Battleford and Fort Pitt. In the performance of this service the mail passes through Bresaylor settlement which is now become a point of some importance. As yet no arrangement has been made for the\nestablishment of a Post Office at this place. I trust this also may receive consideration at the hands of the Post Office Department. The increased expenditure on this head would be very slight.\n\nSince I wrote my last annual report telegraph communication has been established between Battleford and Fort Pitt.\n\nThe Hon. the Minister of the Interior visited Battleford in September last. Such transport and escort as were necessary were furnished by my Division. I trust that the duty devolving upon us in this respect was performed to the entire satisfaction of the Minister.\n\nI enclose herewith the annual report of Asst. Surgeon Aylen, returns of cases tried at this Post, and target practice. (Returns of target practice not printed).\n\nYou will observe that there have been very few convictions under the North-West Territories Act for infractions of the prohibitory liquor laws. I know of no other district in the Territories which, in this respect, can make a more favorable showing. Several trading outfits were searched during the season, but in no case was any liquor found. I firmly believe that every drop of liquor brought into Battleford came in on permit.\n\nI cannot speak too highly of the conduct of the non-commissioned officers and men comprising my division. In saying this I am not giving expression to any mere conventionality. There has been a total absence of any serious crime, and never in my experience have I seen so few entries in the defaulters' book. I need not add how proud I am to be able to say this.\n\nBefore closing I wish to bring to your most favorable notice the name of Inspector Starnes. In addition to the ordinary duties devolving upon this officer as an inspector, he has also performed those of post adjutant and quartermaster. Inspector Starnes takes a deep interest in his work, in the performance of which he is diligent and thoroughly capable.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJOHN COTTON,\nSuperintendent Commanding.\n\nThe Commissioner\nNorth-West Mounted Police,\nRegina.\nAPPENDIX C.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT J. H. McILLREE.\n\nNORTH WEST MOUNTED POLICE,\nMAPLE CREEK, 18th November, 1887.\n\nSir.\u2014I have the honour to forward my Report from 1st December, 1886, to 19th November, 1887.\n\nAll Detachments were in Barracks by the 7th December, with the exception of two men I had in charge of a herd of cattle at East End Post, seized for non-payment of duty. On 17th January Inspector Norman sent a party from Medicine Hat to the Saskatchewan Coal Mine, the miners being on strike. The difficulty was settled and quiet restored. I sent out a party on the 11th of February to look for some men from this place who had taken over night to Assiniboine and had been out on their return trip nearly a month. They were found near Ten-Mile Crossing, without any provisions, and more or less frozen. Provisions and transport were sent out to them, and they were brought in. A boy who was of the party lost parts of both his feet. On 16th March it was reported that some Bloods had been seen in the Hills. I sent out scouts Cobelle and Queenelle but they found no trace of Indians. The snow was still very deep in some parts of the Hills. On 22nd March I went to Lethbridge to meet Superintendent Neale to arrange as to where his patrol should meet mine. The Medicine Hat Ranch Company reported to Inspector Norman on 27th March that a number of their horses had been stolen. Mr. Norman sent Staff Sergeant Spicer and three men in pursuit. Spicer had the trail for some time and recovered one mare in Medicine Lodge, but finally lost trail, and went into Assiniboine and from there on to Fenton, but did not find any trace of horses. The horses were eventually recovered at the Blood Camp. There having been a good deal of uneasiness reported to be existing among the half-breeds at Saskatchewan Landing, I sent out after Leveill\u00e9 up there, but except that they were holding frequent meetings there did not appear to be anything unusual going on. On 31st March scouts M. Queenelle and Leveill\u00e9 were sent out on a five days' scout. Indians were reported to have been seen near here. On 3rd April, I sent a strong party out and searched the country thoroughly. No traces of Indians found. The next morning a man named Bradley reported his horses stolen. A party was sent out with scout Cobelle and horses were trailed and found some seven miles from Bradley's house, from where they had strayed. On 5th April a small scouting party was sent out. On the 14th Mr. Gunn's son Rod Davis reported that his three horses had been stolen at Medicine Hat. Another horse was stolen from a settler, and a son of Mr. Gobbett fired at by an Indian who was trying to get into the stable. Two of Gunn's horses were subsequently recovered on the Blood Reserve.\n\nOn 14th April the first detachment for frontier duty was sent out, a Non-Com. Officer; five men and a scout. They went to Ten Mile Crossing. On 16th Inspector Moodie arrived for duty at Medicine Hat to relieve Inspector Norman, ordered to Headquarters. On 16th the detachment for duty at \"Bull's Head\" left Medicine Hat.\n\nDetachment for Willow Creek left Maple Creek on the 19th.\n\nThe Medicine Hat Ranch Company having reported that two of their cattle had been killed, I sent four men to go down at ranch and scout that section of the country. On evening of 26th April ex-policeman Gow came in from Graburn and reported that Indians had killed two of his cows; his partner, Stothers, having seen these Indians packing off the meat. I started Inspector Mills out in a couple of hours with twelve\nmen, wired instructions to Inspector Moodie at Medicine Hat, and notified detachment at Ten-Mile Crossing and Willow Creek to send all men that could be spared to Graburn. The Indians had moved down to some heavy timber, down McKay Creek, and the parties in pursuit did not effect their capture, the Indians getting away on foot during the night. Three horses were however captured which these Indians had stolen; two large draught horses from Sand's mill and a cayuse belonging to a Cree Indian. One of the horses was loaded with meat from the slaughtered cows, some provisions also found, dropped by the Indians. Sergeant Spicer had gone out from Medicine Hat with a party to endeavor to intercept the Indians from Graburn, he sent a man into Dunmore and reported that he had come across a party of Indians located in a deep coulee about 25 miles from Dunmore. That on endeavoring to approach the Indians\u2014who were all on foot\u2014they opened fire, and Spicer and his party retired. He stated there were from fifteen to twenty Indians. I ordered Inspector Moodie to take all available men he had to join Spicer, and try and take up trail of these Indians; this however he was unable to do, the Indians being on foot and the country intersected in every direction with deep and heavily wooded coulees.\n\nOn the 7th three horses were stolen from a man named Watson at Medicine Hat and the next day Rev. Mr. Tudor, A half breed boy was fired at the same night, the ball going through the rim of his hat. Mr. Tudor's horse was afterwards found on the Blackfoot Reserve, Watson's horses were also recovered.\n\nOn the 3rd May, I reinforced the detachments at Bull's Head and Willow Creek. On the 9th I sent a detachment to East End for duty, six men and a scout.\n\nI received orders from Customs Department to seize a herd of cattle belonging to one S. Spencer, for infraction of the Customs Act. I immediately proceeded to round up the cattle, and put Corp. Meneley in charge, about 183 head were collected, and were brought in to Maple Creek, and sold there by Dr. Allen, Inspector of Customs.\n\nOn the 14th May I sent detachment to Farwell for duty, which completed my line of depots necessary to keep up the weekly communication. I also sent an extra detachment of six men and a scout to Graburn. Inspectors Primrose and Mills were also on detachment duty.\n\nOn the 20th, two Indians on their way to Stony Mountain, escaped from Sheriff Campbell at Dunmore; men were sent out from Medicine Hat to search country and all detachments notified, but the Indians were not recaptured.\n\nOn 18th June a half-breed Sioux was arrested here charged with having in his possession a horse belonging to a Sioux of Mr. White Cap's band. The horse was recovered and as the Sioux would not prosecute, I released the prisoner, keeping the horse. On the 25th a settler named Adsett living south from Irvine, reported to detachment at Graburn and Bull's Head, that their horses had been stolen. Men from both detachments were promptly on hand and the horses were found, having simply strayed. On 6th July, the telegraph station at Battle Creek was completed, The Rocky Mountain Telegraph Company furnished instruments, and Constable Kennedy was installed as operator.\n\nI went into Fort Assiniboine on the 21st July on special duty and returned on the 30th. On 3rd several Indians were arrested for being off their reserves, and were sent to Regina, under escort. A man named Farley was arrested west of Medicine Hat on a warrant charging him with stealing two horses from Mr. Fenton, C.P.R. Agent at Swift Current. When arrested he had a Police revolver in his possession, loaded with five cartridges, stolen from the town station at Maple Creek. I gave him 3 months imprisonment for the offence, and he is to be tried for the horse stealing. The two horses stolen by him were recovered, as well as a rifle belonging to Mr. Fenton and also stolen by Farley.\n\nI sent team and man into Fort Assiniboine on the 13th August, with Mr. Scott, on business in connection with extradition of McLeish murderers.\n\nOn 4th October I went to meet the Assistant Commissioner, and accompanied him on a tour of inspection of the outposts of my district, returning to Maple Creek on the 13th.\n\nOn 8th October Inspector Sanders arrived from Macleod for duty, on the 11th.\nInspector Sanders, with two non-commissioned officers and 9 men and interpreter, left for Kennedy's Old Post on Milk River, to take over a number of Cree Indians put over the line by the American troops. The Indians had been across the line some days before Inspector Sanders arrived, and had scattered about the country. Some returned across the line, and have gone, I believe, to the South Piegans Reserve; a few went into Medicine Hat, and are now in guard room, awaiting orders as to their disposition. A few were allowed to come home. Five lodges were left at Battle Creek, and the remnants taken on to Swift Current, where a party under charge of Sergeant Tucker still have charge of them.\n\nOn 15th October, Staff Sergeant McGinnis arrested some people on No. 2 train who were connected with the railway ticket forgery at Calgary, and brought them back to that place.\n\nOn 25th October, the town station at this place was burnt down. It was an old frame wooden building. The constable in charge hearing a disturbance outside about 2.30 a.m. went out, and was away about half an hour, when he returned the whole building was in flames. He lost all his kit, and private effects.\n\nA half-breed named Rocheflave was arrested at Swift Current for having in his possession two horses stolen from an Indian in Montana. He was brought before the magistrate committed for trial and sent to Regina. A half-breed named Dubois was sent here from Swift Current on 22nd September committed for trial for larceny, by Messrs. Tims and Knight, J.P.'s. I received instructions to release him, there not being sufficient evidence to warrant his trial.\n\nI have had very little magisterial duty to perform during the past year and a return of all cases tried in my district is attached.\n\nThere have been a few fatal accidents.\n\nOn 16th April Mr. Lawrence, a farmer near here, while handling a revolver shot his daughter in the head. She died a few hours later.\n\nOn 14th August a little boy of 8, Jules Quesselle was accidentally shot. The party were out berry-picking, and one or them getting into the waggon with a loaded shot gun, it exploded in some way, the charge striking the boy inside the thigh of one leg. He died within a couple of hours.\n\nOn 1st October a man named Collinge was found drowned in shallow water in the river at Medicine Hat, close to the water cart which he had been driving. He is supposed to have had a fit and dropped off the cart. The same day Mr. Smith, yard master at Medicine Hat, was run over by a gravel train, and died within a few hours.\n\nDuring the past season I have had the following outposts built, beginning from the west: Ball's Head, Willow Creek, Grabow, Little Rock, Farrell and East End. \"K\" Division patrolling from the west connected with my system at Willow Creek once a week, and patrolling together with \"B\" Division from the east at McCarthy's Lake every Tuesday. This distance, from the East End to McCarthy's Lake, I consider too far to have to make the weekly connection. I would recommend that a station of some description be erected at some point on the White Mud, about 40 miles from the East End, where a detachment could be stationed. Then, if a detachment from the Wood Mountain District were stationed somewhere about Pinto Horse Butte the patrol could easily meet, and have time to scout the country besides. There has been a great deal of work done by these outposts during the past season. Besides keeping up the regular weekly communication parties were out daily (weather permitting) in different directions along the line.\n\nI forwarded to you a map showing positions of the different outposts, and the principal scouting lines, but I could by no means show the whole of them as the country has been very thoroughly traversed. Each non-commissioned officer in charge of a detachment sends a copy of his diary, weekly, to the outpost at Battle Creek. They reach me every Sunday evening.\n\nBesides their regular scouting duties the members of each outpost (except Grassburn) have erected permanent buildings, which has entailed a good deal of labor. I received a grant of $1,000 to build five permanent outposts. They have all been completed, and the men on outpost duty are now very comfortable, as well as the horses.\nAt Bull's Head there is a good log house which holds from ten to twelve men, a very good log stable to hold twelve horses. Both buildings shingled.\n\nAt Willow Creek there is a very good house, shingled, holding twelve men; also log stable with shingle roof to hold twelve horses. There is also a \"shack\" erected by men of detachment earlier in the year, which can, with little expense, be turned into a storeroom.\n\nThese two posts were built under the superintendency of Inspector Moodie, and reflect great credit on him.\n\nAt Battle Creek there is a good log house, to house six men, shingle roof, stable to hold five horses, mud roof, telegraph office, log with shingle roof, and a small log building used formerly as a stable, which can be turned into a storeroom.\n\nFarwell has a good house built of cottonwood logs, with mud roof, to hold ten or twelve men. Stable same material, to hold ten or twelve horses.\n\nEast End has a good dwelling house, log, with mud roof, will hold eight men. Stable of same material will hold ten horses, but is too narrow, and should be improved on next year.\n\nEach of the dwelling houses has a lean-to kitchen, leading out of the main room, in some of the buildings large enough to be used as a mess room as well as a kitchen.\n\nAt Graburn the detachment built themselves a log house, which at present is rather low but by raising it a log or two, the building could be made a very good one. I should recommend that a permanent building be built there next year.\n\nAn ample supply of hay has been put up at each of the six outposts, and good strong corrals built around the hay. Acting under your orders I called in detachments from East End and Farwell.\n\nThe detachment from East End came in on the 4th November, and that from Farwell on the following day. The remaining detachments are still out (18th November).\n\nI should recommend that Graburn be brought in at the end of the month. That some men be left at Ten Mile all winter, as it is on the line of travel south, and if there is no one to look after the buildings some malicious person might destroy or injure them.\n\nWillow Creek and Bull's Head should be kept out as long as the weather remains open. Scouts kept on during the winter months should visit outposts frequently, to see that everything is in order. Since the early spring, when the western Indians made several raids, I do not think there has been a hostile Indian in the hills. None have been seen. No horses have been stolen from Maple Creek district this year. Some were stolen from Medicine Hat early in the spring, but were mostly recovered.\n\nI consider the result of the summer's work, entirely due to the efficient manner in which the members of the division have performed patrol duties. The Cypress Hills is a difficult country to act in, there being so many hiding places in the thick bushes and sagebrush, and I think a good staff of scouts is a necessity in this district.\n\nOn the 4th November, I received orders from you that Inspector Sanders and ten picked men were to be detailed to proceed, when orders arrived, to the line to take over the McLeish murderers from the American authorities. The party was at once detailed. On Monday the 7th Inspector Sanders and party left to take over the murderers at boundary line on Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday morning Inspector Primrose with ten men left, detailed to go to Ten Mile Crossing, and from there to go south towards the boundary, and scout the country thoroughly, working in conjunction with Inspector Sanders' party. On Tuesday afternoon I received a telegram from you, that Sanders would have to go on to Assiniboine, and possibly into Benton. I immediately telegraphed instructions to Ten Mile, and the despatch was forwarded by man on horseback to boundary line, and he left there and proceeded to Assiniboine with his party. He had to go to Benton to get the prisoners.\n\nI got a telegram from him, that he would be at the line by noon on Monday 14th inst. I instructed Inspector Primrose and party to proceed and meet Inspector Sanders. The two parties met at the South Fork, and reached Ten Mile that night. I sent out a fresh team to meet them at daylight in morning (Tuesday) and prisoners...\ngot in here in plenty of time to go on to Regina that day, but unfortunately the train was cancelled, and there was no passenger train until yesterday, when Inspector Sanders and escort left with prisoners for Regina.\n\nOn 7th November a team and five men arrived from Swift Current, being part of the escort which had been with the police Crees since the 11th October. Two more men came in on the 10th. The remainder of the party, Sergeant Tucker and two men, left Swift Current on the 13th to proceed with Indians going north until relieved by an escort from Battleford. Six Indians that had been arrested and were in guard room at Medicine Hat, were sent to Swift Current by train, and went north, one Indian went overland with two horses.\n\nOn 10th November, Corporal Bulger arrested two men, named Wm. Jordan and D.M. Leamer, both of Fort Macleod, for having intoxicants illegally in their possession. There were three large trunks filled with bottles of brandy and whiskey. The keys of the trunks and the checks for them were found in Leamer's possession. He was brought before Inspector Macdonald, J.P., and fined $200 for costs, and the liquor destroyed. There was no evidence against Jordan, the liquor was brought from Victoria, B.C.\n\nThe buildings at this post (Maple Creek) are quite inadequate for the number of men stationed here during the winter months. There is but one barrack building, made originally to hold 25 men, there is no recreation room, or any place where men can go out of their barrack rooms, there are no sergeants' quarters, no sick stable, and no waggon shed, the present guard room has only two cells, and is a very poor affair. The buildings required here are another barrack room, recreation room, sergeants' quarters, guard room, sick stable, a waggon shed, and more officers' quarters. The Quartermaster's store also requires enlarging, at present space is so confined that it is hardly known where tidy or anything else to find. You want, as different articles have to be piled one on top of the other. The present buildings will be much improved when the plastering now being done is finished. The hospital will also be more habitable when the authorized repairs are made.\n\nThe buildings at Medicine Hat are generally in a fair state of repair.\n\nFire Protection.\n\nThere is no adequate fire protection at either this post or Medicine Hat; all there is to depend upon are water buckets and a few \"Babcocks.\" At Medicine Hat, there being no wells there, the river is the nearest source of supply. There are also a few \"Babcocks.\" In the event of a fire gaining headway at either post the whole of the barracks would go.\n\nTransport.\n\nThe division is well supplied with light transport. The \"Minchin\" buckboard is an excellent one. The \"Minchin\" lumber waggon I consider too light for this section of the North-West. Two supplied here came to grief; the first one the front axle went, and the hind one in the other.\n\nArms.\n\nMany of the Winchester Carbines, from long service, require looking over; some have front sights crooked and many require browning and a general look over by the armourer. The revolvers are mostly in good order.\n\nSaddles.\n\nI would recommend that the division stationed here be issued entirely with double cinch saddles. I consider them a necessity in this section of the country. A saddle room is also a great necessity here; you having just authorized the building of one, the saddles and harness can be better looked after in the future than they have been.\nTelephones.\n\nI would again recommend the erection of a telephone line to barracks both at Maple Creek and Medicine Hat.\n\nDesertions.\n\nDuring the past season there have been eight desertions from my division. One man was granted leave and did not return, one man deserted from Medicine Hat, two from this post, one from Graburn, two from Battle Creek, and one from Willow Creek.\n\nSixteen American deserters reported here during the past season.\n\nDrill and Target Practice.\n\nThe drill I have been able to perform has been small. The past winter was unusually severe and the snow deep. Early in the spring the Indians began to raid, and horses and men were kept constantly going. Then permanent detachments were sent out, and there has been an average about 50 men on outpost duty all the season. Target practice was pretty well finished by most members of the division, and some mounted target practice performed.\n\nHorses.\n\nEight horses were cast and sold, seven of which were sent to Calgary. Fifteen re-mounts were received. Seven horses have died during the year, leaving my present strength at this date (4th November) 95 horses and 2 pack mules. Saddle horses have certainly kept in very good condition, by being able to change about and give the poor ones a rest. The team horses are pulled down somewhat, their work for the past year has been constant and arduous. In addition to general duties and supplying outposts with rations and oats, logs had to be hauled, and different supplies hauled long distances for the construction of the five permanent outposts.\n\nFerry at Medicine Hat.\n\nThis ferry was repaired at considerable expense, but the repairs were well done. A substantial tower built and cable well stretched, and the boat has been running well; as far as I can see, the expenses in connection with the boat should be very light next year.\n\nIndians.\n\nThere are still the usual number of Indians about my district. They have made quite a lot of money by polishing buffalo horns and selling them, principally to passengers on the trains. Most of them have horses and had gardens this year and raised some garden stuff. They behave themselves well. One I sentenced to one month's imprisonment for assaulting another Indian and breaking his wrist. Three horses were taken from an Indian at Medicine Hat who had been there at Forks of Red Deer. They were branded I.D. I sent them to Regina by Joe Tanner. Several parties of Indians who had left their reserves were arrested and sent back.\n\nHealth of Division.\n\nI regret to have to report that Staff Sergeant Holme died on the fourth of June, from pneumonia, after a short illness. He was very popular with his comrades, a clever physician and regret at his death was universal.\n\nThe general health of the division has been excellent. There was only one case of fever which yielded readily to treatment.\nI am glad to report that there have been no serious accidents to anyone in my division during the past year.\n\nI am happy to report that, with a few exceptions, the conduct of non-commissioned officers under me has been entirely to my satisfaction. They have always shown themselves willing and ready to carry out all orders entrusted to them, and I trust you will judge they have done their work efficiently when you take into consideration the very small amount of horse-stealing or other crime that has taken place in this district during the past year.\n\nI leave this post tomorrow to take over my new command at Calgary. I have been stationed here in command of \"A\" Division for the last three years and a half, and I leave the division with much regret.\n\nI am unable to forward any medical report; there have been so many changes in the hospital staff here, and the present acting hospital steward, Constable Ware, has not been here long enough to be able to write a medical report for the past year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. McILLREE,\nSupt. Commanding \"A\" Division.\n\nThe Commissioner\nNorth-West Mounted Police,\nRegina.\nAPPENDIX D.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT R. B. DEANE.\n\nREGINA, N.W.T., December, 1887.\n\nI have the honour to render my report for the year commencing the 26th March last.\n\nOn that date having temporarily handed over my duties as Adjutant of the force to Inspector W. G. Matthews, I proceeded to Ontario on recruiting service.\n\nAfter having spent about a month in Ottawa, during which time considerable correspondence with applicants produced but few suitable recruits, I opened an office in Toronto and advertised the requirements of the Police by means of posters in the city and its neighborhood. I also visited Montreal and London. The standard is unusually high, being 5 feet 8 inches in height, and minimum age 22 years. In consequence of the latter regulation I was compelled, during the first few weeks to reject some applicants who were in other respects very eligible. In reply to representations, however, I was instructed to use my own discretion in relaxing the age disqualification in the case of well developed and promising applicants.\n\nI received 183 applications for engagement, exclusive of about 25 of which I kept no record, such as drunken men, tramps, &c. I, in all, engaged and sent to headquarters, 63 intelligent and able-bodied men, who produced recommendations or testimonials, which I believed to be authentic. Of these, Mr. Joseph Henry Foster, an ex-street railway employee in Toronto, failed to report to me at the train after he had completed his engagement papers. He stated that a relative had given him funds to go to England, and that he had already started. Charles Hildred (I was informed from headquarters) also deserted while en route to Regina. He, too, was an ex-employee of the Toronto Street Railway, whom I would not accept until he had completed his engagement therewith. He appeared to be very anxious to join the Police, and his references were good, but it is certain now that he was no loss.\n\nSixty-two applicants were rejected by the examining surgeons, varicose and enlarged veins being prominent disqualifications. Of the remaining 53 some were rejected as being under height or age. Two could not read or write. Some went out to the doctor for examination and did not go to him; others, after medical examination ascertained that they were sound and well and went their way. I gave every man fully to understand the conditions of service in the Mounted Police, set forth its disadvantages as well as its advantages, pointed out that discharge by purchase being rarely permitted, unless a man has made up his mind to serve for the five years of his engagement, he had better not sign the papers. I believe that results have shown that the recruits so engaged have done satisfactory service so far.\n\nOn the 19th July, in accordance with your orders, I took over command of the Depot Division at Regina and Headquarters District.\n\nOn the 27th Sergeant Macpherson, who informed me that he had reason to believe that the murderers of McLeish were near the neighborhood of Fort Ellice, travelling south, was sent with two men to intercept them. He subsequently reported:\n\n\"On arrival at Brandon was informed by two half-breeds that Gaddy, Racette and LeRoy, who were on the 19th July near Fort Ellice, travelling south. I, with my party, left Brandon and went to Plum Creek and from thence to Sayer's ranch; drove to the house of a man named Mossange, who told me that a half-breed, named Davis had told him that two breeds answering the description of Gaddy and Racette had come to his camp after nightfall on the 21st July. I went to Oba Lake and from there to St. John's, Dakota, where I reported at the Custom House, and was...\"\ntold by the American interpreter that he knew where the murderers were, but that he would not tell me. This interpreter and the United States Marshall agreed to go that night, taking me with them as deputy marshall, but this offer they afterwards withdrew. I paid Joseph John to go and ascertain the exact position of the parties wanted and left myself for Killarney, to allay suspicion. Next day when I returned to St. Johns, John reported to me that they had been camped on an island at a lake on the southwest of the mountain on the 3rd August, but had left that place in disguise, wearing Indian clothing, and had been seen 10 miles north of Buffalo Lake and were on their way to Canada.\n\n\"The U.S. Marshall wanted to go to Fort Totten for a company of United States infantry to follow the fugitives, but I, knowing how useless it was to follow mounted men with infantry, decided to return, and reached Headquarters on the 7th August.\"\n\nNews was received here on the 12th August, by a telegram from the officer commanding at Fort Macleod, that Gaddy and Racette had been arrested at Fort McGinnis by the Sheriff of Montana.\n\nMr. D. L. Scott, Q.C., Crown Prosecutor for this judicial district, proceeded to Fort Benton with Corporal Matheson and a settler from Wolseley to identify the prisoners and take the necessary steps to procure their extradition, and the prisoners were accordingly extradited and brought to Regina by Inspector Sanders and an escort on the 1st November. Their trial is peremptorily fixed for the 3rd January next, at Wolseley.\n\nOn the 15th August it was reported to me that a child about 2\u00bd years old, belonging to Mr. Pringle, of Regina, had strayed from its mother, who was on a visit at Pensee. A Police party was despatched to search the neighborhood, accompanied by some citizens of Regina. The child was lost on the evening of the 15th, but the loss was not reported here to the following afternoon. The child was found about 7 o'clock on the evening of the 16th in some bushes about \u00bd mile from the house from which it had strayed, and being somewhat frightened, was \"strange to say,\" not crying during the exposure.\n\nOn the 18th September the body of a man, who was afterwards identified as John Descon, was found dead at the railway switch near Grenfell. He was last seen alive on the previous day some miles west of Grenfell where he was met by some men who were working on the railway; he had been working on the railway at Pasqua, and had started to walk to Winnipeg. An inquest was held and a post mortem examination made, when the jury found that death had resulted from \"fatty degeneration of the heart.\"\n\nOn the 19th October, Dr. Dodd, coroner, reported to me that he had just returned from the scene where one William Love had been accidentally shot by a companion, named Springfield Rice. It appears that they had been examining an old Winchester carbine, in the magazine of which (unknown to them) was a cartridge, which successive movements of the lever failed to pump into the barrel and eject. If it would have happened had the carbine been in proper condition, at last however, the cartridge found its way into the barrel and just as Mr. Rice had completed his examination he laid the carbine on the table and almost immediately afterwards the cartridge exploded, the bullet entering Mr. Love's kidneys, and inflicting injuries from which he died the next morning. The coroner did not consider it necessary to hold an inquest.\n\nThe periodical reports have described details of the Police work performed during each month and there have been no occurrences in this district during my tenure of command to call for special notice. The list of criminal cases disposed of which accompanies this report is evidence of work that has been done.\n\nThe country has been thoroughly patrolled throughout the district. The outposts along the line of railway are provided with horses, and have patrolled the country in their respective neighborhoods.\n\nPatrols have been sent out from headquarters in such manner as to keep at least one always moving about the country. Their general direction is shown on...\nthe map which has been furnished to you, and as their details are for the most part unimportant a report taken at random of a patrol which left here on the 2nd August may suffice.\n\n\"Sergeant Lauder with 4 constables, 1 interpreter and 6 horses, left headquarters on the 2nd August, proceeded to Long Lake and from there to Touchwood, visiting the settlements and mission on the way. From Touchwood to Round Plains and thence by the Prince Albert trail to File Hills, Pleasant Plains en route to Wolsley. Proceeding thence north of the Assiniboine Reserve to Indian Head, Qu'Appelle, Moosepotang's Reserve, Piapot's Reserve, Crofter's settlement and Home. The sergeant in charge reported water very scarce, crops in general good, no complaints from settlers, and Indians working quietly on their reserves. The settlers invariably expressed their pleasure at seeing the Police.\"\n\nThe usual escorts have been provided at the Indian treaty payments.\n\nPrairie fires have not been so frequent this autumn as in former years, and in certain cases prosecutions have been held in abeyance pending the publication of a recent decision rendered by the North-West Council. In a case at Summerberry during the month of November the proceedings were by a writ of Certiorari removed from the Magistrate's Court to the Supreme Court, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company being the defendants in the case, the result is not yet known. With a view to enforcing the provisions of the existing Ordinance, the country has been divided into sections and a non-commissioned officer expressly detailed in each to follow up cases of prairie burning.\n\nThe police as a body have assisted in extinguishing fires when within reasonable reach. A fire appeared on the horizon one dark evening in November last, and was truly alarming. We could apparently distinguish stacks, if not a house, in a blaze. I mounted a party and set off in the direction of the fire, which after some time disappeared from view, but which might, nevertheless, have continued to rage in a depression of the prairie, to break out with renewed violence later on. After travelling about six miles, a farmer met us and said the fire had been started to burn a clearing, that it had been properly safe guarded and had burnt itself out. A similar alarm occurred a few nights later on, when a mission party, after riding about fourteen miles, estimated that the fire was still twenty miles ahead of them, in a locality where there were no settlers, so returned home.\n\nNow that judicial districts in the North-West Territories have been reconstituted, I would respectfully suggest that at some point convenient in eastern Assiniboia, a lock-up should be provided for the use of that district.\n\nAt present the Police at Qu'Appelle, Wolsley, Broadview, Whitewood and Moosomin have no means whatever of providing for the safe custody of a prisoner, other than by shackling him.\n\nMoosomin is 150 miles from Regina, and the Police guard room at the latter place is the nearest lock-up. Notwithstanding that Regina is in a different judicial district from that over which Mr. Justice Wetmore presides, I would respectfully submit for consideration that Qu'Appelle, through which the Prince Albert and other trails pass, should have a lock-up capable of temporarily securing the safe custody of at least two prisoners. I have previously reported to you that the building at that place, hitherto occupied by the Police as barracks and stable, are no longer habitable.\n\nThe Police post at Fort Qu'Appelle is too far from the town for the site to be of any value for Police purposes, and I would submit that a barrack room, capable of accommodating at least four men, with a lock-up for two prisoners and a stable for at least three horses, be erected in a suitable part of the town. By utilizing such of the material in the present buildings as is fit for use, the accommodation I describe can be erected for $500. I have previously reported in detail on this subject. I submit further, that as Moosomin may be said to be the headquarters of the eastern Assiniboia judicial district, and as a detachment of at least six men are required there for ordinary duties and patrols, that Police barracks and stables should be\n\n28\u201431\nerected there for the accommodation of ten constables and eight horses, the barrack building to include room for a lock-up capable of holding four prisoners.\n\nThe cost of railway transport, which is annually incurred in conveyance of prisoners and their escorts to and from Regina, will contribute no inconsiderable proportion towards the erection of such buildings, to say nothing of the additional convenience and facilities for carrying out the public service. At present the men at Moosomin lodge in a rented building and board at an hotel. The latter arrangement is convenient, because otherwise, in a small detachment, one man is always fully employed in cooking, &c., for the others, and is consequently non-effective, but it would be very much better if the men could live in their own barrack building, at a convenient distance from neighbors.\n\nOn the 11th November, in consequence of a sprained ankle, I was placed on the sick list, and remained thereon until the 4th December. During that interval, however, I was able to preside over a court of enquiry, convened by the Assistant Commissioner, to investigate the origin of, and the circumstances connected with the burning of the riding school on the 26th December last. The evidence went to show that the conflagration originated from a fire which had been lighted in a stove in the saddle-room, by \"B\" Division on the morning of the 26th before the man in charge thereof went to his breakfast, at about 7:30 o'clock. He stated that when he left the door of the \"Syndicate\" stove was open, the dampers closed, and a moderate fire in the grate. The fire was discovered about 8:45 a.m., and Constable McLeish's evidence was corroborated by that of Constable McMenamy. The first of the first to enter the burning room, with a Babcock, and residing close to the stove in question, noticed that the doors thereof were open, and that there was very little fire in the grate. He first saw the fire in the ceiling over the corner of the room in which the stove stood, and appeared to be burning between the ceiling and the roof, the saddle-room in question being a compartment of a lean to which ran along the northside of the main building. The court could only conjecture as to the origin of the fire, but the impression in my mind is that the bracket upon which the brick chimney was built sunk, that the chimney or the safe, or both, cracked in consequence of the settlement, and that burning sods fell through the crack and ignited the dry woodwork between the horizontal ceiling and the lean to roof, and that burning embers dropped down between the studding inside the partition wall and set a light to shavings and other combustible material on the ground.\n\nIn conclusion with your directions to report upon the several murders that took place during the past summer, as officer in present charge of Headquarters Police District, which extends from Moosomin in the east, to Moose Jaw in the west, and from Touchwood in the north to the outposts of \"B\" Division (stationed at Wood Mountain) in the south, I beg to report that the murders of McLeish, at Wolseley, Poole, at Sumner, McLean, near Whitewood, and Smith, at the Salt Plains, were committed about the end of May, nearly two months before my return from Eastern Canada, I can, therefore, only render copies of extracts from the diary in the district office, which are as follows:\u2014\n\n**Tuesday, 31st May.**\n\nTelegram from constable Matheson reporting that a man was shot at Wolseley by horse thieves. Telegram from Hill, J. P., that a man was murdered a Sumner by horse thieves, considerable excitement. Inspector Baker left at 5 o'clock p.m. to make enquiries.\n\n**Wednesday, 1st June.**\n\nSergeant Richards and 11 constables, with 14 horses, left by special train at noon or Grenfell on special duty in connection with the recent murders by horse thieves.\n\n**Thursday, 2nd June.**\n\nInspector Baker returned from Grenfell bringing Geo. McKenzie, a prisoner charged on suspicion with being implicated in the murder of McLeish, near Wolseley.\nSergeant Macpherson arrived with two Indian prisoners charged with the murder of Peter Smith.\n\nConstable Johnson brought in Joseph Racotte charged with being implicated in the murder of McLeish, near Wolseley.\n\nSaturday, 4th June.\n\nSuperintendent Jarvis, Sergeant Rohrig and 24 constables left for Broadview for duty in connection with the recent murders at Wolseley and Whitewood. Sergeant Bright and 2 constables, left for Grenfell on similar duty. Sergeant Macpherson and Constable Henderson left for Indian reserves to bring in witnesses in the case of the murder of Peter Smith.\n\nConstable Tennant from Qu'Appelle brought in Moise Racotte charged with being implicated in the murder of McLeish.\n\nTuesday, 7th June.\n\nInspector Norman Staff-Sergeant Mahony, Sergeant Farmer and 25 constables, with 13 horses, left for Broadview by special train at 5 o'clock a.m. in pursuit of the murderers of McLeish. Geo. McKenzie in custody, charged with being accessory to the murder of McLeish, was brought before the Commissioner and discharged on his own recognizance of $200 to appear when called upon.\n\nInspector Brooks returned from Whitewood where he had been investigating the Poole murder.\n\nSaturday, 11th June.\n\nInspector Baker returned to Broadview, Inspector Norman Staff-Sergeant Mahony, Sergeant Farmer, and 37 constables returned from Crooked Lake. Sergeant Macpherson left by night to bring further witnesses in the case of Nan-nan-kase-lex, charged with the murder of Peter Smith.\n\nTuesday, 14th June.\n\nThe prisoner Nan-nan-kase-lex was examined by Inspector Norman, J. P., and remanded to the 21st instant.\n\nOn my returning duty on the 19th July, I found that two prisoners, Cree Indians named respectively Nan-nan-kase-lex and Ana-say-o, were being held in custody here. Nan-nan-kase-lex was charged with implication in the murder of Peter Smith at the Salt Plains, but there being insufficient evidence against him he was discharged on the 11th August, with the concurrence of the Crown prosecutor.\n\nThe other prisoner, Ana-say-o, had been arrested under warrant of Justice at Touchwood on a charge of having been concerned in the stealing of some horses from an Indian of Pasqua's band, and it was suspected that he was implicated in the murder of Smith, but there being no evidence to connect him with one crime or the other he was discharged, along with the prisoner, with the Crown prosecutor.\n\nBetween the 1st January and 25th December of this year, 157 recruits have been taken on the strength of the Depot Division, and 13 have re-engaged for a further term of service making a total of 170.\n\nForty-five non-commissioned officers and men have been discharged during the same period (including constable Dowse who died on the 12th December from a cancerous tumour in the shoulder.) One sergeant and one constable's time expired, one staff sergeant and 17 constables by purchase, 1 corporal and 17 constables invalided, 3 constables dismissed, 15 constables deserted and 1 one discharged special authority.\n\nA total number of 19 officers, non-commissioned officers and men have been transferred out and 157 officers, non-commissioned officers and men have been transferred from the Depot Division, between the above mentioned dates.\n\nThe average number of officers, non-commissioned officers and constables on the monthly pay roll of the Depot Division is 160, involving a monthly payment of about $5,000 dollars, paid for the most part in small sums, with innumerable stoppages.\nSo far as I have observed since my return to Regina the conduct of the men has been good. Now that they are installed in the new barrack buildings they are comfortable enough, the rooms, however, though well warmed, are ill ventilated.\n\nHorses.\n\nThe horses call for no special remark, 64 remounts have been taken on the strength of the division, and 24 have been transferred from other Divisions; the losses for the same period, viz., from 1st January, to 28th December, being 7 cast, and sold, 7 dead, and 32 transferred to other divisions, the average strength of the division in horses is 129.\n\nA board of officers has reported from time to time upon the quality and fitness for service of transport, harness, clothing, &c., as received from the contractors and, as a rule, prior to issue from the Quartermaster' store.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

BURTON DEANE,\nSuperintendent commanding Depot Division,\nAnd Headquarters District.\nAPPENDIX E.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT P. R. NEALE, 1887.\n\nMACLEOD, 30th November, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit the following report for the past 12 months. The district under my command is very quiet and very free from crime. The Blood and Peigan Indians are contentedly staying on their reserves, and there is not even the annual rumour of any rising in the spring.\n\nThe frontier patrol, extending from the Crow's Nest Pass to the Cypress Hills, a distance by rail travelled, of 292 miles, has worked very successfully throughout the season, has tended to keep the Indians on their reserves, and has in a great measure put a stop to the passage of parties of Indians on horse-stealing expeditions, which, before its establishment, were so often complained of.\n\nThe patrol by its constant movements has also been of great benefit to the ranchmen between Mosquito Creek and the boundary line, only one case of cattle killing (the perpetrator of which was apprehended and punished) having been reported. The system inaugurated by me, with your consent, of making the patrol men call at every ranch on their line of march to ask if there are any complaints, has also given great satisfaction to settlers.\n\nIn addition to the frontier detachments, during the summer session a small party was stationed at the Leavings of Willow Creek, and connecting with a party of \"E\" Division at High River, kept up communication with Calgary, and patrolled through the Porcupine Hills to the north of the Peigan Reserve. Another small party stationed at the Peigan Reserve Post scouted through the reserve and thence in a westerly direction to Pincher Creek, watching and reporting the movements of the Peigans and calling upon the settlers in the Porcupines.\n\nThe Indians on the Blood Reserve are watched by the Stand Off, Kootenay, and St. Mary's Detachments, the work of which in addition to their patrol work on the frontier are constantly riding on and about the reserve and noting and reporting the movements of its occupants.\n\nThe first matter of interest which occurred after my last annual report was that of the capture by Corporal W. R. Simmons, of \"H,\" of one Michael Shear, who had a quantity of liquor in his possession. This man was sentenced to six months' hard labor in default of payment of fine.\n\nInspector Wattam having arrived here on the 8th December, 1886, proceeded to put \"D\" and \"H\" Detachments through a complete course of drill.\n\nDuring February considerable excitement obtained amongst the young men of the Blood nation. They held several meetings, and determined to start south for the purpose of avenging the death of six of their tribe who were killed by the \"Gros Ventres\" in Montana in September last. Happily by the combined efforts of Mr. Pocklington and myself they were persuaded to take no action until the authorities had investigated the matter.\n\nAbout the 10th February, 1887, Sergeant Bremner of \"H,\" then in charge of Stand Off Detachment, with the assistance of Red Crow, Chief of Bloods, and Star Child, a Blood, recovered two horses, the property of one Mr. Granchamp, that had been stolen from him at the Sweet Grass Hills, Montana.\n\nAs you are aware, during 1886, the Patrol Detachments east of Lethbridge were stationed about midway between the Galt Railway and the boundary line\u2014at Chin Coulee, Forty Mile Coulee, and Bull's Head Coulee. The water and feed at all these places being bad, I, with your approval, moved the Detachments south, placing one twenty-four miles south of Lethbridge at \"Kipps\" Coulee; one on \"Milk River...\"\nRidge,\" twenty-five miles further south and a little east; one at the \"Writing on the Stones\" Coulee, thirty miles east of the \"Milk River Ridge\" Detachment; and another at \"Pend-d'O-eele,\" thirty-five miles still further east, which latter party rode fifty miles and connected with a Detachment of \"A\" Division, stationed southwest of the head of the Cypress Hills. A new outpost was also established midway between the Milk River Ridge Detachment and that on the St. Mary's River, (fifty-eight miles south-west of Macleod) so that the whole frontier from the base of the Rockies to the head of the Cypress, where the duty was taken up by \"A\" Division, was closely watched.\n\nOn the 22nd February, Mr. Pocklington, Indian Agent at the Blood Reserve, notified me that one of his Indians had murdered his wife and immediately afterwards committed suicide; the non-commissioned officer at Stand Off having cognizance of, and enquired into the case, further action on the part of the Police was unnecessary.\n\nOn the 26th February, a report reached me, that \"glanders\" had broken out in a herd of horses, the property of the Brown Ranching Company on the St. Mary's River. Inspector Sanders and Veterinary Staff Sergeant Jackson were immediately dispatched to inspect the herd, and two horses, were, with the consent of the Manager of the ranch, destroyed.\n\nThe winter of 1886-87 was probably the most severe within the recollection of any white settler in the district, for weeks the snow was 2 feet deep on all the trails, and the cattle on the ranges suffered greatly in consequence. On the 11th March, a thaw having set in, the ice in the \"Old Man's River\" broke up, and all the low lands along the river from Pincher Creek to Kipp were flooded. An ice jam took place just above Kipp, the water rose and flooded the stopping-place kept by W. H. Long, on the east side of the river, and distant from the river some 90 or 100 yards, the water entering Long's house, and rising therein to a height of nearly 5 feet. Masses of ice, weighing 3 and 4 tons, were thrown up on the bank on either side. Two telegraph poles on the west, and one on the east bank were swept away and the wire broken. For some days the river was so bad that it was impossible to cross it even in a boat, so that both mail and telegraphic communication was suspended. After a few days Constable Furois, the telegraph operator here, pluckily crossed the river in a canvas boat, and, having taken with him a telegraph instrument, opened communication with Lethbridge, and got messages through to Macleod by calling or repeating them to a constable on the west side of the river.\n\nIn the meantime the Peigan District was entirely cut off by the same river; I could not communicate with Pincher Creek over the top of that stream, nor could I with the St. Mary's Detachment, their post being badly flooded. The Stand Off Detachment was in the same condition, the Kootenay being too high to cross, nor could I communicate with the party stationed at the Leavings on the Calgary trail, as Willow Creek was, if anything, worse than the Old Man's River.\n\nOn the 20th April His Honor the Lieutenant Governor arrived and on the 22nd proceeded to the Blood Reserve returning the same day, and on the 23rd, visited the Peigan Reserve, leaving for Calgary on the 25th. His Honor was furnished with escort and transport during his stay in this district.\n\nOn the 21st April, information having been received that a party of Police under Staff Sergeant Smith of \"A\" Division, had been fired on in the vicinity of the Cypress Hills, thirty men, under command of the late Sergeant Major Lewis were at once ordered to move from Lethbridge East with orders to arrest any Indians that they found in that vicinity. The Outposts were notified, as also the Indian Agents.\n\nOn the 29th April, the Officer Commanding at Lethbridge reported that a party of freighters had been fired on by Indians near Kipp's Coulee. Inspector Sanders was immediately sent out with 12 men, but failed to make any arrests, and, from what I have since heard, I am led to believe that the freighters' story was void of truth.\n\nThe Stand Off Detachment, during the month of April, recovered seven horses\nwhich had been stolen some months previously from Mr. Spencer, of San River, Montana, the Indians surrendering them without demur.\n\nOn the 3rd May, a draft consisting of one Sergeant, one Corporal, eighteen Constables, and eighteen horses, arrived here from Regina. Ten of the men were afterwards, by your order, sent to \"D\" Division at Lethbridge.\n\nOn the 6th May, having ascertained the names of some Indians suspected of having been in the party which fired on Staff-Sergeant Spicer, Inspector Sanders, Assistant Surgeon Phipps, and thirty non-commissioned officers and men, were sent to search the Blood Reserve, and endeavour to arrest the suspected persons; they were, however, unsuccessful.\n\nOn the 9th May, Inspector Sanders was placed in command of fifteen mounted men with necessary transport, with orders to keep patrolling south of the Blood Reserve in order to intercept any small parties of Indians leaving their Reserve for Montana without the written permission of their Agent. This officer performed the duty entrusted to him most zealously as did also Inspector Chalmers who relieved him in July.\n\nOn the 13th May, Inspector Sanders with a party of \"H\" Division very cleverly captured two Blood Indians, viz., \"The Dog\" and \"Big Rib,\" who were supposed to be of the party which fired upon Staff-Sergeant Spicer. That party, however, even fell through, but on the 17th May they were each sentenced to five years penal servitude for stealing horses, the property of one Robert Watson, of Medicine Hat, two of the three horses stolen being recovered by the Police and handed to Watson. As already reported to you, the convicts were handed over to the sheriff on the morning of the 18th May, and escaped from his custody on the morning of the 20th, and although every effort was made to recapture them, they succeeded in getting across the line.\n\nOn the 26th May my command was reinforced by Inspector Wattam and thirty-three men of \"E\" Division, who remained in this district and took part in the scouting and patrolling until July.\n\nOn the 27th May, owing to the very high water in the Old Man's River, an accident occurred at Kipp, which caused the death of two horses of \"D\" Division and very nearly caused the death of four others and three Constables. The disaster occurred owing to the breaking of the wheel of the ferry-boat, and but for the courageous action of a Mr. McNab and Constable W. H. Scales of \"H\" Division, assisted by Constable Lendrum, now of \"D,\" four other horses on the boat would have been lost.\n\nOn the 28th May, His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, accompanied by yourself, arrived here, and on the next day held a council with the Chiefs of the Blood tribe, at which it was arranged that Inspector Sanders, with a small body of Police should accompany Mr. Pocklington, Indian Agent, and Chief Red Crow to Fort Assiniboine, Montana, U.S., for the purpose of recovering a number of horses stolen from the Bloods by the Assiniboine Indians. As you will agree, the visit was eminently successful, resulting not only in the recovery of Red Crow's horses but also in the making of a treaty of peace between the Bloods, Assiniboines and Gros Ventres. The making of the treaty has undoubtedly been productive of good; horse stealing between the Bloods and the southern Indians appearing to have ceased entirely.\n\nOn the 2nd June, \"K\" Division, consisting of 65 officers and men and 50 horses, arrived on the north side of the Old Man's River from Battleford.\n\nOn the 7th June, \"K\" Division left for Lethbridge to relieve \"D,\" which was under orders for the Kootenay District.\n\nOn the 9th June the detachment of \"E\" under Inspector Wattam, was moved to the vicinity of the Blood Agency and patrolled the Blood Reserve night and day.\n\nOn the 11th June, 50 men of \"K\" Division moved out of Lethbridge and proceeded to Swift Current on special service; Inspector Howe, who was commanding \"K\" in the absence on leave of Superintendent MacDonell, taking over the barracks, stores, &c.\nOn the 12th June, two horses, the property of one George Gunn, of Red Deer, were recovered and handed over.\n\nOn the 18th June the Deputy Minister of the Interior arrived here and left next day for the Cochrane Rancho, from which place he proceeded to Pincher Creek, and after visiting several ranches left for Calgary.\n\nOn the 29th June Chief Red Crow came here with a number of minor chiefs to officially thank the police for the action they had taken in recovering his horses. He brought with him a Blood named \"Star Child\" whom he surrendered and charged with bringing stolen horses into Canada at the same time handing over three ponies, said to have been taken from the Assiniboines. This Indian, after being in the gaol here for a few days, was released by order of the Honorable Mr. Justice MacLeod, as beyond his own confession there was no evidence against him. The ponies, a description of which was sent to the officer commanding Fort Assiniboine, Montana, are still in possession of the police. Another Blood Indian, \"The Heel,\" also surrendered to answer a charge of having drawn a knife on a constable of \"D\" Division, but, owing to the departure of \"D\" Division to British Columbia, the evidence could not be produced, \"The Heel\" was released after a few days, confinement.\n\nOn the 5th July, having heard that 70 miners were to arrive at Lethbridge to work in the Galt mine, and from information previously received anticipating some trouble, I proceeded to that place, and, as reported to you, on the 12th July found it necessary to concentrate all the men I could for the protection of the North-Western Coal and Navigation Company's property, which was guarded by us for several days during a strike which terminated peacefully.\n\nOn the 15th July Inspector Wattam and the detachment of \"E\" left Lethbridge for Calgary.\n\nOn the 5th September I left the post at 2 p.m., with two officers and fifty-five men for the Blackfoot Crossing, at which place I arrived at 10 p.m. of the 6th September and reported to the Assistant Commissioner, co-operating with that officer in a search for a Blackfoot Indian named \"Deerfoot,\" who had escaped from custody a few days before. The search being unsuccessful, I returned with my party to Macleod, arriving here on the 9th.\n\nOn the night of the 11th September, Sergeant Williams, of \"H,\" with three men came upon \"Big Rib,\" one of the Indians who escaped from the Sheriff on the 20th May last, and who in company with ten others was in the bush with the Blood reserve.\n\nSergeant Williams succeeded in getting hold of \"Big Rib,\" but was overpowered by the others, who rescued the prisoner. One of them, \"Eagle Rib,\" has since been imprisoned with hard labor for three months for obstructing Sergeant Williams.\n\nOn the 28th September I proceeded to the Kootenay Lake to enquire into a complaint which had been made by Mr. Charles Miller, that his house had been broken into and robbed by Kootenay Indians.\n\nOn investigation I found that the only thing stolen from Mr. Miller was a loaf of bread, and that his house was not broken into, as he had gone out and left the door unlooked, and the Indian who took the bread quietly walked in and helped himself.\n\nOn the 29th October, a prairie fire was observed burning very fiercely to the south-west, and a party, under Sergeant Hetherington, was immediately sent out to endeavour to extinguish it. After fighting it for six hours in the face of a very strong wind Sergeant Hetherington and his men succeeded in driving the fire into the Kootenay River while Inspector Chalmers, who had taken another party on the Stand Off Trail, cut it off near the Agnes Crossing. Some portion of the fire must, however, have remained smouldering in the timber in the Kootenay bottom, for, on the evening of the 31st October, under the influence of a strong south-westerly wind it was fed afresh and appeared to be very rapidly approaching Macleod. Every available man was mounted. All the horse-blankets were made wet and placed in a waggon and accompanied by a large contingent of merchants and others from the...\ntown, we proceeded to the fire and extending for some miles succeeded in putting it out completely.\n\nThis fire was started by a shooting party near Pincher Creek and was observed by the officer commanding the detachment there stationed, who sent out all his men to act in conjunction with the settlers to put out the fire, and also to apprehend the person who caused it. In the meantime the party which had let it get drawn into the village, and one of them laid information before Captain Scott, R.P., against their cook who, the same evening, was arrested; he pleaded guilty, and was fined $50. The fire destroyed the grass on a range of about 68 miles long, and in some places, 15 miles wide, and, but for the vigorous action of the police, ably seconded by the settlers and ranchers, would have caused incalculable damage had it gone any further. Had the valuable farms and buildings in the \"slide out\" and other bottoms leading to the Belly River would certainly have been destroyed.\n\nDuring this month, the outposts of \"H\" and \"K\" Divisions were inspected by the Assistant Commissioner.\n\nOn the 5th November, the Deputy Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs arrived from Lethbridge, and went on to the Peigan Reserve, returning to Lethbridge the next day, being furnished by me with transport.\n\nOn the 7th November, having been informed that several Blood Indians, camped at the Lower Agency, had whiskey in their possession, and that one of their minor chiefs, \"Calf Shirt,\" had brought it in from Montana, and had stated to his band that if the Police came to arrest him, he would defy them; and at the same time being informed that an Indian named \"Good Rider,\" who had for sometime been suspected of killing cattle, had killed an animal on the Cochrane Rancho on the 4th November, evidence of which was obtainable, I determined to arrest both \"Calf Shirt\" and \"Good Rider.\"\n\nI wired Superintendent Macdonell to send an officer and twenty men to meet me at Stand Off at 6 a.m. on the morning of the 8th, and myself left here with a like number shortly after midnight of the 7th.\n\nI proceeded with the detachment from \"K,\" met me at Stand Off exactly at 6 a.m., and we then proceeded to the Lower Agency, where \"Calf Shirt\" and five other Indians who were required as witnesses to testify as to \"Calf Shirt's\" possession of the whiskey were arrested. We then proceeded to the \"Upper Camp,\" where we arrested \"Good Rider.\"\n\n\"Calf Shirt\" was sentenced to one month's hard labor for having liquor in his possession, and \"Good Rider,\" having pleaded guilty to the charge of cattle-killing, was sentenced by the Honorable Mr. Justice Macleod to imprisonment with hard labor for one year.\n\nThese arrests have had a very good effect on the Bloods, and I do not think that any of them will talk of defying the police for some time to come. The escape of \"The Dog\" and \"Big Rib\" from the Sheriff and the subsequent rescue of the latter from Sergt. Williams led the young men of the tribe to believe that they could, to use a Western expression, \"get away\" with the Police; but the sudden descent upon the camp of \"Calf Shirt,\" who is their war chief, and his arrest, followed up as it was by the capture within an hour, at a distance of ten miles, of \"Good Rider,\" has, I think, caused them to change their minds.\n\nOUTPOSTS.\n\nDuring the past summer reserves have been surveyed and staked out at Stand Off, on the ground now occupied; at St. Mary's, opposite the present location. A reserve for the Kootenay Detachment was selected in the Big Bend of the Belly River, about 15 miles west of the Cochrane Rancho. A quarter section for the Peigan Detachment has been reserved on the north side of the Peigan Reserve. At Pincher Creek the quarter section on which the Police buildings are situated is reserved; also a quarter section at the mouth of the Crow's Nest Pass.\n\nThe surveys were made by Mr. Miles, D.L.S., and maps showing the different locations have been already forwarded to you.\nFrame buildings and stables should be erected at Stand Off, St. Mary's, Peigan Reserve and Big Bend, the buildings now in occupation at the three first named places being simply log shacks with mud roofs which expose the men to much discomfort during wet weather, and are besides unhealthy and unsafe to store provisions and forage in. The buildings at Pincher Creek are in fair order. Those at the \"Crow's Nest\" were put up this summer by the detachment, and are built of logs, with the usual mud roof; they are very well built, and, if shingled early in the spring, will be very comfortable.\n\nStables should also be built for the detachments from Lethbridge at Kipp's Coulee, Milk River Ridge, Writing on the Stones Coulee, Pen d'Oreille Coulee, and at some point to be selected midway between the last place and the western detachment of \"A\" Division, the distance between the two places (5\u00bd miles) being too great. By your direction a quantity of hay has been distributed in stacks between Lethbridge and Pen d'Oreille, so that should occasion demand, the patrol, which was withdrawn when the winter set in, can move.\n\nIn order to keep communications with Lethbridge and to better watch the eastern end of the Blood Reserve, a detachment of \"K\" Division has been established at Kipp, midway between here and Lethbridge. Men from this detachment patrol to Stand Off and old Fort Hamilton (Whoop-up).\n\nBUILDINGS.\n\nThe buildings at Lethbridge are being plastered, painted and added to under the supervision of Mr. B. C. Kenway, of the Public Works Department. A new stable and an addition to the Quartermaster's stores have been built, but a hospital, officers' office, and a recreation room, as also a fence around the barracks, are much needed.\n\nAt Macleod, brick chimneys have been constructed in nearly all the buildings, save the officers' quarters, thus materially lessening the danger from fire.\n\nAs previously reported, all the buildings at this post require clapboarding, and I cannot too strongly recommend that the wire fence now surrounding the barracks be removed and a picket fence substituted therefor.\n\nARMS.\n\nThe arms are in serviceable order in both \"H\" and \"K\" Divisions.\n\nTARGET PRACTICE.\n\nThe annual practice is not yet completed, owing to the number of men on detachment from both Divisions and the prevalence of extremely high winds throughout the district.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION.\n\nTanks are much required at this post and Lethbridge. The fire engine sent here by the Public Works Department is a very good one, but the suction hose being only fourteen feet in length it cannot be used with the well.\n\nHORSES.\n\nThe horses of both divisions are in very good order considering the heavy work that they have had to perform on patrol during the past year. I have not yet received a mileage return from Lethbridge, but that of \"H\" Division shows that the 106 horses in that division have travelled 83,739 miles since 1st December last. Forty-six are on herd at Pincher Creek and are doing very well; they are brought up daily and fed a few oats.\nAMMUNITION WAGGONS.\n\nThese have not yet been furnished.\n\nINDIAN POLICE.\n\nThe Indians engaged by your order on the 1st June last as special constables worked fairly well, being able to assist us in many ways in recovering horses and giving information as to movements on the reserves. At the present time I have only two employed, the others preferring to be idle through the winter on account of the poorness of their horses.\n\nASSISTANCE RENDERED TO CUSTOMS' OFFICER.\n\nThe detachments of \"H\" and \"K\" Divisions, acting under instruction from the local customs officers, made several seizures during the past year, and the detachment at St. Mary's especially has intercepted many parties bringing in horses and cattle from Montana and escorted them to the collector of Customs here.\n\nMORMON SETTLERS.\n\nSince June last between 20 and 30 families of Mormons have settled upon Lee's Creek, about 50 miles south-west of here. They have so far conformed to our laws and appear to be a very pushing and industrious people.\n\nEQUIPMENT.\n\nNumnahs are urgently required for both divisions. All other stores to complete or replace are estimated for.\n\nI enclose herewith the annual sick report for this post and Lethbridge, and also forward Superintendent Macdonell's annual report.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. R. NEALE,\nSuperintendent, Commanding Macleod District.\nAPPENDIX F.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT STEELE.\n\nKootenay, B.C., 1st December, 1897.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit this my report for the year ending 30th November, 1897.\n\nThe division was stationed in the Macleod District until 12th June, the district being under the command of Supt. Neale.\n\nThe headquarters of \"D\" Division were at Macleod until the 7th January, when they were transferred to Lethbridge, which is situated in the eastern half of the district.\n\nThe strength of the division at that time was 4 officers, 15 non-commissioned officers, and 86 constables, distributed as follows:\n\nAt Macleod, 2 officers, 8 non-commissioned officers, and 48 constables.\n\nAt Lethbridge, 2 officers, 7 non-commissioned officers, and 38 constables.\n\nI took over immediate command of the Lethbridge post on the 8th January. It was reinforced from time to time from the detachment at Macleod, until the whole of the division had left Macleod.\n\nDuring the winter and spring the division was employed in the usual routine and other police duties, such as patrolling, recovering stolen stock, &c. A patrol was kept in the town of Lethbridge both night and day.\n\nThe opening of spring, when discontented characters and restless Indians could roam the plains, necessitated constant watchfulness and a great deal of hard riding. The men were frequently called upon to ride very long distances, the work being of such a severe nature, that the horses required very great attention to keep them in a condition for continuance of the work.\n\nEvery complaint made by settlers or others was attended to forthwith. Americans were constantly obliged to obtain police aid to recover stolen stock, and every one who applied received assistance, and in all cases they went away quite satisfied with the promptness with which the police performed the duty.\n\nOn the 20th May, I received orders by telegraph to hold myself in readiness to proceed to British Columbia, with 2 officers, and 73 non-com. officers and constables, and to relieve the furthest outposts to save time.\n\nI selected the men for British Columbia, and sent out the relief to Pen d'oreille Coulee and Writing Stone, leaving the other detachments until the arrival of \"K\" Division, which came shortly to relieve me.\n\nOn the 8th June, Inspector Hunt reported for duty with the division, and on the 9th \"K\" Division, under the command, temporarily, of Inspector Howe, arrived on the left bank of the Belly River, and commenced to cross. Later I received a telegram ordering me to send 50 men to Calgary by rail. As \"K\" Division was then crossing, and their horses just come from a long trip, I sent four men, mounted, belonging to \"D\" Division, and ten of \"K\" Division across the river, and to save time took 7 \"K\" Division waggons, which had not yet crossed, with picked teams from both divisions, as transport for the ammunition, rations, and kits of the party.\n\nInspector Howe, in accordance with your instruction was placed in command, Inspector Wilson to join him en route as he passed Kipp. Subsequently orders were received for me to take command and leave Inspector Howe in command at Lethbridge, but just as I had proceeded to carry out the order, it became necessary to direct me to re-cross the river with the party, and march to Medicine Hat by trail.\nI moved the party down to the bank of the river, but it had become too dark to cross that night, as the river was running with a current of at least 6 miles an hour and very deep.\n\nThe current was so strong that a new good wire cable which was used for the ferry boat had been broken a few days before and the boat swept away.\n\nOn the same afternoon, Inspector Bradley had by my orders gone out to relieve the outpost at Milk River Ridge and Kipp's Coulee, reinforce the posts at Pen d'oreille Coulee and Writing Stone, and take charge at Pen d'oreille Coulee until further orders. Inspector Likely to take charge of the whole of the posts, and locate himself on Milk River Ridge.\n\nMy party re-crossed the river on the next day, and entrained at 8.30, which considering the river, was as good work of the kind as I have seen in the west. Inspector Wood and Hnott were in charge of the party while crossing, as there were numerous duties which kept me hard at work in the post until they were across.\n\nThe party left at 10 p.m. the time agreed upon, but before going the whole of the citizens came to see us off, and presented the division with an address which alluded to the satisfactory relations which existed between the citizens and the Police, and the thorough manner in which the Police duties had been performed.\n\nThe party arrived at Swift Current on the 13th June, and went into camp. On the 14th I reported to you at the train, and received my instructions, all of which were carried out, and a report of the circumstances made to headquarters.\n\nA detachment of \"C\" Division under Sergeant Alexander was stationed at Swift Current, waiting for some recruits for Battleford, and were attached to \"D\" Division during their stay.\n\nOn the 16th as arranged Sergeant Sinclair and 8 constables, with 10 saddle horses, arrived from Lethbridge, and were taken on the strength.\n\nOn the 21st at 5 p.m. I received orders from you by wire to report at Regina. I took the train at once and arrived at 2 a.m. on the 22nd. I remained at Regina on duty until the 24th when I left for Swift Current, and immediately wired Inspector Wood to send on all the men required to make our strength up to 75, as far as Dunmore, to wait our arrival there, and to come on himself, if he had completed the work of handing over the Division Stores as ordered, but it not to follow as soon as possible.\n\nI obtained a special as soon as possible, but owing to the scarcity of cars, I could not leave until Sunday the 26th at 1 p.m. The detachment from Lethbridge joined at Dunmore as ordered.\n\nThe train stopped at Calgary until the horses were fed, and the men had dinner.\n\nThree remounts were taken on here from \"E\" Division and I transferred to \"E,\" as per your orders horses Nos. 663, 1286, 1322.\n\nThe Division arrived at Golden, British Columbia, at 10.30 a.m. on the 28th and went into camp on the left bank of the Kicking Horse River, the camp being connected with town by a wooden bridge.\n\nOn the following day you wired and the division was inspected dismounted.\n\nInspector Wood and the late Sergeant Major Lake arrived, having completed handing over the stores at Lethbridge to the officer commanding \"K\" Division.\n\nAssistant Surgeon Aylen arrived on the 2nd July to take medical charge of the division.\n\nThe Assistant Commissioner, who had been in the Kootenay district, arrived on the steamer \"Duchess\" on the morning of the 5th with Dr. Powell, sen., and A.W. Vowell, Esq., and directed me to start for Kootenay on the following morning. The steamer was loaded during the day, and a counter order received directing me to remain at Golden until further orders, I caused the ammunition to be unloaded.\n\nOn the morning of the 7th, at an early hour, the Division Sergeant Major Lake shot himself in his tent while suffering from a severe attack of neuralgia.\n\nThe steamer started for Columbia Lakes and it was reported to me that she was not properly trimmed, and had a great deal of bilge water which should have been pumped up before leaving. I was informed shortly afterwards that she had capsized.\nnear Lang's Landing and that most of the light stores were floating down the river. I sent men under an officer to endeavor to save some of it. They were thus employed for several days, and succeeded in saving a great deal, but almost everything else offered had been rendered useless by the water. A cartload of oats and all the officers' uniforms and many other valuable articles belonging to them were destroyed. I sent some volunteers to assist Mr. Armstrong to raise his boat, but up to the time of leaving nothing had been done.\n\nI engaged a small steamer belonging to J. C. Hayes, a merchant in Golden, to freight stores for the division to the Columbia Lakes, at the usual rates of freight, viz., one dollar per hundred. Mr. Armstrong had agreed to do it for seventy-five cents per hundred, but there now being no competition I could not make such terms with Hayes. I sent two men to the lakes, to take charge of the stores as they were delivered.\n\nDuring the remainder of our stay I employed the men and teams in hauling stores to the landing, getting the new saddles put together and oiled, branding and numbering the remounts and various other duties.\n\nOn the evening of the 11th July I received your order to march, and on the following morning at 5.30 leaving Staff Sergeant Fane and Mercer, and 8 constables, most of whom were sick, moved off. The steamboat \"Clive\" taking some of the dismounted men for rations and forage for the trip. Each mounted man carried his dinner and forage for his horse. I arrived at the Hog Ranch at 5 p.m., expecting to find the steamer there as the distance was only 25 miles, but she did not appear until after 10 p.m., the men and horses being all this time without anything to eat. It appears that Hayes' cupidity was too much for him, as he had waited for some passengers.\n\nThe division moved at 7 a.m. on the 21st, taking rations and forage for the whole day, as Hayes' ability to reach the place named was doubtful, which proved to be correct, the evening halt was made near Roger's Landing, but no sign of the boat was seen until 8.30 the following morning.\n\nLewis' place was reached on the morning of the 22nd, the steamer for a wonder coming in a short time after.\n\nThe upper storeboat landing was reached early on the 23rd. I parted from the steamer there and gave instructions to the master to bring up all the men except Staff Sergeant Fane, and one team and teamster, on the next trip.\n\nI sent Inspector Wood back to Golden, as it was evident that unless an officer was there to look after Hayes, there would be little chance of getting any work done by the steamer \"Clive.\"\n\nMr. R. Galbraith was at the steamboat landing, ready with his pack train to take our baggage and supplies to Kootenay, as previously arranged by the Assistant Commissioner, Col. Horchmer. I had no further trouble, Mr. Galbraith being prompt and business like, and his pack animals in first class condition.\n\nThe division reached the Six-Mile Creek, above Bummer's Flats on the 30th July, this place had been suggested as suitable for a permanent camp, but on examination\u2014which I made in person, accompanied by Assistant Surgeon Powell, medical officer of the division, and Inspector Haot, found it unsuitable for the following reasons\u2014The ground upon which the post would have to be built, was very uneven, the timber was very much too heavy for building purposes, the site was commanded by a piece of high ground on the left bank of the creek, a large marsh caused by the spreading of Four-Mile and Six-Mile Creeks as they passed through Bummer's Flat lay immediately below the site, and lastly the Six-Mile Creek, from which the water supply would have to be obtained, filtered through a couple of swamps a few miles up. The assistant surgeon condemned the site as unhealthy, and I was satisfied it would not suit.\n\nI then examined the country along Four-Mile Creek, but could find no suitable spot, and the next day accompanied by Inspector Haot, rode to Mr. Fenwick's lower ranche, where it was reported a good site existed. Mr. Fenwick kindly accompanied us. I found the place unsuitable, being a flat surrounded by high hills, a great deal\nof swamp on the opposite side of the Kootenay and there being no waggon road for 10 miles was also a serious objection, so I returned and asked Mr. R. Galbraith if I might look over his land for a suitable place; he consented, and that evening I arranged with him to take 10 acres on the high ground near the confluence of the Kootenay River and Wild Horse Creek. This site is by far the best I have seen, although it has a few objections, but from a military point of view it is perfect, and it appears to be healthier than any of the others, the water is excellent and feet not far distant, it is almost impossible on two sides, commands the trails to Tobacco Plains, the Moyes and Columbia Lakes, and is the most central point from which to communicate with the Indians, and protect the settlers in the event of an uprising.\n\nI moved the division into camp here on Sunday, 31st July, and on the following day told off parties to cut logs for the storehouse, arranged for a mail system for the summer between the Upper (Sam's) Steamboat Landing and here. I also purchased a pack train, consisting of 24 good ponies and 3 mules, which, with equipment complete and in excellent order, I obtained at a much lower figure than they are generally sold here. The proprietor of the train had previously spoken to the Assistant Commissioner on the subject and he had requested me to look at them.\n\nOn the 1st August the Dundee started for her first trip since being raised, Inspector Wood and the non-commissioned officers and constables left at Golden came up on the steamer, and Constable Fisher and team came by trail. Inspector Wood and Staff Sergeant Fane were required to return to Golden for a time, the remainder arrived here on the 11th.\n\nAs soon as possible I communicated with Chief Isadore as described under the head \"Indians,\" and with favorable results.\n\nThe advent of the Police ceased confidence to take the place of the alarm which had been felt during the winter and early spring.\n\nThe Indians soon began to visit the camp out of curiosity, and were more civil to the whites than formerly.\n\nFrom the 1st August to this date, all members of the division have been diligently employed in their duties, such as patrols, couriers, preparing quarters, receiving and forwarding freight, packing, freighting, and taking charge of stores at the unfortunately too numerous landings.\n\nPATROLS IN MACLEOD DISTRICT, N.W.T.\n\nThe first detachments for patrol duty were posted on the 22nd March, the great depth of snow having made it impossible to send them out earlier.\n\nOn that date Constable O'Brien was posted at the lower crossing of the St. Mary's and Constable Hay at the Fifteen-Mile Lake, each with four constables.\n\nFrom the 22nd March until the 8th April patrolling was kept up between Lethbridge, Fifteen-Mile Lake, the St. Mary's and Stand Off, where detachments of \"H\" Division were stationed.\n\nThis system answered the purpose very well, until the snow had melted further east, and necessitated a connection with the outposts of \"A\" Division, which the great depth of snow had prevented from being posted as early as those in the Macleod District.\n\nDuring the last week in March, I was directed by Superintendent Neale to go out and select points for the detachments along the boundary line, and started on the 25th March, went south, across Ripp's Coulee, to the Milk River Road, and from there, west, visiting Stone to Pon d'oreille Coulee, both places I found suitable for detachments, as they are situated in places where the river may be forded easily when the water is very high, and the banks being accessible are much used by travellers and law-breakers in crossing the boundary. Between these two points there are sixteen very high and steep banks or soft spots, which make a crossing very difficult. I moved out to Badwater Lake, and found that a detachment at Pon d'oreille Coulee could easily communicate with any post situated west or south of the Cypress Hills. I then passed around the east\nside of Badwater Lake, to the Seven Persons Coulee, and camped one night near the Bull's Head. I returned to Lethbridge on the 3rd April, by the old trail from Walsh to Macleod, and on the following day went up to Fort Macleod and reported the result of my observations to the commanding officer.\n\nDuring my trip I saw around Pend'oreille Coulee traces of a large band of cattle, which had been there during the greater part of the previous summer, and saw about one hundred head which had wintered in the vicinity.\n\nSuperintendent Neale approved of my suggestions and directed me to send out detachments on my return to Lethbridge, and remove the detachments at the St. Mary's and Fifteen-Mile Lake.\n\nOn the 8th April I sent Inspector Wood in charge of the men to be posted for patrol duty, and in accordance with my instructions he posted two constables at Kipp's Coulee as a connecting link between Milk River Ridge and Lethbridge, one sergeant and six constables at Milk River Ridge, one sergeant and six constables at Writing Stone, and the same number at Pend'oreille Coulee. The detachments at the St. Mary's and Fifteen-Mile Lake were relieved at the same time, and were utilized to make up number required for the other detachments.\n\nDuring the time the division remained in the district, constant patrolling, night and day, was kept up between the detachments, the eastern outpost of \"H\" Division communicating with my post at Milk River Ridge, which patrolled to Writing Stone, and Writing Stone to Pend'oreille, which patrolled as far as No. 2 Post of \"A\" Division, situated near the south-west point of the Cypress Hills.\n\nThe whole of the detachments sent out patrols to the southward during each day, and men with field glasses, situated on high hills, but concealed as much as possible, viewed the country in every direction.\n\nConstant communication was kept up between the outposts and Lethbridge.\n\nThe outposts performed their duties in a most satisfactory manner. The few complaints made against them proved unfounded. No suspicious characters, smugglers, horse-thieves, or other criminals succeeded in crossing the boundary undiscovered; all Indians who attempted it were, with very few exceptions, caught in the act, and compelled to give an account of themselves. The non-commissioned officers of the corps of each outpost, sent in weekly a list and description of all whites and Indians passing and repassing, together with that of all horses, vehicles, &c., in their possession.\n\nAs soon as the outposts were established, the cattle seen by me at Pend'oreille Coulee were seized, and a report made to Mr. Champness, the Customs' officer at Lethbridge. It was ascertained that the cattle had been driven in from Montana, and that no duty had been paid. The owner, named Spencer, had a small hut on Milk River, several miles east of Pend'oreille Coulee, on the north side of the international boundary. He stated to the patrols that he intended to apply for a lease there, but no doubt he had no such intention and was simply endeavoring to graze his cattle where not so likely to be observed. I have been since informed that \"A\" Division patrols see another herd belonging to the same individual.\n\nOn the 26th April, I received at Macleod a telegram from Superintendent Mollree stating that Staff Sergeant Spicer and party were fired upon by Indians near the Cypress Hills, and that the Indians had escaped. I wired to Inspector Likely at Lethbridge to warn the outposts and send Sergeant-Major Lake with 35 men to patrol between Lethbridge and the Milk River Ridge, as it was expected that the Indians would avoid arriving by Lethbridge and keep towards Kipp's Coulee. I returned to Lethbridge on the same afternoon, and at once sent a patrol to work between the mouth of the Little Bow River and Lethbridge, and went out myself with a small party to the east and south-east. The outposts sent patrols to the northward, as far as Elkhorn Coulee.\n\nAt the time I received the telegram, Superintendent Mollree was not certain where the outrage had been committed, I was, therefore, under the impression that it had occurred south or south-west of the Cypress Hills, and, consequently, the\npatrolling was done principally over the large tract of country lying between Milk River and the old trail to Walsh.\n\nOn the 3rd May, Sergeant Mongean, with part of Sergeant Major Lake's party, patrolling east of the Fifteen-Mile Lake, captured four Indians, en route west to the Blood Reserve, and Sergeant Major Lake discovered the trail of some more who had passed through to the reserve on the previous night, which was very dark and wet, making it quite an easy matter for men to pass through patrols, scattered over such a large area of country.\n\nI telegrammed Superintendent Neale and Superintendent McIlree reporting the result to both, and requesting the latter to send Staff Sergeant Spicer to Lethbridge and Macleod to see if he could recognize the Indians. He arrived on the 8th, but could not do so.\n\nOn receipt of my telegram to that effect, Superintendent Neale directed Inspector Sanders to examine the Blood Reserve, he did so, and after a good deal of trouble succeeded in finding and arresting two of the Indians, viz., the Dog and Big Rib. They had in their possession some horses belonging to Watson, of Medicine Hat. Watson appeared against them and Mr. Justice Macleod sentenced them to a term in penitentiary. They, no doubt, belonged to the party said to have fired on Staff Sergeant Spicer and his patrol.\n\nOn the 17th I telegrammed to Lethbridge directing that an escort, of a sergeant and 12 rank and file be sent up as far as Kipp to meet and relieve an escort of the same strength from \"H\" Division, and take over from them the prisoners \"Dog\" and \"Big Rib\" en route to the penitentiary, Stony Mountain, Mr. Sheriff Campbell in charge. My orders, although clear were misunderstood, the escort instead of going to Kipp went to Kipp's Coulee, the \"H\" Division escort having to take the prisoners to Lethbridge.\n\nOn Friday, the 20th May, I received a telegram from Mr. Sheriff Campbell, dated from Dunmore informing me of the escape from him of the \"Dog\" and \"Big Rib\" with shackles on. I at once sent out to the eastward a corporal and a party with orders to patrol south of the railway, but not far from it, and to proceed as far as Seven Ponds Coulee. The next day Inspector Neale and 10 men of \"H\" Division proceeded in the same direction. Both parties returned without success, no Indians were seen. I received information shortly afterwards that they had concealed themselves in a coal car on the railway, got off at Chin Coulee, and lying concealed in a hole there all day, borrowed a couple of horses, and rode to the Blood Reserve. I informed Superintendent Neale at once, and warned the patrols on the boundary.\n\nA telegram from you dated the 20th May, directed me to hold myself in readiness to proceed with my division to Kootenay District, B.C. I sent out a party the following morning to relieve the outposts at Pen d'Oreille Coulee and Writing Stone, these places being so far distant that the reliefs could not be delayed without great inconvenience to the service.\n\n\"H\" Division, under the temporary command of Inspector Howe, arrived on the 8th June, and were at once directed to relieve the detachments on outpost duty at Kipp's Coulee and Milk River Ridge.\n\nPATROLLING AT SWIFT CURRENT.\n\nWhile encamped at Swift Current in accordance with your instruction patrols were sent north towards Saskatchewan Crossing, and south towards Fish Lake, the former place is distant from Swift Current 25 miles, and the latter about 20 miles, nothing was seen.\n\nOn the 15th June, it was reported that some railway men, had seen a large party of armed half breeds near Gull Lake. I sent a patrol at once and obtained the information that there were only 5 or 6 lodges of poor people who were collecting buffalo bones for sale. I understand that some persons at Swift Current had started alarming rumors of a half-breed and Indian rising, and some of them appeared to believe\nthat such was imminent, but careful personal investigation, proved to me that neither half-breeds nor Indians thought of such a thing. As to the half-breeds their only anxiety seemed to be with reference to the means of obtaining a living next winter, as the buffalo bone collecting was becoming difficult and freighting to Battleford was not as brisk as in former years owing to the failure of crops in 1886.\n\nI found two families of half-breeds in a starving condition. One consisted of a widow with 7 children, and the other of a woman with a large family, her husband away freighting and no food to be had.\n\nI relieved them and reported the circumstance to you.\n\nPATROLLING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nPatrolling in Kootenay District, although it may be necessary, is not so much so as in the North West. The country is of a rugged nature, and there are only two practicable routes to the United States, one is by the Moyea Pass, between the Purcell and Selkirk Ranges to Sand Point, on the Northern Pacific Railway, the other is the trail to Walla Walla, it crosses the boundary 60 miles south of this place. A trail forked off from it leads through the Crows Nest Pass to Fort Macleod. These trails are only practicable for pack horses.\n\nThere is only one trail leading north, it is practicable for wagons from here to Canal Flat, it then becomes a pack trail to Geary's at the foot of the Upper Columbia Lake, from thence there is a wagon road to Macaulay's Landing, 90 miles north of here. The pack trail, crosses and recrosses the wagon road to that point, and continues on to Golden.\n\nAt intervals during the summer patrols and other parties have visited Tobacco Plains, the Moyea Pass, Old Camp, Colonel Baker's, the Mission, Chief Isadore's, and many other points. Couriers, packers and teamsters have been constantly on the trail between here and Macaulay's Landing, Sam's Landing, Windemere and several trips to Golden have been made. These duties have been performed satisfactorily.\n\nI enclose herewith a list of the number of miles travelled by the horses of the division during the year. (Not printed.)\n\nAMERICAN TROOPS.\n\nFrom spring until the 4th September 35 men of the 5th United States Infantry were stationed on Tobacco Plains, six miles south of the boundary, and 68 from here, Lieutenant Kennedy, 5th Infantry, in command. I am informed that this detachment had a very good effect upon the Indians in that section.\n\nI was in constant communication with Lieutenant Kennedy during his stay in that part of the country.\n\nCRIME, NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.\n\nDuring the winter there was very little crime in the portion of the Macleod District occupied by my division. On the 17th January, two Blood Indians named respectively \"Shoots Well\" and \"The Bee,\" were arrested and brought before me for forcibly stealing and taking away a shawl, the property of Isabella Bouchette of Lethbridge. I committed them for trial at the next court to be holden at Macleod.\n\nOn the 14th January, some ranchmen reported to me that while riding the range they saw a few lodges of Indians near the mouth of the Big Bow, and that they were under the impression that as the Indians were not likely to receive rations down there they must be killing and living upon cattle belonging to the white settlers. I sent out next day Interpreter Potts and four of the constables as scouts, with orders to examine the whole country as far as the mouth of the Big Bow River, and some distance down the South Saskatchewan, both sides, and the valley of the river to be scouted; all Indians were to be questioned as to their business there, the lodges entered, any traces of dead stock to be noted, and if any were found near or\nin an Indian lodge, that the occupants were to be arrested and brought back to Lethbridge.\n\nThe party carried out my instructions thoroughly, with the result that they found no traces of cattle killing. There were several lodges of Indians along the Belly River and at the mouth of the Big Bow, but they were living on antelope meat, as many as 11 antelope heads were counted in the lodges of the Indians at the mouth of the Big Bow. I am satisfied that no cattle killing was done in that section of the country. There was no need to go for antelope being very plentiful, and the winter being exceptionally severe one, a number of cattle died in the snow drifts along the Belly River and were generally eaten by the Indians, who being of a very restless disposition prefer living in that way to receiving their rations at the agency.\n\nOn the 11th April, two men came into Lethbridge from Sweet Grass Hills, Montana, and reported that while camped there they had five ponies stolen from them by Blood Indians, and had followed the trail to the Canadian side of the boundary. I sent Corporal O'Brien and a party to the Blood Reserve early on the morning of the 12th, accompanied by the Montana men. They were not discovered on the reserve, but as they were not in the possession of any particular Indian, and the other Indians \"knew nothing about it,\" the thieves were not taken. The patrols on the boundary have seen the Indians pass, and taken note of the horses but as they had no identifying marks they could not ascertain the names of the Indians.\n\nJ. M. Christopher came from Montana on the 22nd April, and reported two horses stolen south of the boundary line by the Bloods. I sent Corporal Hayne and party to recover the horses. Only one was found, and the Indian who had it in possession, drew a knife and endeavored to prevent the recovery of the horse; he was backed up by a large number of others and it was necessary for Corporal Hayne to obtain assistance from Sergeant Brymer at Stand Off, before the horse could be taken away. Corporal Hayne did not arrest anyone offending him having quite misunderstood my instructions in regard to the matter. He returned that night with the recovered horse and laid an information against the Indians who resisted him. I sent Sergeant Jones out at 11 o'clock that night, with a party of ten men to lie near the reserve until dawn and then steal into camp and effect the capture. Sergeant Jones examined the whole camp but could not find the Indians wanted. It was ascertained afterwards that an Indian saw the party crossing the Belly River near Whoop-up, and saddling a horse, galloped as fast as he could to the reserve, and warned the Indians, who immediately started for the United States.\n\nA man named Peck came in from Montana on the 1st April, and reported that five horses were stolen from him by Blood Indians south of the boundary line. I sent Sergeants Robinson and Monger with two parties to recover the horses, the former went to the Blood Reserve and the latter proceeded to the St. Mary's, where some horses were reported to have been left by some Indians. Sergeant Robinson recovered the horses, but the Indians could not be identified.\n\nOn the 16th April I sent Corporal Hayne to the Blood Reserve to look for horses supposed to be stolen from the Medicine Hat Ranche Co. Most of the horses were subsequently found grazing on the reserve, they had doubtless been stolen by the Indians, but as usual they had turned them loose.\n\nFriday, 6th May three Bloods, named respectively Wolf, Bird and Piegan, were arrested in the valley below Lethbridge for being drunk and disorderly. They were brought before me and Inspector Likely, J.P., the next day, and sentenced to one month's imprisonment with hard labor. It was impossible for us to find out the names or descriptions of the parties who sold them the liquor; it was found that one of the Indians had obtained it for them, but she could not be induced to tell where she got it, her statement being that she had found it in the bush.\n\nDuring the year, several saloon and restaurant keepers in Lethbridge were brought before me, for having liquor illegally in their possession, and a few before Inspector Likely, J.P. Returns of these cases will be made to you by the officer commanding the division stationed at Lethbridge, from the crime book of that post.\n\nOn the 28th May, two American deserters from Fort Shaw, Montana, arrived at\nLethbridge and handed over to the Police a buggy and span of horses which they had obtained from a livery stable keeper at Sun River Crossing, Montana. I was not in barracks at the time, and as it was not suspected that the property had been stolen, the deserters were allowed to depart.\n\nOn the 31st May I received a telegram from the Sheriff at Sun River, requesting me to detain the men as the property had been stolen. I caused them to be arrested. One of the men turned out to be a civilian, who was employed as post tailor at Fort Shaw. The sheriff and owner of the horses arrived next day, and a hearing was given. Mr. Justice Macleod dismissed the charge against the accused, and the property was given up to the owner. It appears the horses were hired ostensibly to take the men to Butte, but were not used for that purpose.\n\nA man named Kapla, who had been cook in the Macleod Hotel, Macleod, was arrested on the night of the 15th July, for attempting to commit suicide. I held an investigation, which resulted in showing that the prisoner had not attempted to commit suicide. He was examined by Dr. Newburn, and proved to have been drinking heavily before coming to town, and was still suffering from the effects of his prolonged spree. I therefore detained him for a few days, and discharged him.\n\nCRIME, Kootenay District, B.C.\n\nThere has been very little crime in Kootenay District since the arrival of this division. As already reported, I was directed to take over Kapla, an Indian, who had been arrested by Provincial Commissioner Anderson, last spring, on suspicion of having murdered two miners named Kemp and Hylton, but who had been taken from the lock-up by Chief Isadore of the Kootenay tribe, assisted by a considerable number of his men. On arrival in the district of Assistant Commissioner Horchmer, North West Mounted Police, A. W. Vowell, Stipendiary Magistrate, Gold Commissioner, and Dr. Powell, Senior Indian Commissioner, B.C., were appointed by the Government as commissioners to enquire into the causes of the trouble in this district, Chief Isadore promised to cooperate, and I arrived with the division on the 1st August, and on the 20th I visited the camp and was directed by me to hand over Kapla and another Indian named Isadore, who was also suspected of being an accomplice of Kapla's. The chief handed them over to Provincial Commissioner Anderson by my directions, the lock-up at the old camp being safer than one of our tents. I went up to Wild Horse Camp on the 25th August, and caused the Indians to be brought before me, read the charge and remanded them for eight days until Commissioner Anderson could produce the witnesses for the prosecution. I then concluded that it would be better to keep the prisoners at the two camps, and caused them to be removed there forthwith. The prisoners were brought before me again on the 2nd September, and the witnesses examined. Commissioner Anderson then asked for another period of three days, which was granted. On the 1st September, two Indian boys, named Encas and Baptiste, who were supposed to have been with the prisoners at the time of the murder, were arrested and kept in close confinement without being permitted to see any one. On the 5th September, the accused were again brought before me, and after a careful examination of the witnesses, were discharged. There was no evidence of any consequence, the only evidence showing that they had passed along the trail together, and shot the white man.\n\nThe accused in their statement merely said they were not guilty. The boys who were said to have been with them denied all knowledge of the affair, and showed that they had been elsewhere at the time of the murder.\n\nIn connection with the above, I am of opinion that this murder case ought to have been attended to immediately after the occurrence. It does not seem strange that the murder was committed on the trail between here and the Canadian Pacific Railway, especially as it was at that time travelled by bad characters, either making for the railway which was then under construction, and proved a fruitful field for gamblers, whiskey peddlars, and every class of criminal let loose upon Canada by the\ncompletion of numerous lines of railway in the United States, or escaping from justice in Canada. But it seems very strange, that in a country full of Justices of the Peace, that two respectable miners, with a considerable sum of money in their possession, were murdered, and no steps taken to hold an inquest at the time, bury the remains of the poor fellows, or bring the murderers to justice. It is often difficult to bring criminals to justice when the case is taken up at once, how much more difficult must it be to do so, when the affair is allowed to rest for three years. I feel certain that if Kapla and Isadore committed the crime, evidence could have been obtained at the time to convict them. Now, the Indians are aware of the effort made, and have effectually screened the accused. However, it is possible that the murder was committed by whites passing along the trail, the Indians were located near it, and with the knowledge they had of the murderer's stated how much money they had, or it may have been generally known and thus excited the curiosity of some of the many bad characters constantly moving along the trail in either direction.\n\nI will endeavor during the winter to obtain some clue. I have been constantly endeavoring to do so, but without success.\n\nChief Isadore, on the occasion of the departure of Father Fouquet for another field of labor, came to the Police camp with him and requested him to read the following petition to me.\n\n\"Kootenay, B.C., 4th November, 1887.\n\n\"Gentlemen.\u2014Before leaving, I address you a few words in behalf of the Indians agreeably to the wishes of Chief Isadore, who gave for reason of his wish, the confidence he had in you.\n\n\"During the thirteen years I have resided here, I have always found the Kootenays anxious to live on good terms with the whites. It has been always my personal opinion that although a brave and cool race, they would not go to war unless forced into it.\n\n\"The first few years I was here, there had not been a case of drunkenness, and only four or five cases of light drinking known amongst the Kootenays. Not one case of robbery of any importance was heard of. But since the buffalo hunting has ceased, the Indians here have mixed more with Chinamen and whites, and since the authority of the chiefs have been lessened by various causes, the last four or five years there has been too many cases of drunkenness and gambling heard of and some with shooting and fighting; half-breeds, whitemen and Chinamen have been gambling with the Indians or supplying them with liquor.\n\n\"It is my personal opinion that the missionaries having no influence over these unscrupulous whitemen, half-breeds and Chinamen, will not be able to stop their evils, unless the Government checks them whitemen or Chinaman, and compels the Indians to say from whom they got the liquor.\n\n\"I have the honor to be, Gentlemen,\n\n\"Your obedient servant,\n\n\"L. Fouquet.\n\n\"To the officer of the North West Mounted Police,\n\n\"Kootenay, B.C.\"\n\nI replied that I was gratified to hear the chief was anxious to have such irregularities prevented and that the Police were anxious to prevent them, but that it was necessary for the headmen to report any Indian who was drunk, for no matter how complete a supervision we had, the scattered situation of the tribe prevented us from seeing as much of it as the headmen. I advised them to avoid those crimes, and told them that in the event of any Indian being found drunk, he would be severely punished, and the full benefit of the law meted out to the parties who supplied them with the liquor.\nFrom what I can learn drunkenness is not at all common among the Kootenays, occasionally one of them gets hold of some liquor, but as a rule the whites are afraid to supply them, as they are so apt to expose themselves to people who would proceed against the seller.\n\n**INDIANS, MACLEOD DISTRICT, N.W.T.**\n\nThe Indians in the portion of the Macleod District, in which this division was stationed are the Bloods and Piegans, of the Blackfoot nation. They are on separate reserves. The Bloods are of a more restless nature than the Piegan, and less law abiding. The young men and many of the middle aged ones, are generally well placed as when roaming about the country, when they are, and justly, looked upon with suspicion by the settlers. These Indians keep the greatest watchfulness. During the portion of the summer spent in that district, Americans were constantly complaining of the depredations of the young men of the band. A constant supervision had to be kept over them, and although there were 200 men in the district, it was found that even that number were not sufficient. It would appear that three divisions would be little enough. The craftiness of these people makes it difficult to watch their movements.\n\nFrom my experience of the Bloods, I am of opinion that it is necessary to keep a firm hand upon them, their constant attempts, sometimes successful, to go into the United States for the purpose of stealing horses from both whites and Indians makes it necessary that the superintendents in the Force should have the powers of commissioners of police, and the North-West Acts should make these powers sufficiently great to enable the officer in possession of them to inflict a severe punishment upon horse thieves, and other criminals.\n\nThere are frequent instances of horses being stolen by the Indians from a long distance in the United States and Canada, and summary justice is required to save the owners of the stock from the often great expense and inconvenience of coming back to prosecute if a committal is made, and besides a summary punishment would have a greater effect upon the Indians. If such criminals had to remain in jail for weeks, or perhaps months, awaiting trial, The country is so large and settling up so fast that it is impossible for the judges of the Supreme Court to decide upon every case, which may turn up, between the usual sittings of the District Court.\n\nThe Piegan Indians are, as before mentioned, much quieter and law abiding than the Bloods. During the past spring and summer very few complaints were made against them.\n\nDuring the stay of the division in Macleod District, Mr. Pocklington, the Indian Agent there, gave the police very valuable assistance when it was necessary for them to visit the reserves on duty.\n\n**INDIANS, KOOTENAY, B.C.**\n\nThe Indians in this district are the Kootenays (Upper and Lower,) and Shuswap.\n\nThe Upper Kootenays have their reservation on the north side of the St. Mary's River and at Tobacco Plains. The Lower Kootenays are on the Lower Kootenay River near the Kootenay Lake.\n\nThe Shuswaps have their reservation at the Columbia Lakes. The Upper Kootenays and Shuswaps are horse Indians, the Lower Kootenays canoe Indians.\n\nDuring last winter the whites of this district were thrown into a state of alarm by the action of Isadore, head chief of the Upper Kootenays, in forcibly releasing from a local Indian prison Kapla, who had been arrested a short time before by Provincial Commissioner Anderson.\n\nThis action of Isadore showed the whites, that although the Indians had up to that time abstained from any hostility, they did not do so through fear of consequences. It was evident to all that the whites had been here on sufferance. A\nmeeting of the white settlers was held, the situation discussed and the decision arrived at that Provincial Commissioner Anderson and the Honorable F. W. Alymer were to leave the country temporarily.\n\nMr. Anderson had been Commissioner of the district for some years; Mr. Alymer had been working at his profession as a surveyor and civil engineer. It appears that Isadore was under the impression that Mr. Alymer had been taking up land all over the country, and the chief pretended that he thought no land would be left for the Indians. No doubt this was a very lame excuse, as the chief well knew that he and his tribe had a reserve, which had previously to this time been laid off by Mr. O'Reilly, a Commissioner appointed by the Government for that purpose.\n\nThe action of the white settlers in directing Mr. Alymer and Commissioner Anderson's leave of absence no doubt gave the Indians a greater opinion of their powers and caused many to be very independent in their bearing towards the whites, and commit some petty offences which they would never have done if the whites had simply remained at their work and shown no signs of fear.\n\nWith a few exceptions the whites here are afraid of the Indians as a body. The scattered nature of the settlements leaves them completely at the mercy of the Indians if hostile. But the Shuswap, and many of the Kootenays, are too well off to provoke trouble, knowing, as many of them do, what the consequences would be. But many of the young men of these tribes have no property, and are ready at any time to take advantage of the weakness of local power. They, as much as most young Indians, require to be dealt with firmly and taught to respect the law. But this they cannot possibly be taught while only half civilized if that power is represented by one constable, who is obliged to call into requisition the services of the settlers, who desire to live on peaceable terms with the Indians, and therefore object to being called upon as special constables whenever it is necessary to make an arrest.\n\nAn Indian cannot understand the employment of special constables; it seems strange to him that settlers who are earning a livelihood by the same means as he can be brought to arrest him for any offence, and until he is more civilized it would appear that the district should have four or five constables to make arrests when required.\n\nShortly after I arrived here Chief Isadore came to see me, and stated that he was informed by whites and Chinamen, that the Police came here with hostile intentions towards the Indians. I informed him that such was not the case, that I came here to maintain law and order, both whites and Indians were all the same to us, and would be fairly treated, but that any breach of the law, would be severely dealt with, no matter who the offender might be. I told the chief to pay no attention to any statements made to him by anyone, if they were to the effect that hostility towards the Indians was the feeling of the Police.\n\nBefore going he promised to inform me if anyone attempted to stir up trouble between the whites and Indians.\n\nOn the 22nd November three Commissioners, viz., Hon. Mr. Vernon, Dr. Powell, Indian Commissioner, and Mr. O'Reilly, came to the district to make an inspection of the Indian reserves, and allot to them some more land if necessary. The Indians at this time were away at Sand Point, on the Northern Pacific Railway, and the Commissioners were unable to meet them, which was unfortunate, the Indians being well aware that such arrangements are usually made at a Council.\n\nThe Commissioners on leaving wrote requesting me to read their decision to Isadore and the Kootenays on their return from Sand Point. I met Chief Isadore on the 5th November, the first opportunity which had offered, and asked him to meet me on Monday the 7th with as many of his Indians as possible. He came on Monday with a number of headmen, and a few others, explaining that the remainder were at the fall hunt.\n\nI read the proclamation and informed them that the arrangement made by the Commissioners was irrevocable and that the quantity of land given to them, was all that they required. The chief objected to giving up the land belonging to Colonel Baker, which he said he had occupied years before any whites came. I replied that it must be given up on receipt of the value of the improvements as arranged by the\nCommissioners. He then said, that, of course, he had to obey their decision and requested that an irrigating ditch be dug for his own land.\n\nI reported the result of the interview to the Commissioners through Dr. Powell, sen., Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Indians have a very good feeling towards the division. The behavior of the men towards them has won their respect.\n\nThe chief of the Shuswap Indians is Mathias, a very good Indian, industrious and well disposed.\n\nThe Indians here are more industrious and moral than any in the North West, except perhaps the Mountain Stonies.\n\nAll immoral conduct if detected is punished summarily by flogging.\n\nI beg to state that it is my opinion from careful observation, that if the waggon road is completed, a competent magistrate, and half-a-dozen selected constables appointed, may be able firmly and impartially do their duty, the district can do without any other force.\n\nThe completion of the waggon road by next autumn will enable troops to move in, if any sign of discontent is shown among the Indians.\n\nIn addition to the waggon road, a telegraph line would be a great advantage, one of the constables being employed as operator here.\n\nIt would no doubt be undesirable to take the Police out of the district before their influence has been sufficiently felt; such action might cause the Indians to think the Police were either afraid, or unable to maintain themselves, so far from supplies, and they would become easier than ever. But a stay of 12 months will have paved the way for a less expensive maintenance of law and order.\n\nBARRACKS, LETHBRIDGE, N. W. T.\n\nThe barracks at Lethbridge were commenced last autumn, under the supervision of Mr. Henderson, Clerk of Works, Public Works Department.\n\nThe division moved into them on the 21st January, and although owing to the severity of the weather, the plastering could not be done, the other work had been performed so well, that the rooms were quite comfortable.\n\nThe stables under construction were for only forty horses, which made it necessary for me to utilize the old stable obtained from the North-West Coal and Navigation Co., which contained 37 horses.\n\nDuring the winter an ice house was built by the men at a very small cost. A corral for the hay was constructed by the division carpenter, in time for the stacking of the hay.\n\nThe buildings occupied by the division while at Macleod, were not to be compared with those at Lethbridge, being of less substantial workmanship, and much colder even with lath and plaster, than those at Lethbridge without.\n\nBARRACKS, KOOTENAY, B. C.\n\nOn the arrival of the Division here, I detailed all available men to get out timber for quarters, which are now occupied and completed. They are constructed of logs of yellow pine, partly hewn, sheathed and floored with common lumber, and roofed with shingles (an unshaved shingle 3 feet in length).\n\nThe buildings consist of a barrack building for the men, containing two large rooms, separated by a passage and large enough to contain the whole division without crowding.\n\nA stable for 75 horses, with saddle and harness room, under the same roof; hospital 40 by 25; quarters for the officers, 25 by 50; guard room, cells, casualty\n\n* Note.\u2014(The arrangements have since been completed satisfactorily.)\nstore and orderly room in one building, 25 by 50; sergeants mess room, kitchen and staff-sergeant's quarters in one building, 25 by 50; quartermaster's store, 60 by 25; shoemakers' and carpenters' and saddlers' shops 40 by 25. The buildings are nine feet to the eaves, with a roof of a quarter pitch.\n\nThe work of erecting these quarters has been very hard, the timber is very heavy, and had to be hauled a considerable distance, about fourteen hundred logs of various sizes, some as much as 30 feet in length, and none under 20 feet, had to be cut, hauled, and rolled up. The non-commissioned officers and constables worked well; the quarters they have constructed are, without exception, the best log houses I have seen for years. In addition to the buildings a root house and latrines have been constructed on suitable situations.\n\nThe timbers used for the roof were in part split by the men, partly by others. Mr. Cowan who took the contract agreed to furnish them at less than half price, if some of the men were allowed to assist him. I permitted this, obtaining the shakes at almost one-third the price. The lumber is the only expensive material used which could not be avoided, owing to lack of competition.\n\nI directed Assistant Surgeon Par\u00e9 to examine the building; he reported them to be sufficiently well ventilated, and quite comfortable enough for winter quarters.\n\nIn the event of these quarters being vacated in the spring and still retained by the Department, I would suggest that the Provincial officer or some other responsible person, be placed in charge of them so that they may be ready for occupation if required.\n\nSUPPLY, FREIGHTING, &c.\n\nA sufficient quantity of beef, potatoes and fuel is obtained here, of good quality and at reasonable prices. Twenty-two thousand pounds of oats have been purchased from Colonel Baker. The hay is of poor quality, and costs from $20 to $25 per ton, as there is not enough of it that horses will have to remain on the range until the 1st January. The remainder of the supplies are sent from the east. The difficulty of getting a sufficient quantity delivered here is very great.\n\nShortly after the arrival of the division at Golden, the steamer \"Duchess\" navigating the Columbia from Golden to Columbia Lakes (eighty miles) capsized with a load, the principal part of which belonged to the Force. Very little was recovered, and the boat lost 6 trips, which caused great inconvenience to the Police and public alike. The boat was raised after considerable delay and continued making frequent trips, about three in a fortnight, to Sam's Landing, Upper Columbia Lake. On the 20th August the water became low, and the boat was unable to come higher than Chaucer's, eight miles below Windermere.\n\nTwo other trips were made to that place, and then it was impossible for the boat to get higher than Spellamacheen, a point about 40 miles from Golden. As soon as the boat ceased to reach Sam's Landing it was necessary to employ small boats to bring the freight to there, and detail men of the division to each landing to take charge of and forward the freight by small boats to that place, from which it was necessary to hire freighters to freight it to Geary's store at the lower end of the upper lake, a distance of 16 miles from Geary's; the greater part of it was brought across the lake in small boats to Canal Flat, 16 miles, and the remainder was freighted by the pack train to the same place, both routes had to be used, as it was impossible to obtain enough of either class of freighters to enable me to use either one or the other exclusively.\n\nFrom Canal Flat, four Police teams, the pack animals of the Force, and some teams belonging to Mr. Mathor, brought the freight to Kootenay Camp.\n\nBefore the steamer ceased to run to Sam's Landing, Messrs. Galbraith Bros. and Mathers brought some of the freight through from the Landing to here, and for some time our pack train was employed in packing from the Landing to Canal Flat, where they met three of our teams, once a week, and loaded them up, the teams coming to this place, the packers returning for another load.\nThe whole of the supplies not yet here are at Geary's Landing and a couple of the men are in charge. There are still some 60 tons to come in, which will most certainly keep all the available transport busy until the 1st January.\n\nThe lakes having been up, the pack train will have to transport all the freight left at Geary's to Canal Flat, from which three teams and two of Mr. Galbraith's will haul it to here. The difficulties to contend with to get supplies can hardly be overrated. The whole transport of the district consists of four Police teams and wagons, and 6 or 7 belonging to settlers, and the Police pack train. Messrs. Galbraith's pack train was laid up for the winter. It did us good service in the early part of the season, but having been constantly at work for more than 6 months the mules and horses can do no more, the greater part of winter supplies for the settlement had to be brought in by them, as well as a large quantity for the Police.\n\nThe delay in the construction of the waggon road has caused this almost endless trouble. The road was completed early in the spring. The manager was building it around the Upper Columbia Lake when some personal cause caused the stoppage of the work at the place for a time. One portion of the community wished the road on the west, the other on the east side, and with the natural result that they have it on neither side as yet. The manager during the stoppage of the work at the lake, continued constructing from the Lake to Mackay's. This part of the road has been of great use to us, in fact if it had not been built, I could not have got the supplies in this year.\n\nThe cost added to the freight owing to the late arrival of the supplies has been enormous, although the terms I have obtained are lower than formerly given to the settlers.\n\nWhen the steamer plied to the Upper Landing, the rates were 75 cents per hundred, and from there Messrs. Galbraith and Mather's brought them to this place for $2.50 per hundred, which is 50 cents less than the price to settlers and others. The Police waggons and pack train averaged 5,000 lbs. a week while employed.\n\nAs soon as the steamer ceased running to the Upper (Sam's) Landing, the small boats, working from here to the landing, had to be paid and the steamboat people charged the same rates as before.\n\nThe average rate is $6 a hundred to this place, $1 less than to the public, part of which is brought by the division transport.\n\nThe rates after the boat ceased running to the Upper Landing are as follows, viz.\u2014\n\n| Amount by steamboat to Spelimacheen, \u00bd cent per pound. |\n| To Mackay's Landing, by small boats, \u00bd cent per pound. |\n| From Mackay's to Geary's, by waggons, \u00bd cent per pound. |\n| From Geary's, by small boats, to Canal Flat, \u00bd cent per pound. |\n| From Canal Flat by hired teams to here, 2 cents per pound. Our own teams saving those rates on 5,000 pounds a week. |\n\nIn the event of the division staying here another year, a sufficient quantity of beef, potatoes, hay and cordwood, and a far larger supply of oats than this year could be obtained.\n\nDRILL.\n\nDuring the past winter all ranks of the division went through a course of drill.\n\nThe officers were instructed in riding, sword, manual and firing exercises. The constables in riding drill, manual and firing exercises. Inspector Wattam was instructor, and it is but just to that officer to say that his system was so good, that although the weather was severe and the drills frequent, all ranks took a great interest in them, and when the course was completed reflected great credit upon their instructor.\n\nI endeavored to give the division a course of musketry in May, but the necessity for constant patrols and other duties, compelled me to give it up.\nDuring the stay of the division at Swift Current, all men not employed in patrolling were instructed twice daily in field movements, mounted, dismounted duty and extended order. Many of the horses were remounts just purchased off the range, but they proved very tractable in a short time and performed their work very satisfactorily.\n\nAll ranks of the division are, with a few exceptions, well up in drill and equitation.\n\nOFFICERS.\n\nI beg to recommend to your favorable notice Inspectors Wood and Huot, and Assistant Surgeon Powell. Inspector Wood acted as Adjutant at Macleod post until the removal of the division to Lethbridge; had charge of the outposts and patrols last summer; forwarded supplies from Golden, and performed many other important duties to my entire satisfaction.\n\nInspector Huot joined the division in June, and has been most of his time at its headquarters; he has been of great service to me, both on the line of march, and in camp and quarters.\n\nAssistant Surgeon Powell has been very attentive to the sick under his charge, and prompt to respond to any call for his services.\n\nDISCIPLINE.\n\nThe discipline of the division, considering the varied circumstances under which it has been placed during the past year, has been on the whole satisfactory. Any offences have been, as a rule, committed by a few, who through some defect in temper, indiscipline or bad habits contracted previous to their engagement, are liable to get into scrapes at any time.\n\nThe great majority of the division are as fine and respectable a body of men as any one could desire to command. They have strictly attended to the line of conduct laid down by me, with regard to their intercourse with both the white and Indian population. Not a single complaint has been made against any of them, nor have I ever heard anything other than gratifying to me.\n\nThe non-commissioned officers now serving have set an excellent example in everything, and used great tact in the necessary encouragement of the men.\n\nDESERTIONS.\n\nOn the 12th March three constables deserted from Lethbridge. As soon as the desertions were known to have taken place, I sent Inspector Wood, Sergeant Gordon, and seven (7) constables in pursuit towards Benton. This party divided, one keeping on the Benton trail, and the other towards the west end of Milk River Ridge. The party on the Benton trail met the deserted Kipp's coul\u00e9e, but all traces of the deserters were then lost, although the country was well examined.\n\nIt turned out afterwards that the deserters, being recruits and knowing nothing of the country, mistook Kipp's coul\u00e9e for Milk River, and being afraid to cross, halted there, and their horses got away. They then started along the coul\u00e9e, east, and left the saddles where they were afterwards found, continuing east until they were completely lost. They were next heard of in Fort Assiniboine, in a fearful plight. It was reported that one would die, that one would lose his feet and eyesight, and the third his feet and hands.\n\nOn the night of the 24th May, three constables deserted while patrolling. Inspector Lakely had just arrived, and he sent Corporal O'Brien in pursuit. The corporal got on the trail of the deserters and followed it to the stopping place on the Marias River, Montana. They had reached there but a short time before him, and left the horses and saddles, arms, &c., in charge of the hotel-keeper.\nCorporal O'Brien then returned to Writing Stone. No doubt the gold mining in the Sweet Grass Hills and the reports of high wages on railway construction in Montana induced these men to desert.\n\nOn the 26th March, Superintendent Neale telegraphed me from Macleod, stating that one of his own and three of my men had deserted on the previous evening. I sent Sergeants Roby and Allen with six men each to endeavor to head them off before their arrival at the lines. But the deserters had got too good a start and knew the country so well that it was impossible to do so. Inspector Sanders eventually recovered the horses, saddles and arms, which had been taken from them by some Piegan Indians.\n\nThese men were no doubt induced to go by a Constable of \"H\" Division and one of \"D\" Division. The former had been recently reduced from corporal for a breach of discipline, the latter was a very bad character and had been transferred from \"C\" to \"D\" Division the previous autumn while undergoing a term of imprisonment for insubordination.\n\nOne constable deserted from Golden while under sentence of imprisonment for being drunk and disorderly in camp, and another from this post on the 17th August, going down the Kootenay River to the United States in a boat.\n\nThree constables deserted from this post on the 27th September. Inspector Hunt sent Corporal Harrison and party to recover the Government property taken and if possible capture the deserters. The boxes belonging to Messrs. Clutterbuck and Lees, English tourists, were taken by the deserters. Corporal Harrison returned from the United States on the 2nd October; he recovered all the stolen property. It appears that the men expressed their regret for their foolish action and would have returned but were afraid of the punishment usually given for the offence.\n\nThree men deserted in October, Sergeant Allen and party were sent in pursuit; all Government property was recovered, but the men had crossed the line, having pushed the horses very hard.\n\nThe above is the largest number I have known to desert. Several of them were no doubt enticed away by others, as in almost every case the men bitterly regretted their foolishness.\n\nThese desertions show the necessity for carrying out your recommendations of last year, that Canadian farmers' sons be preferred.\n\nHARNESS AND SADDLERY.\n\nThe harness and saddlery on charge at this post, consists of five sets of heavy wheel from \"K\" and one from \"E\" Division, one light set of wheel, received this year from headquarters, and one set heavy lead harness. Fifty new and fifteen old, but good, double cinch saddles, 25 Spanish pack saddles, and the required number of saddle blankets and head collars.\n\nThe double cinch saddles are of the manufacture of Main & Winchester, and are excellent. The advantage of the double over the single cinch is very great, especially in a hilly country; the former will never cause sore backs, unless there is great carelessness on the part of the rider; the latter frequently does so, no matter how careful he may be. I would respectfully urge that in future no single cinch saddles be purchased. The harness, excepting the light set of wheel, is old, but will answer the purpose for which it is required until next autumn. The pack saddles are in very good order. The stable halters supplied this year are first class.\n\nBefore leaving the North-West, five sets of heavy wheel harness, and five sets of lead, one set of cart harness, and nineteen single cinch saddles, were properly packed, addressed and placed in store at Lethbridge, for transmission to Regina. One set of wheel harness was transferred to \"K\" Division, fifty single cinch saddles were boxed up, addressed to officer commanding \"G\" Division, and placed in charge of the officer commanding at Calgary.\nWAGGONS, &c.\n\nThe vehicles on charge in this district consist of five heavy wagons, four received from \"K\" and one from \"E\" Division, and one double buckboard received from headquarters in September. These are all in fair order and have stood remarkably well the rough roads of this section, and a great deal of unavoidable rough usage.\n\nOn leaving Lethbridge, I transferred to \"K\" Division at that time four heavy wagons, one heavy spring wagon, and one double buckboard, all in first-class order.\n\nI took over from that Division four heavy wagons in good order. This transfer was unavoidable, as it was necessary that I should march to Swift Current at once, and all my wagons being out at the relief of my outposts I was obliged to take the only wagons available at the time.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nMountain fever broke out in the Division about the first of August, and before it was finally subdued three of the best men in the Division, Regimental No. 1848, Constable Lazebny, Regimental No. 1783, Constable Mason, and Regimental No. 1789, Constable Fisher, succumbed to the disease.\n\nAssistant Surgeon Powell was attacked by the fever on the 24th September, and fortunately, Dr. Powell senior, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, was in the district and kindly volunteered his services to the Division. He remained until the 10th October, when Assistant Surgeon Par\u00e9 having arrived from Calgary, reported for duty.\n\nDr. Powell's kindness and strict attention to the sick, is remembered with gratitude by all, especially as it was well known that he had urgent matters calling him elsewhere.\n\nDr. Par\u00e9 worked very hard after his arrival, and completely subdued the disease. I beg respectfully to recommend him to your favorable notice; his energy, ability and kindness won the confidence and respect of all who came under his care.\n\nAs soon as Assistant Surgeon Powell became well enough to return to duty, I permitted Assistant Surgeon Par\u00e9 to depart.\n\nFurther particulars to be found in Assistant Surgeon Powell's report herein enclosed.\n\nCLOTHING.\n\nThe clothing of this year is, on the whole, superior to that of last. The tunics, riding breeches, underclothing, overcoats, stockings, socks, highlows, mitts, forage caps and watch coats are good. Riding breeches better cut and forage caps of a better shape than the previous issue. The moccasins are of poor quality, and the fatigue suits of too light material for the rough work required. The boots are better than former ones being worn, but the soles are not quite strong enough.\n\nShould it be necessary to cease issuing buffalo coats to the Force, I would suggest that a coat be issued of the style called a pea jacket, such as has been and now is frequently worn by the officers and sergeants, but of the same material as that used in the manufacture of the blue cloth cloaks.\n\nIn 1884 the men employed in the mountains were permitted to purchase and wear pea jackets, furnished with the regulation brass button, it having been found that the buffalo coats were too clumsy for active work either mounted or dismounted; a pea jacket of the above description would, if worn with a muffler, be just as suitable for prairie work as the buffalo coat.\n\nFrom careful observation and evidence taken by your orders last summer, it has been clearly shown that the grey cloaks are not fit for our service, and the blue cloth cloaks previously issued are suited in every way, being more durable, impervious to rain, and far better in appearance than the grey.\nARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS.\n\nBefore leaving Lethbridge, 20 carbines and 12 Adams revolvers were placed in chests, and turned into store for transmission to Regina to be repaired.\n\nThe Winchester carbine has, after a fair trial, proved to be too weak for the rough usage which it must necessarily receive in a Force which, one may say, is constantly undergoing the rough work of a campaign.\n\nIf a horse falls, with the carbine on the saddle, or a man is thrown with it in his hand, it is generally broken, no less than four (4) in use in this Division have been broken during the past summer. On no occasion has the accident been caused by carelessness.\n\nThe accoutrements of the Division are in good order, the bandoliers have been a most satisfactory addition, and are of excellent workmanship.\n\nThe manner of wearing the pistol on the belt has always been found inconvenient especially when mounted, as a man has to bring his arm across the body to seize and draw it, I would suggest that it be worn on the right side with the butt to the rear. At present when the man attempts to draw while holding the reins he experiences great difficulty in reaching the pistol, unless it is hung further forward where it would be perhaps dangerous, as the muzzle would hang over the thigh just below the groin, in which position a premature discharge would, most likely, result in making the man a cripple for life. The men of the western plains of the United States, who are acknowledged to be the most expert pistol shots in the world, invariably wear it on the right side, with the butt at the rear, and the same custom is observed in the American Army.\n\nIn the inspection and drawing of pistols, on foot, I would suggest that the carbine be carried to the left side as at \"the order\" before drawing the pistol, instead of being placed between the knees\u2014a position which was merely a makeshift when inspecting a small guard, but becomes very painful when the party inspected is a large one.\n\nHORSES.\n\nThe horses of the division have stood their work very well. Twenty-one remounts were taken on the strength; five horses were cast and sold as being unfit for further service, and two as being too large and slow. The former were sold at Lethbridge, and brought fair prices, considering the locality. The latter were left with \"K\" Division to be exchanged for their remounts to the proper standard. Three horses which had become comparatively unfit to be brought here, we exchanged with \"E\" Division for three others while en route here.\n\nThe trip along the pack trail under a very hot sun, with clouds of dust, myriads of mosquitoes, very steep ascents, and unsuitable pasture, naturally made the horses fall off in condition. They did not fully recover until the mosquitoes left and the weather became cooler, but since that time they have changed very much for the better.\n\nOwing to the scarcity and very poor quality of the hay it will be necessary to keep the horses on the range until January at the earliest. I was, earlier in the season, under the impression that sufficient quantities of hay could be obtained, but the great rainfall during haying and harvest time has very much reduced the quantity of hay put up.\n\nThere is a great deal of difficulty in herding animals here, as there is no open country of any extent; it is therefore necessary to allow them to run in the woods, where more careful watching is required.\nMEDALS.\n\nI beg respectfully to draw your attention to the fact that there are several men in this division who are entitled to the medal for the late Rebellion, and are anxious that their services should thus be acknowledged. Some of them served as non-commissioned officers in corps of scouts who have already received their medals, and many others served side by side with the militia.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. B. STEERLE,\nSuperintendent Commanding \"D\" Division.\nAPPENDIX G.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT A. B. PERRY.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 30th November, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to submit, for your information, my annual report for the current year.\n\nNothing of grave import has transpired in the district\u2014the year has been marked by an almost entire absence of serious crime\u2014the Indians have worked industriously and remained quietly on their reserve\u2014the French half-breeds have become more settled and made considerable advance towards attaining the prosperous condition in which they were previous to the rebellion\u2014the crops have been magnificent and suffered but little from early frosts; in fact, the condition of the people and the future prospects of the district are most satisfactory.\n\nINDIANS.\n\nThere are a large number of Indian reserves in this district. With the exception of the Sioux at Saskatoon, all are Crees, who have been settled on their reserves for many years, and consequently have become accustomed to their present life. They are peaceable and contented, working willingly, and rapidly becoming self-supporting.\n\nOne Arrow's band, of the Crees, is the only one but little advanced. This past summer, for the first time, they have worked very hard. The result of their labor is not very apparent, but next year, if a favorable season, they will have a large crop.\n\nThe Duck Lake Indians have worked well for the last two years. This year they have secured a large crop. At the annual exhibition held by the agricultural society of the district, these Indians secured the first prize for wheat.\n\nBoth the Duck Lake and One Arrow Indians were in the rebellion of 1885.\n\nThe Sioux were given a farm instructor this year, under whose direction they have made a creditable attempt at farming. They put out a large crop last spring, which was doing fairly, when it was destroyed by locusts in July. In addition, they have erected a number of houses, built a considerable amount of fencing, and cut and stocked a large quantity of hay. Rations have been issued them regularly by the Indian Department.\n\nThe good behavior of the Indian population of this district is worthy of note. Only one Indian, a Sioux, has been in our custody during the year; horse stealing is unknown; and there is not an instance of settlers being molested by them. They are not given to travelling about as much as in former years. Few have been permanently camped near the town other than the small band of Sioux who earn their living here unassisted by the Government.\n\nLast winter a severe snake and moccasin occurred among the Indians to the north about Grand Lake and Isle la Crosse. Nearly every Indian family was attacked, and many cases proved fatal. Hunting and trapping ceased entirely, and for a time the Indians suffered, until relief could be sent to them. The Snake Plain Indians suffered from the disease also, to some extent. Successful efforts were made by the Hudson Bay Company's officers to prevent the spread of the disease eastward into the Cumberland District. A fresh outbreak this winter is to be feared.\n\nHALF-BREEDS.\n\nThe late rebellion naturally causes considerable interest in the French half-breeds which is manifested in the rumors and reports which are circulated as to their\nmovements. During the past year many false rumors have been credited and sensational statements appeared in the eastern press relative to them, generally without foundation and quite wide of the truth.\n\nTo understand the present position of the French half-breeds, it must be remembered that they occupy a peculiar position, being isolated from the mass of the inhabitants of the district by their religious language, and descent. On the paternal side they are of the French Canadians, on the maternal the North-West Indians, thus they are endowed with the strong national and religious feeling of the former, and inherit all the suspicions and reserve of the latter. The settlers are English speaking, of a different religion, and the greater number unacquainted with the French tongue\u2014an almost impassible barrier thus exists between them.\n\nIs it to be wondered at that the French half-breed is restless and unsettled, that he looks with regret and longing on his old life which was one of freedom, plenty and ease, untrammelled by laws and remote from settlements.\n\nMany of them removed from Manitoba here after the troubles of 1870 in order to shake themselves free of the new order of things. They find soon a recurrence of the same state of affairs. The district is setting up, and I believe many of them to-day, if possible, would withdraw again from the advancing settlement.\n\nIt must be remembered that within the last few years the half-breeds have been compelled to change their mode of obtaining a livelihood. Not long ago buffalo hunting and trading with the Indians afforded them a sure and easy method of living in luxury. As the buffalo disappeared they naturally resorted to freighting. Supplies for the northern country and so far west as Edmonton came in to a large extent overland from Winnipeg, hundreds of miles distant. Freight was plentiful and prices high. The loss of the buffalo was not at the time severely felt. Freighting was second nature to them, and they did it wonderfully well. But with the advent of the railway into the territory the whole condition of things was changed. Freight which was hauled from Winnipeg in 1880 came from Brandon in 1881 and from Qd'Appelle, only 250 miles away, in 1882. In 1883 freight to and from Battleford and Edmonton ceased to pass over this route at all. With the railway came settlement along the line. Active competition for freight soon cropped out. The half-breeds then saw their means of living narrowing. All recognized that within a few years a branch railway into the district would cut it off entirely. As yet they had not seriously contemplated farming as a sole support. All had their small fields under cultivation, but only to furnish themselves with potatoes and a little coarse grain.\n\nIn 1884 the half-breeds were, comparatively speaking, prosperous, but were almost ruined by the rebellion. They had not even their little crop in 1885, and took but little of the freight offered. In 1886 the crops failed, so that in the spring of this year as a body they had grown despondent. The favorable season and magnificent crops of 1887 have greatly encouraged them. The results can be seen in the number of new houses erected, the repaired fences, old fields not under cultivation for some years ploughed ready for next season, and the amount of new \"breaking\" done.\n\nThe average under crop could have been much larger had not an unfortunate misunderstanding existed among them, as to the issue of seed grain. This was not known till the middle of May, when, through representations made to the Government, the conditions were so explained as to allay the fears of the half-breeds. The trouble arose through some half-breeds, who having accepted seed grain in Manitoba in 1874 and having been unable to repay it, stated that they had lost their farms, the mortgages given for the grain having been foreclosed. Before all were satisfied that these statements were incorrect the season was far advanced and precluded wheat from being sown. Several, however, took the coarse grains, oats and barley, and had good crops.\n\nThe French half-breeds are intelligent, law-abiding and energetic in work to which they have been accustomed. Farming they do not readily take to, and it will take some time before they can possibly become successful and experienced.\nfarmers. In the meantime they must compete with the competent and experienced white settlers, so that their present position is not an enviable one.\n\nEarly in May last a communication was reported to have been received from some of the refugee half-breeds in Montana U.S. It purported to warn the half-breeds that an invasion was imminent by American Indians, and that to protect their wives and families they should remove them to a place of safety. Much importance was attached to this, and some of the leading half-breeds requested that a strong force of police should be stationed at Batoche to protect them. They were satisfied shortly that such an invasion as they feared could hardly extend to this district, so remote from the boundary line. It is quite possible that the report circulated was the result of an authentic communication, the object of which was most apparent. The leaders of the refugees do not wish to allow themselves to be forgotten. They therefore write letters full of bombast, threats, and intentions purposely masked, which are calculated to irritate the recipients. The distance of the refugees, the instability of their position, and the possibility of assistance being rendered by American Indians all give color to the matter. An excitement is created which is undesirable and is added to by the great prominence given to such reports in the eastern press.\n\nTwice during the year reports of the foregoing nature have gained wide belief. They unquestionably do harm, which could be averted if it would be borne in mind that there is nothing to be feared in the district itself.\n\nThe undue prominence which the affairs of the half-breeds have been given in the eastern press and by politicians has caused many to view themselves as of considerable importance. Their doings and sayings often came back to them through the press in a magnified form, to which they attach an enlarged and fictitious value. They do not rightly estimate the large amount of sympathy extended to them and fail to recognize that those loudest in proclaiming their wrongs would perhaps be the last to substantially aid them.\n\nThe vexed half-breed question will solve itself before long. The moment the railway reaches this fertile district, a rapid settlement will ensue, and the question thus be settled.\n\nIt may not be generally known that the French half-breeds do not consider that the liberal issue of scrip which they have already received, nor that any issue on the same basis, be it ever so generous, will extinguish their original title to the territories which they claim to have held in common with the Indians.\n\nCRIME.\n\nIn the beginning of this report, I refer to the absence of crime in the district.\n\nAt Touchwood Butte, however, in the District of Assiniboia, a brutal murder was committed. The victim, Peter Smith, was residing about 20 miles north of Touchwood Agency, on the edge of the Salt Plains, and many miles distant from any habitation. He had been keeping a stopping-place during the winter, and was about leaving in the beginning of May, when he was murdered. His body was found by a freighter some days after the murder, in the vicinity of the house. The police were notified, who took charge of the body and asked for a coroner. The jury at the inquest returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown. As soon as information was received he was sent out to assist the detachment at Touchwood, in the search after the murderer. Suspicion fastened on an Indian boy, who was traced from his reserve in Touchwood to a reserve near Broadway, where he was arrested. The evidence, however, brought against him was not sufficient to convict.\n\nThe perpetrator of a crime such as this murder can only be discovered through fortunate circumstances. The isolation of Smith's house, the fact of the murder not being discovered for several days, and the apparent absence of motive other than robbery, tends to favor the escape of the felon.\nIn September a false report was circulated of a murder at Green Lake, which, on investigation by us, proved to be untrue.\n\nA glance at the return of cases tried in this district shows that all the offences are of a minor character.\n\nPATROLS.\n\nAs far as possible, every portion of the district has been frequently patrolled. Last winter the Indian reserves were visited, which required watching. Early in the spring the patrols were increased. A party passed over the mail route from Batoche to Touchwood every week.\n\nThe detachment stationed at Touchwood watched the trail north as far as the Salt Plains, and visited the Touchwood Agency reserve weekly.\n\nThe Batoche detachment furnished a weekly patrol to every portion of the French half-breed settlement, and frequently sent a patrol as far south as Vermillion Lakes or the Appel trail.\n\nThe detachment stationed at Saskatoon visited the Sioux reserve, twenty miles south-west of that place, every week, with the result of producing an excellent effect on the Indians. This outpost also visited Clark's Crossing and surrounding portions of the country very frequently.\n\nDuring the months of August and September the country along the South Saskatchewan, as far as Fish Creek, was patrolled by a strong detachment consisting of one officer and twenty men.\n\nThe winter patrols commenced this month, and will be kept up during the winter months.\n\nFrom Prince Albert, a fortnightly patrol to Carrot River and Fort \u00e0 la Corne, to Sturgeon Lake, Snake Plains, Murkog Lake and Carlton.\n\nFrom Batoche a fortnightly patrol to Carlton, Fish Creek and St. Louis de Langevin; from Saskatoon weekly to Sioux Reserve and Clark's Crossing; monthly to Telegraph Coulee.\n\nA glance at the map shows that this system ensures all the Indian reserves being visited and inhabited districts being patrolled.\n\nThe patrolling duty is important and of service in many ways. The police keep themselves posted on the general doings of the district, become accustomed to travelling over the topography of the country, and acquire much useful knowledge.\n\nIn addition to the work done by the patrols there is a large amount of travelling on duty of a special nature. Seldom a week passes but that one or two parties are despatched from this post. Parties are sent to Regina, Battleford, Saskatoon and other points not so distant, the round trip to the places named averaging from 200 miles to 550 miles.\n\nSupplies have to be furnished to the different detachments. Until lately oats were sent from here to Batoche and Saskatoon. During the winter, communication with Saskatoon is most difficult as there is no winter trail. A party of 2 men was delayed last winter by storms, and had to remain out all night, with the thermometer 50\u00b0 below zero, without food, tent or firewood. They had started in the morning with the intention of reaching a stopping-place 18 miles distant.\n\nThe winter duty, however, in this district is not as severe as a few years ago.\n\nA stopping-place can be reached every night and on the trail to the Railway Mail Stations are established at a day's drive apart.\n\nStill the work of the Police the year round is not without its dangers and difficulties. As in former days, trips have to be made in all seasons, in all kinds of weather and without regard to the state of the roads.\n\nRivers have to be crossed when rendered very dangerous by running ice or high water. Such work is done willingly by the Police, which entitles them to no little credit.\nSTRENGTH OF THE FORCE IN THE DISTRICT.\n\nAlthough I believe this district has nothing to fear from its Indian population, still it will be necessary, for some time to come, to maintain a strong force of Police here. The danger which exists is altogether from the possible trouble which the Southern and Western Indians might cause. An outbreak in that portion of the Territory would breed disquiet here and end, it is possible, in active insurrection if the troubles were prolonged, and a show of success rested at first with the rebels.\n\nEvery spring brings its imaginary Indian uprisings. To prevent alarm amongst the inhabitants a strong force must be in the district. Its presence tranquillizes the country, counteracts false rumors, and thus passively exerts a healthy influence in the development of the district.\n\nEmigrants will avoid a district where there is not sufficient force to suppress the most dangerous criminals and Indians which might occur.\n\nThe Mounted Police must therefore have the confidence of the public as an offensive and defensive force, if its full benefit is to be obtained. It does seem that, at times, this most important reason for the existence of the force is overlooked. If the North-West Territory had no Indian population, it would need no Mounted Police Force, for the necessary police duties, in the ordinary sense, would be carried out at a much less cost, by a few men carefully chosen for that purpose.\n\nThe Mounted Police are therefore required to act in a dual capacity. On the one side they must be prepared for instant and unexpected war, which they must fight to a successful issue. On the other they are to cover a huge country sparsely settled, with a boundary line 700 miles in extent, and thus prevent crime. If crime be committed, the criminals must be apprehended forthwith.\n\nThe liquor traffic must be stopped, although the mass of the people appear to be against the law, and in spite of the fact, that a prohibitory liquor law is most difficult to enforce in any country, even when approved and instituted by the majority of the people. Witness the working of the Scott Act in the counties of the old provinces.\n\nTo fulfil the first requirement we must be trained and disciplined; when we fail in the second, the time will be too late for the first.\n\nThe state of the country has changed materially since the advent of the Police. The Police in their dealings with the Indians in early years, had only their own safety to consider. They pursued the proper course, and dealt successfully with them, and in so doing rendered invaluable services to the people of Canada. Now the Police must consider the lives of the many unprotected women and children scattered throughout the country; they must consider the large investment in the cattle industry, and other things. Should they by any hasty action bring on the horrors of an Indian outbreak, they would indeed be guilty of an offence immeasurable in its gravity.\n\nQUARTERING OF THE DIVISION.\n\nLast winter, different rented buildings were occupied in the eastern portion of the town. The horses were kept in temporary stables. Early in May the division was placed under canvas. As the material of the stables was required by the Public Works Department to be used in the erection of the new stables, the horses were sent on herd during the day, and at night were tied up to the lines.\n\nThe succeeding months were very unpleasant, being wet and cold. Daily showers made camp life most undesirable.\n\nThe wet and cold weather was most prejudicial to the health of the horses, a large percentage being taken sick with colds.\n\nIn August, although the new barracks were not completed it was thought necessary that the horses should be placed in the stables which were ready for occupation.\n\nA few barrack rooms were finished so that it was possible to move. The new barracks were occupied on the 26th of August.\nNEW BARRACKS.\n\nThe new barracks at this place are situated on a commanding site south-west of the town and about one mile distant. The site appears to be most suitable. The drainage is excellent and a plentiful supply of water before the work has been obtained.\n\nThe buildings have been erected by the Public Works Department, who placed Mr. H. J. Peters, an architect of college experience, in charge. Mr. Peters commenced operations in February last. Actual building was not commenced till May.\n\nThe buildings which are now occupied and almost completed, are:\n\n- Barrack building, 159x28.\n- Officers' quarters, 35x24.\n- Extension kitchens, 20x21.\n- Extension kitchen to No. 2 quarters.\n- Guard room, 48x24.\n- Quarter Master's store, 60x30.\n- General store (erected of old material).\n- Stables, 75x30.\n- Wings to stables, 12x30.\n- Blacksmith shop, 24x24.\n- Latrines.\n\nBuildings commenced, but which require a large amount of work to complete:\n\n- Sergeant's mess, 50x26.\n- Extension kitchen, 16x28.\n- Sick stable, 60x28.\n- Artisan's workshop, 24x28.\n\nThe barracks when completed will accommodate:\n\n- 3 officers.\n- 85 non-commissioned officers and men.\n- 64 horses.\n\nIn carrying out the work no contracts have been let, but the labor has been directly employed.\n\nThe buildings have been erected in a careful manner; the foundations are well built, and all the work is of a very thorough description. The system of construction is well adapted to this cold climate.\n\nThe material used is of good quality, and in the case of the lumber the best that could be obtained. Only a small portion of the lumber used was seasoned, the rest being this year's cutting. Consequently, no matter how close the joints and how careful the work, the heat kept up in the winter causes the wood to shrink, the joints to open and the doors to warp.\n\nWhen all the buildings are completed the Prince Albert barracks will be found very comfortable, neat in appearance, and well suited for our purposes.\n\nTRAINING OF THE DIVISION.\n\nA regular course of training was commenced in the spring and completed as far as possible by every man in the division. The Mounted Infantry regulations were closely adhered to.\n\nA gun detachment was instructed and obtained a competent knowledge of their work.\n\nWith few exceptions, as will be seen by the target practice returns forwarded with this report, the Division completed its annual target practice with the Winchester carbine at the ordinary practice\u2014eight ranges from 100 yards to 500 yards. Very good scores were made. The average for the division is 52\u00bd per cent. A very decided improvement over the previous year is apparent. There are in the Division 10 good shots who would rank as first-class marksmen in the service.\nIn the mounted practice, advancing and retiring and firing dismounted at three ranges the scores made were fair. The tendency of all the men, however, was to sacrifice accuracy to quickness.\n\nThe revolver practice on foot at 20, 30 and 40 paces, was fair. With this arm much practice is needed and a larger number of rounds should be allowed for the annual practice.\n\nThe men also fired mounted with the revolver at dummies arranged much in the same manner as the heads and posts practice with the sword. Firing was done at the walk and at the gallop. This practice is a most valuable one, as it accustoms the men to judge the pace of the horse and aim accordingly, and the horses to the firing.\n\nIt is to be hoped that prizes and rewards will be given for good shooting, and that such an arrangement will be authorized.\n\nI would like to point out that the training of a division is carried on with difficulty; parties are coming in and going out; men must be sent away before a certain course of instruction can be completed. These continual changes render any great degree of perfection in drill impossible.\n\nEQUIPMENT.\n\nThe division is now well equipped in harness, saddlery and transport. Some additional buckboards are required, and two of the heavy wagons could be exchanged with advantage for the light half spring wagon. This wagon I consider the most serviceable one ever used in the force, and its adoption in place of a large number of the heavy wagons is most desirable.\n\nThe clothing, &c., supplied for issue is generally of good quality.\n\nCONDUCT.\n\nI am able to report this year a material decrease in the number of offences against discipline. There are 27 entries in the defaulters' sheets, against 49 last year. There have been only two serious cases, which merited severe punishment.\n\nThe total amount of fines imposed for the year is $54.25.\n\nAs an indication of the conduct of the Division I would call your attention to the large number of men who are depositing their pay in the Government Savings Bank. A total sum of $1,716 has been deposited, an increase of nearly $800 over last year. There are 32 depositors, which gives an average deposit of $55 for each.\n\nOne man only has deserted during the year. This man had been granted leave to visit the Eastern provinces, and did not return.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThere have been no serious cases in hospital during the year. The total number who have been in hospital is 16, and the average daily sick report, 3; the average number of men off duty, 4.\n\nForwarded with this report are the following returns:\u2014Cases disposed of during the year. Return of target practice, (not printed). Ground plan of barracks.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. BOWEN PERRY,\nSuperintendent Commanding \"F\" Division.\nAPPENDIX H.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT A. H. GRIESEBACH.\n\nN. W. M. POLICE, HEADQUARTERS \"Q\" DIVISION,\nFORT SASKATCHEWAN, N.W.T. 5th December, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit for your information my annual report for the year ended 30th November, 1887.\n\nINDIANS.\n\nDuring the past year the Indians in my district have behaved extremely well. One reserve, that on the south side of the Saskatchewan, opposite Edmonton, has, owing to the chief and headmen and some other members of the band taking scrip and leaving the treaty, been broken up, and the rest of the band removed to the Stoney Plains, on the north side of the river, lying north-west of Edmonton.\n\nIn the north the Bear Lake Indians, near Lac la Biche, were, so Inspector Piercy reports, much disappointed at not receiving treaty money this year. The payment of this band was stopped owing to their conduct during the rebellion.\n\nSo far as I have been able to ascertain, the Indians throughout my district have attended to their agricultural affairs with more industry than in previous years, and have been most attentive and respectful to their agents and instructors.\n\nAs to their crops, I am sorry to say that they were more or less injured by the early frost.\n\nI have taken steps to carry out the instructions contained in the general order recently received, regarding Indians away from their reserves and infesting settlements for immoral and other purposes.\n\nGenerally the Indians are in a better condition and more contented than at any previous period.\n\nCRIMES.\n\nDuring the past winter and early spring some cases of housebreaking and petty pilfering occurred, the perpetrators of which (Indians and half-breeds) were promptly arrested and dealt with according to law.\n\nIn August last it was reported to me that a murder had taken place at the Lesser Slave Lake. After communicating with you and receiving authority to incur the necessary expense, I despatched a party, consisting of two non-commissioned officers and one constable, to arrest the criminals. This they succeeded in doing, and the prisoners were committed by me, tried at the Supreme Court, and sentenced to six (6) years in the penitentiary. In connection with this arrest I have to report that Sergeant Davidson, the non-commissioned officer in charge of the party, showed excellent judgment in carrying out his instructions. The experience gained by this non-commissioned officer, in an entirely new sphere of action (the main part of the trip being performed in boats), will, no doubt, in the future be valuable to the force.\n\nEarly in the spring (a detective having been sent to my district), I was enabled to locate and seize two illicit whiskey stills, and also to convict certain persons of selling liquor.\n\nOn the 24th December, 1886, Inspector Snyder also succeeded in finding and destroying an illicit still, but found no person in the vicinity.\nOn this head I may mention that the law, as it now stands, under the permit system, is not a success, and it is most desirable from many points of view, which I do not consider it is in my province to enter into, that some radical change should take place at an early date; possibly the introduction of a high license liquor law, with proper safeguards would now best meet the case, and would be, in my opinion, more conducive to morality, good order and a better carrying out of the law, than under the present system.\n\nPATROLS.\n\nDuring the past year, owing to my division being principally employed in enlarging and repairing the barracks at Fort Saskatchewan, not so much patrolling was done in my district, neither did it so much required as in the previous years, the southern part of my district having permanent parties stationed at Red Deer and Peace River Hill, who, when travelling is possible, constantly on the move.\n\nEscort was furnished, under Inspector Casey, to bring in the annuity money from Red Deer in September.\n\nIndian Agent Lucas, of the Battle River agency, informed me that he did not require an escort; so after handing over to him the money for his agency, Inspector Casey, who had gone to Battle River, returned without attending the treaties.\n\nThe agent for the Edmonton district did not apply to me for an escort; so none was furnished.\n\nAgent Mitchell, of the Victoria district, applied for and was furnished with an escort under Inspector Piercy. This party left on the 29th September, and returned on the 18th October, after being exposed to very inclement weather, snow and rain storms being very prevalent.\n\nThe mail has been constantly escorted by the detachment detailed for that purpose.\n\nDRILL.\n\nThe division was put through a regular course of drill, early in the year, both mounted and on foot, the Edmonton detachment being brought in for this purpose.\n\nThis drill was carried on strictly in accordance with the regulations for mounted infantry, as per G.O. No. 22.\n\nTarget practice, mounted and dismounted, with both carbine and pistol, was also carried on, in accordance with the circular memorandum issued from headquarters.\n\nARMS.\n\nThe arms of the division are in fair order, but I have to remark that in my opinion the Winchester carbine is not suitable to the force, owing to the mechanism, which is too delicate and is constantly getting out of order, which in many cases necessitates the arms being sent to Regina. The sighting of many of the carbines is also defective, which prevents such a good average being shown in the target practice as would otherwise be the case.\n\nThe Enfield revolver, with which the whole of the Division is armed, appears to be a good, serviceable weapon.\n\nSADDLERY.\n\nThe saddlery of the division is in good order, but good numnahs are much required; these should be of the same felt as used in the Imperial service. The Division is well supplied with saddlers' tools.\n\nCLOTHING.\n\nIf it were possible that the whole of the clothing required for the Division could be delivered at one time, not later than the end of August in each year, it would not\nonly save money, but do away with a large amount of unnecessary work, and add to the comfort and contentment of the men.\n\nDESERCTIONS.\n\nI am glad to say that no desertions have taken place from the division, during the past year.\n\nHORSES.\n\nThe horses of the division are in good health. During the past year there was only one case of contagious disease, viz., glanders. The horse in question was promptly destroyed and every precaution taken to prevent the disease spreading.\n\nOne horse died from the effects of a fall through the ice in the Bow River, while on special duty.\n\nEight horses died from natural causes; some of these horses were employed during the rebellion, and were more or less injured at that time, from hard work and exposure. Owing to these causes, fifteen remounts (saddle horses) will be required early in the spring.\n\nTRANSPORT.\n\nThe transport of the division is not so complete as it should be, four heavy wagons being still required. Three new ones were received a short time ago, known as the Minchin wagon, which, so far as I have had opportunity to judge, appears to be a good suitable and serviceable wagon.\n\nFORAGE.\n\nOats have been furnished for the current year at a cheaper rate than ever before, and are of a good quality.\n\nHay is very fair, but owing to the dry season, was very scarce, and dearer than in former years; the enforcement of the hay dues also added to the price.\n\nHARNESSES.\n\nThe harness of the division is generally in good condition, although some of it is not suitable for heavy work, and would not have been used for such work had heavy harness been available. It will be necessary to condemn two sets, and four sets of heavy harness are required to complete.\n\nQUARTERS.\n\nAt Fort Saskatchewan great improvements have been made, the following buildings having been erected or rebuilt, viz.:\n\n- Recreation and mess room, 50 by 25 feet.\n- Troop kitchen, 26 by 23 feet.\n- 20 feet added to sergeants' quarters, now 50 by 18 feet.\n- Saddlers' shop and harness room, 28 by 18 feet.\n- Guard room and lavatory, 50 by 18 feet.\n- Store, 24 by 16 feet.\n- Carpenters' shop and oat store, 32 by 22 feet.\n- Slick stable, 40 by 16 feet.\n\nThe square has also been levelled, all buildings mudded and white washed. These improvements have added not only to the comfort of the men, but also to the appearance of the barracks.\n\nI append herewith a plan of the barracks as they are now.\nDISCIPLINE.\n\nThe conduct of the division during the past year has been excellent, very little crime being recorded against the old men of the division.\n\nOn the barrack improvements the men worked with a will, doing all in their power to assist me in making the necessary improvements.\n\nGenerally I have been well seconded by both officers, non-commissioned officers, and men in carrying out the various duties required in my district.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. H. GREISBACH, Supt.\nCommanding \"G\" Division.\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT A. R. MACDONELL, 1887.\n\nLETHBRIDGE, 6th December, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit this, my annual report for the year ended 30th November, 1887.\n\nDuring the winter of 1886-87 I was on leave in the east. Having previous to leaving handed over the command of the division to Inspector J. Howe, I cannot speak too highly of the very satisfactory manner in which this officer discharged his duties while in command. During the winter months he drilled the men thoroughly in the detail as laid down in the manual for mounted infantry.\n\nThe horses were exercised daily, and when not too cold mounted drill was carried on.\n\nI may mention here that the various articles asked for in the last annual report, required to equip the division, have been supplied.\n\nSuperintendent Cotton being in command of the Battleford District, will, of course, report on the work performed in the district.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I marched out from Battleford with \"K\" Division on the afternoon of the 18th May\u2014destination Macleod District, taking the trail previously passed over by \"C\" and \"D\" Division, viz., via Sounding Lake and the Marquis Crossing of the Red Deer River. The following is the marching out state:\n\n| Item                        | Number |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Officers                    | 5      |\n| Non-commissioned officers   |        |\n| and constables              | 62     |\n| Saddle horses               | 18     |\n| Team do                     | 30     |\n| Heavy waggons               | 13     |\n| Light do                    | 2      |\n\nTwo divisions having marched over the route so recently and reported on it, I will merely state that I found it to be a good trail, the feed good, the supply of water excellent and abundant.\n\nAs all the waggons were heavily loaded, and not having any spare horses, I made short marches for the first few days, gradually increasing.\n\nI took wood at Battleford to do until I reached Sounding Lake, where I laid over one day (24th). The feed there being exceptionally good and plenty of water I thought it advisable to give the horses a rest. I here redistributed the loads according to the weights of the several teams.\n\nHaving taken in sufficient wood, I resumed the march on the morning of the 25th. Reaching the Red Deer Crossing at four p.m. of the 27th, crossing at once as the water was rising rapidly, and camped on the opposite side. Inspecting Superintendent W. M. Herchmer, had arrived at the crossing the previous evening. Inspected the Division and spoke very favorably of the men and condition of the horses.\n\nI here found as I had previously been advised, a supply of rations and forage.\n\nAs you are aware the hill here is very difficult to climb, however, I got up in splendid style (doubling the teams), making the ascent in less than an hour after breaking camp. I reached the Blackfoot Crossing at 6:30 p.m. of the 29th.\n\nThe following morning I unloaded, taking all the waggons apart, using a small\nboat I found there. The river was booming deep, the current very rapid; at 4 p.m., the Division was comfortably camped on the other side, the horses having swam over. Perfect discipline was maintained, consequently, everything went on like clock work, not a single hitch happening, all ranks worked with a will.\n\nBroke camp the next morning. On Tuesday, 2nd June, arrived at the Old Man's River (opposite Macleod); the river was not fordable and there being no scow there, camped, reporting to the officer commanding Macleod district.\n\nThe care of all horses was all that could be desired, men at all times prompt when assistance would be required in passing over creeks or other impediments. On the following day, the 3rd, the Division was inspected by Superintendent Neale.\n\nThe following is the marching in state:\n\nOfficers...........................................................................................................5\nNon-commissioned officers and constables......................................................62\nSaddle horses.................................................................................................18\nTeam do........................................................................................................29\ndo \"C\" Division attached..............................................................................3\nHeavy waggons.............................................................................................13\nLight do.........................................................................................................2\n\nOn the 6th June, in accordance with instructions received from Superintendent Neale, I handed over to Veterinary Surgeon Riddell seven east horses of \"K\" Division and two attached to \"K\" from \"C\" Division.\n\nReceiving from Superintendent Neale fifteen horses (broken), from \"E\" Division five, and two remounts, making the total strength when leaving Macleod for Lethbridge, sixty-three horses. On the same date, I handed over the command of the Division to Inspector Howe, having obtained a short leave to attend to private business.\n\nOn the 7th, the division took the line of march for Lethbridge, camped opposite the town on the 9th, on the 11th the division moved into barracks at Lethbridge.\n\nThe marching in state was as follows:\n\nOfficers...........................................................................................................2\nNon-commissioned officers and constables......................................................61\nHorses, \"K\" Division....................................................................................62\n\" \"C\" Division attached..............................................................................1\nHeavy waggons.............................................................................................13\nLight do.........................................................................................................2\n\nPrevious to the departure of \"D\" Division, I took over from that Division nine heavy waggons, one spring waggon (only fit for use about post) and two backboards, one unserviceable; shortly after I handed over to \"D\" Division four heavy waggons, and later on transferred four heavy waggons to \"H\" Division as directed by you.\n\nOn the 11th, men of \"K\" Division left Lethbridge to relieve detachments that had been furnished by \"D\" Division along the frontier.\n\nIn all four detachments:\n\nAt Kipp, 2 men, 2 horses,\n\"Milk River Ridge,\" 8 \" 8 \"\n\"Writing Stone,\" 8 \" 8 \"\n\"Pen-d'Oreille,\" 8 \" 11 \"\n\nTwo officers were stationed with these detachments.\n\nI have much pleasure in reporting that all ranks performed their duties while on frontier service faithfully. All these detachments were inspected by the Assistant Commissioner, who on arriving at this post, spoke most favorably, both as to the appearance of the men and condition of the several camps.\n\nJuly 6th, seventy miners arrived; having been brought in to replace a number that had been discharged.\nSerious trouble being feared in consequence of these men insisting on the discharged men being re-engaged, by order of the officer commanding the district, I placed an officer's guard on the premises to protect those who were willing to work as well as the machinery in connection with the mines and railway shop. I may mention here that many of these strikers were hourly at the Orderly Room, doubtless anxious to find out what action the Police would take under certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, I told them in unmistakable language what my action would be in the event of the slightest breach of peace.\n\nThis afternoon a prairie fire broke out a few miles south-east of the barracks; all available men turned out at once; they succeeded in putting it out. Thirty-one non-commissioned officers and men arrived from Macleod for duty at the mines.\n\nOn the 11th Inspector Wattam with 24 men of \"E\" Division arrived from Macleod at 6 p.m., and left on the 15th.\n\nOn the night of the 30th August I received a telegram from the officer commanding the district to send at once to join him, en route to Blackfoot Crossing, three non-commissioned officers and twenty-three constables. They left in the midst of a terrible rain storm.\n\nThey returned on the 12th September.\n\nAbout noon of the 12th September, just after the contractor's men had left the corral where they had been stacking hay on the police contract, one of the stacks (36 tons) was discovered to be on fire. There were three stacks in at the time, about 170 tons. The stack between the one on fire and the others, was not over twenty feet. The men turned out promptly and succeeded in confining the fire to the stack in which it originated. Considering the very poor appliances here for an emergency of this kind, they deserve a great deal of credit, for the manner in which they worked; at 2 p.m. the fire was completely extinguished. I left a strong guard at the place until daylight. Loss about fifty-six tons.\n\nOn the night of November the 7th, I received a telegram from the officer commanding the district, directing me to have a party consisting of one officer and twenty men to meet him at Stand Oil and to be there so that this party would join him at 6 a.m. next morning at the post, at midnight sharp. They were well mounted and fully equipped; Inspector Howe then took command. The time of departure was well timed and the junction with the detachment of \"H\" Division made at the time named, thereby enabling Superintendent Neale to effect the important arrest that necessitated the calling out of so strong a party.\n\nInspector Howe on this as on all other occasions acquitted himself in a most creditable manner.\n\nOn the 29th November Milk River Ridge detachment (the other having been called in before), was brought into the Post. In accordance with instructions received, I have had distributed along the line of detachments seven tons of hay. I have also a small quantity of oats cached, so as to enable me to send out (weather permitting) patroling parties. In connection with the regular patrol, men scouted daily in the vicinity of each detachment.\n\nI find that the distance between Pen-d'Oreille detachment and the western out post of \"A\" Division is very trying both to men and horses (50 miles). I would recommend that next season a few men should be camped say about half way.\n\nI strongly recommend that some sort of a felt hat should be adopted for prairie use.\n\nBARRACK BUILDINGS.\n\nA new stable has been erected, also an addition has been put to the Q. M. store.\n\nThe several additions and alterations now being done will add materially to the comfort of the men. A hospital, an orderly and recreation rooms are very much required.\n\nA fence of some description is very much needed about the barracks, as it is almost impossible to keep cattle from collecting (particularly in cold weather) about the stable and hay corral.\nPROTECTION AGAINST FIRE.\n\nI cannot too strongly lay before you the urgent necessity of having a well sunk here.\n\nTARGET PRACTICE.\n\nThe men of the Division have been put through a course of rifle practice, as far as circumstances and weather would permit. I am in hopes that the weather will permit my finishing the course.\n\nDESERTIONS.\n\nReg No. 1826, Constable E. F. Robinson, deserted on the night of the 16th of August from this post, and was recaptured a few miles this side of the line by men from the Milk River Ridge detachment.\n\nReg. No. 1887, Constable C. C. Wilson, deserted on the 2nd October, while out exercising a Broncho.\n\nReg. No. 1575, Constable L. Flannery deserted on the 2nd October, while returning from Kipp Coulee Detachment, having been sent there on the previous day with a dispatch.\n\nTRANSPORT.\n\nThere are at the present time:\n\n- 14 heavy waggons,\n- 4 spring do\n- 3 buckboards\n\nin the division, one of the spring waggons being only good for use around the post, and one buckboard is useless.\n\nI shall require 4 new buckboards by the time the frontier work opens up in the spring.\n\nBARRACK ROOM FURNITURE.\n\nSuitable cots for use in barrack rooms, are very much required, they would add much to the comfort of the men and materially improve the appearance of the rooms.\n\nSADDLES AND HARNESS.\n\nI have at the present time 61 saddles on my books, one of which has been lost with a horse, the 60 remaining are in good condition. I shall require 5 more to complete my division.\n\nThe harness is in good condition, with the exception of the collars, which require renewing. I have a sufficient number of sets for the use of my division, with the exception of lead harness, of which I require two more sets.\n\nHORSES.\n\nThe total strength of the horses in the division is 101 composed of 33 team and 68 saddle.\n\nThe horses are in good condition after the season's work; a few may require to be cast during the coming year.\n\nARMS.\n\nThe division is fully equipped and they are in a serviceable condition.\n\nNUMNAHS.\n\nThere are at the present time 61 numnahs in the division, and they are fast wearing out.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. R. MACDONELL,\nSuperintendent Commanding \"K\" Division.\nAPPENDIX J.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT E. W. JARVIS, 1887.\n\nREGINA, 30th November, 1887.\n\nSir.\u2014I have the honour to submit the following report on \"B\" Division for the year ending today.\n\nThe headquarters of the division was at Regina during the winter performing the usual routine of duties and fatigues, and attending occasional drills and rides under the supervision of the acting adjutant.\n\nDuring January and February the weather was very cold and many of the men suffered severely from the want of buffalo or other warm winter coats.\n\nI went out to Wood Mountain in the middle of March and inspected the detachment which had wintered there and at Willow Bunch, and in April Inspector McGibbon visited the detachments at Carlyle and Alameda; in all cases the results of the inspections were satisfactory.\n\nOn 13th May the division was ordered to march out, and on that day Inspector McGibbon started with the detachments for the Moose Mountain district. The next morning Inspector Drayner left with the headquarters of the division for Wood Mountain, and a sergeant with five constables started for Langenburg, a new outpost at the end of the track of the Manitoba and North-Western Railway. For several days in succession heavy rain and snow had fallen, the roads became very bad and several parties were delayed on the march. The horses also suffered a good deal on leaving their warm stables.\n\nOn the departure of the division I remained for some time at Regina in command of the post during your absence in the west.\n\nPATROLS.\n\nPatrols were established in the Moose Mountain and Wood Mountain districts on the same routes and of about the same strength as last year, with the exception of the western patrol (which connects with \"A\" Division) which was extended fifteen miles further west, thus making the distance covered in these two districts about 350 miles from one end to the other. The division being so much under strength, this entailed very heavy work on both men and horses.\n\nAt various times food parties were sent out each week, and once a month a party was sent up the Assiniboine River to visit Fort Pelly and the Indian reserves in that vicinity. This party sometimes returned by way of the York Colony and other settlements in that section of the country.\n\nAn outpost and store-camp was established sixty miles from Regina, on the trail to Wood Mountain. To this point oats and some of the supplies for the division were brought by freighters, and there transferred to our own teams, to be hauled seventy-five miles to Wood Mountain Post. But I suggest that in future this arrangement be discontinued and the supplies delivered at the post by the freighters, thus reserving police teams for work on the patrols.\n\nAll these patrols were kept up until the division reassembled at Regina on the 20th of this month.\n\nINDIANS.\n\nThe following work has been done at the request of the Indian Department. At the end of April a sergeant and nine constables were sent to Buffalo Lake, north...\nof Moose Jaw, to intercept and turn back some Indians who were reported to have left Piapot's Reserve and to have gone in that direction.\n\nInspector McGibbon and his command while on the way to their outposts, were stopped at Carlyle to cause nine families of Indians who had left the reserve at Crooked Lakes to return there. All the trails near Moose Mountain were watched and both reserves on the mountain visited by Inspector McGibbon himself. Only one small party of Indians was found, and they turned out to be Sioux from the Oak Lake Reserve. After five days' search Inspector McGibbon re-assembled his men and marched south.\n\nAt the end of October I went to the boundary line crossing of Frenchman's Creek with an escort of twenty non-commissioned officers and constables, to receive from the United States authorities a band of fifty Cree Indians, and to take them to Swift Current. I waited until the 6th November, and as the Indians did not arrive I returned to Wood Mountain Post. I subsequently learned that a band of Crees is camped on Frenchman's Creek about twenty-five miles south of the boundary line, and that they intend to winter there.\n\nA few Sioux Indians, from the neighbourhood of Moose Jaw, camped at Wood Mountain and at Willow Bunch at different times during the summer. They were quiet and gave no trouble whatever.\n\nMURDER OF McLEISH.\n\nA special report has been made to you on the work done at Crooked Lakes Reserve from 4th to 15th June by the party under my command while searching for the murderers of Hector McLeish. As none of the men of \"B\" Division were concerned there, I only refer to the matters and pass on to the part they took in the pursuit.\n\nIt was reported that the murderers had made their escape by way of Moose Mountain southward and the whole of Inspector McGibbon's detachment were turned out to search that part of the country; while two special patrols from Wood Mountain under Inspector Drayner scoured the country along the boundary line as far as Deloraine, and one of these parties went south to the Turtle Mountain District, but without success. These patrols were re-called at the end of June.\n\nINSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT.\n\nI left Regina on the 19th June for Wood Mountain Post, and from there proceeded to Willow Bunch, Wood End, Rosecris and Carlyle. I then went via Moosomin to Langenburg and returned by the way of Fort Qu'Appelle to Regina, where I arrived on 16th July, having travelled a total distance of 750 miles. On this trip I made odometer measurements of all distances travelled, thus determining the amount of ground covered by each patrol.\n\nI made a careful inspection of the various detachments, and everything\u2014with the exception of some deficiencies of kit\u2014was very satisfactory. There were no complaints among the settlers against any of our men.\n\nThe district was visited, and the detachments inspected, by the Assistant Commissioner, who arrived at Wood Mountain on the 2nd October and started west on the 5th.\n\nHORSES.\n\nVeterinary Surgeon Riddell came to Wood Mountain at the end of June and selected from the band of the Home Land and Cattle Company forty horses for the use of the force. He inspected four horses belonging to settlers and finding them affected with glanders, ordered them to be destroyed. This was done by their owners.\nThe remainder of the Home Land and Cattle Company's horses were sold in Regina, and their band is practically broken up.\n\nSeveral small bands of ponies were imported by traders and others, and paid duty at Wood Mountain Post.\n\nCATTLE.\n\nThe severity of last winter, with the frequency of the storms, caused great loss among the cattle wintering at Wood Mountain.\n\nBUILDINGS.\n\nA frame building 50 feet by 18 feet has been erected at Wood Mountain for the use of the detachment wintering there. A log stable, 50 feet by 16 feet, has also been built. The buildings are located three hundred yards south-east of the old post, and on higher ground.\n\nAt Wood End camp the men of Inspector McGibbon's detachment put up two sod houses\u2014one, 30 feet by 18 feet, for a barrack room, and a smaller one for officers' quarters. There was no expense to the Government, except for doors, windows and hardware.\n\nTARGET PRACTICE.\n\nTarget practice with carbine and pistol was carried on at intervals during the summer, until everyone had gone through the course. A special report is being made on the Winchester carbine, so that its imperfections and unsuitability to police requirements need not be enlarged upon here.\n\nHEALTH OF THE DIVISION.\n\nThe health of both men and horses was fairly good during the year, until the month of October, when an outbreak of typho-malarial fever occurred at Wood Mountain Post. The low marshy situation, and the rotten state of the old log buildings, conduced largely to this. The new location, as already mentioned, is higher and drier, and presumably more healthy. The old buildings should be destroyed forthwith. All the invalids are convalescent, with the exception of one constable, who is still in hospital here.\n\nWINTER DETACHMENTS.\n\nThe following is a detail of non-commissioned officers, men and horses remaining on outpost duty for the coming winter:\n\n| N. C. O. | Constables | Horses | Remarks |\n|----------|------------|--------|---------|\n| Wood Mountain | 1 | 5 | 7 | Also 2 special constables with 4 ponies. |\n| Willow Ranch | 1 | 3 | 4 | |\n| Carlyle | 1 | 2 | 3 | |\n| Alameda | 1 | 2 | 2 | |\n| Broadview | 1 | 1 | 2 | |\n| Coal Mine | 1 | 1 | 2 | |\n| Langenburg | 1 | 5 | 7 | Qu'Appelle Station, Broadview. |\n| C. P. Ry | 1 | 1 | 2 | |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\nSAVINGS BANK.\n\nThe amount deposited during the year reaches the gratifying total of $3,209.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to make the following recommendations:\n\nA well is needed at the new Wood Mountain Post, both for convenience and health, but principally the latter; the creek water being much contaminated. A storehouse and blacksmith shop are also much wanted; the old ones have been patched up for this winter, but they will not serve another year. An expenditure of $2,000 would make the post complete.\n\nA hut and small stable should be built at Willow Bunch. Estimated cost, $400.\n\nA police post, with stable, should be built at Langenburg or Churchbridge; the latter place, to which the Manitoba and North-Western Railway will extend this year, is preferable. The estimated cost could be $800.\n\nThe buildings at Wood End are well located and though only of sods, they will last for some years. There is, however, no title to the land, and a quarter section, embracing the bend of the river as now occupied, should be reserved. There is good pasturage, wood and water here in plenty. I therefore beg to recommend that the south-west \u00bc of Section 15, Township 1, Range 8, west of 2nd Meridian, be taken as a reserve for police purposes, and as the country is beginning to be settled in this vicinity, this should be reserved at once.\n\nIn forwarding you the proceedings of a board of enquiry about the grey greatcoats now in use, I suggested that an oil coat or \"slicker\" should be issued, the present coat offering very little protection against rain. I also beg to repeat my suggestion that a prairie suit, with proper and serviceable head-dress, be issued for use by men.\n\nWith regard to the issue of uniform, I would most strongly urge that issues of complete kit due, should be made only annually, or at most, semi-annually; and that men joining in the interim, should only receive sufficient clothing to last them until the next issue comes due. I also beg to recommend that the stable suit be made a part of the free issue.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. W. JARVIS,\nSuperintendent, Commanding \"B\" Division.\n\nThe Commissioner\nNorth-West Mounted Police,\nRegina.\nAPPENDIX K.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF INSPECTOR T. WATTAM, 1887.\n\nNORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE,\nCALGARY, 1st December, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to forward the annual report of \"E\" Division for the year ended the 30th November, 1887, together with a return of cases tried at Calgary and Banff for the twelve months ended the 30th ult., and the estimates for the coming year. I beg to request that you will forward the same to the Commissioner.\n\nAssistant Surgeon Pard has not yet completed his medical report for the past twelve months; when finished I will forward same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. WATTAM,\nInspector, \"E\" Division.\n\nThe Officer Commanding\n\"E\" Division, Calgary.\n\nNORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE,\nCALGARY, 30th November, 1887.\n\nSir.\u2014I have the honor to forward the annual report of \"E\" Division for the twelve months ended the 30th November, 1887.\n\nAs I have only been in temporary command of the division from the 21st of July last to the 3rd October in the absence of Superintendent Antrobus, who went on sick leave on the former, and Superintendent Gagnon, who took over command of the division on the latter date, the records of the official diary and reports left by Superintendent Antrobus will have to be my guide in compiling this report.\n\nPATROLS AND DETACHMENTS.\n\nA great deal of patrol work has been done by the men of this division during the past year, the whole of this district having been thoroughly patrolled,\u2014\nSouth as far as Mosquito Creek and the Little Bow.\nNorth as far as Little Red Deer and the Rosebud Creek.\nWest to the foot hills of the Rockies and Ghost River.\nEast to Crowfoot Creek, Sand Hills and Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nAll settlements within the above boundaries have been thoroughly patrolled from April last up to the present time by the permanent detachments and parties from this post, duplicate copies of detachment and patrol reports being forwarded to headquarters for your information at the end of each month.\n\nThere are at present four permanent detachments stationed at the following places:\u2014\nBanff\u2014Inspector Constantine, 14 non-commissioned officers and men and 8 horses at Banff, 50 miles west of Calgary on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This detachment also finds an outpost at the anthracite mines.\nGleichen.\u2014Sergeant Jarvis, 1 corporal and 9 constables and 10 horses at Gleichen, close to the Blackfoot Reserve and 55 miles east of Calgary, on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This detachment finds patrols to the Rosebud Creek, 40 miles north, Crowfoot Creek, 30 miles, High River Blackfoot Reserve to the east and south. All ranchers and settlers 25 miles to the west.\n\nHigh River.\u2014Sergeant Barker, 4 constables and 6 horses at Pekisko, the forks of High River, 60 miles south-west of Calgary. This detachment finds patrols to Mosquito Creek to the south, Sheep Creek to the north and settlers and ranchers east and west of their post.\n\nScarlett's.\u2014Corporal Main, 1 constable and 2 horses at Scarlett's stopping-place, 40 miles north of Calgary on the Edmonton trail. This detachment patrols the district they are in and escorts the mail when required.\n\nA party left here under my command on the 21st May last for Fort Macleod, consisting of 34 non-commissioned officers and men, 38 horses and 4 heavy waggons to carry camp equipage, baggage, &c. I arrived there on the 25th instant. My orders on leaving Calgary were to report to the officer commanding at Fort Macleod and afterwards to relieve the \"D\" Division outposts, that division being under orders for British Columbia.\n\nOn account of the rivers being impassable between Macleod and Lethbridge, the snow being carried away at Kipp, I received fresh orders from Superintendent Neale to take my party and patrol the Blood Reserve, which was done until the 8th of July when I received orders from the same officer to take my command to Lethbridge and relieve a detachment of \"H\" Division, also to furnish a guard of 12 non-commissioned officers and men, in conjunction with \"K\" Division, on the Galt mines.\n\nOn the 14th July you inspected my command, and the Galt difficulty being over, I received orders from you to strike camp the following day and proceed to Calgary, where we arrived on the 20th July.\n\nI reported fully all work done by my command whilst in Macleod District to Superintendent Neale, the officer commanding that district.\n\nA serious accident happened to Regimental No. 1231, Constable T. Dowling, at Lethbridge on the morning of the 15th of July, being thrown from his horse whilst on herd, sustaining a fracture of the clavicle. This constable was left in hospital at Lethbridge.\n\nThe map already forwarded you will show the correct routes taken by patrols from this division.\n\nGENERAL WORN, ETC.\n\nA serious fire took place in barracks at this post on the night of the 20th March last, by which two barrack rooms, kitchen and mess room were burnt to the ground.\n\nAn investigation was held by Superintendent Antrobus and a full report of the proceedings forwarded to you.\n\nOn the 13th of July a man named Swanson was found dead in the Cascade River between Anthracite and Banff, supposed to have been murdered. This affair was investigated by Inspector Constantine and a special report forwarded to you.\n\nOn the 5th August last the men at this post rendered great assistance in putting out a fire in the town of Calgary, for which they received the thanks of the Mayor and Council.\n\nOn Wednesday the 24th of August one J. Thompson, a settler from the mouth of High River came into barracks and gave himself up for shooting a Blackfoot Indian named \"Trembling Man.\" On the same date, one G. Madge, a settler on the Bow River reported that his house had been broken into by Indians and certain articles stolen therefrom. Corporal Racey and five constables were immediately sent out in pursuit and captured the Indian \"Deerfoot,\" who afterwards escaped. Special reports of both these affairs were sent to headquarters for your information.\n\nOn the 5th of September, a large party consisting of fifty officers, non-commissioned officers and men left for the Blackfoot Crossing to search the reserve for Deer-\nfoot, returning to Calgary on the 9th inst. A special report has already been sent you by the Assistant Commissioner upon the result of this duty.\n\nOn the 6th October, I accompanied the Coroner and Dr. Lindsay to Gleichen to enquire into the cause of death, and to hold an inquest if found necessary on the remains of one G. Batterworth who was accidentally killed by being thrown from a horse and dragged some distance on the evening of the 5th inst. The coroner and doctor, after viewing the remains and hearing the evidence, did not think an inquest necessary. I forwarded you a full report of my enquiries, also a copy of the evidence taken before the coroner.\n\nOn the 20th of October, Superintendent Gagnon received information and was shown by A. Flynn, night agent, Canadian Pacific Railway, at this place, one of our transport requisitions signed by Superintendent Gagnon's name, which signature proved to be a forgery. He immediately took steps in the matter and on the 21st and 22nd instants the following men were arrested as being implicated in the forgery\u2014Farrell, J. McGregor, E. W. Carroll, J. McDougal and J. Metcalfe. These men were committed for trial and brought before the court commencing the 10th of November, Judge Wetmore presiding. Farrell was found guilty and sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment with hard labor. The remainder were acquitted.\n\nBreaches of the liquor law still continue in this district notwithstanding the efforts to suppress the same. A large amount has been collected in fines and hundreds of gallons of whiskey seized and spilled during the last twelve months.\n\nYou will see by the schedule of cases which accompany this report that the greater part of the cases have been appealed.\n\nGreat assistance has been rendered to settlers in the suppression of prairie fires, men turning out at a moment's notice.\n\nEvery assistance has been given to the Indian Department, escorts being furnished for treaty payments on the reserves in this district; also to take treaty money north for Edmonton Indians. The payments went off quietly, no disturbance of any kind occurring. Two Indians have been convicted during the year for being drunk and having liquor in their possession, one a Blood, the other a Blackfoot Indian.\n\nOne other Blackfoot, \"The Meat,\" was tried and acquitted on a charge of feloniously wounding.\n\nA great deal of petty thieving has been done by Indians around the outlying settlements, and unless we are allowed to punish them when rambling off their reserves, it will still continue.\n\nDRILL.\n\nI put the Division through a thorough course of both mounted and dismounted drill in March and April last.\n\nMusketry.\u2014Each member of the Division has fired at the various ranges with carbine and revolver, according to orders issued from headquarters. 30 rounds more Winchester and 24 revolver should be allowed each man during the annual course, as I consider the present allowance not sufficient to make a man a good shot.\n\nARMS.\n\nThe arms and accoutrements of this Division are in good order, with the exception of sergeants' cross-belts, glasses and pouches. I would suggest that six more be furnished as soon as possible.\n\nHORSES.\n\nThe horses of this Division are in fair condition considering the amount of patrol work done this year. No deaths have occurred at this post during the past 12 months.\nHARNES.\n\nThere are at present in possession of the Division\u2014\n\n10 sets of wheel.\n3 \" lead.\n3 \" single.\n\nI would suggest that three more heavy sets be sent to replace the same number worn out.\n\nSome of the harness at this post has been in wear over six years.\n\nTRANSPORT.\n\nThe transport is in very good order. There are\u2014\n\n7 heavy wagons.\n5 spring\n2 double buckboards.\n2 single.\n\nAt present in the division. This includes those with the detachments.\n\nThree more heavy wagons are required, as we have not sufficient to do the work of the post and district.\n\nSADDLERY.\n\nSeveral of the saddles need replacing, being worn out and past repairing.\n\nThe numnahs also need replacing badly, nearly all being worn out.\n\nI would recommend that the next ones issued be made of brown Army felt, this with two thicknesses of blanket protecting the horse's backs thoroughly on the longest trip, having proved the same on several occasions, especially last Spring, when, with 35 mounted men riding on an average of thirty miles a day for nine weeks, not one had a sore back.\n\nCLOTHING.\n\nMen are fairly supplied.\n\nHEALTH OF MEN.\n\nThe health of the division during the past twelve months has been very good; with the exception of one or two slight accidents and sickness, has been far below the average.\n\nCRIME.\n\nThere has been very little crime in the division during the past year, the conduct of the men being very good.\n\nDISCIPLINE.\n\nConsidering the various kinds of work the men are called upon to do, and their absence on detachment and patrol duties for weeks and months at a time, a high state of discipline has been maintained.\n\nBUILDINGS AND BARRACK FURNITURE.\n\nNew barrack accommodation is badly needed here. Since the fire the men have to eat the meals where the food is cooked. There is no recreation room, consequently their men have to amuse themselves the best way they can in their barrack rooms. The latter would make very good workshops, but are scarcely fit for men to live in.\n\nWhen the new barracks are built I would beg leave to make the same suggestion that many other officers of the force have been making for years, namely, that the men be provided with proper iron cots, and that the barrack-room tables and forms have iron trestles and legs. Their cost would be made up in a very short\ntime, as it takes some thousands of feet of lumber yearly to keep up the present make-shift boards and trestles.\n\nThe old stables have been greatly improved by clap-boarding them on the outside, making them very comfortable for the winter.\n\nThe barracks have also been greatly improved in appearance by the addition of a post rail and wire fence.\n\nA new hospital and single officers' quarters are also badly needed here.\n\nI enclose a return of cases tried at Calgary and Banff for the twelve months ending the 30th November, 1887, and the estimates for the coming year.\n\nI also forward a distribution state of the division for the 30th November, 1887.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

REPORT OF SENIOR SURGEON JUKES, 1887.\n\nREGINA, N.W.T., 30th December, 1887,\nCompleted 7th January, 1888.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to place in your hands my annual report as senior medical officer of this force for the year expiring 30th November, 1887. I regret that its completion should have been so long delayed, but this has been unavoidable, partly owing to the large number of documents, returns and other official work which has accumulated during my recent absence at Ottawa, which demanded immediate attention, and partly to the late arrival of the annual reports from Assistant Surgeons at some of the outposts.\n\nMy report for the year now expiring must be less satisfactory than I could have desired; because, during that period no opportunity has been afforded me for visiting and inspecting outposts, my knowledge of what has taken place there having been confined, during the last twelve months, to such information for the most part as could be gathered from the monthly sick returns. The demands made upon headquarters medical supply for medical stores, and the sick sent down from various outposts, either for treatment or to be invalided, whose names appear in the annual report of sick from Regina, the large number of cases appearing thereon, and the severity and duration of many of them, must not, therefore, be regarded as indicating anything specially unhealthy in the establishment at Regina, which, in this respect, compares favorably with any other post in the Territories, but to a combination of causes which, under existing conditions, combine to swell the number and duration of cases of disease or injury appearing upon the annual sick report from headquarters, a few of which may be here cited in order that these causes may be better understood.\n\nTo begin with, it must be remembered that all new recruits are admitted first at Regina, where they are posted for a longer or shorter period, to become familiar with their drill and special duties before being transmitted as competent policemen to the outposts. Many of these are young men hitherto unaccustomed to work of any kind, and entirely ignorant of riding, or of the handling, grooming and management of horses, a fact which these animals are remarkably quick in appreciating. The ordinary routine work, though not exceptionally severe, is always hardest to a new recruit, hitherto unaccustomed to drill and discipline; added to which almost every newcomer on his arrival in the Territories, suffers to a greater or less extent from relaxation of the bowels, frequently amounting to diarrhoea, dependent mainly upon the alkaline salts found almost universally in all water everywhere except near the mountains. This, though ordinarily amounting to only a temporary inconvenience, not unfrequently continues for many days and occasionally even for weeks, during which period they often present themselves for medical advice at headquarters, their names appearing more or less frequently upon the daily sick reports from which the annual report is compiled. Many of those who are unaccustomed to continuous drill and duty, find the work hard, until they become accustomed to it, sufficiently trying, and gladly avail themselves of any slight indisposition to escape from it temporarily by getting upon the sick report. Some recruits also from their ignorance of riding and the management of horses generally, not unfrequently sustain injuries, either by being thrown from their horses or by receiving kicks and bruises from them, both in and out of stables, some of which are occasionally of a very severe nature, confining them to hospital for various and uncertain periods; added to which, those arriving\nduring the autumn months, when endemic malarial fever may be apprehended by the unacclimated almost everywhere throughout the North-West Territories, are specially liable to attacks of this nature, and with such it is often more than ordinarily severe and protracted. It must also be borne in mind that the healthiest, soundest, most vigorous and efficient men as a rule forwarded to the outposts, and that all serious or protracted cases of disease occurring at these, sooner or later, as a rule, find their way to head quarters whenever they are capable of bearing the journey, either for further treatment or to be invalided, where they often remain long under treatment in hospital, and in not a few cases are ultimately restored and returned to duty.\n\nIt must also be remembered that the force at headquarters averages more than double the number to be found at any of the outposts, and that the continual shifting and changing of the Assistant Surgeons, several of whom have temporarily and for limited periods taken the sick parades and performed the hospital duties there, during a period representing altogether nearly seven months of the year now expired; arriving, as they do, unfamiliar with the individual character of the men; it becomes comparatively easy for chronic malingerers, of whom there are always some, to evade duty for an additional term, under various false pretences, and for a time at least in every such case, adding to the number of names upon the daily sick reports. When all these circumstances are taken into consideration, it will no longer be considered surprising that the number of cases appearing on the annual sick report from Regina and the extended duration of many of these, is largely in excess of those found in the annual sick reports sent in from any of the outposts.\n\nThe new hospital erected during the past summer at Regina, though a great advance upon the old one, is not, for reasons mentioned below, all that could be desired. The building as originally projected, was provided with five wards, each capable of accommodating five patients, a total of 25 available beds being required for a force of 250 men; but no room having been provided by the architect for a dispensary and surgery, it became necessary to fit up one of the two lower wards for that purpose; the other has been converted, by necessity, into a drug supply store, the old building being required for other purposes, and the whole of the drugs stored there, together with the new consignment recently received for the same service, were directed to be removed (this only temporarily), into the remaining hospital ward upon the ground floor, the only other room upon that floor of the main building being too small for any other purpose having been set apart for the use of the hospital steward and staff Surgeon Richards in charge of the drug supply, leaving only the three upper wards, capable of accommodating fifteen patients, available for the reception of the sick. As a temporary arrangement and under favorable conditions, this may probably suffice for the winter months, but it is proposed to make it permanent, nothing can well be more objectionable or destructive of the order, well-being, comfort and convenience of the sick, for whom the hospital building was specially designed. Nothing less than ten beds for every 100 men has been uniformly considered indispensable. Under existing arrangements we have ten less than my former report upon hospital accommodation asked for, and which, under very possible circumstances, may become absolutely indispensable. But apart from these considerations, the only convenient access to the ward now occupied as a drug supply store, being through the hall door, entrance hall and corridor of the hospital, from which a broad, open stairway ascends to the wards overhead, all medical stores received and discharged, together with all packing cases and materials for packing, must necessarily find entrance and exit to and from the drug supply store, by this hall alone; the dirt, noise and confusion attending which operations, must be added, the hammering and other disturbances necessarily involved in the packing and unpacking of consignments of stores, and the transmission of these, both in and out, through the front hall and door, which constitutes, as I have said, the main entrance to the hospital proper, and the only way through which they can pass; conditions entirely hostile to the order, cleanliness, privacy and repose specially demanded in such institutions, the imposition of which must impair its comfort and efficiency for\nthe purpose for which it was specially designed. I have submitted temporarily to this arrangement as a most unwelcome necessity; but no time should be lost when spring opens, in providing a small building near at hand for use as a drug supply store, when the large cellar beneath the hospital can still, unless another is provided, be made available for storing perishable supplies, which must otherwise suffer from exposure to frost.\n\nThe annual sick report has been compiled from the daily sick reports for Regina. To me it is by no means a satisfactory document. During five months of the period covered by this report, the sick parade daily was attended personally by myself, no other medical officer being at headquarters; but these duties were attended to for various periods of the remaining seven months by four different Assistant Surgeons in succession, though sickness continues coming into hospital at that period were taken charge of by myself personally. I have no doubt that much which appears extravagant in the sick report referred to, may be readily explained by the suggestions made in this report. The great number of cases of ordinary colds and coughs must be noticed, occurring in a climate where, under ordinary circumstances, they are remarkably rare. This, I believe, is mainly due to the heating of the barracks, especially the sleeping apartments at night, and this evil existed to an almost equal extent in the old barracks, against which these new ones have supplanted; some measure should be devised by which this can be remedied, and also by which the rooms may be properly ventilated, especially when the storm windows are put on, without creating draughts.\n\nNo case of typical malarial fever has occurred at Regina during the past year; the only case appearing on the hospital books having been brought in from Wood Mountain suffering from that disease, and the remarkably few cases of malarial fever occurring during the same period (some of which also came from Wood Mountain), their short average duration, and the absence of any fatality, speak highly for the sanitary condition of Regina, which may not only be maintained, but possibly improved upon, in succeeding years, if the same degree of attention is observed in maintaining the water in the creek at the dam, now used by the dam and sluiceway below the post, and by strictly enforcing the indispensable regulation that no offal, garbage, stable drainings or any other source of impurity is permitted to contaminate its waters. If these and similar precautions are overlooked or neglected, we shall sooner or later, suffer from a recurrence of the severe endemic fever which prostrated so many of our men in the autumn of 1885, though happily without the loss of a single life.\n\nI am not in favor of the introduction of dry earth closets at the hospital, as in severe weather it would be impossible to empty them or keep them clean, unless within the building, to which I am equally opposed. With ordinary care the present closet, which is well cut off from the building, is easy of access and will be well ventilated, will be perfectly safe if thoroughly cleansed in the spring and autumn and properly disinfected; provided no slops are permitted to be thrown into the vault, a matter of the greatest importance.\n\nSo long as these and similar suggestions, often repeated, are carefully attended to, the health of the Headquarters Post, so far as endemic fever is concerned, will continue to compare favorably with other posts in the North-West Territories. We are always exposed to the possible introduction of contagious zymotic disease, introduced by failing troops and immigrants, and this danger is increased by our intimate connection with Regina, a growing town and station on the railway line; but even these, should they be introduced, as they have already been on several occasions, will be favourably modified to us if sanitary regulations are strictly maintained and enforced.\n\nOn the 13th of August, 1887, I proceeded to Ottawa to assist in making the arrangements necessary for providing the annual hospital and veterinary supplies. During my absence the medical charge of Regina passed temporarily into the hands of Assistant Surgeon Aylen, who performed the medical duties of the post until 12th September, from which date until my arrival on the 26th of October the duties of\nsick parade and hospital were taken by Dr. Dodd, of Regina, who has since received the appointment of Assistant Surgeon at this post.\n\nWith reference to Regimental No. 1475, Constable Thomas, sent down by Assistant Surgeon Aylen, to be invalided about a year ago for an inguinal hernia sustained by him while on duty, I retained him in order to attempt his radical cure. In that attempt I have happily succeeded; for the last six or seven weeks he has dispensed altogether with a truss and has only been continued at \"light duty\" in the armorer's shop to prevent the possible recurrence of the disease by too early and violent exercise. For the last month he has been urgently soliciting me to recommend his return to Fort Saskatchewan as armorer there\u2014a duty for which his former trade as a machinist, qualifies him, but I prefer keeping him for a time beneath my observation until I am satisfied that the cure is permanent. If my instructions are followed and he is permitted to continue awhile longer at his present employment, there is every reason to believe that his recovery will be perfect.\n\nAccompanying the estimate and annual sick list from Calgary will be found two excellent and carefully written reports from Assistant Surgeon Par\u00e9 in charge of that post, relating to his experience of the outbreak of fever at Kootenay, to which post he was suddenly ordered during my absence at Ottawa, to assist Dr. Powell, who, with many others of \"D\" Division had been suddenly struck down with fever at that point in the heart of the mountains. The first of these reports, dated 31st October, was received by me during the absence of the Commissioner, and was then referred by me to the Assistant Commissioner in command, who returned it to me after its perusal; the second, is his annual report for Calgary. In each of these reports he enters largely into the subject of the fatal endemic fever lately prevailing at Kootenay, from a severe attack of which Dr. Powell has only lately recovered. Dr. Par\u00e9 is an active, intelligent and efficient officer of whose professional capacity I entertain a high opinion, and who deserves great credit for the prompt and energetic discharge of his duties on his occasion. Practicing his profession until very recently in the Province of Quebec he has hitherto had little opportunity of becoming acquainted generally with diseases due to malaria, from which that Province is comparatively free, and perhaps from this cause, views the fever lately prevailing at Kootenay in somewhat different light to that in which I regard it; but judging from his own description and my own long experience in a highly malarious district during the thirty-five years preceding my appointment to this force, I am strongly of the opinion that Constables Mason and Fisher, whose symptoms he details, and probably some others, died from what is known as a hemorrhagic malaria fever, a very fatal form of endemic malaria fever occurring in certain seasons and localities.\n\nThe more clearly I come to understand the conditions existing in the neighbourhood of Kootenay Pass, from the various accounts received of the outbreak of the fever there, the clearer becomes my conviction, that, though accompanied, as many such malarial endemics are, by symptoms of a low, typhoid character, this fatal fever was unquestionably of malarious origin, and must, to a certain extent have been dependent upon the position of the post; a very extensive knowledge of the topography of such a country, and the ordinary course of the prevailing winds through the mountain passes, deep valleys and river bottoms, and their relation to the numerous large bogs or marshes; some of which become probably dry during the summer; being required before any definite opinion of the source from which the deadly exhalations proceed can be satisfactorily ascertained and expressed; but the mere fact that malarial fever has once made its baneful presence so severely felt at Kootenay compels me to believe it will be likely to recur at similar periods and under similar conditions so long as any considerable body of unacclimated men are stationed there during the autumn months, and perhaps in a modified and less fatal form in the spring of the year also, when marked variations of temperature occur between noon and midnight.\n\nThese suggestions may possibly receive as little attention as many of a like nature which have preceded them\u2014but any competent medical authority familiar with the ravages caused by malaria among unacclimated troops or bodies of men\nstationed in districts where malaria uniformly abounds at certain well defined seasons of the year, will confirm what I have written, and would probably agree with me in foretelling the recurrence of endemic fever there under similar conditions and during similar seasons to those through which the post has recently passed, though future epidemics may vary much in type and character, here as everywhere, under changed atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe intelligent report of Assistant Surgeon Powell throws additional light upon the causes contributing to the outbreak of fever at Kootenay, from which he personally suffered severely, and he is clearly disposed to attribute its outbreak to the presence of malaria. There can be no question that this view of the subject is correct, though possibly the main sources from which it was derived are not to be found in the immediate neighborhood of the post. I am pleased also to observe that Dr. Powell does full justice to the excellence and abundance of the medical supplies and hospital comforts provided, \"and everything which would in any way tend to promote the well-being of the patients.\" This is extremely gratifying, coming from so thoroughly competent a medical officer, though the supplies at every other post have been furnished in even greater profusion. The surgical instruments asked for by Dr. Powell in his annual requisition, herewith forwarded, should be provided with the least possible delay and forwarded as soon as practicable.\n\nIt is also pleasant to hear from the report of Dr. Tulloch, Acting Assistant Surgeon at Fort Saskatchewan that the supply of drugs at that post is full and satisfactory. There can be no question that no troops in the world are better provided for in this respect than the North-West Mounted Police.\n\nThe following documents are herewith enclosed:\n\n1.

JUKES, M.B.,\nSenior Surgeon.\nAPPENDIX N.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF ASSISTANT SURGEON BALDWIN, 1887.\n\nFort Macleod, 1st December, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to enclose my annual sick report for the year ending 30th November, 1887.\n\nI would draw your attention to the absence of any case of typho-malarial fever so called, at this post during the past year.\n\nI would state that in my opinion the present system of cesspool latrines is exceedingly unhealthy and I would strongly urge the adoption of dry-earth closets, especially in posts situated in sandy soil.\n\nI would also suggest that the present system of issuing blankets to the men be discontinued. At present a man on joining receives three pairs which he is supposed to keep for the year. I would recommend that clean blankets be issued every month and that all blankets in use for that length of time be returned to store for the purpose of being washed.\n\nI would also suggest that a charge of ten cents per diem be allowed against patients in hospital for messing. This is the same rate paid voluntarily by the men in the troop mess, and if this would be allowed in hospital it would do away with extra pay of cook.\n\nI accompanied \"K\" Division from Battleford to this post, leaving Battleford in 18th May and arriving at this post on 2nd June.

Y. BALDWIN,\nAssistant Surgeon.\n\nFORT MACLEOD, 30th November, 1887.\nAPPENDIX O.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF ASSISTANT SURGEON AYLEN, 1887.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 5th December, 1887.\n\nTo the Commissioner North-West Mounted Police,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to present you with my annual report for the year ending the 30th of November, 1887.\n\nFrom December, 1886, to June, 1887, I was stationed at Fort Saskatchewan, and had medical charge of \"G\" Division. I visited the detachment at Edmonton once a week and Red Deer twice a month. There were a few serious cases last winter, and I am happy to say they all made good recoveries. It is wonderful how few venereal cases there were in this division. I venture to say that there are not another hundred men in the Dominion that can give as clear a record.\n\nOn the 14th of June last I reported at Calgary for duty; on the 15th I took stock and found everything in splendid condition. Prisoner Fisher was the only patient in hospital, suffering from a gunshot wound. On examining him I found that an abscess had formed, I opened it freely and in a short time he recovered and was transferred to Regina to put in his unexpired time in imprisonment.\n\nOn the 29th of June I received orders to join Supt. Steele at Golden City, en route to the Kootenay District. On the 2nd of July I took medical charge of \"D\" Division, the men were in splendid condition and seemed to enjoy camp life. On the 4th of July I received orders to return to Calgary. On the 7th July, I took medical charge of \"G\" Division again; during the short time I had charge of this division there was very little sickness.\n\nOn the 15th of August I received orders to report at Regina for duty. On the 19th of that month I took medical charge of the depot. This division excels any three divisions for sickness that I have had charge of.\n\nDuring the short time I have had medical charge of the depot, it fell upon me to recommend five constables to be invalided as follows:\n\nReg. No. 1475\u2014Constable Thomas\u2014suffering from hernia.\n\nReg. No. 1750\u2014Corporal Johnston\u2014suffering from varicocele. I believe he has recovered enough to do light duty, but I fear he will be laid up again shortly.\n\nReg. No. 1804\u2014Constable Stephens\u2014suffering from varicocele, contracted before enlisted. Invalided.\n\nReg. No. 1963\u2014Constable Brown\u2014Suffering from suppurative nephritis, contracted before enlisting. Invalided.\n\nReg. No. 2011\u2014Constable Underhill\u2014Suffering from tertiary syphilis, contracted before enlisting. Invalided.\n\nOn the 12th of September I received orders to report at Battleford for duty on the 19th. I took medical charge of \"C\" Division and found the hospital and drugs in very good condition. The men are in excellent health; fever has disappeared altogether; there is not a single case in the neighborhood of Battleford, and if next summer is not an exceptionally dry one I don't think it will reappear.\n\nI beg to recommend that a verandah be placed in front and on one side of the hospital, and that a bay-window be made in the surgery, as there is not sufficient light at present for dispensing. With these two additions Battleford will have the finest hospital in the North-West Mounted Police.\nThe general sanitary condition of the barracks is excellent, great care is taken in the removal of dirty water and slops of all kinds.\n\nI enclose you an appendix of diseases treated in this hospital during the year ending the 30th of November, 1887. This includes \"K\" Division which was stationed here from December, 1886, till May, 1887.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. AYLEN, M. D., C.

AYLEN, M.D., C.M.,\nAssistant Surgeon, N.W.M.P.\nAPPENDIX P.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF ASSISTANT SURGEON DODD, 1877.\n\nREGINA, December, 1887.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour in making this, my first annual report, to outline my work since the commencement of my connection with this Force, although prior to 1st October, the date of my appointment, I was only contingently engaged.\n\nOn the 13th of September, my services were called into request owing to the absence of Sergeant Jukes, whose presence was demanded by duty elsewhere. The sick parade and the routine medical duties of the post were taken by myself until the 4th October, when fever being reported as having broken out in the Wood Mountain detachment, I had the pleasure of offering to go to that point, where it was considered my services might possibly be of value.\n\nLeaving Regina on the 5th, Wood Mountain was reached on the evening of the 8th, a delay arising on the road through the death of one of the horses used for my transport. On my arrival Staff Sergeant Tulloch, hospital steward, was found suffering from an attack of typho-malarial fever. By a course of that treatment, which I have found so more successful in dealing with cases of this disease, which is peculiar to this country, the patient so far recovered that I was able to return to Regina on the 25th October. Two days after my return another despatch was received from Wood Mountain to the effect that Staff Sergeant Tulloch had suffered a relapse, and a request was made that I should again proceed thither. Arriving there on the 30th of that month, I found the patient improving, but a few more cases had unfortunately developed. By the 10th November, Staff Sergeant Tulloch being able to travel, was sent with Inspector Drayner, who was suffering from rheumatism, to headquarters. I remained at Wood Mountain attending to the other cases until the return of the division to this place, when I brought two patients sufficiently strong to undertake the journey.\n\nArriving back at Regina on Thursday, 11th November, my patients, Sergeant Stratton and Constable Roth, were placed in hospital.\n\nThe old post at Wood Mountain was in bad sanitary condition and not healthily situated; the buildings had become damp from decay and age. The old latrine pits had partially been filled up, and these had been used as receptacles for the filth of the post. As they were situated in the proximity of the houses, the miasmatic exhalations from them could not fail to be deleterious to the extreme, and no doubt contributed their share to producing the disease that caused my visit. The water, too, I was informed, had been used for all purposes, and was drawn from a small stream, which was polluted by settlers and Indians resident upon its banks, about one hundred yards from the post, and it was noticed by me that the water was actually polluted in the manner I suspected, as old skins were seen soaking therein, and other sources of contamination were noticed.\n\nThe new barracks are admirably located; they are on a hill, the sub-soil of which is gravel, which is surrounded by good railings. Excellent water is to be had at a depth of 25 feet, and will be free danger of pollution from any source if the spot for sinking a well is judiciously chosen. The buildings are both commodious and well arranged, and I confer great credit upon those who planned them, and arrangements for keeping them in excellent sanitary condition have been made by Superintendent Jarvis, the officer in command.\n\nTwo of the patients, Staff Sergeant Tulloch and Sergeant Stratton, the first sent into headquarters on the 10th November and the latter brought in by myself with the Division, have both returned to duty.\nSufficient attention was not given by the architect to the ventilation of the buildings put up at Regina this year. This remark applies particularly to the new quarters for men and the hospital, in both of which ventilation is all important. The buildings are heated by dry hot air, and complaints are heard from the men that their sleep is not refreshing. Feverish colds, which are to be put down to lack of supply of proper air, are of constant occurrence. The ventilation of the hospital cannot be regulated although it should be possible to adjust it to perfection as a properly regulated air supply is of paramount importance.\n\nI would recommend immediate changes, which after discussion with a gentleman expert in the subject of ventilation, I believe to be quite feasible, and if so desired will be happy to suggest.\n\nThe buildings, excepting in the respect just mentioned, are, from a sanitary point of view, all that could be desired. The latrine system which has been in vogue, is anything but as perfect as it should be, and dry earth disposal should be substituted for the present system.\n\nThe hospital is unfurnished with conveniences of this nature.\n\nIn conclusion of this my first report I would acknowledge the courtesy extended to me upon entering the Force, especially by Senior Surgeon Jukes my immediate superior.\n\nI have not felt it incumbent upon me to touch upon other matters of sanitation and routine in connection with the Medical Department than those aforesaid, as no doubt this will be done by the senior surgeon. Appended hereto, by instructions of the Senior Surgeon, is the headquarters' sick report for the past year, also drugs and instruments for 1888 required.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHENRY DODD.\nAssistant Surgeon.\n\nThe Commissioner North-West Mounted Police,\nRegina.\nAPPENDIX Q.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF ASSISTANT SURGEON PAR\u00c9, 1887.\n\nNORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE,\nCALGARY, N. W. T., 19th December, 1887.\n\nL. W. Hergemer, Esq.,\nCommissioner North-West Mounted Police,\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to tender you my annual report for the year ending 30th November, 1887.\n\nOn reporting for duty at headquarters, Regina, in the beginning of August, 1887, I was placed in medical charge of the post by the Senior Surgeon, but remained only a few days, being transferred to Calgary, where I relieved Assistant Surgeon Aylen and took medical charge of the post on 15th August. There were then four men off duty, two being in hospital. I had the honour to address you a special report concerning two of those cases, viz., Reg. No. 1122, Sergeant Major Kempster and Reg. No. 526, constable Donald.\n\nSince I was attached to the division and also during the whole year as the \"monthly returns\" show, the general health of the men has been very good indeed; the majority of them being the usual trifling ailments of the daily sick parade, and the remainder in great part the result of accidents. I am happy to state that I have no cases of death to record for the past year.\n\nI would have drawn your attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the barracks in general, their insufficiency of space, &c., and to the dilapidated state of the hospital in particular, but I was informed that new buildings were to be erected this fall.\n\nTwice I was sent on detachment, first to High River, and, secondly, to the Blackfoot Crossing. From the first place I brought back a civilian who had been shot through the arm, he was attended to in the hospital here, and sent home cured. Both trips as far as our men were concerned, were medically speaking quite uneventful, there being no accidents of any description, and the health of the men keeping good.\n\nOn 2nd October, I was ordered to Kootenay, B. C., to attend some of the men sick with the fever, Dr Powell, the surgeon in charge being down with the fever at the time. As already stated in the special report of my visit to Kootenay, I found the Fever to be typhoid. I failed to see any local cause for the outbreak of the disease in the immediate surroundings of the camp. South of the camp across the Kootenay in the intervening space between this river and the mountains is a flat which was completely covered by the exceptionally high water of this spring's flood that carried thereon fallen trees, rotten wood and other vegetable matters, which under the influence of the also exceptionally great heat of this past summer, must have given forth deadly exhalations to which this fever might be attributed. The camp and barracks are beautifully situated on a flat sandy elevation, which, covered with large pine trees, gently slopes from north to south, on the sides of which is a high cut bank, separate from a lower flat on the east side. A few hundred feet below this plateau, the Wild Horse River rushes by, making for itself at the first obstacle, a new channel through its gravelly bed from the west side and sweeping gracefully around the southern and front points of the barracks, the Kootenay, to which the St. Mary has just added its waters, flows along with considerable rapidity. All around (on all sides) at short distance and dominating the plateau by a few thousand feet are the lofty peaks of the Rockies, the Wild Horse Pass, &c., the Purcell and Selkirk Ranges.\n\nThis description, as exact as I possibly can make it, is to place the Senior Surgeon in\npossession of the facts concerning the camp and its surroundings. The little abandoned channels of the Wild Horse above mentioned dry very quickly, leaving hardly any mud or gravel. There is no vegetable matter apparent in the whole bottom; nothing but gravel, and as stated, I am informed that the overflowing of the flat across the Kootenay is exceptional.\n\nI cannot close this report without begging liberty to draw your attention to the ability, zeal and punctuality with which Sergt. Graydon, the hospital sergeant of this post, performs his duties; a more accurate, better informed and more conscientious dispenser cannot be desired, and if I might be permitted, I would like to express the opinion that his services well deserve the rank and pay of a staff sergeant.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

A. PARK\nAssistant Surgeon.\nNORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE.\n\nKootenay, B.C. 31st October, 1887.\n\nThe Senior Surgeon\nNorth-West Mounted Police,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to report that in compliance with instructions transmitted to me (by Inspector Wattam, Officer Commanding Calgary) at 10.35 o'clock, 1st, October 1887, I left Calgary the same night by the Canadian Pacific Railway for Golden from there to proceed to the camp of \"D\" Division at Kootenay, B.C. It was only 26 hours after my arrival at Golden that I was enabled to leave by the Steamer \"Duchess,\" and owing to most adverse circumstances I reached Spallumcheen (a distance of forty miles up the Columbia River) at 4 p.m. of the 4th October. From this point the journey was to be completed on horseback. I was enabled to leave Spallumcheen at 8 o'clock next morning and reached Windermere at 8.30 p.m. the same night. There, Superintendent Steele was awaiting the arrival of a doctor and had pack horses to send him through. We left Windermere next morning and were detained on the way to examine and prescribe for some men of the detachment who were sick at \"Sam's Landing.\" Constable Lownes had been in bed three days suffering with neuralgia; Constables Craig and Taylor had suffered and were still suffering with headache and diarrhea. As these men were not then exhibiting any marked signs of fever I concluded to send them medicine and await further developments and consequently had it sent on my arrival at the camp.\n\nOn account of the necessary delay I could not proceed further than the Hot Springs that day. That night our horses stamped and broke out of the corral, therefore we were unable to leave until 11 o'clock next day. At a distance of eight or ten miles from this place I met a courier (with despatches for Superintendent Steele) who informed me that Constable Street was very sick, alone and unable to move, at Doyle's Camp. To go to him added six miles to my journey, as I had to go three miles around the Columbia River. There I found Constable Street in a very bad state of fever and nervousness, the skin was hot and dry there was much tenderness of the abdomen, the pulse was weak and at 90 per minute, temperature 102\u00b0. It was completely out of the question to take him to camp. I instructed Constable Rupert to remain with him until relieved, and proceeded alone with as little delay as possible towards the camp. Not knowing the road I had to remain at Messrs. Aylmer & Humphreys Rancho for the night as it was already too dark to see the trail. There I found Constable Fisher who according to all symptoms had been suffering from fever for some time, there was already much tenderness of the abdomen and also a good deal of the rose-colored spots.\n\nHe had been working until five o'clock that day, and had only stopped work through great exhaustion. Mr. Humphrey had tried to persuade him to quit work but without avail. Constable Fisher was very anxious to come to camp and as it was almost impossible to leave him there, I decided to take him into camp. I reached the Kootenay Camp in time for sick parade next morning (8th October). Dr. Powell sen., Indian Commissioner for this District, was in charge. Dr. Powell jr., being down with typhoid fever. There were also Sergeant Roby and four constables.\n\nThree of the patients Dr. Powell, Sergeant Roby and Constable Smythe were in a little building 20x19, which through the kindness of the Indian Commissioner (to whose Department this building belonged) was used as a hospital. The rest of the patients were under canvas, a very undesirable circumstance considering the lateness of the season, and the special type of fever. From my arrival on the 26th October, I had the pulse and temperatures carefully registered, as also the administration of every dose of medicine, food, &c., so as to enable any one at any time to study each individual case in all its phases and details.\nOn the 19th Constable Mason (who since the beginning had exhibited such severe symptoms of abdominal form) had intestinal hemorrhage.\n\nA great state of prostration followed. The heart at first responded to the administration of stimulants, the pulse after having been quite imperceptible became better. But a second hemorrhage occurred during the day. Again he rallied after a hypodermic injection; but, however, a third hemorrhage took place in the evening of the 20th and he died at 9 p.m.\n\nConstable Fisher, who throughout also exhibited very severe abdominal symptoms, excessive tenderness and tympanitis, had a sudden change in the evening of the 24th, when he complained of great pain in a circumscribed spot about one inch and a half in diameter, in the right iliac torso and as he described it had a feeling of something pouring or running out. I immediately came to the conclusion that the bowels were perforated. Other symptoms subsequently confirmed this opinion. He had previously passed clots of blood twice, and died at 6:10 a.m., on the morning of the 26th.\n\nI propose sending in a subsequent report of all charts and notes in connection with each case.\n\nThe temperatures were very carefully taken and always verified by the hospital orderly, Constable Hayne, or myself (as the case might be) before registering them. A couple of days after my arrival, two more cases of fever came under my notice and as the cases appeared to be severe (their temperature being 104) I had them removed to the hospital at once, and Constable Smythe who was convalescent was removed to the hospital tent to make room for them.\n\nThey are still now doing well, but according to all appearances quite out of danger. Dr. Poirier though not very strong yet is now quite capable of attending all emergencies that may arise in the camp. Although I think it would be too trying for him to go out any great distance.\n\nBefore concluding I suppose I may be permitted to declare that I have received from Superintendent Steele the most hearty and intelligent support that a medical man could expect from the officer commanding.\n\nThe Hospital Steward Staff Sergeant Mercer is perfectly qualified for all the duties of an intelligent dispenser, and never hesitates to perform the duties of nurse whenever the case seems to require it. The nurses Constables Hayne and Whitehead have done so in their power to alleviate the sufferings of their sick comrades. Constable Hayne having had long experience in a London hospital as nurse, would strongly recommend that he should remain on as hospital orderly and draw the extra pay of fifteen cents per diem. Constable Knight (who I sent to nurse Constable Street at the Kootenay Crossing) must have been up day and night, his reports giving every spoonful of medicine and food given to the patient, also temperatures, pulse, &c., in a word the nurses carried out their instructions to the letter and deserve the greatest praise for their zeal and spirit of discipline.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. A. PAR\u00c9,\nAssistant Surgeon.\nAPPENDIX R.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF ASSISTANT SURGEON POWELL, 1887.\n\nKootenay, District, B. C., 29th November, 1887.\n\nThe Officer Commanding North-West Mounted Police,\nKootenay District, B. C.\n\nSir.\u2014In accordance with instructions I have the honour to forward my report for the five months during which I have been attached as medical officer of this division.\n\nReceiving orders from the Comptroller, I left Ottawa on Wednesday evening, 29th June, en route for Golden, B. C., but on nearing Regina I received a message to stop off until further orders, and accordingly reported myself at the barracks on Sunday morning. On Tuesday I received instructions to report myself to Superintendent Steele at Golden B. C., as soon as possible, and left by the train that night arriving there Thursday morning, 7th July, and reported myself at once. On assuming medical charge of the Division I found the health of the men and the sanitary condition of the camp to be most satisfactory.\n\nBeing detained in Golden two weeks, owing to the capsizing of the steamer \"Duchess,\" which resulted in great loss to both drugs and supplies, we proceeded on the morning of Wednesday, 24th July, for the Kootenay District. I deemed it necessary to leave behind three men as I considered them unfit to undertake the journey there, and left Staff Sergeant Morcey in charge of them.\n\nAfter a somewhat tedious journey we arrived near Six Mile Creek on Friday, 30th July. I was here requested by the Superintendent to examine closely into the sanitary condition of the site which had been selected for the erection of our barracks. After inspecting the ground and surroundings carefully, I deemed it necessary to report against the site for two reasons:\u2014Firstly\u2014the ground which is elevated looks over an immense swamp. Secondly\u2014Six Mile Creek from which we would have to derive our water supply I found to take its origin in a big slough. The next day was spent in selecting a more suitable place and on Sunday afternoon, 1st August, we left for Galbraith's Ferry, the point selected and camped in the rear of the present situation of our barracks.\n\nOur present site is an elevated tract of ground overlooking the Kootenay River and having in the front, in the distance, the Selkirks, to the left Wild Horse Creek and in the rear the Rockies.\n\nDuring the months of July and August the health of the division continued satisfactory, but in September an outbreak of fever occurred. This outbreak I considered to be of a somewhat similar nature to that which occurred at Battleford last autumn viz., typho-malarial, otherwise known as mountain fever.\n\nIn touching upon the Etiology of the outbreak I feel that I am entering upon a difficult subject. The camp was certainly kept in good condition; the latrines were regularly covered with earth, &c. The only way in which I can at this moment for it is the fact of having had a very warm summer, the heat at mid-day being most intense, while at mid-night it was very damp and cool, our blankets in the morning, being covered with a thick mist. During the hottest portion of the summer, also, a branch of Wild Horse Creek which had previously been running, dried up. These influences, combined, would, in my estimation, prove sufficient to cause the decomposition of vegetable and animal matters which may have been exposed and poisoned the atmosphere.\nBe the cause what it may, eleven of us were prostrated with it, resulting unfortunately in three deaths. I am happy to state that of the remaining eight, six have been returned to duty, two only being at present in hospital, and they are fast convalescing. No new cases have presented themselves, and I trust the disease is at an end.\n\nDuring the outbreak we were amply supplied with quinine, hospital comforts, and everything which would in any way tend to promote the well-being of the patients. With regard to surgical cases, we have had but very few, and they were of a very minor character; not a single case of fracture or dislocation occurred. Of specific troubles there were only three cases, and they were of old standing, not a single case of gonorrhoea having presented itself.\n\nDuring the erection of the barracks, which were built entirely by our own men, over one thousand trees being felled for that purpose, I am happy to state that not a single accident occurred, which I consider speaks very highly for the men of the Division.\n\nThe barracks being now completed, and the men comfortably settled, the health of the division is most satisfactory. Our hospital building, 40 by 25 feet in dimensions, containing a large ward, mess-room, kitchen, surgery and bed-room, is comfortable, and I consider it to be fully large enough, and in every way satisfactory.\n\nIn closing my report I feel that I cannot do so without expressing gratitude to Dr. Powell, Indian Commissioner of Victoria, who happened to be in the neighborhood when I was taken ill, and kindly stayed and attended to the sick previous to the arrival of Assistant Surgeon Par\u00e9 from Calgary, on the 4th October; to Mr. Phillips, Indian Agent here, who gave up his house to be used as an hospital until the completion of our new building. I also beg to express appreciation for the promptness with which the drugs and hospital comforts requisitioned for were despatched to us.\n\nLastly, I would recommend that this post be supplied with a more complete set of surgical instruments and appliances.\n\nI enclose you the sick reports for the four months from 1st August to 30th November. The average on the daily sick report was 6\u00b792.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

On reference to this it will be seen that there has been remarkably little serious illness among the men during the year. Two men were recommended to be invalided\u2014one Regimental No. 940 Constable Peasnell for general debility and disease of the kidneys; the other Regimental No. 1561, Constable Barrett, for pain in the hip, the result of an old dislocation.\n\nThe men are now most comfortably quartered in the new barracks which have been occupied since August last. At present one of the barrack rooms is being used as an hospital. It is, however, not at all suitable for such a purpose. I would strongly recommend that a proper hospital capable of accommodating at least ten patients, with rooms for surgery, hospital, sergeant's quarters and kitchen be built.\n\nWe have a good supply of drugs on hand, but are in need of more surgical instruments and appliances.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHUGH U.

Regarding it, the patient took a full teaspoonful of tarter emetic from an ounce pocket which lay on a shelf in the new quarters, \"as an emetic to clear his head.\" In three-quarters of an hour he was comatose. It was four and one-half hours before he was out of danger.\n\nOne patient was sent to Regina unwell, being unfit for duty here. He had been illing quite a long time and was invalided.\n\nThe house used as a hospital is much more comfortable than it was last year. Still there is so much room for improvement, that a properly constructed hospital is required.\n\nThe stock of drugs is full and satisfactory.\n\nI herewith enclose estimates for drugs, &c., required for the medical and veterinary departments during the year 1888.\n\nDuring the autumn six neat iron bedsteads and fittings arrived, which are a great boon, and render the hospital fairly comfortable for the patients.\n\nThe new quarters, \"old log buildings renovated,\" though comparatively comfortable, are rather small and badly ventilated, thereby necessitating over crowding with colds and catarrhs as a sequence.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. TULLOCH, M.D.\n\nThe Commissioner, N. W. M. P., Regina.\nAPPENDIX U.\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF ASSISTANT VETERINARY SURGEON BURNETT\n1887.\n\nREGINA, 20th December, 1887.\n\nSir.\u2014I have the honour to present you with my first annual report for the year ending this date.\n\nAs I have not had an opportunity of visiting all the outposts and making a personal inspection of the horses, this report must necessarily be incomplete.\n\nThe general health of the horses at present, I am happy to say, is good, and they are free from all contagious and infectious diseases. During the past year a couple of cases of glanders were discovered, but as the infected animals were promptly destroyed and every precaution taken to prevent the spread of the malady no further outbreak has occurred. However, this is a disease we must always be on the watch for, as there are so many horses in this country affected with this scourge, that it is almost impossible to prevent Police horses from coming in contact with infected animals at places. One of the most fruitful distributing points I may say of the contagium of this disease is the stopping place stable, found on all the principal trails of this country, and it will not be over-stating the mark to say that within the past two years glandered horses have been fed in all of these stables. And I believe there are a great many people in this country who are keeping and working glandered horses and are ignorant of the fact.\n\nDeaths from disease have been comparatively few this year, when it is taken into consideration the work the Police horses are called upon to perform, and the hardships they very often undergo, the horses sometimes travelled under scorching summer sun or facing the cold blasts of winter, the thermometer registering at times 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 below zero, the shelter they often get at night being very poor. It is simply a wonder that there are not more deaths to record in a year's history of the Force than what there are. And I have no doubt that there would be a great many more if it was not for the good care that is taken of them, by the men having them in charge, where opportunity presents. Any person who has ever travelled any distance with men belonging to this Force must have noticed this.\n\nAnother thing that I am satisfied has been the means of saving the lives of many valuable animals, is providing the men when about to start on a journey with medicines for the treatment of some of the commoner complaints, which if allowed to run on would in a great many cases result fatally.\n\nWhile on duty away from the post there have been three fatal accidents: two horses were drowned while attempting to ford Old Man's River; the other one killing itself by jumping over a cut bank.\n\nAny divisions that I have visited are very well supplied with stable accommodation with the exception of the depot. The new stables built at Prince Albert the past summer are first class as far as light, ventilation and heat are concerned, and as they are situated on a slight elevation there is good drainage. I have visited these stables at one o'clock in the morning (with the thermometer outside registering 20\u00b0 below zero) and found them very comfortable and an entire absence of that suffocating smell generally found in warm stables at that hour when the doors are closed. In building new stables, however, there are certain alterations in the Prince Albert plans, I would strongly recommend in the mangers and the flooring in the stables.\n\nThe mangers should not be over 2\u00bd feet in height. The oat boxes should be arranged so that they could be taken out and cleaned.\nThe floors in the stalls should be boarded or planked just about half way up and the front portion filled in with clay on a level with the plank, thus giving the horse a moist and natural surface for his fore feet. The back part should be planked for the sake of cleanliness.\n\nThe clay floors have been given a trial in some of the depot stables and in the \"E\" Division stables, and they have given the best of satisfaction.\n\nI believe if this plan were universally adopted throughout the Force we would have no more complaint from the blacksmiths about the horses' feet being hard and dry, and groggy and sore footed horses would be a thing of the past, as this is a very important matter, a little further explanation may not be amiss.\n\nTake a horse, for instance, that has always lived in a natural state; has always run wild; corns, contracted feet or chronic laminitis are diseases unknown to him. And why? Because his feet get a sufficient amount of moisture to keep them healthy, the frog, sole and wall of the hoof bear the weight that nature intended they should; but take that horse and put him in a stable where he will have to stand on boards, have him shod, and while he is in the stall the frog is raised clear off the ground; the most of the weight comes on the wall; he gets no moisture; and what is the result? A lame horse. But by having a clay floor for him to stand on, the shoe will sink into the clay, the frog and sole bear a portion of the weight, he gets the moisture necessary and the foot is kept healthy.\n\nThe saving in the cost of a floor of this description should be quite an item.\n\nThe new hospital stable built at Prince Albert the past summer is first-class in every particular; it has good light, ventilation and drainage. There are seven good roomy box stalls and two single stalls; two of the box stalls are set apart for contagious or infectious diseases and are separated from the others by the surgery and boiling room. The stalls are fitted with movable mangers and oat boxes and with sling attachments above, there is also a small tank arranged over one stall for the purpose of showering, whenever such treatment is necessary.\n\nI would recommend that every station be supplied with an infirmary, built on the same plan as this one. I believe the saving in horse flesh by having a proper place to treat the sick would amply repay the outlay.\n\nThe majority of saddle horses now used by the Force are bronchos or natives, they having been found very much superior to the eastern horses; when once broken they are more tractable, stand the long hard journeys better, are easier kept, and there is no time wasted in waiting for them to become acclimatized. Those purchased within the last two years will average about 15 hands 1 inch in height, and these are found plenty big enough. My opinion is, the smaller horses stand the work the best. The trouble being the big horses have, as a rule, as good backs, and are not as well coupled as the small horses, and are therefore not as good weight carriers. This is a very important point in choosing a saddle horse, and I would recommend that the standard be lowered from 15 hands to 14\u00bd, for I believe we miss a great many really first-class horses by keeping the standard up. There are other points too in favor of the smaller horse; in travelling they are much easier on themselves, require less food, and I think they can be purchased cheaper. Of course there are some stout horses required for the heavy weights of the Force, and as I believe it is your intention to make team horses of the heaviest of the saddle horses, as they are required, there can be no mistake made in buying some big horses.\n\nI would recommend that say eight of the heaviest of the saddle horses of each division be broken to harness so that in case of emergency they could be used, and if carefully handled the breaking would not hurt them for the work they were originally at. Our best saddle horses come from British Columbia and Oregon. This is due to the fact that the breeders in the above-mentioned countries have been using thoroughbred stallions with the native mares for a much greater length of time than the breeders in Montana and Alberta, but judging by the number of thoroughbred horses that have been brought into the Territories the past year for use on the ranches it will not be long until the horses bred in this country will be equal to any in the world.\nThe team horses are principally from the east and the great fault with them is they are too heavy for anything like fast work; this can be said especially of those purchased in 1886, and there are times when this is a very serious fault, but as we gradually draw on the ranks for our team horses this fault will be rectified.\n\nIn purchasing horses I think the best time would be in the fall of the year, by so doing it would give them a better chance to fill out, as the work in winter is not as hard as it is in the summer, or what would perhaps be better buy them in spring and let them run on the range until the fall, we would then have more to pick from.\n\nThe horse shoes mostly used by the Force are I believe known as the Montreal shoe, and where there have been a great many complaints made against them, the principal one being that they break very easy and in a number of cases I have known them to break the first day they were put on. Lately, however, we have been using a shoe known as the Rhode Island pattern, so far they have proved satisfactory.\n\nIf not out of place I would like to say a word or two re the Hutchings saddle, made in Winnipeg. I consider this a good serviceable saddle for the Force, having practically tested it, and for work in those districts requiring double cinch saddles it is particularly well adapted. The manufacturer claims to have taken every pains to equal at least the San Francisco saddle of Maine and Winchester, with two of the best trotting ones in the United States, the Goodall and Viscolia. I consider for Police service that durability and lightness have been combined in the Hutchings saddle, and would recommend that they be adopted throughout the Force and thus place us in a more independent position as to our own market in such an important part of our equipage, than being as heretofore solely dependent on the American manufacture which might be closed to us with fatal results.\n\nThe fodder supplied the Force at the different posts I have visited is of first class quality, the oats this year being especially good, and are superior to any I have seen raised in the east.\n\nThe drugs supplied the veterinary department are first class in every particular, and so far have heard no complaints.\n\nThe saddles and utensils purchased in Toronto are also first class, and are equally as good as those of English manufacture, the cost being a little over one-half of those purchased in England.\n\nI enclose you a list of horses that have died the past year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Police\nthe barracks\nrecently occupied\nby them at\nWild Horse Creek\nKootenay, for the\npurposes of the\nproposed Industrial\nIndian School\nto be established\nin that locality.\nThey appear to\nbe well adapted\nfor such a institution\nfor the purpose,\nbeing reported\nto be well built\nand to have\nafforded comfortable\nlodging for the\nPolice during\nlast Winter.\n\nI enclose\na rough sketch\nshowing the ground\nplan\nplan of the buildings, and I have to request that you will inspect the same and report what alterations or additions, if any, it may be necessary to have made and to what extent in connection with the institution. In your opinion the several buildings should be adapted if the proposal to establish an Industrial school therein is given effect to. It would appear from the plan that the building used\nused by the police as officers' quarters and marked A would afford suitable accommodation for the Principal of the Institution and perhaps for the Assistant as well. The buildings \"B,\" \"C\" and \"D,\" which were for the orderly and guard rooms, sergeant's quarters, and quartermaster's store, might be used for girls' and boys' dormitories and for schoolrooms. The building marked \"E,\" used for mess quarters, might be used for school and dining rooms. You will, however, be best able to guide the Dept. in\nin the above matters after carefully inspecting the buildings.\n\nThe H.W.M.\n\nPolicie had an understanding with Mr. Gallbraith on whose land the above buildings were erected, that he would transfer 14 acres of the land so soon as he received a title from the Provincial Govt. for the same.\n\nYou will be good enough to enquire of Mr. Gallbraith whether he will be prepared to give the Deputy...\ngive effect to this arrangement if an Industrial Indian school is established in the District I shall be obliged by your giving earliest possible attention to this matter and by your informing me if possible by return of mail of the result of your inquiries.\n\nIf Mr. Galbraith will favor sending the list of your recommendations that the buildings be utilized in the manner proposed please state how so what furniture will be required & equip the institution for\nfor 30 pupils\u2014say 20 boys and ten girls\u2014a principal, and matron and two or four or three servants\nIndian Office, Montenay B.C.\nDec. 14th 1888\n\nL. Vanbrugh, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt by today's mail of your letter of the 5th ultimo in No. 33, stating that the Dept proposed taking over from the North West Mounted Police the barracks recently occupied by them at Wild Horse Creek, Montenay for the purpose of the proposed Industrial Indian School. I also enclose the sketch showing the ground plan of the buildings.\n\nIn reply I have to state that I proceeded at once to inspect the buildings which are situated about one mile from this Office.\n\nThe buildings are all of rough or uneven logs, but well and substantially put up. With the exception of the Officers quarters, the Hospital, and the Quarter Masters store they are rather drafty and cold and altogether without interior finish.\n\nThe Officers quarters have recently been fitted up by the Provincial Government. The \"Government Agent\" at\npresent occupy them. They are well finished and would make good rooms for the principal. The other buildings can of course be fitted up for dormitories, schoolroom, dining hall etc. They are all much the same size of building made entirely of green material. The bank left on the top I do not think they will last more than four years. The roofs are very open. Another great drawback is the water. The river is more than 200 ft below the level of the bench on which the buildings stand. In is there any garden land. Still with these drawbacks they could be made to serve & to serve well the purpose of an industrial school, and although not so good, still at a much less cost than new buildings.\n\nI should not however be doing my duty if I did not lay before you what I consider a most serious reason for not employing the building for an Indian school. The parents of the children would naturally camp over a lot around the school. At present when out on hunting or on their farms they camp at the river out of the way of white settlers. After the depot have been to so much trouble in making them understand that the reserves alone belong to them it would not I think be wise to bring them over on this side of the river into what is in fact a small town. They\nwould bring their wives over to the\nannoyance of settlers. Of course if they\ncould be got to stay away from the\nChildren it would be much better, but\nis this possible. These Indians are\nall Catholics and apparently devout ones\nand unless the schools are under the\nMission I fear the duties of Principal\nwould be a hopelessly difficult one.\nThe Missionaries would certainly\nconsider it their duty to interfere as\nmuch as possible & do their best\nto make the school a failure.\nWhen first asked by the Supp.\nto pick out a School site, I picked\nupon a beautiful spot on the St.\nMary's Reserve.\nI do not know at all how\nother schools belong to the Department\nare managed & therefore hesitate before\nmaking suggestions. If Coeza the\npresent Agent at the Mission seems to\nhave much common sense; & the mission\nis in a very different place since he has\nbeen there. He is most anxious to have\nthe school at the Mission. He told\nme some time ago that he would\ngive land on the mission property for\nthe School. The Indians also wish\nit there. In many ways it would\nsimplify things if I think would work\nwell; though having the schools in charge\nof the Mission may be foreign to the\npolicy of the Department.\nReferring back to Fort Steele\nplace for the industrial School\u2014I have today written to Mr. Galt (who is agent of the centre in Victoria) about the title of the land. His agent Mr. Clark tells me that the 16 acres have already been surveyed.\n\nThe freight on furniture would come high. School tables, benches &c. likewise could be made here. For a twelve heating house would be required and four cooking stoves.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nMichael Phillips\nMichael Phillips Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nKootenay, B.C.\n\nFeb. 28 - 89\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to my letter to you of the 15th inst., respecting the proposed site for the Industrial Indian school at Kootenay and request you to inform me whether the material of which the police barracks have been built could not be utilized in connection with the school building also in respect to the manufacture of school furniture.\n\nMay I request that\nMichael Phillips, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nKootenay, B.C.\n\nJanuary 8th\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ack. the receipt of your communication of the 14th last, respecting the proposed appropriation by this Dept. of the N.W.

Mr. Lotship will, therefore, understand that, in paying the $130 per an. for each pupil, the Depot is to bear\nno further expense whatever in connection with the management & running expenses of the school. I fear that I may not have made myself sufficiently clear to Mr. Letship with regard to the instruction in trades or agriculture referred to in my previous letter, & I therefore, beg to supplement the statement made in that regard by explaining that the Dept will expect instruction to be given in more industries than in agriculture; that is to say in two or three trades besides agriculture.\n\nI may add that the Dept will accede to the desire expressed in yr. letter so that the Sisters of Charity that the opening of the institution be deferred till the 1st May next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract of letter from Mr. Paul Barton, O.M.I.,\nIndian Apostle of British Columbia,\nRector, New Westminster, B.C., the 30th June 1890.\n\n\"In answer to the letter, Re: Kootenay Industrial School,\ndated 7th June and numbered No. 46083, I have the honour\nto state, that the Roman Catholic Church agrees to conduct\nthe Kootenay Industrial School, on the principles of\n\u00a3130 per annum for each Indian pupil, Re: to pay, but\nthe said capitulation of \u00a3130 per annum the Roman Catholic\nChurch is prepared to board, clothe, educate and give practical\ninstruction in Agriculture, and also in two or three trades to\neach male pupil, and the same to each female pupil, providing\nfor trades or Agriculture, in the case of the latter instruction in\ndomestic duties. Provided that the Principal of the Institution\nbe paid a salary of \u00a3250, the Mother \u00a3200, two servants \u00a3200\neach, the cook \u00a3250, the instructor of trades \u00a3600, and it is\nallowed to him to be Industrial School.\n\nI have the honour to present as Principal of the Industrial\nSchool at Kootenay, the Reverend Father Pasquina, elected\nSuperior of the same Institution, as also of the other Sisters who\nwill begin their first year of management of the establishment.\n\nI hope that the Government will not raise any\nobjection to the representation of the Roman Catholic Church\nto have a charge made in the divisions of the house,\nin order to have a room exclusively dedicated as a Chapel\nfor Divine worship, or to have some additions made\nwhen found necessary, viz., a bake house with an\noven, a laundry &c.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nP.S.\nMemorandum\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit herewith an extract from a letter from the Vicar Apostolic of the Roman Catholic Church for British Columbia dated the 30th ultimo relative to the industrial school proposed to be established for the benefit of the Indian children of the Kootenay Country.\n\nIt will be observed from His Lordship's letter that the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church expect besides the per capita grant of $130.00 per annum for the pupils in residence at that Institution,\n\nHon. E. Beattie,\nSuperintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\nThat the Principal of the same shall be paid a salary of $800.00, the matron $400.00, two servants $200.00 each, the Cook $250.00 and an Instructor of trades $600.00 per annum, being the wages allowed to employees at the Kamloops Industrial school.\n\nIt has hitherto been understood by the Dept., that the Kootenay Institution was to receive no more than the per capita grant, and that the Roman Catholic Church Authorities were in consideration of that sum being paid, to provide everything for the support and education of the pupils. The whole amount provided on account of the per capita grant was $3200.00 being $130 per annum each for 25 pupils.\n\nIt is found however that in the Estimates for the current fiscal year an\namount of $2500.00 was inserted for salaries for a staff at the Institution. Said staff to consist of a Principal, matron, cook, servants and teacher.\n\nThis would cover the salaries proposed by the Rt. Rev. Gentleman to be paid to the above employees, with $50.00 to spare. The undersigned does not consider that if the salaries of the officers and employees are paid by the dept., the per capita allowance for feeding and clothing the children should be as high as $130.00 per annum, and he is of the opinion that His Lordship should be informed that the dept. cannot agree to pay at that high figure, if it pays also the salaries to the employees.\n\nThe Subt. General will\nObserve that in the letter now under consideration, the party is informed that the Rev. Sister Pacifica has been elected \"Superior\" (it is presumed by this is meant Principal of the Institution) and that other sisters will be appointed to manage the same, and in a previous letter from His Lordship dated the 28th of May last, it is stated that the Principal will select a suitable person to act as foreman and instructor of the boys in industries. The undersigned begs to remark that if the appointment of a Lady Principal at the Institute is approved of, it will be a novel and unprecedented feature connected with the management of Industrial Indian Schools in Canada, and as there will be more pupils to be instructed and\nmanaged therein, it is questionable whether it would be judicious to appoint a female as Principal of the Establishment.\n\nThe remark is made in the letter from the Rt. Rev. Gentleman, that it is hoped no objection will be raised to the representatives of the Roman Catholic Church making a change in the divisions of the building in order to have a room exclusively so used as a chapel, also to additions being made, when necessary, for a bake-house, laundry etc., The undersigned begs to state that in his opinion no changes in the plan of the present building nor additions thereto should be allowed until the proposed changes are submitted to the department through the local agent, are reported on by him, and have been\napproved by the Department\n\nK.

I have the honor to inform your Lordship that it is thought that $130.00 per pupil, per annum, should be sufficient to run the establishment, and also that a man, bona fide, must be appointed Principal of the Institution.\n\nI must add that if the R.C. Church cannot undertake to carry the Institution on at that figure, the Dept will appoint the Principal and other officers\u2014all being of the R.C. faith\u2014and manage the Institution itself, and as regards your Lordship, it is presumed that the remarks School being built to close.\nremarks respecting a desired change in the division of the house in order to have a room to be used exclusively as a chapel for divine worship.

The date fixed for the latter was so done at the request of the Right Rev. Bishop Durie of New Westminster, His Lordship having requested that the Institution be not opened at an earlier date. I have however this day been advised by telegram from the Hon. the Minister of Customs from Revelstoke, that although the school building is ready for pupils and that those interested are anxious to receive instructions to admit pupils immediately, the school has not been opened, and the Minister of Customs...\nstrongly urges that girls, as well as boys, be admitted at once. I have to remind you that the appropriation voted by Parliament for the support of this Institution is $350.00 being for 25 pupils at $14.00 each for the year. I can see no objection whatever to female as well as male pupils being admitted to the Institution, provided the appropriation is not exceeded. You should at once communicate with Bishop Durieu in regard to this matter, and inform him that as the Dept had consented to the School being opened by the 1st Aug., it cannot possibly have any objection to pupils being admitted immediately. The children, it appears to me of a greater age than ten years, should, however, be taken into the Institution, but you will guide yourself in this respect by the rule that has been followed in connection with the other industrial schools in the province.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNew Westminster B.

We are allowed to admit only 25 scholars.\nWe are obliged to have so many employ\u00e9s to see that proper care, order and discipline is established among that number as if there were 50 scholars. And too, your Govern't is aware that the only chance of bringing civilization among Indians is to educate them.\n\nWe had about 500 Indians gathered here for the past holidays, all were pleased beyond measure to see their children so well taken care and brought up at school like white children. That is what made Chief Isidore eloquent who for the first time spoke in favor of the whites; exhorting his people to honesty and peace with the whites who were the first to give so many marks of friendship.\n\nThe whole Community of this district perceive already the influence for good the presence of the Sisters of Charity devoting themselves so generously for the education of the youth had on the whole Mohawk tribe.\nWith these remarks I trust I may\nConfidently request you will ask\nyour Gov't to give permission\nto the Sisters of Charity to admit\nat School, 25 additional pupils\nnext spring.\nI should like to be remembered to you\nworthy Secretary Mr. Parnell whom I\nexpect to meet again with you.\nI hope you are in the enjoyment of\ngood health, and pray the Great Ruler\nabove for your happiness, and to grant you\nlong years for the good of your friends.\nI have the honor to be\nDear Sir,\nVery sincerely yours\nM.

Since December 1890 the full grant has been drawn each quarter and as there is a full attendance at the Institution at present there does not seem to be any chance of their being a balance of the present appropriation on the 30th June next, for, as in addition to the expenditure in my memo of the 21st additional expenditure to the amount of $352.42 has been incurred for a sewing machine, a cooking range and stoves and other furnishings which it was considered absolutely necessary for labor painting the laundry. There will not likely be a\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 189\n\nbalance from the appropriations from the other Industrial Schools in B.C. as the appropriation for the other three schools in operation is $160.00 less than the total appropriation for 1890-91 and accounts amounting to nearly $800.00 have had to be charged to the current year's appropriation which for the Metlakatla Industrial School which should have been charged to last year's account has they been received previous to the 30th June of September last.\n\nJ.M.\n\nfor Act.\nExtract from Mr. Alfred Phillips' Annual Report for 1891\n\n\u2014 Kootenay Industrial School \u2014\n\n\"It was necessary for the Missionary Father Kokolai Cocola to refuse many children as under the present arrangement provision has only been made for a limited number.

This was two years ago & the schools have been built & have been in full working order since that time. The good that the schools are doing among the Indians is incalculable & I have reason to believe the Colonel & his Sister deserve the greatest credit for the admirable manner in which they have conducted these schools, but I repeat & beg the number of children\nProvince of British Columbia\n\nProvincial Secretary's Office,\n\nVictoria B.C.,\n\nbeing so small, only twenty-five, there is a loss of $500 in the last year account. If the number of children allowed were to be doubled, the same staff & the same buildings would be sufficient & the school would then be able to be carried on for an additional rate of $130 per annum.\n\nThe Indians are most anxious to send their children & it is wonderful to see the change in the boys & girls after they have been under the admirable discipline of the Sisters for a year.\n\nNothing but the request may meet with your approval.\n\nI am\n\nYour very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSecy's Branch,\nDec. 6 1892\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Parliament at its last session voted the sum of \u00a36250 towards the maintenance of 50 pupils at \u00a3130 each at the Kootenay Industrial School, being double the grant formerly accorded that institution.\n\nI will be good enough to act as notify the school authorities that they are at liberty to take into the schools the increased number of pupils above stated.\n\nI am not having been informed of this fact at\nan earlier date was apparently due to an oversight in the printing.\n\nA.
