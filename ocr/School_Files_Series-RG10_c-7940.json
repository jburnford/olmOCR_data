NEAR\n\nIt is regretted that I find it necessary to again refer to tires for the school bus. I know, of course, that it is not your fault but I am, as usual, receiving the full force of criticism which rightly belongs elsewhere but, since coming to Muncey, I have certainly learned to accept unearned criticism.\n\nI must advise, however, that I have exhausted all channels of emergency and, unless tires are produced immediately, I shall have but one alternative left - that is the discontinuance of the bus service. Everyone is becoming annoyed particularly the driver as he is continually on the road fixing tires. On account of the Christmas examinations our farm truck is standing idle because I have had to transfer the tires from it to the school bus. For such an important piece of equipment the ruling does seem strange. However, please understand I am not complaining but I must repeat, \"If the tires do not soon arrive the bus service must, of necessity, be discontinued\" which will, of course, mean that the pupils cannot get to school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReferring to the N School and our telephone conversation of December 1st.\n\nLooking over the plan, I notice that there is no provision for eave-troughing which is perhaps overlooked. The building carries a large, fairly deep roof; in wet rainy weather the ground, particularly immediately under the eaves, would develop into mud holes and the water would perhaps find its way into the basement. Mr. Dods of Glencoe was on hand Tuesday and I had him submit an estimate covering a job on this building which is attached. You will note that the price covers 28 gauge material and labour complete, no extras or plus costs.\n\nIf accepted, the work can be proceeded with and finished within the present fiscal year.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGVD/JA\nBelle, dear,\n\nI am writing to you today, Dec. 15/42.\n\nI am enclosing this letter with a gift of $16.00.\n\nWith love,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MSD\nMuncey, Ontario,\nDec. 15, 1947.\n\nATTENTION MR. HILL:\n\nI wish to refer to our telephone conversation of a few days ago when you advised that the purchase of a new school bus had been assured, and that a Purchase Order would shortly be forwarded. In connection with this vehicle and other motor equipment I feel that it is my duty to point out the entire lack of garage accommodation. A new bus of this type should not be committed to the wide open spaces for a garage, and I feel that arrangements should be made to acquire a small piece of land and build the necessary buildings to accommodate two school buses and two trucks being operated for farm and general purpose use. Owing to the fact that general allotments may be insufficient for this year I would suggest that arrangements be made to have the land ready for building early in the 1948-49 fiscal year. Such a building might cost approximately $1,000.00 or $1,200.00 and might be shared equally between education and general welfare.\n\nWith regard to the land there is a plot of approximately 1\u00bd acres, immediately adjacent to the Agency buildings, which I think could be purchased at a reasonable price. These are mere suggestions and submitted for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nS.M. INTENDANT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nDecember 17, 1947.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan\n\nConfirming our telephone conversation re heating of New School.\n\nIn this connection I have contacted Mr. Dodds, of Glencoe, and he advises that he is not a hot water heating mechanic; and that his firm does not interest itself in hot water heating. He also advises that the building can be successfully heated by forced hot air, and that he would be interested in the job and would promise work to commence immediately. This however, would not entirely solve our problem as we still must have some plumbing work done which might be undertaken by Dempsey and Keayes of Delaware. This would keep the work all in the Riding as appears to be the Minister's wishes. Failing this Mr. Dodds again advises that hot water heating is a specialty and not all plumbers are capable of installing a complete job such as the one we have in mind, and the nearest firm that he knows of doing this type of work is in the city of London.\n\nThese are suggestions for your consideration but whatever the final outcome it is very important and very urgent. I would therefore request that no time be lost in arriving at a final decision and that I be advised as soon as possible.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nGWD/BC\nOttawa, December 23, 1947.\n\nMr. George W.

Elgin Indian Day School\n\nReference yours of December 17 -\n\nWe have noted Mr. Dodds' comments concerning hot air heating for this school. We have built this identical school elsewhere. Hot water heating systems have been definitely proven superior for heating and hence this type is specified.

It would be a good thing if the Department would arrange for an early delivery of the blackboards of which I spoke of on my recent visit to Ottawa.\n\nThe electrician has been somewhat slow in commencing work but from a conversation had with him yesterday it is expected he will start at the beginning of this week.\n\nOf the two firms you authorized to obtain tenders from for plumbing only one has seen fit to be interested in the work and that firm has promised to have\ntheir tender in this Office by Monday morning.\n\nThe writer would point out it would be to our advantage for a quick decision on this as the building is now at the stage when the heating and plumbing system should be immediately installed as later on in more advanced stages it would make it a more difficult task for the firm doing the work.\n\nE.P.

Only one of the two firms who are mentioned by the Minister's office has shown an interest in this job (Raines Brothers). Their tender is due at Muncey on Monday and will be forwarded here immediately. Colonel Randle long distanced me on Friday night and asked that every priority be given to the rushing through of Ministerial approval for this tender. I have had to wire authority for Colonel Randle to substitute electrical conduits in lieu of rigid conduit at this school. This is due to the fact that the carpenters are too far ahead of the job and if we had insisted on rigid conduit it would have meant the tearing down of some of the gyproc wall board, etc. The main thing is to send the heating and plumbing tender over to the Minister's office the minute it gets here. When approved, you should wire both Colonel Randle and the contractor in London.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt, of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.S. Also spoke to Mr. Pratt re this.\nIndian Affairs.

Limited, quotation of $1,359.00 for the plumbing installation is not unreasonable in consideration of present day prices and we would recommend that it be accepted.\n\nThe same firm quoted a price of $5,864.00 for a forced hot water heating system, based on the layout prepared by this Division for a similar school at Akasoni. It is our considered opinion that this price is fair and reasonable.\n\nThe forced warm air layout submitted by Robert Dodds, of Clencoe, Ontario, along with his quotation of $3,276.00 is lower than that submitted for the forced hot water system.\n\nHowever, an analysis of the design brings to light several elements open to question and if it were revised and brought into line with present day accepted standards, the cost would be appreciably increased and the difference would, in our opinion, not be worth while.\n\nIt is our recommendation, therefore, that the forced hot water heating system based on our design for Akasoni, which we understand was used by Rhame Bros.

Bande,\nActing Superintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nNanosey, Ontario.\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of the Cost of Operation Returns covering vehicle No. 1156 and the new school bus for the month of February.\n\nIt is noted that the current mileage when added to the previous total mileage gives a final total of 101,162 miles but that you have inadvertently shown the total mileage for the previous month. The departmental records have been adjusted but the foregoing is brought to your attention in order that you may correct your records.\n\nIt is noted that the speedometer on the new bus is out of order and that you state you are unable to secure a cable. As it is most important that the mileage of all departmental vehicles be accurately recorded, it is suggested that you submit a requisition covering the cable required and we will request the Departmental Purchasing Agent to endeavour to purchase the same.\n\nFor purposes of record, please advise us as to the number of miles you estimate this vehicle was operated during the month of February.\n\nR. F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Training.\nOttawa, March 15, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR C.A.F. CLARK\n\nMount Elgin Indian Day School\n\nThis will confirm our conversation with regard to the above Day School. It would seem that relationships between the Principal and his staff are not what we would require and that it will be necessary for you to report upon conditions there in some detail. Apparently Mr. Johnston is not a good disciplinarian and, as a result, there is much freedom between the pupils and their particular teacher. Complaints have been made with regard to his association with the older girls. There is also evidence of too much freedom between the older boys and Mr. Johnston during recess and lunch hours. You can investigate these \"stories\" during your visit there and I wish to be advised as to whether we should contemplate the future employment of this teacher.\n\nI would also like to know just how much teaching Mr. Joblin is doing. We are now paying four teachers at this school and I would like to know exactly what the teaching load of each teacher is. You might also check as to the number of visits which Mr. Joblin has made to the day schools of the agency.\n\nThe third point which I wish reported on is with respect to the contemplated construction of a one-room school at Rock Settlement. I would like a specific report from you as to where this new school can best be located. You can also investigate the question of land required for such a building. It will be our standard one-room school plan and I would suggest that you mail ahead a set of the plans, specifications and bill of materials for this project. I would like to have this school\nconstructed on a day labour basis, using the present foreman at the Mount Elgin Day School as the foreman for the one-room school. However, you can check into this matter with Colonel Randle when you are at Caradoc. It would be necessary to allow at least two months for requisitions to pass through the Departmental Purchasing Agent's hands and to arrive on the spot at Back Settlement. We would endeavour to rush the cement so that the excavation could be proceeded with.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMuncy, Ontario,\nMar. 12, 1948.\n\nRe: New School, Caradoc Agency\n\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that when plans were made for the heating of the new school no one apparently gave any consideration to the installation of a stoker to be attached to the boiler. It is understood that a boiler of the type to be installed by the contractors should, to be economically and efficiently run, have a stoker rather than be fired by hand which would mean constant attention by the caretaker while in operation, and the use of a more expensive quality of coal.\n\nConsequently it would appear beneficial all around to have a stoker installed while the contractors are there placing the heating system for the entire school; and we are advised by Rhame Brothers that they could supply and install a suitable automatic stoker, placed ready for operation, for $791.00.\n\nMay this Office please be advised if the Department will authorize such an expenditure, as evidently it is in the interest of efficient and economic heating of the new school.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEPR/JA\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 13)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 23, 1948.\n\nLt.-Col.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWhile I have been going to Muncey some weeks now, - as my time there was somewhat limited most of the time was given to office matters, such as correspondence, interviews and general routine.\n\nI did, of course, visit the new school each week to see how things were progressing, or discuss some angles with the foremen, - but not having much time assumed that as there were regular plans, everything was provided for.\n\nWho drew up the plans I do not know, but since this week, having more time, there was an opportunity to go into things, - it appears to me there are some essential things not provided for, which in my opinion should be included.\n\nFor instance, there are four large class rooms, and in addition a manual training room and one for home economics. This means four teachers are there daily, and possibly two more, apart from the Supervising Principal, and yet there is no provision for a teachers' room where they can retire to when lessons are halted or to have lunch. This appears a great oversight to me, as they need rest and relaxation out of the schoolroom, as none of the children go home for lunch like an ordinary day school, so the teachers will get little privacy or rest.\n\nThen while there appears to be one washroom provided evidently for the teachers, - if both sexes are there, as is likely, it would appear there should be two.\n\nThen with regard to the children's toilets, - apparently the plans call for outside ones, with a septic tank serving both, - but actually, I understand,\n(and quite rightly so) it is intended now to have them inside.\n\nThis may raise some structural difficulties, as the basement is below ground level quite a bit, and it appears they would have to be raised up to obtain proper operation of the septic tanks.\n\nIt also means there must be two septic tanks instead of one, - as the boys and girls could not now be arranged anywhere adjacent to each other, and as far as can be seen will have to be more or less at opposite ends, - which means one would have too long a flow to operate from one tank.\n\nAlso the provision of these toilets for the children will entail extra expense, as they were not in the plans, - and as the contract given to Hame Bros. for plumbing was based only on the original plans. I, of course, did not realize this at the time, for the reasons outlined at the beginning of this letter, and evidently no-one in Ottawa took it into consideration when the contract was being considered.\n\nPersonally, it is my opinion with the room there was available, had all these things been considered and planned from the start they could have been fitted in conveniently and suitably.\n\nNow of course, it may be possible to place them in, - but it will cut things up in a far less suitable manner, and make for awkwardness, for while there is considerable space, it is now in the wrong locations.\n\nYou might please give this matter early thought and consideration, and actually I would prefer either you or Mr. Phelan to run down next Thursday or Friday and meet me there just to discuss these things on the spot, and see if we could not plan somehow to work in some of these essential needs, and the extra cost they would entail.\n\nLt.-Col.E.P.Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nNew Caradoc School.\n\nPhoto #4\nH.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 13)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Butler:\n\nPlumbing, New Caradoc Day School:\n\nBy those who have recently examined the school to look into the suggestions made in Colonel Russell's letter of March 13th, it is recommended that rest rooms for teachers be provided in the spaces available at the base in each stairway at the classroom level; each rest room to contain a toilet bowl, wash basin and mirror.\n\nSanitary conveniences for the pupils can, it is considered, be best provided at ground level; for girls at the Home Economics room entrance; for boys at the Manual Training room entrance.\n\nThe plans provide for a covered-in lean-to over these sanitary entrances. These outside structures were to be 12'8\" long, 5'8\" wide, and sloping from a height of 10'6\" from below the classroom windows to a height of 5' at the outer wall.\n\nIt is proposed to prolong these lean-tos to the full length of the end walls (45'9\") and after allowing for an outside door and steps leading down from the outside entrance and another flight of steps down from the washroom, a space 20' by 5' is available for plumbing fixtures. The girls' washroom would have four toilet bowls, four wash-basins and mirrors, two hot-water radiators, lights, two windows 3' x 1'.\n\nThe boys' washroom would be along similar lines.\n\nA drawing is attached showing toilet compartments 4'2\" by 2'6\". Modifications for the boys' room are shown in red.\n\nAs shown in the accompanying photos, there are no yet no steps or retaining wall at the Manual Training room entrance. This construction may proceed according to the plan which I have attached. At the other end, the\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is indicated in photos #2 and #4.\n\nPhoto #3 shows that there is still a considerable supply of cinder blocks (four piles). The structure recommended will need a total of about 1100 blocks.\n\nThe original plans called for one toilet, but it is not yet on the premises.\n\nThe immediate purchase of the aforementioned items appears indicated.\n\n- Cement, 150 bags.\n- Cinder blocks to bring number on hand to 1100.\n- Asphalt shingles (green) for roofs: 1000 sq. ft.\n- Extra doors (and compartment walls): 12\n- Windows 3' x 1' (transom type): 4\n- (Other windows will be obtained from present basement walls).\n- Toilet units: (teachers 2, boys 2, girls 4): 8\n- Urinal (5 ft. length): 1\n- Wash basins: (teachers 2, boys 4, girls 4): 10\n- Water taps (hot & cold): 20\n- Drinking fountains (classroom floor): 2\n- Radiators (hot-water type) 2 in each pupil's lavatory: 4\n- Mirrors 18\" x 12\" (above each wash-basin): 10\n- Electric light fixture: teachers' rooms, 2 each; pupils' lavatories, 2 each: 8\n\nExtra water pipe.\nExtra heating pipe.\nExtra wiring.\nExtra ears-trafficking (100 ft.)\n\nC.A.T.

It was placed there in 1947, I have just found out that it is an old stove which was removed from the home of Mr. Down when a new one was purchased last year, it is not in good enough shape to be used for Home economics.\n\nThere is a large blanket loom in the old school also, there is apparently no intention of using it here so I would suggest it be transferred to some other school in the near future.\nMr. Jgblin mentioned the possibility of finding a position as teacher for Mrs. Ruben Schuyler, who is apparently the only qualified Indian teacher from this reservation. I think the idea is sound; it would act as an incentive to other young people on the reserve to endeavour to improve their own chances of getting a position with the Branch.\n\nThe reports on Miss Morris are not very encouraging for the older pupils; she appears to be good with the junior forms but poor with the senior forms. I understand that none of the older pupils will graduate this year.\n\nI have had some conversation with Miss Mrs. Harledge regarding a telephone account; the matter is partially settled but an amount of about $6.50 is still outstanding. I am seeing the telephone people some time this week and will try to get it cleared up. I do not think the this lady should be allowed to return to the agency; her influence has been quite upsetting and is obvious before you have been here a few hours. She is in Montreal at the present time, and I would recommend that she be interviewed in Ottawa and either placed elsewhere or her services be dispensed with. It is going to be hard for the new superintendent here under any circumstances and any source of friction ought to be removed.\n\nNo arrangements were made last year of goods to provide the children with a hot lunch; this should be rectified and either an amount of money made available or the superintendent advised to requisition for the supplies needed.\n\nAll the lawns are in poor shape, untidy and long grass; it would improve the whole set up if these could be kept in better shape and help to inculcate neatness among the pupils.\n\nThe water coolers are being collected to be stored at the agency building; the new bus is being put up for the holidays, but it will be necessary to use the old one for some time transporting materials for repair work.\n\nThe janitor ought to have a tool chest with a supply of the necessary tools for general repairs; I would suggest that Mr. Doucett be asked to make a list of the tools that might be needed.\n\nThe requisitions for supplies for next year are being collected and mailed to you as they arrive.\nI have made the recommendation in the earlier part of this report that the colours of the paint inside the classrooms be changed to White and Light tan for the lower part of the walls, I think this would be an improvement on the present green and white or cream and green as they are painted at present.\n\nHas the question of heating the schools with oil ever been brought up; I think it would be more economical here and give a better range of heat control.\n\nThe old school bus which was secured from War Assets is not in very good shape, in fact it is in need for repairs to the radiator, it was blocked and the last day of school could be only be driven a few miles at a time due to it boiling; a requisition is being sent in for a set of wrenches for this truck, it is apparently different from the general run as it was a converted army truck.\n\nI realize the above report is very lengthy, but I thought it was necessary as much of this work will have to be initiated from Ottawa during the interim until a new superintendent is appointed, the most urgent thing at the moment is a set of tools and authority to purchase or an order placed for paint and brushes.\n\nYours very truly\n\nF.

We have already received payment for the Chevrolet truck.\n\nWith regard to the sewing machine, it is a small machine and I think it should be worth $25.00.\n\nAs far as the work tables and chairs in the sewing room are concerned, I shall leave you and Mr. Phelan to put a price on these.\n\nWe shall make no charge for the articles left in the library.\n\nWith regard to the crosscut saws and other articles which were left around the farm and buildings, I think we should get something for these, but I am not sure how much they are worth, except the 25 tons of stoker coal. This is coal which you are now using and which you would have had to purchase.\n\nWe shall also be glad if you will put a price on the power tools in the manual training shop, which I understand were purchased by Mr. Strapp.\n\nWe shall appreciate your giving this matter your attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nArticles purchased or taken over by the Department,\nfrom Mount Elgin Indian Residential School\n\nPurchased for the office at Muncey-\nAdding Machine $10.00\nTypewriter desk\n\nPurchased for school office-\nBook-case (sectional) $25.00\nFiling cabinet $25.00\nOffice desk and chair $25.00\nSecond office chair $5.00\n\nPurchased by agreement with Mr. Phelan and Dr. Dorey-\n4 work tables from sewing-room 3' x 8'\n2 = = = = 4' x 8'\n26 chairs\n\nLeft for school use-\nLibrary set - oak, first-class condition -\nTable 3' x 6'\n3 chairs, 1 armchair (total 4)\nLibrary cupboard and shelves, glass doors,\n\nLeft for use around the farm and buildings-\n2 crosscut saws\n10 garden hoses\n12 garden rakes\n12 garden forks\n1 post-hole auger\n15 lbs. axle grease, Mica\n1 oil pump (on drum)\n1 log chain\n1 cordwood saw blade, 28\"\n6 pitch forks\n2 mowthongs\n2 electric fence chargers\n25 tons stoker coal - approx.\n1 extension ladder, 30 ft.\n1 step ladder, 10 ft.\n1 truck tarpaulin\n\nPower tools in manual training shop-\nDelta saw and jointer; \u00bd H.P. motor\nAtlas metal lathe; \u00bd H.P. motor\nBand saw and spindle shaper, motor missing (1 H.T.)\nDriver jig saw; \u00bd H.P. motor\n2 grinding and polishing heads\nAir compressor; \u00bd H.P. motor\n1 emery wheel, \u00bd H.P., motor\nOther motors, 1/8, \u00bd H.P.\n\nChevrolet truck $265.00 paid\n\n40 cots, with mattress and pillow @ $1. - $40.00\n\nIndian Affairs.

As soon as he returns arrangements will be made to pay for them.\n\nPlease forward three accounts as follows:\n\n1.

The day I was there the windows were being installed. As directed, the Agent is making inquiries from the firms whose names he has been given with reference to securing the wiring and the furnace.\n\nIt was found that water can be obtained easily from the pipe line leading from the former residential school and consequently it was decided to proceed with the installation of indoor toilets. Mr. Down will have a septic tank constructed.\n\nIf the electric wiring and furnace can be obtained in the near future, this building should be completed by the end of March, 1948.\n\nI wish to again direct your attention to the old residential school. I still feel that this building should be demolished at the earliest possible date. In this connection I attach copy of a memorandum that I made on May 30th, 1946. At that time it was decided not to take any action. Several of the windows have been smashed and if the building is allowed to remain much longer, it will be a continual source of trouble.

Gray,\nIndian Affairs.\n\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School\n\nThe attached files concern the main building formerly occupied by students attending the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nIn 1926, when this building was erected, various Indian bands that were served by the school contributed $10,000.00 from their funds towards the capital expenses. Since that time, the Department has expended from Parliamentary Appropriation for buildings and improvements a sum in excess of $130,000.00.\n\nIn 1915 fire destroyed some of the outbuildings and pursuant to the collection of insurance $7,500.00 was repaid to the band funds leaving an equity of only $11,000.00.\n\nThis school building was condemned two years ago and is no longer in use by the Department or by the Indians. We have erected a new day school a short distance away and intend opening this school during the summer of 1948. We are still continuing to use the separate classroom block of the old school.\n\nIt has been recommended that this old main building (not the separate classroom block) be declared surplus and turned over to our Assets Corporation as surplus government property. The point at issue is whether or not we have the authority to do this, in view of the Indians' equity in these buildings.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 21st, 1947\n\nMr. Downes,\nMuncie Indian Reserve,\nMUNCEY, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur representative Mr. Carl Grosskurth has requested that we send you information and prices on our Standard ARMCO STELOX Buildings for use as rural school houses.\n\nProper insulation is perhaps the best solution to any heating problem. STELOX Buildings are adaptable to standard forms of insulation and we recommend that the following practice be followed:\n\nWalls: Walls may be insulated in any number of ways by the use of rock-wool batts, Alfoil or Micro Cell Aluminum sheets tacked to furring strips previously nailed to the panel ribs and then covered with wall board for the interior finish. An insulant that does not retain or build up moisture is recommended. It is imperative that a vapour seal be used in insulating both the walls and ceiling.\n\nCeiling: We recommend that our Standard STELOX ceiling be used with some form of insulation placed above the panel ribs. As an alternative 2\" x 4\" joists supported on angles in the same manner as the STELOX ceiling may be used. With this second method a vapour seal must be used above and below the joists.\n\nSTELOX Buildings may be placed on timber sills or concrete foundations depending on the type required. Adequate light is obtained from large windows and proper cubic volume by a 12' wall height.\n\nBased on the above recommendations and suggestions we wish to quote as follows:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 14)\nNovember 20th, 1947\n\nMr. Downie\n\nOne ARMCO Standard STEELOX Building: 26' wide\n40' long\n12' high\n\ncomplete with:\n\n- 2 - #3668 single swing doors\n- 5 - B24 sash including glass putty etc.\n- 5 - #211AL commercial projected sash including glass, putty etc.\n- 4 - 1-2L Louvred panels\n- 1 - Ridge ventilator\n- 1 - 24 x 40 STEELOX Ceiling complete with all supports\n\nSelling price f.o.b., Guelph $2,352.62\n(without ceiling) $1,891.42\n\nThe above building is based on a similar design in North York. The completed cost including erection, insulating, painting, etc., would be about $4,500.00. The enclosed literature illustrates our buildings. If we can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to let us know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nARMCO DRAINAGE & METAL PRODUCTS OF CANADA LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.F. Runge/eb\nMuncey, Ontario,\nNov. 28, 1947.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. HILL\n\nDuring your recent visit to the area I will recall that I mentioned portable steel buildings which might be the answer to the building problem of new Indian Day Schools; also added classroom space where necessary but I did not have any literature on the subject. I have since been in touch with Mr. Grosekurth, Western Ontario Representative for the Armco Drainage & Metal Products, Guelph, Ontario, and he has co-operated by forwarding complete information which I attach for your personal consideration with Mr. Newby. Should it not meet with your approval or consideration, I am requesting that you please return it.\n\nYou will note that the steel is made up of interlocking sheets which can be easily assembled on the site. They are also available in any size height or length to meet the requirements of each individual school. The buildings are treated to prevent fire and rotting. Whenever they are placed on land, it is proper for maximum light with no overhanging roofs where necessary. An outstanding feature of this type of building is that it is 90 per cent fire proof.\n\nYou will also recall that I mentioned a school of this type was recently built in North York. It is only 30' x 15' on the ground floor including erection, insulating, etc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 14)\npainting etc., was approximately $4,500.00.

Such kits, at one time, were a regular piece of equipment of all our schools but the practice seems to have been dropped. I took the matter up with Dr. Wiebe and he feels that it is unwise to leave such materials exposed in the classrooms and suggests that each school be supplied with a small cabinet under lock and key and the personal supervision of the teacher. As far as I am aware the small kits were always under the personal supervision of the teacher but no cabinets were provided.\n\nHowever, the suggestion is a good one and lends itself to a lesson of cleanliness and hygiene. I would therefore suggest, if it may be approved, that each school be provided with a small cabinet\u2014say about 12\" x 12\" x 6\". I do not know what they would cost but suggest that you may have placed them in other areas; if so you would know the source of supply and could perhaps order seven such cabinets. If you do not know of a firm, please advise and, if necessary, I will endeavour to purchase the requirement.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nGWD/JA\n\nIndian Affairs.

OERT,\nDepartmental Solicitor.\n\nFormer Mount Elgin Indian Residential School Building -\n\nThe attached files concern the main building formerly occupied by students attending the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nIn 1896, when this building was erected, various Indian bands that were served by the school contributed $19,000.00 from their funds towards the capital expense. Since that time, the Department has expended from Parliamentary Appropriation for buildings and improvements a sum in excess of $130,000.00.\n\nIn 1925 fire destroyed some of the outbuildings and pursuant to the collection of insurance $7,400.00 was repaid to the band funds leaving an equity of only $11,600.00.\n\nThis school building was condemned two years ago and is no longer in use by the Department or by the Indians. We have erected a new day school a short distance away and intend opening this school during the summer of 1948. We are still continuing to use the separate classroom block of the old school.\n\nIt has been recommended that this old main building (not the separate classroom block) be declared surplus and turned over to War Assets Corporation as surplus government property. The point at issue is whether we have the authority to do this, in view of the Indians' equity in these buildings.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI wish to refer to your letter of March 15th wherein you refer to various pieces of equipment at the former Mohawk Residential School. In this connection you will recall that we purchased, complete with mattresses and pillows, 40 cots for distribution among aged, sick and needy Indians. Some have been given out when the occasion arose; if necessary the remainder will be disposed of as soon as possible.\n\nWith regard to the kitchen range it was my impression that Mr. Arnell had discussed the matter with you with a view to possible disposal. It is a large kitchen cooking range suitable only for domestic or institutional purposes. It is in very good condition, although after two years' idleness in a damp basement, it shows signs of surface rust. If the cost of transportation were not prohibitive it might be made available for any Residential School where one is required. It is approximately 6 feet long, 4\u00bd to 5 feet high with 3 or 4 ovens and several top heating lids.\n\nReference is also made to an extractor and wringer in the old laundry. There seems of equipment, among many others not mentioned, were left after the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman had had his choice of pieces which were transferred to the Mohawk Institute. All equipment is of the commercial type and would be suitable only for commercial laundries or institutions of work. However, I do not think it is all a little the worst for wear and in need of repairs. I would say that with the trouble of dismantling and repair the various pieces would hardly be worth salvage.\n\nWhile we are on this subject it appears that much has been overlooked, although Mr. Arnell's attention was drawn to it many times. There are several bath tubs of the old rolled top style, in not too good a condition, and many of them are badly chipped. I have suggested, and still suggest, that they be disposed of fairly but at advantage when they may help our Indian people or if they cannot be disposed of without payment, that a small nominal charge be made for each one.\n\nThere are also many odds and ends too numerous to mention, such as pumps, pulleys, line shafts, a gasoline engine and many other moveable fixtures. I do not,\nknow what is being done in the disposal of this building but I have been told that appraisers were on the spot a few weeks ago and they found the proposition a little larger than they expected and that they would return at a later date. My conclusion is that it is a big job and the valuation on the various places for disposal would hardly compensate for the work involved. However, if you wish I will enumerate the pieces I think could be disposed of to advantage. If I were asked for my own personal opinion, providing a convenient place otherwise could be arranged for the building, I would say that the entire outfit be turned over to the War Assets Corporation for disposal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Elgin Residential School. In this connection I am a little confused as to what action I should take. Since my letter of April 2, 1948, Mr. Rock, representing the War Assets Corporation, of Toronto, was here and advised that the main building was transferred to his Department in January, 1948, for disposal. His instructions in the matter were apparently a little vague in that it mentioned only one building and did not mention equipment of any kind. He, however, decided to take inventory but just what he listed I do not know. I am wondering whether he took the bath tubs in. I am also wondering whether or not you were advised at the time the building was transferred.\n\nUnder the circumstances I thought it advisable to contact you before disposing of the tubs, 11 in number. There are also a few wash basins, cupboards and tables which might be disposed of in the same way to our Indian people. In addition there are six electric light fixtures, quite old fashioned, which I have been offered $1.00 apiece for. I think the price\noffered is fair. This is all that might be disposed of in the main building.\n\nThere are, however, some pieces of equipment in the old laundry but to date it would not appear that this building has been turned over to the War Assets, although Mr. Rock is writing his Department in an endeavour to have them clarify the matter. The question at the moment is - Shall I proceed as instructed in your letter of April 24th? Also advise whether or not I may dispose of the electric light fixtures.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, July 30, 1948.\n\nMessrs. G.N. Weekes & Sons,\nSolicitors,\n396 Ridout Street,\nLondon, Ontario.\n\nAttention - Mr. G.N. Weekes\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFormer Mount Elgin Indian Residential School\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 23rd and your telegram of July 28th concerning the above school buildings and the property on which they are located.\n\nThe school buildings are located not on the 200 acres described in Surrender 58C but on the 4 acres described in Surrender 58B, copy of which is attached. Both these Surrenders were signed on February 13th, 1849. At the same time, Surrenders 58D and 58E were signed.\n\nThe dormitory block of the old school, erected by the Canadian Wesleyan Methodist Conference and Missionary Society was destroyed by fire. In 1896 the Department built another dormitory block in order that a residential school could be continued at Mount Elgin.\n\nA few years ago, this block was condemned by Departmental Engineers as it was in a condition dangerous to the school children. It was found that the brick arches were flattening and dislodging brick along\nthe underside of the arch. This loosening was caused by the settlement of the building at the north end, thus removing the lateral support over the arches. Before building another dormitory block, it was decided to have a thorough educational survey made to determine the type of educational facilities which would best serve the Caradoc Indians.\n\nThis survey was made by a Provincial School Inspector and by the Reverend E.E.M. Joblin, M.A., of the United Church of Canada (now supervising principal of the Caradoc Schools). Acting upon the recommendations made in this survey, it was decided to close the Mount Elgin Residential School and to open a new consolidated day school.\n\nAction was immediately taken to begin the erection of a four-room consolidated school completely modern in every respect. This building is now practically finished. It is situated near the old residential school buildings.\n\nWe have provided two school buses both in charge of qualified Indian drivers. The children are transported daily to and from the consolidated school. A competent staff of qualified teachers has been conducting classes up to Grade I in the old classroom block. These classes will, of course, be conducted next year in the new building.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Joblin who has an M.A., in Education from the University of Toronto, has been appointed Supervising Principal and is concerned with the work of the day schools and the new consolidated school. He has the confidence of the two Provincial School Inspectors who visited the schools of the reserve and they have both expressed their pleasure at the manner in which progress is being made in our educational system at Caradoc.\n\nIn a report dated May 20, 1948, School Inspector Young made the following comments:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\"As the experiment advances, we see more and more benefits coming to the Indian Young People by reason of our policy. In the wider field of supervision of the Senior School, I think that Mr. Jolin has done a splendid piece of work.\"\n\nWe realize the need for agricultural instruction for these young Indians. At the present time we are negotiating with a qualified teacher who is a young veteran and a graduate of the Ontario Agricultural College, and hope to add him to our Caradoc teaching staff next year.\n\nIn view of the condemnation of the old dormitory block erected by the Department and the building of a new school, it was decided to declare this building surplus and to request War Assets Corporation to have it demolished.\n\nYou will note that we have not declared surplus the old classroom block or so-called Annex Building. This was erected in 1931 and enlarged in 1956. It contains three classrooms and living quarters for the teaching staff.\n\nWith regard to the 200 acres of land in Surrender 360, it was the intention to operate a model community welfare farm to be farmed by the Indians for the benefit of the aged and indigent Indians and for the instruction of young Indians in farming methods and techniques. Because of the lack of a farming instructor and the illness of former Superintendent Down, it was decided to delay this project until a new Superintendent and farming instructor were appointed.\n\nA farming instructor is now at Caradoc and the Civil Service Commission is advertising for a\nnew Superintendent. Therefore, it is our intention, in due course, to discuss these proposals with the Caradoc Indian Council.\n\nYou will find that Section II of the Indian Act refers to the taking of lands for school purposes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nBFM/MCD\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nJuly 9th, 1946.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Agency Schools\n\nVOTE 916 ALLOTMENT 10-691 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Indian Office, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nPurpose for which required: CARADOC AGENCY SCHOOLS\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL   |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| 35       | Galls.

E. Morris, Regional Supervisor, Mr. E.M. Joblin, Principal, and myself. We felt that 140 desks were needed in the new school of which 40 could be secured from the old school.\n\nTo-day I was in contact again with Mr. Joblin and we feel that if the Department would be willing to replace the same next year that an additional 25 seats could be transferred from the old school for temporary use but the others in use at present, we believe, should be discarded. Many of them are double seats.\n\nIt would be unfair to the teachers to ask them to continue using the present desks.\n\nWe trust this will clarify the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would appear that if we supplied forty or forty-five new desks that this number would be sufficient to handle the situation for the balance of the current academic year at least.\n\nIncidentally, we would like to know the date on which you consider the school can be opened.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, it seems to us, and we believe it was the opinion of Mr. Morris and Mr. Joblin, that the rooms should be properly equipped. The rooms are of a size to accommodate approximately 35 pupils, hence we requested 140 desks for the four rooms.\n\nNo doubt you are aware of the increase in enrolment in these schools as the season progresses, therefore the October enrolment is not necessarily a true picture of the situation.\n\nWith the requests of Mr. Morris and Mr. Joblin, and our previous correspondence in your hands along with our opinions expressed herein, we would suggest you send the desks deemed proper by the Department.\n\nAs to the date on which the school can be opened, it is difficult to say. It has been two years or more since commencement of building and it seems difficult to get the necessary supplies to complete the plumbing. However, we hope to open by January 1, 1949.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall, Supt.\nNovember 30, 1948.\n\nMr. Fred Hall,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd instant with further reference to desks for the new Caradoc School.\n\nAs intimated in official letter of November 13th, we feel that if forty-five new desks are supplied at the present time, it should be sufficient to meet the requirements until after the end of the present fiscal year at least.\n\nOur funds are limited and consequently we do not wish to purchase more desks than are actually needed between now and the end of March.\n\nWe intend to supply single chair desks and they are made in three sizes, namely, large, medium and small. Please let me know the number of each size that you require to make the total of forty-five new desks.\n\nBernard T. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/ECO\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is going to try to interest the Minister in visiting your agency on this occasion so that he might officially open the new building.\n\nAs soon as we receive definite information as to whether the Minister will accept this invitation, we will write you further. Mr. McCubbin has suggested that the official opening be held in the evening and that a small dance be held after the ceremonies are finished. At official openings in the past, the programme has usually fallen into three main parts:\n\n(1) A short concert by school children, accompanied by display of work.\n\n(2) Official opening ceremonies and short address by the Minister.\n\n(3) Refreshments and social evening.\n\nI would like to suggest that you discuss this matter at some length with your Supervising Principal and let me have your comments in the near future as to the type of programme and probable cost of putting on such a short entertainment.\n\nBernard T.

(RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 15)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThis is in reply to your letter dated March 1, 1949 wherein you state that the purchase price of the house ($250.00) was paid to the Chippewa Band Fund Trust Account & Co. I presume that the same has been done with regards to the house sold to Master Hendrick.\n\nI am curious to know upon what authority or for what reason this money was paid into the Band Funds. The fact that the house is situated on what was Band land has been established. However, I believe that it is an undisputed fact that both houses were built for the use of employees of the Mt. Elgin Residential School. It would seem that the money for the construction of these houses was provided by either the Department or the Church or by both. Most definitely it was not provided from Band Funds.\n\nIn view of these facts I feel that the houses were intended for the benefit of the school. Our present school is\ncarrying on in the place of the Residential School and should inherit to some degree what had been bestowed upon the latter by both the Department and the Church. Besides, the Band as well as the other Bands of this Reserve will benefit from the improvements in the grounds and surroundings of the New School whereas money into the Band Fund cannot possibly radiate such broad benefits.\n\nFor the above stated reasons I would ask that the decision to pay this money into Band Funds be reconsidered and that instead it be paid to the Office so as need to improve the grounds and surroundings of the New Mt. Elgin Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nPH/JA\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Day School\n\nThus far it has been impossible to provide hot lunches for the pupils of this school because there are no stoves, hot plates or other cooking equipment. However, it has been the custom for many of the pupils to purchase a pint bottle of chocolate milk for the mid-day meal. This milk is delivered daily at the school at a cost of 5\u00a2 per bottle.\n\nMr. Joblin states that the children bring good lunches, come to school in heated buses and are housed in a comfortable building. Unfortunately many of them do not drink milk at home, hence this opportunity to provide them with milk seems to be well worth taking advantage of. We thought that the grant toward hot lunches might be used to subsidize the purchase of milk and thus aid in seeing that each child receives a just share throughout the year.\n\nYour comments on this proposal will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6209, file 468-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nto our disadvantage is not to us a matter of surprise, for it is not the first time. The Department has always been our protector when any encroachment has been attempted.\n\nIt is only a few years since the Department was petitioned to have the roadway west side of the farm proper enlarged by taking about 4 rods off the farm from the North to the South. On investigation by Agent Dingman it was ordered that there be no change. We had hoped then that matters were settled for all time to come. Since then at large expense we have gravelled the roads and renewed fences making things permanent.\n\nWe are sure that the Department before consenting to any change from the original bounds fixed by a properly authorized survey in 1864, when this was comparatively a wilderness, will consider the strength of our claim, and the manner in which the land has been used to a great extent of cultivation.\n\nOne of the reasons assigned for the re-survey is the supposition that we have more than the 264 acres. But according to our own measurement we have not, but let that be as it may. If the new survey had shown that we had less than the 264 acres we would simply have been referred to our title, which calls for 264 acres more or less. At the same time if the new survey is correct and if we have more than the 264 acres does not our title allow it?\n\nAgain a glance at the map of the new survey will show you that it takes off a large strip of the North side of the farm. This strip includes our Carpenter and Shoe shop, lumber shed, Recreation Hall and one farm residence together with nearly all the boy's play grounds. All of which has always been re-\nmarked as the property of the Institution with the exception of a road way leading to the ford and what is called the Walnut park sloping from that road down to the river about 2 acres. Would the Society and would the Department have authorized the erection of these buildings on said land if not included in our title?\n\nI want to just here speak of what I think led to a mistake in the new survey. It is this, the river is constantly encroaching upon the Walnut park so much so that nearly half the amount has gone away in our 16 years. How much it has changed since 1847 until our time we cannot just say but the bed of the river has changed at least 50 ft. in the 16 years. This slide has necessitated moving the road at top of the hill leading to the ford back on the boy's play-ground. So that the second fence has had to be removed in 10 years. The mistake seems to me to have been made by the survey taking a point as far back from the river bank as the one that was taken in 1849, while the river in that time must have moved some 75 ft.\n\nYou ask what concessions we would be willing to make in order to satisfy the Indians. I have not had any conversation with the Indians touching this new survey with the exception of Chief John Henry, whom I consulted privately since receiving your letter of March 23rd\u2014to find out what led up to the new survey and how far the Indians were dissatisfied with the present boundaries of the Institution farm. He says the Indians are not dissatisfied, but that the agitation for the re-survey was brought on just before the local elections for chief, by one who was then a member of the council and was ambitious to be elected Head Chief and thought this scheme...\nof curtailing the Institution property would make him popular with the band and secure his election. The other councilors did not like to oppose it on the eve of an election for fear of their seats and it carried by a small majority. Now Mr. Henry says the proof that the Indians are not dissatisfied is seen in that they did not elect that man as chief, nor give him any official position in the council.\n\nIn regard to making any concessions to the Indians. The road for the present will have to be continued with gates though it is moved in on the Institution property from where it was. The prospect is that in a short time a bridge will be built connecting the two reserves. It is now being agitated and will be either on the reserves or adjacent to them when built this road may profitably be closed up. The Walnut park never did belong to us but has been used by the Institution and could not well be used by any body else as the Institution has a Government lease of the land across from it and it is included in that as a pasture. The most they could expect is rent for the 2 acres which is not worth the name.\n\nThe fence is not on the line of the 23 acre piece across the road from the Institution proper. Whoever built the fence took in about an acre more than belongs to use. The fence should be rebuilt and it is my intention to put it on the line where it should be some time this fall.\n\nThere can be no question but that the river on the North and East after you pass the little park and the ford for Ovide was intended to be the boundary in that direction and the road on the West side of the farm proper the boundary in that direction. So that the only thing remaining is the slight excess in the 22.5 acre field and that on the North we hope\nto correct as before stated.\n\nHoping that you will deem it advisable to pronounce this settled for all time to come I am\n\nmost respectfully yours,\n\nW.W. Shepherd\n14 April 1879\n\nWith reference to the Rev. Mr. Shepherd's letter of the 1st inst., I beg to report that the present boundaries of the National School Model Farm are not in accordance with the survey, but if Mr. Shepherd can substantiate his statement to the effect that the present boundaries are what were originally given after being properly surveyed, it would certainly be a strong point in his favor, as original survey marks must govern.\n\n2. Where two parties are interested in a boundary line either party may request and have a survey made of such boundary.\n\n3. There is no doubt that the Carpenter and Shoe shops, lumber shed, Recreation Hall and one farm residence are on surrendered lands.\n\n4. The re-survey is correct to the best of my knowledge and belief, and Mr. Shepherd cannot be allowed to state, as he alleged, that there is a mistake in the new survey. If he is dissatisfied with my survey, he should engage another Surveyor at his own expense to prove the correctness or incorrectness of it before making such a statement.\n\nJ. D.

Mr. Shepherd may be correct in his contention of what part of the river was originally intended to be the boundary on the north and east side, but there is no circumventing the fact that the Institution can have no legal title to uncedared Indian lands.\n\n7. I would suggest that Agent McDougall be communicated with and requested to state his views on the subject.\n\n8.

Accordingly Mr. Green was sent for the purpose. His report is here-\nwith. The land between the Institute is 204 acres as will be seen on reference to Surrenders 831 and 841 attached.\n\nIt will be observed that according to Mr. Green's survey he gives the quantity of land under the Surrenders as 203.20 acres, still leaving an overplus of 30 acres claimed by the Institute and not covered by a Surrender. Upon discussing the matter with Mr. Green, the undersigned considers that a compromise might be made with the Indians whereby they could be secured in the land marked in red on the 22.50 acre plot, together with the Walnut Grove Road, which leads to the ford across the River Thames and which is used by the Oneidas and Chippe-\nwas passing to and fro. This would necessitate a Surrender from the Indians for the remainder of the land to be held by the Institute for the same purpose as that given under the original Surrenders, and would also necessitate changing their fences so as to secure the Indians in the other land referred to.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is very probably that the said side hill was considered, at the time of the original survey, to be of little or no value, and the boundary of the Institute's lands was then defined along the top of the bank, and not along the edge of the river.\n\nThe Indians have made no request that the said land should be vacated by the Institute, and it appears that only a small portion of the said strip could be utilized by them, but after a request made to them, they have decided that they will not surrender the land, in order that it may be legally occupied by the Institute.\n\nIt would evidently be a great hardship to compel the Institute to vacate this land, this new date.\nUnder the circumstances, it might be advisable to simply let the matter drop, but as a feeling of unrest and dissatisfaction would continue, I would recommend that Mr. Shepherd be informed that the Department does not at present intend to take away the use of this strip of land from the Institute, but that he should endeavour to arrive, as soon as possible, at a satisfactory arrangement with the Indians, in order to place the matter on a proper footing.\n\nMr. Shepherd should also be informed that he should place the fences of the Institute on the correct lines, as soon as this may be conveniently done.\n\nI would also recommend that the Indians be informed through their Agent, that the Department regrets that they have refused to make the desired Surrender, and that in view of the fact that the Institute has been long in occupation of these lands, it would be unjust and unfair to take this land from the Institute, and would therefore advise them to come to some mutually satisfactory understanding regarding the matter, with the Principal, Mr. Shepherd.\nOttawa 15th October, 1897.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 3rd August last regarding the re-survey of the lands held by the Mount Elgin Institute, I have to inform you that the tow-path, to which you refer, would not occupy one quarter of the area of 37 acres, held in excess by the Institute.\n\nThis excess, as I believe, consists principally of a wooded area. It was therefore probably not included in the original survey of the Institute Lands. The boundary along this portion was probably laid out on top of the bank instead of along it.\n\nThe Department has decided not to take any action at present to dispossess the Institute of the occupation of this land, but I have to request you to come to some mutually satisfactory arrangement with the Indians, in order that the matter may be put on a proper footing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

As far as I can learn the circumstances of the leasing of my client's land are as follows:\n\nSome years ago my client leased her forty-five acres of fifty acres to Mr. Shepherd in charge of the Luncey Institute at a rental of $35 per annum to keep up fences and she reserving the right of pasture for two horses. Mr. Shepherd settled and paid her before his death.\n\nAfter Mr. Shepherd's decease a Mr. George took charge of the Institute and my client entered into a continuation of the lease to Mr. Shepherd with this change, that George was to pay $45, and to build a wire fence to properly fence the said land, and that if my client did not use her privilege of pasture she was to pay her extra rent.\n\nThis lease to George was in writing and signed by the parties and left in George's possession. My client did not use the pasture. George paid her rent until he left Institute about June 1909.

If paid all at once and not in receipt, we can settle it up properly so they would have to pay it again or settle it their way.\n\nFor instance\u2014\n\nKatherine Spencer is a woman whose husband died leaving her.

This culvert is at the foot of a hill and takes the water from a creek which overflows the road every spring causing a dangerous washout.

He is a little \"queer\" and would not give us any satisfaction. We really must have the water, and the only way to make sure of it is to control the land and preserve the bush covering the springs.\n\nIt is quite useless for Mr. Agent Moore or myself to approach the lessee again. May I suggest that the Department send an Inspector to go over the matter and make a recommendation as to fair rent &c., and arrange for a new lease. About half the land is bush and the balance is useful to the school for potatoe land; it is sandy.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S.

We understand that the land from which the school draws its water supply is covered by Lease No. 335. I shall be pleased if you will inform me definitely if you require a renewal of Lease No. 336.

We would respectfully suggest again that as soon as convenient after the New Year the Department send up a representative to straighten the matter out. Possibly to purchase the land and add it to the School Farm would be the best course to follow. We cannot possibly give up the control of the water supply after spending thousands of dollars in developing it.\n\nHoping for early action in the matter I am dear sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6209, file 408-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Reverend Principal of the Mount Alvin Institute on the Caradoc Reserve wishes to obtain a renewal of Leases Nos. 335 and 336, which cover two parcels of land in the Caradoc Reserve, containing respectively 27 acres and 57 acres. Both these leases have been in effect for a period of twenty-one years, and in both provision is made for renewal for a further twenty-one year period, on terms to be agreed upon.\n\nFor Lease No. 335 the Institute has been paying an annual rental of $15.00. For Lease No. 336 an annual rental of $30.00 has been paid. Inspector McGookin now recommends that these rentals be increased to $25.00 and $75.00 per annum respectively, and further, that the owner of the land involved in Lease No. 336 be permitted to cut on his leasehold from year to year such firewood as he may require for his own use, but not for sale. I would recommend your approval of a renewal of these leases, subject to the revised rental and the provision with respect to wood cutting.\n\nI may say that these lands are urgently required by the Institute owing to the fact that the only available water supply for the Institute is located thereon, and in the development of which the Institute has expended very considerable sums.\n\nDirector.\nMuncey, Ont.\nJanuary 23rd, 1933.\n\nSir;\n\nRe: Leases Nos. 335 & 336,\nMount Elgin Institute.\n\nWith further reference to your letter RG-7F of August 20th, 1932, I would report that Mr. Inspector McCookin and myself made a visit to the home of Luis McGahey, with intentions of securing his consent to the renewal of Lease No. 336 and at the time of visit McGahey was reluctant to commit himself or state what terms he would agree to in case of renewal or whether he was agreeable to renewal at all. This Indian eventually stated that there was plenty of time to consider a renewal and there was no hurry about the same and also that he was of the opinion that the Mount Elgin Institute did not need his land as he was not interfering with their water supply and that he believed the line fence if placed in the proper position would show that the water catch basins were not on his land at all. From the fact that he holds 57 acres of land and judging from where the one catch basin is located I cannot understand his claim and would believe from viewing it with the naked eye that the catch basin is well on his property.\n\nI am not aware what report Mr. McCookin will make in this case but would believe that it would be best that a survey be made of the lands both under lease No. 336, but also lands under lease No. 335 as these lines have long disappeared and it is not actually known where the line fences run at the present time as they have been under lease so long and dividing line fences have been removed. When these lines have been properly established definite steps can be taken with regard to renewal of these leases and McGahey would not be in a position to delay his decision longer on this pretext.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In the meantime Seneca should be very definitely informed that these leases are fully covered by an agreement entered into many years ago and their renewal was provided for notwithstanding any change in ownership. If he refuses to accept the rental payment promptly then he should, of course, be refused any assistance in the matter of relief. No change in the terms and conditions or boundaries of these leases can be made except by agreement with the Department and the Institute. While it is possible that some changes or amendments may be made in this regard, both Seneca and McGahay should, if necessary, be informed that this phase of the situation rests entirely in the control of the Department, and that for the present at least the terms and conditions of the leases as issued must be fully observed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.

Strapp, Principal of Mount Elgin School has consulted me with reference to a number of land leases covering lands on the Oneida and Chippewa reserves, which either have to be renewed or allowed to lapse.\n\nLease No. 570 covering the lands of Solomon Schuyler should not be renewed, as this piece of land of 28 acres is separated from the rest and it is an added expense to keep up the fences for so small a tract which is the farthest distant from the school.\n\nLease No. 572 covering the lands of Mrs Lucy Fisher on the Chippewa Reserve should not be renewed for this 56 acres for during the past 5 years very little use has been made of this land and it was an expenditure that should not have been made due to the school not keeping as much stock and only needing the land part of the time.\n\nLease No. 573 covering what is known as Oneida lands, 154 acres and it is very necessary that this land be released and I would so recommend.\n\nLease No. 574 covering lands of W.K. Cornelius for 30 acres is also necessary for the school and I would recommend the land be released.\n\nLease No. 575 covering the lands of Mrs Levi Doxtator for 34 acres is also necessary for the school and I would recommend the land be released.\n\nThe last leases were for 5 year terms at a rental of $2.25 an acre and all the rents were paid in advance and in my opinion this rental was somewhat high in comparison with other lands leased on the reserves.\nThe Principal of the school considers these lands of more value to the school on account of their location adjoining the River Thames for a goodly supply of water and also that the fencing is kept low on the same account, and that the lands are across the river adjoining the school and can be kept under close supervision. I would suggest that the price of $2.00 an acre at the most be paid for these lands and that the leases be renewed at this rate, which receives the approval of the Reverend Principal.\n\nAs some of the leases run out at the end of this year and others on the 28th of Feb and 31st of March next, I would wish your authority to take the necessary steps for the renewal or that entirely new leases be drawn up for the five-year period.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

Indeed, it is quite possible that the words \"for institute purposes\" may be eliminated from the lease in which they were inadvertently inserted,\u2014unless the sanction of the locators is obtained.\n\nReferring to your request for a list of the locators under the lease of the Oneida lands, it is considered that you are the one in the best position to know, as these lands are not covered by Location Tickets but are held under what is known as recognized title. At the same time, a list is enclosed, showing payments made to the individuals, which may be some guide in the matter of ownership.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nDirector.\nMarch 25th, 1886.\n\nSir:\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of March 1st, dealing with the lease covering land on the Indian Reserve, which are being used by Mr. John Smith, Esq., etc.\n\nI am talking this matter over with the Reverend Principal of the school I am so far as the \"for Institute purposes,\" he is quite willing that the matter be left as it is and if necessary take clause be eliminated from the lease so that there will be uniform conditions. It would at this juncture be a good time to get the locators to sign their consent in writing as they are scattered over this country and the United States and such action does not appear necessary, as the land has been used for pasture for many years.\n\nThe list you sent for approval in the case of the land owner is quite correct with one exception, that is that Carrie Davis (Mrs. Atwood) is the owner of land named in the deed of Mahlon Atwood, as Carrie did pay her brother for his share in the spring of 1886.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I have an Annual School Field Survey on March 21st, 1940 and requested your instructions concerning the issue of new leases, which letters to date have been ignored by the department.\n\nThe School is badly in need of these lands this year, as they are absolutely necessary for pasture for the school stock and the animals must be kept away from the land used by the school and only the lands near the building, etc., can be used. The lease will not be renewed unless these lands are returned to the school.\n\nIf the department is not able to lease these lands for the purpose of the school, I shall have no other course but to take action to get the animals off the land. However, as I have run out of money to pay I shall have to petition in court to have the animals removed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. D. [Name], I. A. A. T.\n\nSecretary,\nI. A. A. T. Office,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOntario, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6209, file 468-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of July 17th, 1940, re the Mount Elgin Residential School leases, is acknowledged, and the writer is quite prepared to accept personal responsibility for the delay in replying. When the matter was first referred to this division by Welfare and Training I had hoped to be able to satisfy myself on several points with reference to these leases by perusing several volumes of files relative to them. This took a lot of time and I regret to say that the files disclosed little or value.\n\nThe leases themselves, which expired in May, contain no provision for renewal. The Superintendent General has no power of which I am aware to lease the individual holdings of Indians on a reserve without their permission. You have furnished this office with no information on which a lease can be based. You may assure the Indians, however, that the Department wishes to rent their lands on the same terms as the former leases contained and that provision for payment will be made as soon as the formal leases can be prepared. In the meantime we will require the following information:\n\n1. A list giving the names and band numbers of all owners whose lands are included in any of the four leases, Nos. 611, 613, 614, and 615.\n\n2. A proper legal description of each separate parcel together with its acreage estimated as closely as possible.\n\n3. A statement from your records showing the title in the claimant as clearly as possible.\n\nA.D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n4. A form of consent to the making of the leases signed by each individual owner, or if deceased by his proper legal representative. (This means the executor or administrator.\n\n5. The amount payable to each owner out of the rent specified in the group lease.\n\nI am sure that you will appreciate the fact that any consent formerly given expired with the leases on May 1st last so that new consents are essential.\n\nProper legal descriptions are important, and to assist you we are enclosing a sketch of the portion of the two reserves affected drawn to scale which is endorsed on the sketch. If the description in words cannot be clearly worked out you could put them in on the sketch giving me urgence. Any good linen tape would be all the equipment you would require. If you have no tape you can requisition one and we will send it to you.\n\nIt would appear from the file that some of the original owners are dead and that you are dealing with the heirs. In such cases the estates will have to be administered in order to ascertain to whom the money resulting from the leases should properly be paid.\n\nIt has been suggested to the writer that the rent reserved should be paid in annual installments rather than in a lump sum in advance. Such an arrangement would spread the income over the term and has something to recommend it. On the other hand we are not overlooking the fact that the Indians may have been assured that they would get their rent five years in advance, and if this is so it might not be practical to change it. We will be guided by your advice in the matter.\n\nIt is assumed that the land is in the use of the school for the present season. You can give the Indians the assurance that whatever happens this year's rent.......\nrent will be taken care of. There should be no great difficulty in furnishing a satisfactory lease when the essential facts herein asked for are furnished.\n\nThe Welfare and Training Service have requisitioned the cheques for the Senecas under leases 335 and 336. You should receive them very shortly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nMuncey, Ont., July 31st 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-0-9 of July 24th, 1940, dealing with the issue of new leases to replace leases 611, 613, 614 which expired March 31st, 1940, and lease 615 which expired February 29th, 1940 and not in May as stated in your letter.\n\nYou further state that I have furnished your office with no information on which a lease could be based. In this connection I would ask you to peruse my letter of December 7th, 1939, at which time I did bring to the attention of the department that these leases were due to expire early in 1940 and did ask your instructions concerning the issue of new leases as the Principal of the school had asked for some changes to be made when the new leases were issued and to date I have not been advised on the points raised by the Principal.\n\nIt was for the purpose of getting these points cleared up that I took the matter up with the department long before the old leases did expire and I do appreciate the fact that the old consent given by the Indians would be in no effect with regards new leases, as stated in the last paragraph of my letter of Dec. 7th last. To confirm with the instructions of the department with regards expenditures during this period of stress on the funds available and before the consent of the Indians was secured it was necessary to know if you would pay annually or all in advance, whether you would lease for one, five or ten years as was requested by the Principal.\n\nConcerning the old leases I would wish to submit the following information,\n\nLease 611. Expired March 31-40.\n\nNo. 45 Caroline Fisher of the Chippewa of Thames Band holds this land under Location Ticket No. 6312. The legal description is contained on the old lease.\n\nLease 613. Expired March 31-40\n\n| Band | No. | Name          | Acres owned | Amount payable on 5 yr lease |\n|------|-----|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Oneida | 1   | David Antone  |             | $65.00                      |\n|       | 284 | Mrs. Japheth Bunn |           | $65.00                      |\n|       | 266 | Huron Williams |             | $5.90                       |\n|       | 269 | Mrs. Annie Williams |         | $5.90                       |\n|       | 222 | Mrs. Jennie Thomas |         | $140.00                     |\n|       | 263 | Sam Thomas     |             | $310.00                     |\n|       | 35  | W.

Also the lands of Aaron and Annie Williams, who are nephew and aunt, are shown as one. The lands of Daniel Antone and the estate of Levi Doxtator are shown as one, having never been divided and the lot as the owner of the lot is concerned, in accordance with your office of recent date, as these lands have been used by Mount Elgin School for over forty years; these parties will not use these lands and are prepared to allow the lots to stand as they are and divide the rentals.\n\nThe legal description of these lands, with the exception of the Jacob Powless lot, is shown in the plan of survey made by James H. Kennedy, O.L.S., dated October 27-1899 (File 101251) and is at the department.\n\nLease 614: Expired March 31-40.\n\nNo. 29 Estate Levi Doxtator Oneida Band, 3\u00bc acres, in the owner of this land that is located in Concession A, Lot 24, 1\u00bd acres, part of Lot 24, Oneida Reserve. Mrs. Sophia Doxtator is the heir of this property, being the wife of the deceased Levi Doxtator, and any rentals paid are retained at the department and applied on the debts of the estate. If leased for five years the amount of rental would be $340.00.\n\nLease 615: Expired February 29-40.\n\nNo. 35 W.K. Cornelius of the Oneida Band is the owner of this 10 acres of land that is in Lot 24 and possibly some in Lot 25, Concession A, Oneida Reserve. If leased for five years the amount of rental would be $300.00.\n\nIf further legal descriptions are necessary it will be necessary for the tenant to employ a qualified surveyor or person assigned to making a survey to locate these separate Indian holdings, for while the School has kept up all outside fences, there are no marks to distinguish the lots that were surveyed in 1899 as these lands have been used by the school for over forty years and all division fences have long since been removed or washed away by the spring freshet of the River Thames.\n\nThe sketch as enclosed does show the actual lots for all lots except that of Jacob Powless in the group leases and W.K. Cornelius and Estate of Levi Doxtator in leases 615 and 614 respectively. In sketching these three lots it was done on my own knowledge in the case of the Powless lot and on the knowledge of the Principal of the school and local Indians concerning the Cornelius and Doxtator lots.\n\nPending a proper survey being made I will prepare new papers of consent for the Indian land owners to sign, which will take considerable time, as some of these owners are now in the United States and scattered over Western Ontario. With one exception they were here last winter and early spring and there would have been little delay in procuring their consent at that time.\nUnless otherwise advised by the department the consent that will be signed by the Indian land owners will grant the Principal of the Mount Elgin Residential School the right to lease their lands for pasture and cultivation purposes for five years commencing from the date of execution of the old leases, that the school shall be responsible for the maintenance of all lime fences and that the lease can be renewed at the end of five years for an additional term of five years on terms suitable to the owner and the school will pay rent for each lease on the Ojibwa Reserve will be paid in advance for the full term of the five year lease. That if possible the lands of Mrs. Caroline Fisher will be leased for five years only and that this woman receive her rental annually in advance, which I would consider of most benefit to her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nD. J. Allan, Esq.,\nSupt. of Reserves & Trusts,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nAugust 7th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir: Re Residential School Lands,\n\nYour letter of July 31st, 1940, is acknowledged, and we appreciate the trouble you have gone to in order to make the records of these holdings clear.\n\nWill you please hold up anything in connection with these lands which you are at the moment prepared to do as the matter has been considered by this Service and the Welfare and Training Service and is now before the Director for a decision as to what should be done. Briefly our recommendation to the Director is that we regard ourselves as over-holding tenants in connection with this land for one year at $2.00 per acre per annum rental. If the Director approves the suggestion made to him cheques will be issued to the various parties at $2.00 per acre which will compensate the Indians for the loss of their property for the year now half gone. When this has been done plans are being formulated for a complete review of this whole question in connection with which we will seek advice not only from yourself but from the principal of the school.\n\nIn the meantime you will please hold the matter in abeyance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\n\nA.D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ontario.\nMemorandum to: Director.\n\nRe Leases covering lands used by the Mount Elgin Residential School at Munsey.\n\nIn the above connection we are renting approximately 220 acres of land from the Indians on the Munsey Reserve for the purposes of the Mount Elgin School. For approximately forty years we have rented this property by five year terms at a cost to the Department of approximately $200.00 per acre per five years. The actual rent is based on $200.00 per acre per annum which, according to values established elsewhere on this reserve and other reserves, means that we are buying the property every five years. This statement may be a little extreme but there is little doubt that the rent is excessive at present day values.\n\nAt the moment all leases have expired and the Department is in the position of over-holding tenants in relation to each of these Indians who is in effect our landlord. It is just possible that some arrangement might be made with the Indian owners for the sale of each of their holdings to meet the requirements of the school. If they were not willing under Section 11 of the Indian Act there would appear to be powers sufficiently wide to enable the Department to acquire the necessary land for school purposes at a valuation to be fixed by arbitration.\n\nThere are instances where the lands used by the school are subject to an interest by Indians other than members of the school and other instances where the leased land is involved in the estates of deceased Indians in connection with which the interests of the heirs should be sought out and determined.\n\nAll of these matters require time to completely investigate them, and it is therefore suggested that the Welfare and Training Division be authorized to issue cheques to the Indian owners according to the lists filed covering rentals for the year 1940-41 without the formality of a lease. If the situation remains as it is during the balance of the fiscal year that is left to us, an effort will be made to purchase the land we require from the Indian holders on reasonable terms. If this fails the Indians could be advised that under the authority of Section 11 of the Indian Act proceedings will be taken to acquire the land necessary for school purposes in payment to them of compensation fixed by arbitration.\n\nIf you concur in the above recommendations will you be so kind as to mark the proposal approved and return the file to Mr. Phelan of the Welfare and Training Division who on the strength of your approval will issue the rent cheques for the current year as above indicated.\n\nApproved-\n\nD.J.

Your file 7-0-9.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 12th, regarding the re-leasing of the property owned by Mrs. Caroline K. Fisher, I would advise that Mrs. Fisher is anxious to receive her rental moneys and has made repeated trips to this office and I would ask that the leases be prepared as soon as possible, so that this woman may receive her rents and not be making application to this office for relief assistance.\n\nWhile cheques have been received and distributed for the season 1940 for lands that were covered by Lease 613, no cheques have been received for the lands covered by Leases 614 and 615.\n\nLands covered by Lease 614 are owned by the estate of Levi Doxtator and when rental for the season 1940 is paid it should be used to pay outstanding debts against that estate. In this connection I would refer you to your file 9007-153.\n\nLands covered by Lease 615 are owned by William K. Cornelius and cheque for payment of rentals for the season 1940 should be sent forward to this office at an early date. Cornelius also owns lands in the group lease 613 and has received his rents for this season from that land and recently returned from the United States where he has been resident, demanding payment of rents for this additional 30 acres which was always leased under a separate lease. Your early attention in this connection would be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. J.

You are using quite a substantial acreage of the Omaida Reserve in conjunction with the Mount Elgin School and have for many years been paying an annual rental of two dollars an acre for the land. Formerly this was rented for five years at a time and the whole proceeds handed to the Indian owners or locators in a lump sum. You will recall that last year we changed it to a one-year basis. Are you content to continue to rent this land on that basis? If you are the leases can be arranged.\n\nI think we are all agreed that two dollars an acre is excessive. There is, however, some doubt as to whether or not we can expropriate for school purposes in the circumstances. It is also suggested that to try to do so would stir up a tremendous amount of ill feeling with the band. I am not satisfied as to the ownership of the various parcels but it will take years to straighten out these title messes with my present staff.\n\nIt is suggested that we might have a chat about the matter and decide on what course of action we are to pursue.\n\nD.J. Allen.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Residential School Lands,\nYour file 7-0-9\n\nI would wish to again bring to your attention the leasing of Oneida Reserve lands for the use of Mount Elgin Residential School, that has been held in abeyance in accordance with your letter of August 7th, 1940.\n\nWilliam Cornelius of the Oneida Band and an influential Indian of that reserve has appeared at this office desiring that action be taken at an early date to lease these lands for a period of years. He claims to represent the Indians land owners and has a large acreage of his own and is asking that the leases be put through in time that the Indians may receive their rentals earlier than last year and that this money be available to aid them in planting their crops and gardens this coming Spring.\n\nCornelius also advises me that if the Department do not desire to rent this land, that it is the intention of the land owners to seek a tenant elsewhere. He also states that the owners are not desirous of disposing of their holdings by sale to the department and if it was the intention of the department to expropriate this land it would receive opposition from the land holders.\n\nKindly advise at an early date what action the department intends to take with regards the purchase or lease of this land, which is very necessary for the Mount Elgin School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nFebruary 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir: Re Residential School Lands,\n\nThe contents of your letter of February 5th, 1941, has been noted and the whole problem of the Mount Elgin School lands has been considered.\n\nIt has been decided to enter into leasing arrangements with the owners of the lands affected at the established rate of two dollars per acre for another year. You should, therefore, proceed to obtain preliminary agreement taking special care to get the best possible evidence of ownership in each of the alleged owners is furnished the Department. The Reserves Service is apprehensive that the title of some of these owners is not free from doubt and in any cases where there is any question as to ownership special care should be taken to report it as fully as possible in making application for authority to lease the land.\n\nYou might give this matter prompt attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.J.

This consent has been signed by all Indians except the estate of Levi Doxtator and Mrs. Sophia Doxtator, the heir, is resident in Detroit, Michigan, and as rental of this estate land is always withheld at the Department and applied on debts owing by the estate, I do not consider it necessary to get the consent of Mrs. Doxtator.\n\nThe acreages listed are those that the Department have been paying for the past 25 years at least and without question are owned by the Indians who have signed the consent.\n\nIt would be appreciated if cheques could be issued at an early date so that the Indian land-owners may have this money in plenty of time to make use of it in planting their Spring crops and gardens which was not the case last year and proved a hardship on these people.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The vouchers for last year's rental, which you will recall were late, recited that the rentals paid in 1940 covered the period from April 1st, 1940, to March 31st, 1941. Why then should we contract for this land from the 1st of January? We have already paid the rent in advance for January, February, and March, 1941.\n\nThe Welfare Division advises me that they will pay these rentals as promptly as they can after appropriations for the year 1941-1942 have been made available by Parliament.

Since that time there is no record of the lands being leased, although Mr. Strapp informs me the Institute has had the use of the lands and the locators have received their rents. I have verified by entries in the cash book, but just how the transaction has been handled I do not know. However, Mt Elgin Institute are anxious to continue and the locators all seem agreeable to the leasing, but would rather have them made out for a specified time. It would appear that these lands are leased by the educational services.\n\nI would like some information as to how they have operated since 1940, and whether or not the locators will receive payment this coming first of May. It may be this office has been submitting an account for the whole amount since 1940. Please advise.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\n\nT.R.L.

Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, this morning he advised me of a recent interview he had with you with regard to lands leased for the purposes of the Mount Elgin Residential School. From this interview Mr. Arnell obtained the impression that you were hesitating about rotating crops on this property due to the fact that we are only operating at present on a yearly lease basis. My purpose in writing to you at this time is to assure you that, even though the land is being handled at the present on a yearly lease, there is no intention whatsoever on the part of the Department of depriving the school of its future use. The only reason for making yearly leases is due to the fact that we have in mind approaching the locators with a view to purchasing the property and it is the opinion of our Lands Branch that we would be freer to act in this regard if we only had yearly leases.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I again returned them to him, point-\ning out that if he intended renewing the contracts, the\nform was the requirement of the Department of Indian Affairs\nand that the signatures should be obtained in accordance with\nnecessary for the locators consent. To date, I have heard nothing\nfrom him direct.

If I am to administer this Office, no person other than the Department of Indian Affairs is going to dictate the procedure.\n\nApplication for renewal of these leases may by-pass this Office with a formal application, or they may arrive in proper form.

However in spite of my protest the leases were drawn on a yearly basis.\n\nThis year when the application for renewal of leases was being circulated by the owners of the various parcels Mr. Jacob Powlis refused to apply for renewal.\n\nThe situation now is that the portions B.B.B., on the rough sketch will not be of any use to for pasture purposes because the only access is by way of the ford across the Thames River which is located within the parcel of land withdrawn from lease. This also means that the individual owners have no access to their land. I have marked the parcels that Mr. Powlis is not willing to re-lease A.A.\n\nI understand that Mr. Powlis intends to lease these parcels to his son, who is at present living in the U.S.A., to be worked up and cropped this year.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n\"Principal.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6209, file 468-9, part 2)\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey;\n\nWith reference to the Oneida Land Leases, last year upon receipt of your letter informing me that it was your intention to continue these leases for the use of the school, I broke up about 80 acres of the high land and worked it as summer fallow. Mr. Agent Downs informed me that unless I obtain signatures to applications for renewal of these leases he will not forward an application to Ottawa for the renewals. I have obtained as many signatures as possible, and yesterday I returned the list to his office, giving his secretary the information that I did not know who, or where, the people were that held the balance of the land and that I felt that the best thing to do would be to leave the list in his office so that those who had not signed could do so if, and when, they called to inquire about the leases.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Downs in which he says \"I must now tell you very plainly, until the application form is complete, or the names without signatures erased, this office definitely refuses to accept it.\"\n\nI am at a loss to understand the change in policy. Previously the whole matter has been handled by the Indian Agent as agent for the people and for the Indian Affairs Branch and the matter has been handled to the general satisfaction of all concerned. The Indian Agency is located in the village of Muncey and centrally located for all the parties concerned, it therefore seems to me to be the logical office to handle the matter.\n\nI shall be pleased if you could give me permission to proceed with the work planned for this land, as it does not include the portion referred to in my letter of March 27th, owned by Mr. Jacob Rowling, who refuses to continue to lease his portion for the use of the school.\n\nI remain,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6209, file 468-9, part 2)\nMuncey, Ontario,\nApril 13, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI wish to refer to lands of the Oneida Reserve now under consideration for lease, to the management of the Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nIn this connection it becomes apparent that one man at least, does not wish to renew his contract. I understand this decision has been made because he wishes to establish his son and crop the land. Before operations can commence it will be necessary to define this particular acreage. For the same reason it is also necessary that we know where the lines are. It is said, and I know it to be correct, that there is a plan of the said lands drawn by Kennedy in 1899. For reference, and establishing boundary lines of the individual holdings it would be appreciated, providing such a plan is in existence in Ottawa, if you would forward one to this Office.\n\nG. W. Down,\nIndian Office.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6209, file 468-9, part 2)\nOttawa, April 14, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\n- Welfare and Training -\n\nReturning file 7-0-9, Mount Elgin School.\n\nIf Mr. Jacob Powlis does not wish to lease the 18 acre parcel indicated on the Principal's sketch the writer does not see how he can be compelled.\n\nPlease examine the sketch. If it is accurate, the ford across the river, or rather the river bank to the ford, is on a road allowance there would appear to be no reason why the ford and the road allowance could not be used to get the cattle across to the available land, which comprises the balance of the sketch without trespass on the land which Powlis refuses to lease.\n\nOn the other hand, Powlis might be willing for a consideration to permit a lane being fenced from the ford to the nearest point on Lot 21 marked AA making access for the cattle to the balance of the land under lease.\n\nIt appears to the writer to be a matter for local adjustment which the Principal with a little ingenuity could solve for himself without shouting for help.\n\nD. J. Allen\nSuperintendent\nReserves & Trusts\nOTTAWA\nApril 15, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you advise that Jacob Powless refuses to renew the lease on his land.\n\nInspector Arneil and Mr. Morris of the Welfare Division expect to visit the Caradoc Agency during the week of April 26.

One of our most difficult problems is to locate persons or families for investigation. It is quite common for parents not to know where their children are and vice versa.

We have reviewed our files and the last payment we made for the lot mentioned above was in 1939 and presumably this particular parcel of land has not been used by the school since that time. However, I should appreciate it if you would discuss the matter with the Principal and advise this office.\n\nFor your information I may say that recently the Department forwarded Seneca a cheque for $25 rental for 27 acres of Lot 7, Range 7.

S. Arnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nApril 10, 1946.\n\nre Agricultural Programme - Caradoc Reserve\n\nThe Agricultural programme for the current year at the Caradoc Agency has been discussed at length with Mr. Down and jointly a land inspection has been made. This programme has included 547 acres which reverts to the Agency on the termination of the Mt. Elgin Residential School on June 30th, and in addition approximately 200 acres throughout the Reserve being operated on an improvement basis to place the farmer occupant or future owner on a basis whereby he will be established in full time Agriculture. The operation of the above acreage is exclusive of other Agency agricultural activities such as partial cultivation of lands for individual farmers, the preparation of garden lands, the threshing of grain, clover and cash crops, the pressing of hay and straw and land drainage.\n\nThe 547 acres reverting from the Residential School can be broken up as follows:\n\n- 210.5 acres, Government-owned, on which the buildings are located.\n- 219.4 acres, pasture land, on the Oneida side\u2014present lease terminates April 1, 1947. The rental of $2.00 per acre is chargeable to Schools. This land may be\npastured by the School herd until its disposal prior to June 30th.\n\n117 acres on the Chippewa side adjoining the 210.5 acres. This area is also rented until April 1, 1947. It is largely arable and under crop, and is essential to the School farming unit. The entire School water supply is derived from a parcel of this land (the Seneca lot) which should be permanently acquired. The $2.00 rental for the current year is also chargeable to Schools.\n\nThe following plan is recommended for the operation of this land for the current season pending a decision being reached regarding the future operation of the School farm with its spacious outbuildings:\n\nThat 40 acres be summer-fallowed and sown to Fall Wheat.\nThat 25 acres be planted to late Potatoes.\nThat 40 acres be sown to Oats and Oats and Barley with 20 acres being seeded to Timothy and Clover.\nThat 120 acres be retained for Hay.\nThat 10 acres be partially summer-fallowed and sown to Buckwheat to be turned under to clean and improve the land.\n\nThis suggested programme is considered essential and the most economical having in mind the present condition of the land and the situation in the district at the School. The potatoes are realized and with the fall wheat and coarse grains are in keeping with the necessity of production on the Reserve. The School staff is at present seeding the 40 acres to Oats and Oats and Barley and they\nhave been requested to continue. A suggested arrangement has been reached to reimburse the School for the sowing and seeding of this 40 acres for the sum of $200.00 plus $40.00 for each ton of alfalfa seed used. In this arrangement we are supplying the seed for 20 acres of Oats otherwise the School is supplying all seed and grass seed. This nominal sum was suggested by myself as the minimum that could be offered and saves us at least an equal amount were they to cease operations. It represents around 25% of returns at present prices from an average crop. A good seed bed has been prepared and the work is being well done. From a financial point of view the operation of this land is largely to our advantage as the extensive hay land is average in seeding and with an average season should result in approximately 150 loads of mixed hay and alfalfa. We have the machinery for pressing hay and straw if necessary.\n\nTo effectively carry out this programme on the School farm and the ambitious programme on the Reserve some expenditures are essential. It will be recalled that our Welfare Power and Machinery has not been replaced during the past year and has been used and abused in the operation. A 10.20 International 9 years old and urgently in need of replacement. To keep this tractor in operation we are losing much time and needless expense. It is definitely in its last season. An International Farmall light tractor also about 9 years old and in similar condition to the 10.20. Our third tractor, an Oliver 70, is beyond repair and valued only as junk. We have never owned any haying machinery although it is urgently needed on the Reserve. I would recommend the immediate purchase of a light tractor, a six-foot cut mower, a side delivery rake, a wagon and rack and a hay loader. This recommendation covers minimum requirements for this year's operations. When it is\nrecalled that this 17,000 acre Reserve is entirely an agricultural one where 75% of the Indian families' revenue should be derived from this source it will be realized the absolute necessity of having adequate machinery in our endeavour to assist Indian land owners to become successfully established as full time farmers. The purchase of this machinery can be arranged by Mr. Down as soon as authority is received. In the case of the tractor needed at a scarce commodity at present it may prove necessary to purchase the School Tractor (a Farmall) at their auction sale. It appears serviceable but a new tractor is preferred and more economical in the long run.\n\nI find a major problem confronting our administration of this Agency at present and one that should be corrected forthwith if confusion and loss of time and effort is to be avoided. It is the unfortunate absence of our Farming Instructor, Mr. Ryckman. I visited Mr. Ryckman and find him ill and preparing to go to Hospital for a rather serious operation. He will undoubtedly be absent for a long time and in view of his age it is my opinion that he has not been fit for any case at his age can I recommend his return to the heavy duties of Farming Instructor at this Agency. He has accumulated considerable Sick Leave and I presume will remain on pay for a good portion of the present growing season making the usual replacement at too late a date for current work. Mr. Down is in present position in long house and has succeeded in getting his spring work in splendid shape and well under way but it is impossible that he alone can carry the load.\n\nI find an opportunity to temporarily replace Mr. Ryckman, on possibly a 90-day emergency payment on voucher basis, by a competent farming instructor already\nin residence in one of the apartments at the Residential School. I refer to A.E. Bush the herdsman at the School. Mr. Bush is married, 53 years of age. He was born and raised on a dairy farm in Haldimand County near Hagersville. He has spent his life on the farm with the exception of some three years while employed in the Cockshutt factory at Brantford. He has owned his own farm and has had responsible jobs as herdsman in large breed Holstein herds in central Ontario. Mr. Bush has been at the School for some 16 months and has continually impressed me with his capability and practical common sense. In my opinion he is well qualified to take over the farming instructor's duties here and tide us over this emergency. He is willing to continue as long as the residential School contract remains, at a very early date, or as soon as the herd is sold possibly in May. If this can be arranged I would suggest a salary of $125.00 per month, plus house, fuel and light. He would simply remain on in the apartment. It is my strong recommendation that he be engaged on a temporary basis to permit this worthwhile program to proceed without disruption. In addition to the School farm and agricultural program he would be required to assist in our land drainage and roadwork activities.\n\nI would appreciate consideration of these recommendations at as early a date as possible with advice to Mr. Down to enable him to lay his plans for the necessary implements and outside supervision.\n\nW.S. Arnell\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThese recommendations have resulted from discussion with Mr. Down who fully concurs. He is aware of all details of proposed operations.\n\nWSA/BC\nOttawa, April 20, 1946.\n\nG. W. Dunn, Esq., Indian Agent, HUNTER, Ontario.\n\nThe Branch has received a memorandum from Mr. Inspector Arnell outlining a proposed agricultural program for the Cariboo Reserve.\n\nFor the present, at least, it will be necessary to farm the property formerly occupied by the Mount Elgin Residential School. Before next year we will have to decide whether we are prepared to run this as a demonstration farm, or reduce our holdings to that portion of the farm which belongs to us by allowing rented lands to revert to their Indian owners.\n\nIn order to carry on this summer it will be necessary to purchase certain farm implements, namely; tractor, side-delivery rake, six foot cut hay-mower, hay-clamp, grain bin and a rock. In connection with the tractor, we understand that it may be necessary to purchase the one belonging to the school, because of the difficulty of obtaining a new one. In view of Mr. Arnell's report on the mechanical condition of your present tractors we hesitate to add to the old machinery troubles by buying an old tractor. Purchase of a new tractor will take some time and we consider that you can manage with the present tractor until we can obtain a new one and turn in the evidence of the present trial. If you can we will order a new one. Please submit requisition, in duplicate, covering your machinery requirements. If you can attach quotations from local dealers and give us some idea of delivery date, this information will enable our Purchasing Agent to place his orders sooner.\n\nMr. Arnell has recommended that Mr. Bush, of the Residential School, be engaged in a temporary capacity to replace Mr. Eykman, the present Farm Instructor, during his illness\u2014possibly for a three months period. This suggestion is tentatively approved. Payment for Mr. Bush's services should be made on monthly vouchers showing the following information:\n\n... days' service at $...... to make up an amount of $125.00 per month.\n\nYour suggested program for operating this land for the present season is approved. The licensees also concur in the proposed arrangement to rent out the school for seeding and seeding 40 acres by paying them $200.00 plus $40.00 to cover the cost of 2 tons of fertilizer, even with the estate.\n\nIt is suggested that a separate account be opened in your books to cover the Residential School Farm so that expenditure on it may be segregated. It will be in order for you to requisition funds you may require to cover labour, etc.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Mohawk Nation,\nAddress: Munsey,\nOntario.\n\n1946 DATE SERVICE AMOUNT\n\nApril 29 To payment of part of land under lease to the management of the Mt.

(RG 10, Volume 6200, file 468-9, part 2)\nReference is made to your letter of April 20th with regard to farming operations at the Mt. Elgin Residential School. We have had enquiries of the dealers in the Mt. Brydges area, and the Massey Harris dealer is the only one who will guarantee delivery in time for this season's harvest. I have attached, hereto, requisition covering the pieces mentioned in your letter which are all very necessary; and it is hoped that the order will be placed without delay.\n\nThere is very little difference in the set up and manufacture of the various types of recognized farm equipment, but there is an important factor which all good farmers consider. I refer to the readily available repair and parts service. The Massey Harris has such a shop in Mt. Brydges, 5 miles distant. It is therefore desired that the order be placed with them. There is also the consideration that they guarantee delivery in time for this season's operations which is a most important factor.\n\nWith regard to the tractor, please do not change the order to smaller size. It must also, on account of the exclusive loading from farms to farms, be on rubber. 25% of our repairs may be attributed to roadings on steel lug wheels. Massey Harris will guarantee delivery of this piece of equipment within three months. I must therefore manage with our present equipment until delivery is made.\n\nI am now faced with the problem of a hay-rack which, if secured, will complete the requirements. This piece of equipment can only be secured through a local manufacturer and must be made to size. I am therefore requesting that I be given authority to have one made. The approximate cost is somewhere between $75.00 and $100.00.\n\nIf I am to receive this equipment in time to harvest this season's crop, please give the matter urgent consideration.\n\nThe dealer's name for the Massey Harris equipment is:\n\nMr. Blake Steer,\nMt. Brydges, Ont.\n\nGeo. W. Dowt,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6209, file 468-9, part 2)\nMuncey, Ontario,\nMay 5, 1946.\n\nReference is made to your letter of April 20th, last paragraph. In this connection a separate file covering operations at the Mt. Elgin Residential School has been set up, which at the end of the crop season will reveal a financial and crop return of the undertaking.\n\nTo do this, however, it will be necessary to set up a ledger account. I am therefore requesting, as suggested in your letter, sufficient funds to carry on with immediate labour operations. I have no way of estimating the entire season's requirement. I am therefore, at this time, suggesting $250.00. If this amount is forwarded in the form of an advance it will be accounted for in the usual manner.\n\nIn connection with the $200.00 plus $40.00, mentioned in the penultimate paragraph of your letter, is it your wish that a voucher made payable to the Principal of the Mt. Elgin Residential School be forwarded for payment?\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 13, 1946.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n- Departmental Purchasing Agent -\n\nThe attached requisition covers implements and a tractor required for use on the Hunney Reserve.\n\nThe prices quoted were obtained from the Essary-Sarris dealers, Mr. Eddie Starr, Mt. Brydges, Ontario. Mr. Starr's firm is the only one that can guarantee delivery in time for this season's harvest. The tractor must be on rubber because it is moved by road from farm to farm on the reserve, and the agent states that 25% of all the repairs required for his tractors can be attributed to running with steel lug shocks.\n\nMay purchase be made at the earliest possible date.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This woman has a sister, Eva Doxtator, aged 17 years, who is a pupil at Mount Elgin Residential School, and she has repeatedly requested Indian Agent A.D. Moore and myself to obtain the latter's discharge from school so that the sister may care for her two children, and housework, while Mrs Dolson rests in bed as instructed by me.\n\nRev. O.B.

The girl herself is not anxious to leave school, but expressed a willingness to do so as a helpful duty to her sister.\n\nMr. Moore, Mr. Strapp and myself have discussed the situation, and the Principal of the school suggests that permission be sought for one month's leave of absence for Eva Doxtator to care for her sister, in lieu of discharge.

We are informed that the Medical Superintendent, Mr. Agent Moore and yourself have discussed the matter and that you were favourable of this girl being granted the leave requested.\n\nThe Department will approve of your permitting Ms. Doxtator one month's leave of absence. She should be returned to the school after that period. No per capita grant can be allowed for her during such absence, and in preparing your returns covering the period of her absence you should make a note after her name on the return stating the date she left the school, and, later, the date she is returned.\n\nThe Medical Superintendent is being informed that you are being asked to grant this girl leave of absence.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nTraining Division.\nTHE MOUNT ELGIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nTHE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nMUNCEY - ONTARIO\n\nREV.

With the exception of Mrs. A.D. Moore the Agents do not even make a note with the pupils giving authentic information as to age, present attendance, school previously, and grade. When the pupils are brought to the school by their parents we can obtain the necessary information but many are brought by someone who can only guess at ages and grades. It would greatly facilitate the recording of necessary information if the Agents were instructed to forward the application forms to the Principal of the school who would then record the information and send the forms on to Ottawa. If you prefer to have the forms come directly to your office then the Agents could be instructed to send with every new pupil a note of introduction giving the necessary information. It something like this idea was in operation it would be easy enough for the Principal to be sure that the application of the child had been made through the proper channels. In our past we have had children brought to this school and only after they have been in school for some time have we discovered the Agent had not received an application for them; the parents of course say that they have authority from the Agent and we have no proof to the contrary.\n\nWith reference to the \"Discharge\" form.\n\nAs far as the records of this school are concerned it would appear that the former Principal discontinued the use of these forms in 1922. We would appreciate a new supply.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If so, you should advise the Department where you recommend sending them, and the rate per month for their maintenance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF. X.

Cook, Melbourne, Ontario, stating that the above named boy had returned to her home the night before and asked that he be allowed to remain there overnight, mentioning the boy she learned that he was a pupil of the Mt. Elgin School and was on his holidays from the school. His mother, the lad claimed had been abusing him and he wished to return to the School. Mrs. Cook requested that the police take charge of the boy.\n\n(2) Before proceeding to the Cook farm the Assistant Principal of the School was interviewed and it was learned that Tenige was a pupil from the School. It appears that in 1936 he was released to his mother for the summer vacation period and shortly after returned to the school and asked that he be allowed to stay there as his mother beat him.\n\n(3) His mother came for him when the holidays started this year and has been in charge of him since. The School authorities requested that the Police return the lad to school and stated that he would not be released for summer holidays in the future.\n\n(4) A patrol was then made to the Cook farm where Tenige was placed in and returned to the School. Questioning him it was learned that his mother had gone to Melbourne in the late p.m. of the 13th instant and had left him to take care of the other children, one being only two months old. During her absence he had knocked a cupboard over and broken some dishes. On her return she found him playing with the baby. The boy is only 8 years old and could hardly be expected to take care of the other children. The mother of this boy has been advised of his return to the School.\n\nJ.M.

O.B. STRAPP, PRINCIPAL\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nSeptember 25th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI reply to your letters as above noted would say that in the case of the Williams girls who are registered as Gladys and Velma George it is simply a matter of the mother thinking that they now are old enough to do some work and they could therefore perhaps be of use at home. While they were younger she was quite satisfied to have us look after them and now that they are old enough to make a contribution to the life of the school she would like to have them go. I beg to point out that it is imperative that we should have a percentage of pupils old enough to carry on the work of the school without any of them being at all burdened. These two girls are not yet fitted to go out to work and would only become a liability upon the reservation without anything to really occupy their time. Mrs. Williams mentioned the matter some time ago and when I raised the question it was admitted that there was someone around the house most of the time who could do the necessary chores etc. I would strongly recommend against their discharge.\n\nReference the Rogers children.\n\nMrs. Rogers visited the children at the school on Wednesday the 22nd. Inst., on that occasion she informed the Lady Superintendent that she had not known of the application made by Mr. Rogers for the children to be discharged from school. She stated that she was opposed to their discharge on the grounds that they would not receive the vocational training at the reserve day school and also they would not have the benefit of the discipline of the school which she felt they very much needed. I beg to point out that if they are discharged at this time the efforts already expended on their training will be largely wasted and it will have an unsettling effect upon the other pupils in the school. The elder girl, Hilda, has definitely expressed her resentment at the suggestion from her father that she be discharged and the other two are not yet old enough to know what they do want. Mr. Rogers' letter is merely a matter of following the line of least resistance and certainly is not in consideration of the welfare of the children nor the unsettling effect their removal would have upon other pupils. I beg to recommend that they be not discharged at this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She further stated that she was opposed to their discharge.\n\nThe Principal also points out that these children have reached the stage where they can greatly benefit by further training, while, if they were discharged, the efforts already expended on them would be largely wasted.\n\nUnder these circumstances the Department is not prepared to grant the discharge of these children at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.O.

He generally stays with grandparents or aunt when on the reservation during summer holidays. He was placed in school in 1932 as a neglected child.\n\nNo. 709 Clayton Fischer\u2014Age 14, Sarnia Agency. The parents of this child are separated and the mother living part of the time with another Indian named Cotterill. The boy was placed in the school in 1932.\n\nNo. 739 Eddie Noah\u2014Age 10, Walpole Island. This boy was being looked after by an Indian family\u2014as he is a non-band member\u2014and because of extreme neglect was placed in this school in 1934.\n\nNo. 672 Elsie Martin\u2014Age 12, Cape Crocker. This girl's mother has been dead for a number of years. She was being looked after by other relatives and on petition of her reputed father, because of her neglected state she was placed in the school in 1930.\n\nNo. 671 Julia Sickler\u2014Age 15, Caradoo Agency. Nothing is known about the parents of this girl. She has, however, been looked after partly by two brothers and a sister who usually work out in wood-cutting camps. She has no settled home on the reservation. She was admitted in 1930.\n\nNo. 6747 Josephine White\u2014Age 13 Walpole Island. This girl's mother, Lena White, has been separated a number of years from her husband, and is employed in the United States.

Sarnia is still the 'Mecca' for runaways. Two from the Six Nations agency and one from Caradoc left us yesterday after informing some of the other boys that they were going to Sarnia, and the Agent there would get them out of school.

Their actions are affecting the other pupils and it is considered advisable to place them in another school.\n\nInstructions are therefore being issued to send them to Chapleau.\n\nAs mentioned above, there are no other complaints against these children other than truancy and as you require additional pupils, I felt that you would be pleased to receive them.\n\nThe following particulars regarding these children have been received from Rev. O.B. Strapp, of the Mount Elgin Residential School:\n\nNo. 705 Irvin Johnson - Age 15, Sarnia Agency. This boy is sometimes known as Irvin Williams. He generally stays with grandparents or aunt when on the reservation during summer holidays. He was placed in school in 1932 as a neglected child.\n\nNo. 709 Clayton Fischer - Age 15, Sarnia Agency. The parents of this child are separated and the mother is living part of the time with another Indian named Cotterill. The boy was placed in the school in 1932.\n\nNo. 739 Eddie Noah - Age 10, Walpole Island. This boy was being looked after by an Indian family\u2014as he is a non-band member\u2014and because of extreme neglect was placed in this school in 1934.\n\nNo. 0711 Elsie Martin - Age 12, Cape Crocker. This girl's mother has been dead for a number of years. She was being looked after by other relatives and on petition of her reputed father, because of her neglected condition was placed in the school in 1930.\n\nNo. 0715 Julia Dickens - Age 15, Caradoc Agency. Nothing is known about the parents of this girl. She has, however,\nbeen looked after partly by two brothers and a sister who usually work out in wood-cutting camps. She has no settled home on the reservation. She was admitted in 1930.\n\nNo. 0747. Josephine White \u2014 Age 13 Walpole Island. This girl's mother, Lena White, has been separated a number of years from her husband, and is employed in the United States. She has been making her home with a married sister who has been ill for some time.

In several cases since the beginning of October, reports have also indicated that some of those who ran away in September also truanted again on one or two occasions.\n\nAs the truancy is apparently continuing, the matter is giving the Department some concern.\n\nI would therefore appreciate if you would write me fully in connection with this matter. No doubt you have very carefully investigated all conditions around this school with a view to determining whether or not there is any real reason for truancy.\n\nPursuant to your telegram of November 21st, the R.C.M.P. were immediately written and requested to arrange an escort for the pupils whose transfer to Chapleau school had already been approved. I understand from the R.C.M.P. report that one of these is now in the United States, but you might let me know if the others have been sent to Chapleau and, if not, the approximate date on which you think they will go.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

She has an occasional slight cough. Temperature and pulse were normal. Weight 96\u00bd lbs., which is seven pounds over weight. Examination of chest revealed nothing abnormal.\n\nIntracutaneous tuberculin skin test was negative to 1/20 milligram of O.T.\n\nVictoria Hospital Chest X-ray Report No. 37134 of Nov. 3/37\nExamination of the chest shows marked increase in the hilum areas with many calcareous nodes and marked increase in the peribronchial thickening throughout.\n\nSgd.

Vale\nPrincipal\nTHE MOUNT ELGIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nTHE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nMUNCEY - ONTARIO\nDecember 6th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nIn reply to your letter of the above date and file number would say that the six pupils were transferred to the Chapleau school on December 1st. The only outstanding truant at this date is Howie Greenbird and he is apparently staying with relatives in the U.S.A. He will probably return to the reservation at some later date and can then be apprehended and returned to school.\n\nSeveral things seem to have contributed to the general unrest amongst them being the fact that during the holidays so many of the pupils were able to get work and earn money, pupils working for a short while earning as high as $2.50 per day and living with relatives who did not charge them for board. Upon investigating the conditions of # 0794 Gladys Laforme I find that she has been in the habit of leaving her home whenever she wandered about the country for a while and then when she felt like it, returning home and carrying on as if nothing at all had happened and she apparently felt the urge to wander again. I have only received a definite complaint from one pupil, Eddie Noah, and it was to the effect that he had to carry in wood for the fires in the Laundry. As we operate our laundry only one day per week I felt that he certainly was not overtaxed as he had two helpers and was only responsible for the job from 8 A.M. to Noon. During that time the three boys would have to bring in about 2\u00bd to 3 single cords as required.\n\nFrom time to time we do have complaints that we do not serve meat often enough. Unfortunately we are compelled to purchase all our meat from the butcher as we have no facilities for cold storage. If we had a meat refrigerator we could kill our own cattle and provide meat on the menu more frequently.\n\nMay I express my sincere appreciation of the action of your department in transferring the six pupils to another school; it has had a marked effect upon a number of the other pupils who have truanted and I believe has settled the matter at least for this year.\n\nI beg to enclose the vouchers for the expenses incurred in connection with the transfer of the six pupils.\n\nI remain,\nYours truly\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nOliver B.

Algim Institute.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of the 14th inst. received advising me of my daughter, Phyllis's mis-conduct, this is really shocking to me.\n\nI believed that she was quite contented to stay there at school till she finished her term, and I am sorry I am giving you some trouble and I cannot think of anyone who she would run away. The only thing I can think of is that when I heard early this fall, that a group of girls were punished for something they had done and Phyllis was one of them, and my opinion is this, that she resented being punished for something she was not entirely to blame for, and it is likely that she will never forget the offense given her by some unsuspected offender and I doubt whether I could persuade her to tell me where the trouble lies. I am speaking from my own experience when I was there, and once I was punished for some things that I didn't do. I will never forget those who gave me the punishment, in spite of my protests, and this is the general experience of most of the ex-pupils.\n\nSo, I would suggest that you try to win Phyllis by kindness and perhaps she will tell you where the trouble is. You must consider that she is at the age now that she will appreciate a treatment accorded to an older person, and will respond to any confidence given her.\n\nI am enclosing one dollar for her and I am leaving it entirely in our care. Tell her that she is causing me a great deal of anxiety, and ask her if she wants me to be happy, to promise that she will be a good girl.

I have to confess that I am somewhat baffled by the attitude of Phyllis Plain who appears to be the leader in the group. She admits that she 'just took the notion' and 'has been in school too long'. The other girls say that they 'just went with her'. I think that Lillian Peters was feeling rather blue as since she came to school three years ago her people have not bothered very much about her and have neither arranged for her to go home for her holidays nor visited her at the school. She is rather a moody type of girl and neglect on the part of her relatives has probably had an influence upon her. George is like a little wild animal and has given us considerable trouble. Anna Kim has been an exceptionally well behaved girl and has made good progress in the vocational classes but is at a standstill in her public school work.\n\nSome time ago I wrote to Chief Nicholas Plain of Sarnia suggesting that he pay a visit to the school but he replied that he would leave the matter to me. I enclosed a dollar bill for his daughter Phyllis. I felt that if I could get him to make a visit and spend some time amongst the pupils he might be able to make some suggestions as to the real cause of the unrest.\n\nThese girls were absent from the school for about four hours from the time that they left until their return by the R.C.M.P. Howie Greenbird was returned after being absent since September 26th, and informs us that he has been at home at Walpole Island during that time helping his father.\n\nHowie and the four girls seem to have settled down and I do not anticipate any further trouble from them.\n\nI beg to make the following recommendations:\n\nRe. Phyllis Plain; This girl very evidently is at the age when she needs sympathetic supervision and kindly but firm discipline.

I made reference to this girl in my letter of December 30th. I am still of the opinion that it would not be wise to arrange for her discharge at this time. She was successful at the entrance to high school examination last June but owing to her age and the fact that she did not at that time expect to go on to the high school course I felt it would be better for her to spend a year in the vocational work before being discharged. Her standing in the practical work of the course is good and in the theory is fair. I quite agree that she is at the age when she should have careful supervision and I doubt very much whether, if she went home, her father or her step-mother could do very much to control her. She seems to have gotten over her moodiness for the present and will probably be able to get a couple of weeks' leave without any trouble. I think perhaps Chief Plain could be willing to agree to her staying until the end of the school year and then receiving her discharge.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Chief Plain, at present, is living on the Reserve by himself and is planning to have Phyllis keep house for him. I do not think this is necessary.

Both her parents have syphilis and the daughter is a congenital case. Doctor McLeod disagrees with the statement that he has seen her 3 times since the onset of her illness and estimates that a dozen attendances would be more in order which statement is borne out by the Principal.\n\nThe family reside in a small shack on the Chippewa Reserve which has recently been enlarged with lumber provided by the Department. Sole subsistence this winter has been by relief supplied by the Department. An older sister, Kathleen, discharged from Mount Elgin School last spring has done no gainful work since and according to a report received by Principal Strapp is now believed to be pregnant.\nIn the opinion of this office, including Doctor McLeod and Principal of the school, Rachael Simon can be much better cared for at the school under a trained nurse and supervisor. She has been placed in bed near a radiator and is being given special food to improve her condition.\n\nThere is a slight suspicion that this girl may be pregnant following a visit to her home during Christmas vacation from which she returned with an ample supply of cigarettes, seized by the school authorities.\n\nDoctor McLeod is investigating the pregnancy angle and it may be necessary to admit her to hospital for a few days to confirm or dispel this condition.\n\nMr. Strapp informs us that since his refusal to discharge this girl from school she has become unruly, disobeying orders and refusing at times to take food. Such action usually follows a visit from her parents whom he blames for the girl's behaviour. Morals in the Simon home are open to question and it is no fit place to return a girl whose health is under par.\n\nThere is no record here as to whether the application for Residential School was signed and Principal Strapp believes that if there were no signature, such was due to the fact that Indian Agent Thomas McCookin peremptorily removed this child from intolerable surroundings in 1928. Mr. McCookin is quite familiar with the home conditions and could amplify this report if such is desired.\n\nIf this girl is as old as her mother claims, she could be discharged from Mount Elgin School at the end of the term next June, in the meantime, she will receive adequate medical attention as heretofore and Mr. Strapp is in favour of this recommendation.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It was learned from Mr. STRAPP that the boys had been inciting the route to Windsor, during the day. L/Cpl. THUSCOTT of Ohsweken Detachment was notified by telephone and requested to be on the lookout for the boys. A telephone call was put through to Windsor, Ont., and L/Bgt. WO K.S. notified.

Both Mr. Strapp and Dr. McLeod have already attempted to assure those interested that the School authorities are acting in the girl's best interests.\n\nDoctor McLeod reports that this girl is suffering from a condition of arthritis and that it would be very inadvisable to discharge her to the deplorable home conditions under which her family exists. With the services of a graduate nurse at Mount Elgin School and constant medical attention she has shown some improvement, although her mental attitude, abetted by her parents, is not one of cooperation in an effort to get well.\n\nLast week when a Dental Clinic was conducted at the School, this pupil was examined by Doctor Auckland, who recommended three tooth extractions and several fillings. This girl, who is practically an adult, refused to permit the Dentist to work on her teeth and carried on to such an extent that Doctor McLeod advised that no force be used in view of the attitude already assumed by her parents. The dental work indicated would assist in combating her arthritis materially.\nWhen shown the letter of Chief Deleary, Principal Strapp affirmed that this girl is receiving every attention both by the Medical Superintendent and the Institute Staff. Although special menu was prepared for her by the dietitian, the girl went on a hunger strike, which was successfully broken by the Principal, who is of the opinion that advice from home has a bearing on her stubborn attitude.\n\nDoctor McLeod states that if this girl were removed to hospital, it would be a long, drawn out and expensive care and that her welfare can be equally protected at the School.\n\nWith reference to Chief Deleary's statement that the parents are not on relief, our records show that the father of this girl received, since November, 1937, seven rations. The pension received by him was inaugurated in December and amounts to, approximately, $5.50 per month.\n\nIn view of the fact that this pupil is receiving special care at the hands of Doctor McLeod and the Mount Elgin School staff, I would recommend that no action be taken in this case.\n\nChief Deleary's letter is returned.\n\nProl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Therefore, the Judge has therefore committed Peter to the Ontario Training School, Bowmanville, and in accordance with the Juvenile Delinquent Act, the municipality to which the boy belongs has to bear the cost of maintenance and, therefore, this boy belonging to the Indian Reserve, the Judge has named the Department of Indian Affairs be so responsible at the rate of 75\u00a2 per day.\n\nAs in previous cases, this Court will forward the monthly accounts for this boy and Edwin Waucoush, to the Department of Indian Affairs, through you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Probation Officer.\nLondon & Middlesex Juvenile Court.\nOttawa, June 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the third instant, with further reference to Peter Myers.\n\nIt is noted from the letter from Mr. Bradshaw that the Judge has committed this boy to the Ontario Training School for Boys at Bowmanville. Under these circumstances the Department is not prepared to interfere with the decision of the Judge.\n\nThe information given you in official letter of May 27th regarding this boy's age was taken from our file. In order to be certain of the boy's age, it would, of course, be necessary for you to communicate with Mr. A. Highfield, Indian Agent, Walpole Island, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. D.

It will be observed that this Indian was proceeded against in accordance with Section 3 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act for the reason that his age was given as fifteen years by the Principal of the Mount Elgin Residential School, Muncey, Ontario. There remains some doubt as to his correct age and as will be noted in paragraph three of memorandum from the Officer Commanding dated June 7th, a search of the records at the Department of Vital Statistics, Toronto, brought no results.\n\n3.

It will be noted from Munney detachment report of the 19th ultimo, that the guardian of this ward, the Rev. G. H.

It will be seen from remarks to attached report, that Mrs. A. D. Moore, Indian Agent at Munney, states that he had never been informed by the Indian Affairs Branch, etc., etc., that there existed between the ages of 18 and 19 years. In view of the present discrepancy in the age of this Indian, inquiries have been made of the Department of Vital Statistics, Toronto, and a search of the records made for the years 1919 to 1924, both years inclusive, but no trace of his birth could be found.\n\n4.

Mr. O.B. STRAPP, Principal, of Mount Elgin Indian Residential School at Muncy, I learned that the above named boy of about fifteen years of age and a student at the school, had contracted gonorrhea. The boy was re-examined thoroughly by both Mr. STRAPP and the medical Superintendent Dr. T.R. McLeod but stoutly maintained that he had not had contact with a woman or girl. He stated however that he had had sexual relations with a son in a barn at the residential school, about a month previous to his illness. Dr. McLeod states that the boy must have at some time or other had connections with a female human being to have contracted the disease.\n\nSub-Division\n\nOn the afternoon of the 18th instant I proceeded to the Mt. Elgin residential School and in company with the principal interviewed the boy Peter MYERS. The lad denied absolutely having anything to do whatsoever with a woman, but readily admitted his intercourse with the son in the barn so far as to take us to the barn and point out the boy in question from amongst several others. He stated that he had had these connections on two different occasions. Mr. STRAPP stated that he wished to take the necessary action in having this matter attended to.\n\nDetachment\n\nOn the afternoon of the same date whilst in London, I interviewed Major A.G.M. BRADSHAW, Chief Probation Officer at the Juvenile Court. I was advised by him to lay a charge against this case under Section 152 of the Criminal Code of Canada before Major BRADSHAW. I was instructed to bring the boy before Juvenile Judge D.F. S. at London on the afternoon of the 20th instant. The boy is at present in the custody of his guardian, Rev. Mr. O.B. STRAPP, at Mount Elgin Residential School, Muncy, Ont.\n\nP.C.R.\n\nThe accused in this case was charged as Juvenile Delinquent.\n\nTo - The Commissioner, R.C.I.P.\n\nForwarded.

This form stated that he was 16 years of age on September 11, 1930. It is possible however, that this information may not have been correct. The only way to trace the boy's age is to communicate with A. Highfield, Indian Agent, Walpole Island, Ontario.

In the latter part of May, Peter was brought before the Judge of the Juvenile Court on a charge of a grossly indecent nature and, owing to medical evidence given at the hearing, the Judge remanded Peter to Victoria Hospital for treatment.\n\nAs soon as he was released from hospital he was again brought before the Judge, who decided that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned to commit Peter to the Ontario Training School for Boys. This institution is located at Bowmanville, Ontario, and is operated by the Ontario Government. This Department will be responsible for his maintenance there.\n\nI have recently been informed that a relative, D. K. Oshgees, of Wallaceburg, has been making enquiries about Myers, and I would appreciate your seeing Oshgees as soon as possible and explaining to him the contents of this letter. You should also inform him that the Department considers the action taken is in Peter's own interests.

Enquiries were also made from the mother of this boy, who gives his date of birth as August 8th, 1920, and states that he was baptised in the Anglican church on Walpole Island. An effort was then made to locate the records of this church, and it was found that owing to a recent change in Ministers, the records are now in the possession of the Rev. J.G. Veir, Brantford, Ont. The Rev. Mr Veir is not expected to take up residence on the Sarnia Reserve until July 17th, 1936.\n\n3. In order to avoid unnecessary delay, could this enquiry be completed by our Chweken Detachment.\n\n4.

M.

Simpson George is not a member of the Band, but his wife Mrs. Simpson George, #248, now deceased, was a member of the Kettle & Stony Point Band. Since her death there has been no care taken of the younger children.\n\nThere are seven children in the family; one boy 22 years of age, one girl around 20 and the rest are of school age and younger. The three of school age are attending Mount Elgin Institute. This leaves two small children at home.\n\nThe older girl also has a baby about one year old. This girl is a very bad character and will not stay at home, even to look after her own child. The son simply refuses to help in any way and the father is almost blind.\n\nThe Band feels it is not their responsibility but at the same time realizes something must be done with the two younger children, age five and six. Would it be possible to have these children sent on to Mount Elgin School, or are they too young? The Council feels that if they (the children) have to be taken care of, the Band should not be called upon to pay the expense out of Band Funds, when the family are not members of the Band, and the older children refuse to help.\n\nPlease advise as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nenc. 1\n\nT.

September 1, 1938.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Nelson Peters, an Indian living on the Muncey Reserve, whose address is Melbourne, Ontario, has consulted us regarding his son Ronald Peters. It appears that this boy was attending the Industrial School at Muncey for the past two years and went on two-thirds part of July of this year he became ill. The father first became aware of the illness on the 12th of July and after having him examined by a doctor he was immediately placed in Victoria Hospital, London, and remained there until the 23rd of August of this year. The boy was suffering from an infection of the kidney and was in very serious condition and as yet has not fully recovered.\n\nThe boy has been examined by the resident physician on the Reserve and also by a physician in private practice. When the boy left the hospital the father was advised that he would have to be very careful for several months as the condition might recur. The physician on the Reserve wants the father to send the boy back to the Industrial School but the father feels that in view of the fact that half of the day is taken up with work and half with school that the Industrial School would be too much for him in his present condition and has refused to send him back until his physical condition has improved.\n\nThere seems to be a controversy between the father and the physician on the Reserve as to the advisability of sending the boy back and the father wanted us to see the story placed before you, as he states positively that he will not consent to the boy going back at the present time. We do not know just who has authority in a matter of this kind and the father has, therefore requested that we write to you giving you the circumstances and it may be that you can perhaps do something in regard to this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSHILLINGTON & HOFFMAN\n\nIndian Affairs.

Huffman, of Blenheim, Ontario, to whom Nelson Peters has appealed for advice as to whether their son, Ronald, should return to Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. Doctor Huffman goes only so far as to convey to the Department the views of Nelson Peters as expressed to him.\n\nIt would appear that the father has refused to have the boy returned to the school on the ground that \"half of the day is taken up with work and half with school and that the school would be too much for him in his present condition\". The recent medical history of the boy is known to the Department; at least to the extent that he was a patient in the Victoria Hospital in London last summer suffering from kidney disease. It is not known what advice or instructions have been given to Nelson Peters by yourself and Doctor MacLeod, nor whether he has expressed to you the views he gave Doctor Huffman. Perhaps the best immediate measure would be to defer any measures you might have in mind to secure his attendance at school until Doctor MacLeod, with such other medical or educational advice, if any, as he may think necessary, can have an opportunity to furnish you with a medical certificate, which you can send to the Department with your own report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.D.

Please submit these reports to the Medical Officer and when he has made any necessary notations from them they should be returned here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. O. B. Strepp,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Institute,\nMunsey, Ont.\nMuncey, Ontario.\nSept. 15th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant regarding Ronald, son of Nelson Peters, member of the Muncey of the Thames Band of this Agency and his proposed return to Mount Elgin Residential School. I would advise that Dr. McLeod inform me that this case was discussed with Mr. Moore some time ago and it was decided not to return him to the Residential School at the present time.\n\nThis boy suffered a serious attack of acute nephritis or kidney disease in July and was in hospital for several weeks during which time his recovery was not expected. He is still under the attention of the Medical Supt. but has progressed to such an extent that he has been able to walk about daily and there is no trace of kidney infection.\n\nDr. McLeod proposed to Mrs. Peters that it would be to the advantage of her son to return to Mount Elgin Residential School where he would be given plenty of rest with no work at all and would have a warm bed and shelter, much more favourable than his home conditions. The proper diet available at the School was also drawn to her attention and the Principal of the School expressed his willingness to cooperate.\n\nMrs. Peters quite definitely refused this suggestion declaring that she was determined to keep her boy at home.\n\nIn view of the fact that for some time this boy will remain semi-invalid and that there is a possibility of the kidney condition returning with tragic results, Mr. Moore and Dr. McLeod concluded that it would be advisable to allow this boy to remain at home and not expose the Department to possible unfair criticism.\n\nAt no time was it stated to the Peters family that their son would be forced to return to school and the consultation with Mr. Huffman appears to have been rather premature.\nIt is interpreted from your letter that a medical certificate would be necessary only if this boy returned to the school against the desire of his parents. If such a certificate is necessary so absent himself from residential School, Dr. McLeod is prepared to furnish same.\n\nThe family is quite anxious that he continue his education and arrangements have been made with the Day School teacher of the Beer Creek School to provide him with lessons to be done at home during his convalescence.\n\nDr. McLeod reports that he saw Ronald Peters at his home on Sept. 13th and at that time assured Mrs. Peters that it would not be necessary for her son to return to Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

He has been a patient with us since that time and during his residence on no occasion have we found evidence of tubercle bacilli in his sputum.\n\nRadiographic study from time to time showed improvement of the chest disease, at the present time this being considered as well healed.\n\nIn September 1932 the patient showed suggestive evidence of synovial disease of left hip joint. Immobilization in plaster was carried out until June 1934 when radiographic study showed suspicious tuberculous disease of the right hip joint. Plaster spica was continued until January 1937 when the patient was allowed up and around in a left calliper splint. Since that time the patient has been up and around the ward with considerable exercise outdoors daily, enjoying perfect health. At the present time there is practically no signs on physical examination of disease in either hip joint, this being confirmed radiographically.\n\nIn our opinion this boy, who is remarkably bright and co-operative, should do well at school, and we heartily recommend his application for approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Medical Superintendent\n\nJ.M./f.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of the following letter from Indian Agent Spence:\n\n\"I am herewith enclosing for the approval of the Department, application and medical history of one Clifford Noah, an illegitimate Moravian boy, for admittance to Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\n\"This boy for the past six years has been a patient of Queen Alexandra Sanatorium, London, Ontario, and now is ready for his discharge from that institution.

This girl is sixteen years old and is not nearly ready for her Entrance examination and has not shown any great progress in her book studies and if only returned to the School for domestic training purposes she would have gotten that at Mr. Trott's home and besides would have been earning money to help her family also making room for a needy child at the Residential School.\n\nI would ask your opinion and instructions as to this girl being discharged to whom Mr. Strapp will not agree although he admits with her return, he will have exceeded the 150 pupil allowance at his School.\nWith regard to Beulah, I would advise you that this girl has an ingrown toe nail and was let out at summer vacation with it not being cured and during her term at the Residential School this toe was never reported to Doctor McLeod although it was treated by the school nurse.\n\nAt the time for this girl's return to the School it was found to be infected and had been opened by an outside Doctor and French protested his girl returning to the School claiming she was being neglected. Doctor McLeod now knows of this ailment of Beulah's and advises me he will have it attended to and if necessary have a surgical operation after the infection has subsided and in Dr. McLeod's opinion this ailment at no time assumed serious proportions. This girl also returned to the school on October 8th and her continuance there as a pupil is recommended.\n\nMaitland French claims he can support his large family but I would advise you that this man has always received some relief assistance in the way of food, fuel, clothing and building materials every winter in the past and I am doubtful if he can again ask for assistance this winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nADD:\nOttawa,\nOctober 24, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Moore with reference to the 2 children of Mitland French.\n\nI am sorry that this matter has been brought to my attention as it appears that it could have been settled between Mr. Moore and yourself.\n\nIn view of the fact that Iris French had a position I do not, at the moment, see the necessity for having returned her to the school. However, possibly you had good reasons for taking this action. I should appreciate it if you would discuss the matter again with Mr. Moore and as both of you are on the ground you will be able to decide what is the best course to take in regard to the two girls.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Accordingly, a patrol was immediately made to this Reserve where it was ascertained that Abner Elliott had been about the Reserve on the afternoon of the 12th. of October but it was also learned that he had gone out on The Georgian Bay for the purpose of fishing and that he could be found on the beach of one of the numerous small islands off Cape Croker for the night and return to the Reserve during the following day.\n\nSub-Division\n\n2. A patrol was again made to Cape Croker in the a.m. of the 13th. inst., when Abner Elliott was accosted when he landed on shore from his fishing trip.

That on Oct. 4th, he and Beemax became separated at Woodstock, and that he had not seen him since. From Woodstock, young Elliott came to Brantford and then made his way towards the Cape Croker reserve, arriving there during the morning of Oct. 12th.\n\nDetachment\n\n3.

Beeswax stated that he had been working for this farmer since about the first week of October last; that he and young Elliott had left the school together, and had both applied for work at said farm; that he was working now; young Elliott had continued on, going north on No. 6 Highway and that he had never seen him since that date.\n\n2.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI regret very much to have to report that Vera Martel of the Rama Agency has proven very unsatisfactory as a pupil in this school. When she first came to us she said that she only intended to remain here for a month or two and only wanted to take cooking classes. I had a talk with her and suggested that it would be very much better for her to at least stay until the end of the school year and learn all that she could in the practical departments and in the meantime take the matter up with her Agent. She wrote to Mr. Featherstone and he replied in what I thought a very nice letter and suggested that she was very much better off in school where she would have an opportunity to learn much that she could not learn at home. Since then despite every effort on our part to make her comfortable and change her viewpoint she has done nothing but complain and at present is proving a very disturbing influence in the school. I very much regret that I have to request that arrangements be made to return her to Rama at the earliest date as may be possible.\n\nThe Anderson girls and Elsie St. Germain seem to be happy and are proving apt pupils.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to Vera Martel of the Rama Indian Agency.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter you may send this girl home immediately. Payment of her transportation will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate.\n\nYou should write the Agent a very frank and detailed report regarding her conduct at the school in order that he may show the letter to the parents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Harvey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. O. B. Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School,\nMunsey, Ont.\nALDERSHOT, Ontario,\nFeb. 15 - 1939.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit this letter for your immediate and favorable consideration on behalf of Mrs. and Mr. John Noah in relation to a boy (Norman Stonefish, Jr.), Member of the Moravian Town Band of Indians, age 6 years. Who was deserted by his mother, Mrs. Norman Stonefish, Sr., and left here at the house of Mrs. and Mr. John Noah on the 22nd of April, 1938, and has been kept by Mr. Noah ever since, with no help from any source. Mr. Norman Stonefish, Sr., father of this boy, has been working in this neighborhood all last summer of 1938, but refuses to contribute anything towards the support of this boy. As Mr. and Mrs. John Noah are non-members of the Band, and they feel they are unjustly treated when they are doing their best for the boy - they buy clothing and fit him out, so he could go to school every day, and all they get during the whole time is $4.40 in clothing from S. Spence, Indian Agent, with instructions to send him a receipt for any clothing bought for the boy, which they have done. But they did not get anything for it yet, as you will see by the letter written by Mr. Spence, Indian Agent. Also they requested Noah to bring the boy to the Reserve, but they did not offer or provide any funds for that purpose. As Mr. John Noah cannot go to any further expense as he has his own family to look after.\n\nMr. Norman Stonefish, Sr., was here on the night of Feb. 4, 1939 in an intoxicated condition, and making a disturbance with Mr. Noah's family. County Police had to be called to take him away from there, and he came over to my home that night, and I know he was very much intoxicated and he admitted to me he was drinking, and he was in no condition to look after a child that time of the night. I understand Police instructed him to come after the boy the next day when he was sober, but he left and never came back. Mr. Stonefish, I understand, has rented his home to someone on the Reserve, and he would have no place to take the boy, but to be left here and there, and to be knocked about. So I would humbly suggest that action should be taken at once to place this boy in a Boarding school - Mt. Elgin School, Muncey, and further, Mr. and Mrs. Noah wish to ask the Department to remunerate them for the keep of the boy at the very small rate of Two ($2.00) dollars per week, which would include all they have bought in clothing for the boy - ten months to 22nd of Feb. 1939. This could be paid for by the Department, and interest money of both Mr. & Mrs. Stonefish, retained until this is paid back in full, and after that the money of the parents should be kept for the children for their future use by the Department of Indian Affairs.\nThe above is humbly submitted for your kindly and favorably consideration.\n\nEver yours,\n\n(sgd) EVERSON SNAKE,\nALDERSHOT, Ont.\n\nP.S. - Enclosed is the correspondence on the matter.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nOffice of the Indian Agent.

The Agent was to have sent an order ($3.60) lately, for the boy. I hope you have rec'd it by this time.\n\nIt was the ruling of the Inspector, McGugan, that we send the boy to some residential school. We are acting on the advice of the Inspector, knowing that it is to the welfare of the boy.\n\nThere is an opening for the boy at Brantford. If you can make arrangements to have him here before the 21st of December he can have a tubercular test at the clinic in Chatham.\n\nHoping you will co-operate with me as soon as possible.\n\nHoping this finds you and the family in the best of health, and wishing you a Merry Christmas, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) BARNEY LOGAN.\nIn the Spring of 1924 Mr. Stewart visited me at the Reserve. That was a good day for me because I had just returned from a trip back home. We discussed the possibility of coming back again, but I couldn't make any plans.\n\nThe following year, in December, I visited the Reserve again. This time, however, I did not have the opportunity to see Mr. Stewart. Instead, I went to visit my family in Ontario. It was a long trip, and I didn't have enough money to pay for it. Despite this, I decided to go anyway.\n\nI arrived at the Reserve on December 25th. I met Mr. Stewart there, and we talked about our plans for the future. He seemed very enthusiastic about the idea of coming back again next year.\n\nStuart Stone\n\nOffice of the Indian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6200, file 468-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 6th, 1943.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have been requested by the parents of the above named children to make application for their release from the institution wherein they are now confined.

Siskind, Esq., B.A.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, Notary Public,\n428 Richmond Street,\nLondon, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from A. B. Siskind, Barrister, London, requesting the discharge of Cleaton and Martin McGahey from the Mount Elgin Indian residential school. Mr. Siskind states that this application is being made by the parents primarily due to the fact that the father has been sick for about a year and being janitor of the River Settlement school requires their assistance in this work.\n\nThe reason given in Mr. Siskind's letter hardly seems sufficient to justify the discharge of the boys who are comparatively young and who have only been in the school since 1936.\n\nPlease let me have a full report from you regarding this family and state what action you consider should be taken in connection with the request of the parents for their discharge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Due to the lack of intelligence of the boy he was not asked to plead. The Court ordered him to see the Principal of the school and the parents of the child. This individual, an Indian woman of rather low culture had very little to say outside of admitting that she had harboured the boy when he truanted from the school. The Judge spoke to her severely about this and also reprimanded the boy who promised faithfully that he would attend school without giving any trouble in future. He promised the Judge and the parents that he was willing to give young TOMEGO another chance to behave. The Judge then instructed the boy to return to school with the Principal. This was done and it is thought that the appearance in Court of this student will act as an example to the other students in the school as well as having a desirable effect on young TOMEGO.\n\nPROSECUTION ENTERED.\nDISMISSED.\nCASE CONCLUDED.\n\nInvestigated by Const.

B. Jiskind, Barrister, London, Ontario, had written to the Department concerning the discharge of Clayton and Martin McGahey from Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nTo supplement the report made by this office on August 8th, last, and your report of August 16th, I would advise that Donald School informed us that Andrew McGahey, one of these boys, is a chronic case of heart trouble and is unable to do any work. He is in receipt of $15.00 a month soldier pension which has been granted since the children have been placed in the school and also receives $6.00 per week salary as caretaker of the old Settlement Indian Day School which janitor work is done by his wife. Besides the two boys in Mount Elgin School, there are three small children under school age.\n\nOn consulting the Rev. Principal of the school I was advised that both boys are good pupils and that the elder, Clayton, is in Grade 6 having a 75% standing in his year's work so far. Also that the younger boy, Martin, is in Grade 6 with an 80% standing which is lower due to his being a run-away truant part of the term.\n\nMrs. McGahey is a woman much younger than her husband who has had a number of affairs with other men and if this couple would remain at home she could well carry on the duties as janitor of the school and provide the needs of the house with the exception of cutting firewood.\n\nIt is the recommendation of this office that, if Clayton McGahey, the elder boy, passes his Entrance examinations in June when he will be 16 years of age, he receive his discharge and, failing that, to be kept in the school another year. The younger boy, Martin, should remain here not more than one year.\n\nMrs. McGahey has been very abusive with the principal of the school in threatening the removal of the children, hence her visit to Mr. Jiskind. I would ask that the Department's decision be made known to Mr. Jiskind and thereby conveyed to her as I believe this would carry weight and possibly stop her interference at Mount Elgin School.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA.

Besides the two boys in the Mount Elgin school there are three small children under school age at home. It is reported that Mrs. McGehey does not stay at home and attend to her household duties as she should.\n\nBoth the boys in the Mount Elgin school are good pupils, the elder, who is in grade 8, having a 70% standing on the current year's work. The younger boy is in grade 6 and only has a 30% standing. This is due in part to the fact that he truanted for part of the term.\n\nMrs. McGehey has been very abusive with the Principal of the Mount Elgin residential school in threatening the removal of her children.\n\nIn view of the progress being made by the boys and the further fact that home conditions cannot be considered totally satisfactory this Department considers that it is in the best interests of these two boys to remain in the Mount Elgin Indian residential school and we are, therefore, not prepared to approve their discharge at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.B.

This girl has just recently been promoted to the 8th grade in her classes but will not try her entrance this Summer, which proves that she is not an adept pupil.\n\nMrs. James Cornelius is in the Ontario Hospital, London, leaving at home her husband James and a son about fifteen years of age. Cornelius did for a time have a widow keeping house for him, but she has now left and he claims he is unable to procure another.\n\nMr. Strapp is not anxious to keep this girl after the present Summer holidays and in keeping her would only be endeavoring to keep her out of trouble on the reserve. As this father has a need of this girl at his home on the reserve I would recommend that she be discharged at the end of the present school term.

Mrs. Powless, who is the daughter of Christopher Stonefish, had her in the custody placed in the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School through the efforts of Mr. Stonefish and the aid of Miss Stonefish. We have attended the Residential School for some time. We believe and are informed that she did play truant from this school on at least two occasions, along with some other girls. This year the Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, the Reverend G. B. Strapp, refused to allow Muriel Stonefish to return to his care for the summer holidays although the other girls had played truant along with her and returned to school. Mrs. Powless has asked us concerning the possibility of transferring her daughter to this school, which may or may not be possible at any rate she has been told by the conclusion that her daughter could not return to this school until she could attend school and be under her supervision. This is the desire of both Mrs. Powless and her father, Christopher Stonefish, who are living in Chatham in the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. We want to know if they should be allowed to visit.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6209, file 468-10, part 2)\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nthere was any order committing Muriel Stonefish to this Institution and she advised that there was not. If this is true, then Muriel Stonefish is virtually being kept a prisoner at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. We have been in correspondence with the Indian Agent who referred us to the Principal, Rev. O. L. Stripp, and we have written him and he ladies very strongly that Mrs. Stonefish had been experiencing difficulty in obtaining her release from the school and goes on to say that any proceedings to that end may tend to alienate the cooperation of her daughter and only prove unprofitable to Mrs. Stonefish and would almost certainly tend to give Muriel the impression that our intentions can be handled with impunity. We shall be pleased to hear from you as to whether there is anything standing in the way of Mrs. Stonefish withdrawing her daughter from the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nMuncey, Ont.,\nAug. 21st 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. R. A Hoey\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-0-10 of Aug. 12th, also a copy of a letter received from Messrs. Wilson, Pike, Stewart & Lewis concerning Muriel Stonefish, a pupil of Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nMuriel Stonefish according to the principal of the school is 15 years of age and at the time of her admission was resident with her grandfather, Christopher Stonefish of the Moravian Reserve, who had her placed in Mount Elgin School, where she has been for the past four years.\n\nMuriel, who is an illegitimate child, did absent herself from the school during the past school term and when she was located by the police was in the home of her mother Mrs. Flora Powless at Chatham, Ont., which home the police considered nothing but a bawdy house.\n\nEarly in July of this year Christopher Stonefish, grandfather of this girl appeared at Mount Elgin School and at the request of the Principal was quite willing that she remain there again during the holiday period, as the grandfather claimed he would have no control over the girl if she returned to his home.\n\nMr. Strapp, Principal of Mount Elgin, informs me that this firm of solicitors had been in touch with him and also with Indian Agent Spence of the Moravian Reserve, to which Muriel belongs, and that both the Principal and Agent had instructed these solicitors that the girl was to remain in school because the grandfather and guardian was willing that she remain so. The legitimate claim put forward by Mrs. Powless would be detrimental to the girl if she was allowed from school in care of her mother.\n\nMr. Strapp contends that if this girl is removed from the school to the custody of her mother, that he does not wish her to return and that such removal would be contrary to the best interests of the girl.\n\nIf any further information is wanted in this case, I would suggest that you write Indian Agent Spence of the Moravian Reserve, as he would be quite familiar with the case and as Muriel is a member of that agency.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: Muriel Stonefish,\nMount Elgin Residential School, Luncey\n\nWe seem to have written you on the 25th of July in this matter and you replied that you were writing the Indian Agent and that on receipt of his reply we would be further advised. Since that date we have not heard from you. As the writer understands the matter, this young lady was placed in the Residential School at Mount Elgin at the request of her mother and her grandfather, Christopher Stonefish, who also appears to have been her Guardian. Both the grandfather, Christopher Stonefish and the mother, Flora Powless, saw the writer today and urgently requested that we write your Department giving their consent to the release of the girl from the Residential School so that she might enjoy some holidays at home. We would very much appreciate the courtesy of an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWILSON, PIKE, STEWART & LEWIS,\nper\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6200, file 468-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nSeptember 6, 1939.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to Muriel Stonefish, a pupil of the Mount Elgin Indian residential school.\n\nAt the time this girl was admitted to the Mount Elgin residential school she was residing with her grandfather, Christopher Stonefish of the Moravian Reserve.\n\nInformation that we received indicates that the mother's home is wholly unsatisfactory and if the girl were placed there the influences to which she would be subject would be demoralizing. In fact the principal of the Mount Elgin residential school would not be prepared to accept her if she were placed for a time under her mother's charge.\n\nTaking everything into consideration the Department feels that it is in the best interests of Muriel Stonefish to remain in the Mount Elgin Indian residential school and we are not prepared to favourably consider either discharging her at the present time or allowing her holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMessrs Wilson, Pike, Stewart & Lewis,\nBarristers,\nChatham, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing, and the further consideration that due to conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age. Consequently unless there are some exceptional reasons the above-mentioned children should be discharged at the end of June next. If however, there are a few of them who you consider should be retained please let me have detailed information before the end of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. O. B.

It seems evident from this that there is an attempt to prevent the Indian Residential School from doing what should be done.\n\nIn conclusion, I would advise that I have discussed the matter with the Principal of the School and he informed me that they will not allow them to demand anything more. The R.C.M.P. were notified and through their efforts the girl was brought back to the School.\n\nThe girl, Emily Green, upon her return to the School, was questioned by the Principal as to why she ran away. It was immediately then made known to her that the reason she was sent to the School to study was so that she could be taught various kinds of things to make her more valuable to society in the future. Emily answered in a manner that left no doubt but it is believed that she had been stolen. However, when asked why she stole from the School girl to steal from younger children, she eventually reached some of the older girls at the School who in turn were very upset and ridiculed her to such an extent that she decided to run away. When she returned to the School in the evening, the R.C.M.P. were summoned immediately. The Principal of the School stated that she would not steal anything herself nor would she again ask younger pupils to steal for her.\n\nThe Principal of the School assured her that he was not in favour of imprisoning the girl as it would only encourage others to steal. She was then placed under the care of the Principal until further notice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant regarding Edith Simon the Department considers that this girl should be returned to her parents on June 30, 1940.

Howard McCue, the father, has been looking after the children during the past winter and they have been badly neglected. The father is quite lazy and he does not even pretend to properly look after his children or provide food for them. In view of the circumstances I would recommend that Caroline McCue, the girl, aged five and Leslie McCue, the boy, aged seven, be enrolled at a residential school if possible.\n\nThere is little likelihood of the mother returning to live with her husband and even if she were persuaded to come back and look after her children I do not think she would remain with the family very long.

Her husband died about one year ago and Mrs. Monague claims that she cannot properly care for all five children. Her children's names and ages are as follows:\n\n- Victor Monague, son, aged 16\n- Audrey Monague, daughter, aged 13\n- Nora Monague, daughter, aged 11\n- Olive Monague, daughter, aged 9\n- Aldon Monague, son, aged 3\n\nThe mother wishes to have her three daughters enrolled at residential school i.e., Audrey, Nora and Olive. These three girls have been attending the United Church Indian Day School at this Agency.\n\nApplications for these three girls have not been completed due to the fact that the mother and her family suddenly left the Reserve about two weeks ago to secure temporary employment picking berries in a white community. If room is available at the Mount Edgin residential school for these three children, I would wish to be advised and if the Department approves of their admission, forms will be completed as soon as Mrs. Monague and her family return to the Reserve.\n\nI would recommend that these three children be admitted to residential school if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.
