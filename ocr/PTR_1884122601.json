A stream of pure distilled perfume runs down the center of the table, causing the guests to feel refreshed and invigorated. The food takes all its name and most of its nature from beef and greens. The one exception, however, is the beef, which is cooked in a special manner. The beef consists entirely of lean fat rather than of lean meat. It may be eaten as it is or may be mixed with other ingredients to make a delicious sauce.\n\nJ. L.

LOUIS, MISSOURI, U.S.A.\nCHRISTMAS.\n\nFather Time has let us onward\nThrough endless years, and now\nThrough the eternal gates we hasten swiftly\nDark and gloomy sees our way!\nWhat has swept our dreams destroyed?\nWhat has brought our hopes to fall\ngather thieves, with eager faces\nWith hearts full of cheerless cheer?\n\nWe have seen that picture often,\nIn the days of long ago,\nGone are the visions, the pictures\nOnly childish hearts can know!\nRemorse now, we see, returns,\nStill in our souls we feel remains,\nOft, ever fresh, its beauty still\nStill, though the world may change!\n\nWhat is this which so endures thus,\nChristmas, all over the land?\nWhat is this which has survived since\nHeart's heart, and hand to hand?\n\nWhy has Age not dimmed thy beauty?\nPray, tell me, O Christmas tree!\n'Twas a Master-hand that drew me\nElegantly twisted years ago.\n\nDISTRICT SCHOOLS.\n\nWe recently devoted some of our space to the matter of education, and in conclusion of the importance of the subject we felt that we could make a better case for the establishment of district schools by the fresh aspect given to the matter of district schools by the recent announcement of the government of the unfortunate fact that the funds at his disposal for aiding them by paying under certain conditions a portion of the cost, salaried teachers had become exhausted. No excuse can be made against the late Hon. Mr. for having been unable to carry out the Territorial school\u2014a condition which probably he regrets as much as anyone else. We have no doubt whatever that such a proposal should have been held out by the framers of the present legislation, and that the amount have possessed a sufficient argument in favor of the scheme of the public finances present and prospective, to show that the matter had not been considered sufficiently to prove to be a sure and a definite success. We qualify our expression of regret by saying that the matter of establishing district schools is of such immense importance that even should some difficulties exist in the present instance, in consequence of this disappointment, yet the attention and energies of the people of the province will be directed so that the effort will be strained even in the face of this unexpected difficulty to prevent the establishment of district schools from falling through. That all will be able to proceed under this altered situation cannot be doubted, but hope\u2014for while in none of the districts are there any objections to the scheme which would be seriously unjustified\u2014there is every reason to believe that it is the question which immediately presents itself for consideration is how best to meet the difficulties which present the ordinance, and satisfy its vast increasing obligations are to be obtained. We believe that the proposal of the local governments are so limited that it seems wise to turn them over to a more powerful authority in the course of time the general agreement of the rising generation caused by the encouragement of whom might provide the means of obtaining the additional class to enable the government to spare some of the funds derived from the district school by the law, which would be used for the purpose of providing a thing as education for their children, of indirectly assisting by the abominations of drunkenness, by the dissipation and dissolution of the difficulty, and that it is the task of the Dominion treasury to dispose some of these funds which are now being fed into the Territorial directly and indirectly. If any arguments are necessary to do the obvious duty in helping the struggling pioneers to what next to food and clothing is most essential, we may just now address a few words which may touch them more nearly as showing that by an doing they will contribute toward the welfare of their own sons. We presume they will easily recognize that if we are to remain in the Dominion it will be to the advantage of it as a whole that the growing generation of what before long will prove to be its most valuable assets shall be educated and useful instead of ignorant and vicious citizens. We take it that the government will be willing to do its part in order by affording easy ingress to a population to develop the country's vast resources, and that it may encourage them that the settlers already here with out the prospect of education for the children they already have, cannot as heretofore, be expected to direct their best energies to further increasing that population by human industry, nor will the lands be opened up to new comers in under such discouraging circumstances. We must remind them that their own children will be subjected to similar conditions with the view of ultimately enriching themselves, by keeping the country cool, and by encouraging the residence of doubly difficult for settlers with assistance to undertake the burden of the schools. We believe that this course must enhance the value of the lands or served. Then there is no self evident advantage with respect to this matter, as to render it idle to argue it seriously.\n\nBIBLE COMPETITION.\n\nThe question of the popular paper was entitled \"Our Jeshurun a Reporter,\" anxious to dispose of the limited number of copies on hand has offered a prize of twenty-five dollars to the first correct answer to the following Bible question before the 15th Jan., 1885.
