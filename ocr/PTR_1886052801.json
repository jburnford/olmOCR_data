It seems that Inspector Hackett has been working hard during the recent troubles in Sag Harbour and Prince Albert. It is true that he does not seem to have much influence at present, but there is no doubt that he will be coming back soon. Meanwhile, we must make do without his services. Delay is dangerous.\n\nA bill has passed the U.S. Senate authorizing the President to issue proclamation allowing the United States to enter into treaties with foreign countries as are desired by the United States. This will allow the United States to enter into treaties with foreign countries as desired by the United States, and will result in the establishment of American ports and the revitalization of American vessels.\n\nNow that the government has taken steps to establish a supreme court in the Northwest, it is expected that the government will be able to settle the disputes between the various nations. The government has been working hard to bring about peace and prosperity in the Northwest, and it is hoped that the new supreme court will be able to help achieve these goals.\n\nTHE MEDICINE HAT LUMBER COY.\n\nW.

The weather was fine, and the day was spent in outdoor activities. At about noon, a large crowd gathered at the park, and a band played music. The Queen appeared on a balcony overlooking the park, and the crowd cheered. Afternoon events included cricket matches, races, and a parade.\n\nThe cricket matches were played between the Argyle and Mission clubs, and the Argyle club won. The races included a horse race, a dog race, and a bicycle race. The bicycle race was won by a member of the Mission club.\n\nThe parade featured floats and bands, and the Queen presented prizes to the winners of the races and matches.\n\nThe day ended with fireworks, and the Queen returned to Buckingham Palace.\n\nBUFFALO HALL\n\nOUR SUMMER STOCK IS NOW COMPLETE\n\nFancy Dress Goods, Prints, Cottons, etc.\n\nClothing and Furnishings\n\nStaple & Fancy Groceries\n\nBEETTS & Gwynne\n\nWARNING\n\nA LARGE STOCK OF THE LATEST STYLES\n\nFURNITURE\n\nPRICES\n\n75 per cent, below any prices quoted by dealers here.\n\nW.
