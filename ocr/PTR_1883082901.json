A very large part of the trouble has been of purely imaginary character, and seems to have had its existence principally in the mind of Mr. Young, who has corresponded who appears to have concocted their story without having any actual knowledge of the circumstances. Ontario has taken hold of the reins with a firm hand, and the proposed alliance would result in quiet possession, as Mr. Young does not seem to be disposed to cause further trouble, unless the judgment of the Courts in some of the cases now pending should be in favor of Manitoba or rather of the Dominion.\n\nINDIAN EXPENDITURE.\n\nAll the world knows by what bypaths and crooked ways I met this crown, And I myself know well how valuable some It lay upon my brow.\n\nThe Globe draws attention to the fact that under Mr. Dewdney's regime the expenditure under the head of \"Indian Grants\" has been increasing at the rate of over $200,000 per annum. The expenditure in the year ending March 31st, 1884, was $1,644,474, of which only $145,474 went to the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island collectively, while $331,874 went to the Columbian and the remainder, $899,796, went to Manitoba and the North West Territories. The annual increase was $222,079, leaving $877,726 for the Province. Of this there were spent in providing supplies distribution $50,451; in \"general expenses\" $89,972; in provisions $14,453; and in farm maintenance $37,888. These sums are insignificant, large expenses that are incurred in procuring supplies and might well occupy the attention of the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons. The public have some interest in knowing how the money was expended.\n\nTECHNICAL POINTS.\n\nThe Ontario Cabinet is composed almost exclusively of members of the legal profession, and in connection with many adverse criticisms to which the administration became inevitable, answer is always, \"That so many of the questions which continually arise are of such a legal character as to require the attention of a lawyer.\" This has been the answer given to objections in the only three departments with which serious fault has been found, viz., the Attorney General and Licence Acts. Strangely enough, no fault has been found with the branches which are under the department of the lawman member. It is now announced that the new Provincial Treasurer, semi-officially announced at the time of Mr. Young's appointment will take place. This fact, together with the legal character of many of the questions continually arising in connection with the administration of the Licence Act rendered the position of the Hon. Mr. Hardy to that of the new Provincial Treasurer, semi-officially announced at the time of Mr. Young's appointment will take place.\n\nCHOLESA IN EGYPT.\n\nThe ravages of the cholera in Africa and Asia and its march towards the west affords reasonable cause for apprehension, if not alarm. At the time of the former visit of this much dreaded epidemic, the disease was prevalent in many parts of the older Provinces were few and far between, yet the awful scourge passed few, if any, of them by. In these days of steam navigation and rapid transportation, the spread of the disease is more rapid than in the old days. In Egypt, at the present moment, the epidemic is working terrible havoc, and some twelve thousand deaths have already occurred within the last three weeks, as many five hundred being reported in one day. With the close relations existing between the stricken country and Great Britain, it is little wonder that the authorities there have become somewhat alarmed at the prospect of a visitation of the epidemic, and are acting upon the principle that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. The people of Ontario are also advised to take time by the forelock. Local municipalities are being urged by the Ontario Bureau of Health to take proper sanitary measures to prevent the disease. The people of Canada will perhaps be as easy controlled as it is amongst many other diseases which were at one time thought to be incurable. There is not much this continent can do to help the fight, the rocking corruption and the oppressive heat incident to those eastern countries where such diseases have their natural birthplace. But if proper sanitary precautions are taken by the people of Europe and America, the cholera may be confined to its eastern home.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES.\n\nAt a meeting of the Clan-na-Gael Association at Chicago, Congressmen Finney emphatically declared the approval of the members of the latter body. The Speaker Cox is being put forward as a candidate for the Speakership of the next House of Representatives. The Democrats, having control of the House, will have many advantages. Mr. Cox claims to have majority of Democrats on his side. Randall, the last Speaker, is also a candidate, and claims that the caucus will be in his favor. In the event that Randall becomes elected Speaker, he will be in a position of being the Democratic nominee for the Presidency will be increased. Sunset Cox lectured in Toronto once or twice, and is rather a hot-headed fellow.\n\nThere are going a few lords and dukes and men of high degree coming to this country just now. Lords and dukes and men of high degree would make fairly good immigrants if they took up land and came to cultivate the waste places of the earth. But this they will not do. They come out here for purposes of speculation. They want to buy land to sell again, making a difference of several per cent. This being the case, the country is really not in want of lords and dukes and men of high degree, but would be a good thing if the Government would provide the sale of land cheap in the North West to any but those who intend to cultivate it.\n\nThe Northcote arrived out from the mouth of the River Missouri early morning. She had been away from this place for some time, having to wait for a boat to help her over. Her freight was partly for Mr. Young & Co.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.\n\nPrince Albert\n\nGeneral Merchants\n\nSTEWART & WOOTON\n\nWholesale and Retail\n\nSaskatchewan.\n\nKNOX & BARKER,\n\nCarpenters and Builders,\n\nJob Work Promptly Attended To.\n\nPlans and Estimates Furnished when Desired.\n\nResidence\u2014BELL'S RESTAURANT.\n\nBELL HOTEL.\n\nMEALS AT ALL HOURS\n\nW.
