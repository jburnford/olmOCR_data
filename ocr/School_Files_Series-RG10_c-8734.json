Considering the locality and the excessive cost of living there his estimate of $3335.95 for the cost of the proposed building seems to me quite reasonable as it must be borne in mind that much of the material will have to be imported at a heavy cost of transport, while for the material procured locally, such as logs, etc., require in their manipulation much skilled labour which is necessarily high in that portion of the Superintendency.\n\nAs these\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs these Indians are making every endeavour to better their condition and as it is necessary in view of the rapid settlement of the country in that portion of the Province, I would earnestly recommend that authority be granted at the earliest possible date for the commencement of the structure so that the same may be completed and utilized for the purpose intended before next Fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn result of a conference, on the 16th of July last, between the Assistant Secretary of the Department, yourself, Chief Teach William and other Indians of both Forts Babine and myself, at this Agency, attending, and according your letter #204, R-5, dated the 8th of October last, concerning inter alia a school being established, at Fort Babine, I have the honour to enclose herewith plans of ground floor, elevation and estimates and specifications, in duplicate, respectively.\n\nIn discrimination to all submitted, many of the most profitable and practical features, adapted to local conditions, etc., etc., were derived consequent the erection of the salmon hatchery building on Babine lake.\n\nThe delay in this matter was occasioned by corresponding with the Revd. Fathers Nunez, O.M.I., and M. Coccola, Stuart Lake Mission, Stuart Lake, B.C.\n\nThereafter, I had to await the latter's arrival here, on the 13th ultimo. Then, in endeavouring to get at the cost of the material, interviewed the Manager of Hazelton Post, Hudson's Bay Company, and found that he could not give me the price of a pair of hinges, at the selling price, at Babine.\n\nAnd, since the lumber has to be whipsawed by the Indians there, and they have no conception of running feet, but only according arrangements by the piece, I finally had to resort to get all my information by corresponding with the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's Post of that locality.\n\nThe main body of the proposed school building there is desired to be of logs for reasons of avoiding as much as possible the high\n\nA. W. VOWELL, ESQ.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs, B.C., &c.\n\nVICTORIA,\nB.C.\nhigh cost of lumber there, and have a warmer building for the winter and much cooler for the extremely hot weather during the summers.\n\nOn estimating the cost thereof, complete, it will amount, in summary, to $5,555.95. This amount may seem large, but such is not the case, considering that the material has to be whipawed and dressed by hand; also, primarily, the material is for some distance to be brought; besides the cost of hardware, imported at high rate, etc., is considerable.\n\nAside of the foregoing, but appositely in connection with the establishment of the said school by the Department, I here beg leave to recommend that the Teacher's salary should be no less than $600.00, or better $800.00 per annum, for reasons of extraordinary costs of subsistence in the locality referred to.\n\nThe building will afford the Teacher's residence.\n\nUpon the establishment of this school, it is calculated to serve for the attendance of children of Fort Babine and Old Fort Babine alike, of whom there are, of school age, 48, collectively, or about 24 belonging to each.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

An amount of $8.00 per month during the winter months was provided for but as the enrolment has increased to 45 children, this amount will not be sufficient. Mr. Boys has recommended that the amount be increased to $15.00 per month and I concur in his recommendation and suggest that the amount be allowed for the months of November, 1946 to March, 1947 inclusive, a total of $75.00.\n\nD.

However, in view of the payment of family allowances, we feel that there is no great necessity for any heavy increase on the part of the Department as it is fair to presume the children are receiving better food at home and in many cases should be able to provide part at least, of the food required for their midday lunch.\n\nBernard F.

It would be appreciated if you would prepare a description and prints to be attached to surrender documents, as it will be necessary to have a surrender of this land before a sale can be arranged.\n\nD. J. Allan\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\n\nEnc.\n\nMMeC/VB\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 151-5-5\n\nI wish to refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of March 7th, 1946, and related correspondence in connection with the proposed construction of a new teacher's residence at Fort Babine; also to my letter of September 23rd last regarding the 1948-49 day school building program wherein reference was made to the construction of a one room day school with teacherage at Fort Babine.\n\nIn anticipation of construction being proceeded with early next year I have been corresponding with Mr. Indian Agent Boys regarding a suitable site for the school. His letters of November 3rd and December 5th and enclosures referred to, are enclosed for your information. You will note that an area of approximately 3.55 acres is plotted on a sketch of Babine L.R. No. 6 on the reverse of the Band resolution. Mr. Boys has been unable to tie the area in to a survey point without instruments and consequently without a survey it will be difficult to adequately describe the parcel for surrender purposes. I should appreciate being advised if the Department will require a surrender from the Band before payment is made to John Baptiste Lowley, Indian locatee, for his improvements, and if the description in the resolution would be acceptable for surrender purposes in this case seeing title is to remain in the Crown.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver,\nB.C.\n\nKindly refer to your letter of November 14th, your File 1-11-3.\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find an Agreement of Sale for the parcel of land on the Babine Indian Reserve, No. 6 which I have selected as a satisfactory School Site. You will note that John Baptiste LOWLEY the owner, has agreed to accept the sum of $75 per acre and I would suggest that a deposit of say $200 be paid to LOWLEY pending Survey following which a final settlement might be made. I would suggest that plans be sought for a School Building with Teacherage attached, plus a separate room, with an outside door to be used as accommodation for visiting officials to this remote reserve, or alternatively as a Dispensary.\n\nI feel that the need of new accommodation at Fort Babine is very urgent and I should dearly like to see a new building erected in 1948. You will note that the sum of $16,000 was set aside in the 1947-48 Estimates for this building.\n\nJ.N. Boys\nIndian Agent.\n\nJVB/MHC\nAGREEMENT OF SALE\n\nJohn Baptiste LOWLEY, otherwise known as Baptiste Tom do hereby agree to sell and surrender to the Indian Affairs Branch all my right, title and interest in and to that piece of land situate on the Babine Indian Reserve, No. 6, more properly described as follows:\n\nCommencing at a point on the East bank of the Babine River, about six chains south of the bridge; thence approximately seven chains east; thence approximately five and three quarter chains south; thence approximately five chains west to the river bank; thence following the river bank northerly to point of commencement; containing three and one half acres more or less.\n\nI agree to sell this land for use as a School Site at a price of seventy-five dollars ($75) per acre. The full amount of land to be determined by survey.\n\nSignature: John Baptiste LOWLEY (Baptiste Tom).\n\nSignature: David George.\n\nWITNESS\n\nBURNS LAKE,\nB.C.\nNovember 27th, 1947.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER,\nB.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of October 25th your file l-11-3 regarding a site for the Indian Day School at Fort Babine I note that it is required to tie in the plot to be surrendered with one of the corner posts of the Reserve.\n\nDiscussing the matter with you at Hazelton a few days ago I pointed out urgent need of a new school at Fort Babine and the fact that I have just returned from what will probably be my last trip to Fort Babine in 1947. You suggested that I should return the file to you and asked that the purchase be considered pending survey of the property.\n\nIt is understood that having no instruments that I can tie this lot in only very roughly and it is felt that until a further survey is made that the bridge might serve as a point of commencement.\n\nAs to the value of the land the suggestion of $100 per acre is purely tentative and I would suggest that an offer be made to Baptiste Lowley on the basis of whatever value the Director may feel is proper. I trust that this matter may be completed before the opening of navigation on Babine Lake next spring.\n\nJ.W. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJVB/NHc\n\nIndian Affairs.

A school survey indicates that there are 79 children 16 years of age and under at this point. Of this number 46 are in the age group 6 to 16. The pre-school age population is 33. Although the number of school age children would appear to warrant the construction of a two room school, due to the nomadic life of many of the families it is felt that a one room would probably meet the actual need.\n\nI might say that a school was operated at this point up until March of 1940 when the present teacher at Fort Babine was transferred from Old Fort. At the time of his transfer there were 23 pupils enrolled in the Old Fort School, with an average attendance of 11.3. The school apparently remained closed, partly because of the acute teacher shortage.\n\nThe building in use was an old structure rented from one of the natives belonging to the reserve. It is quite unsuitable for school purposes and is in very poor repair.\n\n(sgd.) W.S. Arneil\nW.S.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDay School Building Programme - British Columbia.\n\nDear Bill:\n\nI am still waiting anxiously for the final prints of plan 891, as I told you in my previous letter of May 16.\n\nI have decided not to wait much longer for these plans but would suggest the action outlined below:\n\nFort Babine Indian Day School\n\nAs this is a school without hydro, I would suggest that we proceed immediately to advertise for the erection of this two-room school with teacherage, plan 891. Please find attached the draft advertisement which I would like you to check over and if satisfactory, we will arrange to run this advertisement at once. I would suggest that it be advertised in the two main Vancouver papers, the Prince Rupert Daily News and the Interior News at Smithers, B. C. I have marked this advertisement No. 1 and would welcome an early message indicating if advertisement No. 1 is satisfactory or any changes which you would wish to have made in it.\n\nHartley Bay Indian Day School\nTakla Lake Indian Day School\nKincolith Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware, a two-room school with electricity and running water is being designed and will be termed plan 891. I am sending you a draft advertisement marked No. 2 but we cannot\nproceed with this advertisement until the plans are in your hands and deemed to be satisfactory. The one thing that concerns me is that the electricity is designed for hydro alternating current and I presume that the power supply at Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Lakelseap will be from a D.C. village lighting plant. I have spoken to Miss Walton about this and will get details of the lighting plants at these three villages from her if possible. I can then advise the electrical engineer accordingly.\n\nI would welcome your comments on advertisement 2 and will hold this in readiness until you have seen the plans and wired your approval to proceed with advertising. As recommended by Mr. Anfield, this advertisement should appear in both Vancouver papers and in the Prince Rupert Daily News.\n\nDouglas Indian Day School\n\nChehalis Indian Day School\n\nThese are one-room schools and teacherages and we have yet to receive the information reports. I presume that plan 888 will be followed and that both these schools could be advertised together. I have therefore drafted advertisement No. 3 which I think would cover these two projects. We should of course have the information reports first and a definite indication that water is available and that the site is satisfactory. However, I will expect a letter from you covering these two schools.\n\nUcluelet Indian Day School\n\nGlascoo Indids Day School\n\nWe will write a separate letter about this based on the information on Inspector Davey's recent report.\n\nTo conclude, therefore, I feel that we can take the following action immediately:\n\n(a) Advertise for tenders for the Fort Babine School\n(b) Advertise for tenders for the Douglas and Chehalis Schools.\n(c) Be prepared to advertise for Hartley Bay, Lakelsep and Kincolith Schools as soon as the plans are ready and seen by you.\n\nI sincerely hope that the above meets with your approval and that the advertisements will draw tenders. So far we have been quite pleased with the response received to date in answer to our advertisements on the Prairies and in Eastern Canada.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFort Babine Indian Day School\n\nDear Bill:\n\nThe tenders for the erection of this school have been opened, and I am rather disappointed with the results. In the first place, only one tender was received and this was from Precision Housing Co. Ltd., in Vancouver in amount of $67,391.00. Their letter read as follows:\n\n\"Enclosed please find tender for the supply and erection at the site of Fort Babine, B.C., a two classroom Indian Day School with teachers quarters. The remoteness of this location necessitates extreme precaution of the contractor as we are informed there are absolutely no facilities at Fort Babine.\n\nPrecision Housing would, due to the above, be prepared to supply and erect this building on a cost plus 15% basis or for the firm tender of $67391.00. We feel that considerable saving could be made on a cost plus basis.\"\n\nAs you are aware, this is much higher than any price we have been called upon as yet for a two-room school, and I would doubt very much whether authority could be obtained for its acceptance.\n\nDo you think we could obtain a firm tender for a quonset type building for Fort Babine? If so, I could\nsuggest to the Director that we recommend to the Minister's Office that this Precision House Company Limited Tender be rejected as too high and that you be requested to approach the Quonset people in Vancouver for a firm price tender for the erection of a two-room school on their plan at Fort Sabine.\n\nIf you wish to reply by Army Signal that you agree with this suggestion, then I will be pleased to take action immediately in making this recommendation.\n\nWith best good wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Boys' letter of Sept. 21st attached, we are still awaiting a decision from you with regard to the erection of prefabricated schools in the Skeena River and Babine Agencies.\n\nWith regard to acquisition of a site for the above-mentioned school, I note from our files that a surrender of the area was secured and forwarded to the Department on October 13th, 1948. Having in mind, however, that the Department cannot acquire title to school sites on Indian Reserves will you please advise if in this case we should arrange a transfer of the Indian locat\u00e9e's interest to the Band and permission from the Band to use the area for school purposes for so long as it is required, subject of course to payment of the amount agreed upon to the locat\u00e9e, John Baptiste Lowley.\n\nMr. Boys has prepared a voucher, No. 759, payable to Mr. Lowley in the amount of $225.00 and this is enclosed.\n\nW.

Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nFort Babine Indian Day School\n\nI have copy of your letter of 12th September to the Department; I agree that it would be a very wise step to purchase a pre-fabricated building out of the funds available in this fiscal year and I feel sure that satisfactory arrangements can be made for erection of the building next summer. This should give us the early start so necessary in view of our short season.\n\nKindly refer to my letter dated 5th December 1947, we have not yet paid John Baptiste Lowley for the proposed site. I do not know if the Department is going to insist upon a survey before passing the voucher, but I am submitting voucher herewith in favour of this Indian on the basis of three acres of land at $75 per acre, in accordance with the agreement he signed dated 27th November 1947 and supported by the Band's resolution proving ownership. If it is found following survey that a further sum is due the owner we could submit a second voucher at that time.\n\nIf towards the end of the current fiscal year it is found there is a surplus of funds for the school building programme in this Province I would suggest that the same procedure might be followed, namely purchase of a pre-fabricated building for some of the points in this Agency urgently requiring a new school building, and we have several, so that we may get under way with their erection at a much earlier date next spring.\n\nJ.V.

We did not receive the firm tender from this company until August 8 and it was forwarded immediately for the necessary Order-in-Council. We cannot understand Mr. Byng-Hall's statement that their tender stated that acceptance must be made by the end of July, 1949.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Fort Babine Indian Day School\n\nFurther to my letter of September 2nd, I am enclosing a letter dated September 9th, from the Maple Leaf Construction Limited (formerly National All-Steel Buildings Limited) confirming that they are unable at this time to accept the contract for the erection of the above-mentioned school building and advising that they would be prepared to submit a new tender early next year.\n\nPresumably it will be necessary to re-advertise for tenders for the construction of this building next year, but in view of the isolated location, I doubt whether we will ever receive any great response. It appears to me that the solution to our problem at Fort Babine would be to purchase immediately, or prior to the end of the fiscal year, a prefabricated two-room school with teachersage, for shipment to Fort Babine as soon as the lake is open in the spring, for erection on a day labour or contract basis as soon as funds are available next year. It is quite likely that the Maple Leaf Construction Limited would tender on the erection of a prefabricated building and if not, it should not be too difficult for us to arrange for erection on a day labour basis, under the supervision of Mr. Boys.\n\nIf this suggestion is approved, we will obtain from Prefabricated structures a tender on the building, and prior to March 31st, endeavour to secure tenders on erection, or otherwise make plans for erection on a day labour basis. If\nthis procedure is followed, it will permit us to make use of part of the funds available this year.\n\nfor W.S.

It is now of course too late to consider construction by any other means and there would appear to be no alternative but to leave construction of the Fort Babine School until next year.\n\nIn a separate communication I am writing to you with regard to prefabricated school buildings and feel that, in view of our experience this year in the matter of the construction of schools by contract, using standard methods, we should seriously consider the use of prefabricated buildings.\n\nW.S.

The reason for this is that the Company feels that this new plan is much more suitable than the original design and I am in complete agreement. The increase in cost is not altogether due to the change in design. Increases in cost of steel and freight rates are also contributing factors. The price of steel, I am informed by the representative of the Maple Leaf Distributors has increased 12% and freight rates 6%.\n\nIt will be recalled that we are using the original Fort Babine design at Ucluelet and although this building is not at present completed the faults in the plan are now becoming evident. There is only one means of egress from the two classrooms which is considered a fire hazard. The lighting in the main corridor between the two classrooms is inadequate. The general appearance of the building is not in its favour. The new submission overcomes the first two mentioned difficulties and will provide a much more attractive structure. Since visiting the provincial school at Alexandria, which is based on similar design, I am convinced that the natural lighting in the classrooms will be much superior to the Ucluelet building.\n\nR.F.

We have endeavoured to reach an arrangement with the Maple Leaf Construction Company in this connection, not only to avoid the necessity of having the Order-in-Council cancelled, but to take advantage of the funds available this year.\n\nSince the Company first tendered on this school construction project steel prices have increased 12% and freight rates, etc., and the Company find themselves in the position of being unable to supply the building quoted upon at the price mentioned in the Order-in-Council. They have, therefore, submitted a new tender dated November 9th, which is attached hereto, covering revised specifications and plans, a copy of which is being forwarded to you under separate cover. You will note that their firm price is $31,700.00 subject to the contract being signed by May 15th, 1950, so that the school could be constructed during the months of June and July. The material costs for this particular building are estimated at $16,000.00 and, reference their tender, the Company are prepared to cooperate in any way possible to effect purchase of the materials this year with the actual erection taking place next year.\n\nIt is difficult to see how this can be arranged, as the Company cannot provide storage in Vancouver and there are no storage facilities at Burns Lake or Fort Babine. The only suggestion I can make is that a further submission be made to Council for acceptance of this new tender, on the understanding that the Company will secure and bill us for the full value of the materials prior to March 31st, payment to be made to them up to 90% of the value of the materials by means of a Progress Payment as\nnormally provided for in construction contracts. This will enable us to take advantage of the funds available this year and will reduce the expenditure required from next year's appropriation to $15,970.00.\n\nFor your further information a memorandum dated November 9th, from District School Inspector Davey, with regard to the improved design of the building, is attached. I might also mention that the Company are prepared to carry out the minor changes suggested by Mr. Davey without extra cost and will, in addition, increase the size of the basement as shown on the plan to include the unexcavated area between the front steps and the furnace room as shown, to provide space for fuel storage.\n\nfor W.S.

I have discussed the matter with Mr. Cory who informs me that a Submission to Council to rescind P. C. 4186 is not necessary at this time.\n\nWhen you decide on what means will be taken to construct the Babine Day School and Teacherage, a Submission to Council will be necessary containing whatever recommendations you intend to make, and when this is done the Submission can contain a request that P. C. 4186 be rescinded. Even this is not actually necessary, Mr. Cory stated, but for the records of the Privy Council would be advisable.\n\nThe above information was secured at the request of the Director.\n\nM.

Vancouver, plus additional charges for freight, erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses, the total amount of such charges being estimated at approximately $4,500.00.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted to expend a sum not exceeding $15,000.00 in purchasing from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, a two-room Indian day school with attached teachers' residence, laid down on the Port Babine Indian Reserve in the Province of British Columbia.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration.\nOttawa, 31 March, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nFort Babine Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find attached a Submission to Council recommending the rescinding of P.C. 4186 of 24 August, 1949, and the purchase of a prefabricated school for this reserve.\n\nThis Order-in-Council authorized the acceptance of a tender received from National All-Steel Buildings, Limited, 1768 Hastings Street East, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the erection of a two-room school and teacherage on the Fort Babine Indian Reserve, British Columbia, in the firm amount of $22,825.00.\n\nWhen this company was advised that their tender had been accepted they replied that they were unable to accept the contract at this time.

Buddrus as manual training instructor of this school at the rate of $8.00 per week. I omitted to ask renewal for the 1948/49 school year and Mr. Buddrus taking it for granted that such an arrangement still existed has been teaching ten senior pupils manual training. In the hope that the arrangement may be authorized for this year a voucher is enclosed for payment to Mr. Buddrus for his services during the period 7th September to 17th December.\n\nMr. Buddrus also informs me that he requires a few additional tools for this class, namely three heavy jack knives for carving and a small block plane with 1/8\" blade. Would you kindly arrange to have these items sent from Vancouver in my care.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.W. BOYS\nIndian Superintendent\n\nJVB:bms\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Mr. Max Buddrus - Manual Training Instructor Moricetown Indian Day School Your File 151-22-11 (WT.1)\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 4th, 1947, authorizing the employment of the above-named at a rate of $6.00 per week, I would draw your attention to the last paragraph of my letter of August 14th, 1947, in which I stated that services of the above-named would terminate at the end of the 1947-48 academic year. In this connection, I am forwarding Superintendent Boys' letter of January 30th, 1949, requesting authority for renewal of Mr. Buddrus' services during the 1948-49 academic year and I would so recommend. You will note that Mr. Davey has concurred with Mr. Boys' request.\n\nBabine Agency Voucher No.95, in the amount of $120.00, covering Mr. Buddrus' salary from September 7th to December 17th, 1948, is enclosed and I would recommend payment.\n\nThe items referred to in the last paragraph of Mr. Boys' letter, are being ordered by this Office.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Fort Babine Indian DaySchool\nManual Training Supplies\n\nAttached is a requisition from the teacher at the above mentioned school for manual training supplies, the cost of which would amount to approximately $90.00.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department authorize the purchase of this material and equipment.\n\nIt will be noted that the teacher has included on this requisition two books which should have been placed upon the normal book requisition. It is thought that the titles intended are:\n\n(1) Square Knot, Tanning, Fringe and Needle Work\n\n(2) Working in Leather\n\nBoth of these titles appear in copies of the Indian School Bulletin. It will be appreciated if these can be forwarded to the teacher concerned.\n\nW.S.

P.H. DuVernet, Bishop of the diocese of Caledonia, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"A.W. Vowell\"\nIndian Supt., B.C.,\nper W. MacLoughlin.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., June 15, 1908.\n\nMy dear Mr. Lorene,\n\nAiyansh, 70 miles up the Nass River in a rich agricultural valley, is another place where I should like the Day School strengthened by the application of the Hon. Mr. Oliver's new policy. The Aiyansh Indians are willing to set apart a small reserve of 170 acres for school purposes if something could be done to teach them farming. Here again the need is for an increased grant. The time is past to expect to take missionary money to teach farming. Our Church will most heartily co-operate with the Government.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"P.H. DuVernet\",\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, February 13th., 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department was furnished some time ago by Mr. Supt. Vowell with a copy of your letter to Mr. Agent Lorenz regarding the possibility of affording better educational facilities for the Indians of the North West Agency B.C. In your communication you suggested the improvement of the Day School on the Aiyunish Reserve and stated that the Indians were willing to set apart 170 acres of their Reserve for school purposes if something could be done to teach them farming. The Department will be willing to carry out a plan for extending the usefulness of the day schools when it is assured that the time is ripe and the conditions favorable for doing so. Full information should be forthcoming as to whether there would be a sufficient number of children permanently on the Reserve to justify the expenditure of the amount necessary to properly conduct a new type of school.\n\nWhen this fact is established there is still the question of securing the services of a teacher with the necessary qualifications to carry on such a school, and the Department would like you to suggest the name of a\n\nRight Rev. F.H. DuVernet, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMarried man for Teacher, whose wife would be able to assist in carrying out the scheme, which includes improvements in the domestic habits of the women on the Reserve; the aim being to educate the Indian children amid their native surroundings and while inculcating principles of thrift and self dependence to improve at the same time the conditions of life in their homes. It need hardly be pointed out that the success of the proposed plan depends largely on the persons selected to inaugurate it; they should capable beyond all doubt of carrying on the work in which they are to be engaged. The Department is of the opinion that only such persons as are well versed in the usages of the country and have the welfare and improvement of the Indian at heart should be employed in this work.\n\nMay I ask that you will give this matter careful consideration and report to the Department at your early convenience, for it would be advisable to have the new arrangements made at an early date so that any field or garden work may be taken up in good time. Would you also be so kind as to state what would be considered a fair salary for this service.\n\nIn your letter you also mention Massett as being a suitable place for improving the Day School, and as the Department's remarks with reference to a suitable teacher, &c., for Aiyanimish apply equally to this locality, we would be glad...\nto be furnished with any suggestions you may make regarding the educational needs of the Indians at the latter place.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nThe Secretary, of Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAbsence from the mainland at Massett, Q.C.I., has delayed my answering your letters of Feb 13 and 19, No 67,340-1, and 125,342-1 which awaited my return.\n\nI take these letters as asking for my candid opinion upon what we all feel to be a most difficult problem. Let me say first that I am most anxious to assist the Department in every possible way in carrying out their new policy of improved Day Schools. I have thought the matter over long and carefully and discussed it with some of our missionaries. I am quite willing to sacrifice denominational pride for the best interests of the Indians. Allow me to express my views freely in hope of helping the cause.\n\n1. No one policy will suit all parts of Canada. It is necessary to modify a general policy according to local conditions. The policy of an improved day school as outlined by the Department seems to suggest the Prairies rather than British Columbia.\n\n2. Speaking for the Church of England in Northern British Columbia let me try and explain the local conditions.\n\nWe began Christian work among the Coast Indians over fifty years ago. Our 2,300 Christianized Indians have their homes in villages, most of them live in modern houses, dress well &c. In almost every village there is a clergyman and his wife and family. The clergyman is practically a doctor.\n\nWithout\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 1)\nWithout any remuneration he is constantly tending the sick, gives practical advice, tells them the danger of evil germs, urges them to keep their houses clean, his wife (like Mrs. Collison of Kincolith) is constantly giving the women hints in domestic matters, there is a day school in the village, usually taught by a white woman, a single lady who lives with the missionary and his wife. It would be impossible for a single lady to live elsewhere in the village. The cost of reaching these villages up the rivers &c is considerable. The freight or food &c. is excessive, and yet the Department only allows $300.00 a year, subject to reduction, to keep up this Day School, pay travelling expenses and teacher's salary. I have inspected the Day Schools at Metlacatla, Kitkatla, Massett, Kincolith, Lakkal-zap, Aiyansh, Gitwangak, Hazelton &c. and found, not as I have found east of the Rockies, three or four children in a school, but from fifteen to forty five. The younger generation of our Indians have all passed through these Day Schools and the result is far beyond what the Department could possible expect from such inadequate support. I have heard a young Indian man read the lessons in Church in English better than many white men could and yet he had had no other education than that obtained at the village day school. Viewed in the light of relative expenditure I have no hesitation in saying that there has been far greater returns from the Day School than the so called Industrial School which on the per capita system could not afford to keep first class trades instructors. It is on this ground that I appeal to the Department to use some of the money saved from the closing of our Metlacatla Industrial School and strengthen these Day Schools which under great disadvantages have accomplished so much good.\n\nIt seems\nIt seems invidious for me to name two of these Day Schools and leave the others out. I mentioned Massett because it is the largest Day School, 50 on the roll, and the place is 80 miles from the mainland, and Aiyansh because a school midway between Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks would answer both villages and give a good number of children but all these Day Schools should be considered and an increased grant made.\n\nAccepting the policy of the improved Day School and applying it to our local conditions here what are the modifications necessary?\n\nFrom the description given of our villages it will be seen that a nurse is scarcely needed. Some one should have authority to inspect the Indian houses and order a thorough disinfecting once or twice a year.\n\nExcept in the case of a school midway between Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks a mid-day meal does not seem necessary. Many of our Indians are adopting out food. They all have kitchen stoves. They know how to cook. They are not in want. It is mistaken policy for the Government to relieve the parents of the duty of providing for their children.\n\nIn regard to industrial training, very few of the children attending day school are old enough to profit from a course of industrial training.\n\nThe very best thing the Government could do for our Indians is to employ a first class carpenter and boat-builder and have him visit our villages in turn forming classes of young men from 16 up. Most of our Indians are very quick with tools; the Massett men build fine schooners. A skilled white man could teach them much that would be most useful in a short course. It would not be necessary to visit each village.\nvillage each year.\n\nLet me now mention the one great difficulty in the way of making the Day School meet the need of the ordinary Indian child. Absence from home at certain seasons. If our Indians lived all the year round in their villages there would be no need whatever for Boarding Schools or Industrial Schools except one central denominational one for a few of the most promising and perfectly sound children, but this is not the case. The cannery season from June 15 to Sept. 1st does not seriously interfere as most of this is vacation time, but in most of our villages there is another season which comes in March or April when the parents go off and take their children. They would gladly leave them behind them if we could in any way house and feed them for a few weeks. I have thought much over this and talked it over with our leading missionaries. They all agree that this is the problem.\n\nMeet this difficulty and the Day School is all that the ordinary child needs, and the parents will not feel the separation as in the case of a distant Boarding School. \"My child might as well be dead\" said one mother bitterly when she found she could not get her child back for eight years.\n\nIn some cases only a few of the people go away at one time. If we had a man and his wife in charge, a tent that would hold a dozen children, with blankets &c might meet the need. I think the parents would be willing to provide food for their children during their absence. Our Missionaries are willing to co-operate as they see the importance of keeping the children at school. The difficulty is that an equipment is needed for a short time.\n\nTo come to details, Nasset has 50 children on the roll.\n\nIf anything...\nIf anything in the way of an improved Day School is attempted, this school should stand first. If the Department takes up the proposal to have a joint school midway between Aiyansh and Gitladamiks, giving a midday meal I understand that the Aiyansh people will give 1 and 1/2 acres, and Gitladamiks the same on the boundary. There is a good road winter and summer. Distance from each village about one mile. As the Department has promised new school houses there should be economy in combining buildings, salaries &c.\n\nAs to Hazelton we have a splendid teacher there, Miss Soal, who also is a demoness and visits the native people in their homes. I have heard that the Methodists are pressing for a Boarding School there. The Church of England has in Hazelton and neighbourhood about 600 Indians, the Methodists none in Hazelton but in the vicinity (10 miles north and 10 miles south) about 270, the Salvation Army a few dozen, the Roman Catholics have a village 3 or 4 miles away.\n\nPlainly the only way to have a successful Boarding School is for us all to unite upon an interdenominational school with the privilege of giving religious instruction to our own flock. So far as our Indians in Hazelton are concerned an improved day school on the line indicated would, I think, meet the need. Why should the Government take children away from their parents and clothe and feed them, when these parents live in good houses, earn good wages &c.?\n\nAs I have already pointed out travelling expenses are high, the cost of living much greater than in the East, it is necessary to offer a man and his wife a good salary to make...\nto make it worth their while to go to an out of the way place and live among Indians. I earnestly trust that the Department will recognize the fact that the Day Schools cannot be made efficient on $300.00 a year. Until I know how much the salary is to be I cannot very well secure capable teachers but I shall be looking out for such.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nB.C.

No returns have been received since then until the December quarter, 1915.\n\nMr. Inspector Tyson in his report on the schools in the Nass Agency for the year 1914 states as follows:\n\n\"At Aiyansh and Gitlada'micks conditions are very unsatisfactory. The new schools which were to be erected at these places have, as yet, not been built, owing to the fact that the Indians want industrial schools established in place of the ordinary day schools, and although part of the lumber and other materials have been provided for the new schools work has not been commenced.\" Again, when he visited the schools with the Royal Commission, in speaking of Aiyansh he states that \"visited the 9th of October. School has been conducted here by an Indian named Mercer, who...\"\nwho receives a small remuneration from the Indian people. They are, however, very anxious to have a qualified teacher appointed and ask that if it is possible to have one sent in at once, arrangements will be made to secure a temporary school building.\"\n\nJudging by Mr. Tyson's report there was no school conducted during the year 1913-14, but you will see from his second report that an Indian named Mercer had been conducting a school there and received a small remuneration from the Indians. This Indian never received any authority to open the school from the Department and no returns were sent in and the Department had no knowledge of it until Mr. Tyson's report was received in November of last year. As the school was apparently not in operation no notice was taken of this report. The Department does not know how much the Indians paid Mr. Mercer, what benefit the children received from his teaching or how long he conducted the school and the only way to find out would be to obtain a report from Mr. Agent Perry.\n\nWe have no reports from either the Agent or the School Inspector regarding this school since it was closed. Rev. Mr. Green, late School Inspector, visited Aiyansh in May, 1912, in company with Agent Perry, and found the school closed and he recommended that it be not re-opened until there was a proper understanding with the Indians in regard...\nregard to school matters and until the church authorities obtained a qualified and suitable teacher approved by the Department.\n\nNothing was done about re-opening the school until late last fall, when Miss Vera A. Chasteney was appointed teacher. The school was again opened at the end of December, last.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Aiyansh Indian School for the month of April, 1916.

Original on 67340-7\n\nThe activities of Field Matron Royds have greatly aided in securing a good attendance. The latter has begun to decrease on account of the Indians moving to their fishing camps. The Indians will shortly be at the Salmon fisheries, the attendance will be practically nil.\n\nMiss Chastenay has applied for vacation during July and August.\n\nSgd. Char. E. Perry,\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 22, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Aiyansh Indian Day School for the month of April last, in which you state that Miss Ghastonay, the teacher, has applied for vacation during July and August I beg to say that you will see from the enclosed copy of the Indian Day School Regulations that these are the two months set for the summer holidays for Indian day schools. It is considered that the teacher should take her vacation while the Indians are at the salmon fisheries, so that the school may be opened when they return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, after a full discussion of school matters on the Nass River, has given authority to make appointments of teachers to take the places of the Misses Chasteney and Bowen, of Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks, respectively, and Miss Freeman, of Gwinoha, who has resigned. The two first named teachers have been given a month's notice to vacate their school.\n\nConsent has also been given to discontinue the Field Matroncy at Gwinoha and to the appointment of a male teacher who will be able to minister to the needs of the small Gwinoha population, so that it will be no longer necessary to have a second person appointed solely for company for the teacher.\n\nI would inform you that in accordance with instructions of the Deputy Superintendent General I have taken steps to have suitable appointments made jointly by the School Inspector and Inspector of Agencies, at Vancouver, who will have any assistance I can give.\n\nI trust that the steps proposed to be made will have the effect of producing more efficient and effective work, and that the schools of these villages will be in operation under good teachers when the Fall session commences.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCharles C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 13, 1916.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRegarding the dismissal of Miss Chasteney, teacher of the Aiyansh Indian School, Nass River, by Mr. Inspector Tyson, as stated in her letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that this is the first intimation the Department has received that Miss Chasteney's services have been dispensed with and there is nothing on file to show that Mr. Tyson consulted the Department before dismissing her.\n\nThe school was opened in December, last, and the only reports received are two from Mr. Agent Perry for the months of April and May, last. In the April report he states that the school is being conducted with apparently satisfactory results. There is nothing to show, however, that he visited the school since it has been opened. In the May report he states that the children are all leaving for the canneries at Port Nelson and that Miss Chasteney is taking her holidays during the months of July and August, as he had been unable to arrange with the cannery management to have a summer school there.\n\nIn this report he calls attention to the friction which...\nwhich exists between the field matron and the two young teachers. He says that Miss Royds, the field matron, is doing well at Aiyansh and her work is fully appreciated by the Indians. It has been reported to him that the school is often closed when it should be open. The teacher and matron are living apart and there is no co-operation that would have a tendency to make the work of the school effective. He thinks that the trouble lies in the fact that the teacher, who is young and just from the Normal School, together with Miss Bowen, who is also a young girl straight from Normal School, looked to Miss Royds to do all the housework cooking, etc., and were unwilling to do their share in the housework and other domestic duties. Instead of getting Indian help they quarrelled and separated. The Indians are ready to see that friction exists and the effect is not good from any point of view. He recommends the appointment of a more experienced and older person to take charge after the vacation, if one can be secured.\n\nPossibly Mr. Inspector Tyson had received a similar report and acted on it. Apparently Miss Chasteney was not suitable for the position and the interests of the school called for the appointment of another teacher. Her\nHer services practically ceased on the 30th of June and Mr. Tyson's notice of dismissal was to take effect on the 31st of July. This is giving her one month's notice, which is all that is required, while she claims that she should be paid until the end of August.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott Esq.,\nEducation Department, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will remember my name in connection with the Aigasht Indian School, Nas River, where I have been in charge since the opening of the school in December last. As you know, I started under great disadvantage owing to the desertion of the person who was sent up as field matron, thus leaving me the house duties as well as my school work, in the severity of a northern winter. However, I did my best and fulfilled my school duties conscientiously and I believe very successfully. I had many expressions of satisfaction and gratitude from the natives.\n\nIt was arranged by Agent Perry, Metlakatla, that I take as my holiday the months July and August. On arriving in Vancouver I was requested to call at Mr. Tyson's office, where I\nwas handed a notice signed by Mr. Tyson, dated July 3rd, saying that my services would not be required after July 31st, giving no reason for my dismissal. I believe under school law that I am entitled to an inspection, which I have not had, also to a full month's notice from the first of the month. I therefore consider that I am entitled to my salary until the end of August and above all a reason for my dismissal, if this crude notice is official.\n\nI have been unable to send in my report for the June quarter, having no report forms, for which I have asked Agent Perry repeatedly during the past seven weeks. I understand that the forms are essential to acceptance.\n\nMy cheque for the March quarter, which I received late in June in spite of the fact that they left August promptly at the close of the quarter, did not include the Physical Drill Bonus to which I am entitled under Strathcona Trust. This also I have mentioned to Mr. Perry.\nbut have received no reply whatever, either to this or to my request for report forms.\n\nI am sorry to trouble you personally with this but will you kindly take the matter up and see what can be done. I feel particularly hurt and discouraged at such neglect and bad treatment after putting my best efforts against such odds into my school work, single handed, with forty-eight pupils.\n\nTrusting you will give this your immediate attention,\n\nYours truly,\nVera A. Chasteney.\nOttawa, July 17, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant stating that Mr. Inspector Tyson gave you a notice dated the 3rd instant stating that your services as teacher of the Aiyansh Indian Day School would not be required after the 31st of this month.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the school year ended on the 30th of June, last, and Mr. Tyson's notice that your services were no longer required has the Department's approval. On the receipt of your return for the June quarter you will be paid for that quarter and also for the month of July.\n\nI may inform you that the Strathcona Trust is not applicable to the Indian schools, which do not come under the provincial regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She has a State certificate which is said to be equivalent to a B.C. Certificate. I have interviewed this lady and think she will be willing to go there. Her husband is not strong, and he would go with her. He cannot do much work and Mrs. Bromley is earning for both.

Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince the recent turn of events on the Nass River, B.C., i.e., the dismissal of Mrs. Phillipson, formerly Miss Royds, Field Matron, also the charge against Mr. Phillipson, Constable, it may occur to you that not\nI have excellent testimonials both from a British Columbia Inspector and from Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, who, at the time of my dismissal was kind enough to say that he considered a great injustice had been done me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nVera A. Chasteney.\n\nAll the trouble there a year ago was caused by the two young teachers, Miss Bowen and myself, on whom the blame was laid.\n\nIn view of the above developments, should you, on mature consideration, wish at any time to re-instate me as teacher at Aipinch I should be only too pleased to continue in faithful work among the natives, to whom I became greatly attached.\nOttawa, October 4, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo stating that, should the Department at any time wish to re-instate you as teacher of the Aiyansh School, you would be pleased to continue in faithful work among the natives there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there is no vacancy at this school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Vera A. Chasteney,\n2043 Pendrell St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir;\n\nMiss Lydia Hayes taught the Day School at Aiyansh on the Skeena River from October the 1st, 1916 to June 30th, 1917. Had Miss Hayes taught a Public School in the Province of B.C. for that time she would have received salary for the month of July. The School Law provides for that.\n\nThrough some misunderstanding she has been notified by the Indian Agent, Mr. C.G. Perry, that she is not to be paid for the holidays.\n\nIn all fairness, she is entitled to pay, at least, for the month of July. Therefore, I recommend that she be paid the sum of $75.00. I think she would be satisfied with this.\n\nHad she taught ten months she would have had two months holidays for which she would have received pay. According to that way of looking at it she is entitled to nine tenths of $150.00 for the holidays.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nOttawa, November 21, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, in which you apply for a balance of salary for Miss Lydia Hayes, late teacher of the Aiyansh Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, that as you were informed by official letter of October 12, 1916, Miss Hayes' salary was to be at the rate of $75.00 per month for the ten teaching months in the year.\n\nMiss Hayes began duties October 1, 1916 and taught till June 30, 1917, a period of nine months, for which she has been paid at the rate above mentioned.

Mr. Inspector Tyson and Mr. Agent Perry will be informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n249 Hastings St. East,\nVancouver, B.C.\n249 Hastings St. East,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nNov. 23rd, 1916.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October the 12th, no. 29590/1.\n\nConcerning the salary which the teachers at Gwinnah, Aiyunah, and Tilakdamik were to receive, there seems some misunderstanding.\n\nThese teachers were appointed in response to a letter from D.C. Scott, Esq., Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nMr. A.M. Tyson, Inspector of Indian Agencies and I were authorized to confer and make the appointments. Nothing was said about the salary to be paid when we received our instructions.\n\nMiss S. Sturges, teacher at Lakalap, was appointed by us two years ago at a salary of $75.00 per month, twelve months the year.\n\nWe naturally supposed the same salary would prevail for the upper classes. These teachers have gone to work with the understanding. There will be much dissatisfaction if the holidays are cut off.\nOn my recent trip north, I was delayed at Skidegate waiting for a boat to carry me to the Mainland. I visited a Public School located at Sandpit. The enrollment was sixteen and the salary $90.00 per month for twelve months in the year. Our Provincial educational Dept. finds it impossible to get teachers for the isolated schools unless the salary is increased. The salaries for these small outlying schools under the Public School system runs from $80.00 to $100.00 per month, twelve months in the year.\n\nThese teachers that have been sent North to the Nass River are all trained teachers, and would not have gone had we stated the salary was for ten month in the year.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian schools for B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo giving the names of the three teachers who have been sent to take charge of the Indian Day schools at Gwinoha, Gitlakdamiks, and Aiyansh and enclosing vouchers covering their travelling expenses from Vancouver to Kincolith.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Frank Vangorder as teacher at Gwinoha, Mr. H.R. Johnson at Aiyansh and Miss Lydia Hayes at Gitlakdamiks. They will be paid at the same rate as the former teachers of these three schools, viz., $75.00 a month for the ten teaching months.\n\nA cheque in payment of the transportation expenses of these teachers has been sent to the Union Steamship Co. as you requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP.H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, June 20, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 12th of April last, in which you were informed that the Department would accept the services of Mr. and Mrs. Gray as teacher and field matron for the Lekalasop Indian School after the return of the Indians to the reserve in September next, I beg to say that since then the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, who were teacher and matron respectively at Kitkatla, has been received, and Mr. Agent Fouger now recommends that the Rev. Walter A. Gray and his wife should be sent there to succeed Mr. and Mrs. Oliver. It is presumed that this is the Mr. Gray referred to in your letter of the 25th of March last, and who was recommended by Bishop DuVernet for the Lekalasop school.\n\nAs it is not the wish of the Department to dispense with the services of Miss Burgess and Miss Copper, who hold the positions of teacher and field matron at Aiyansh, where there is at present no building available for school purposes, owing to the owner having decided to remove it, the Department agrees with you that it would be well to transfer them to Lekalasop, where there will be vacancies if the Grays are sent to Kitkatla, and Mr. Agent Fouger is being informed that the Grays may be placed in charge at Kitkatla, where they are anxious to go. He is being requested to advise you of their acceptance of these positions, at the same rate of salary as was paid the Olivers.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 1)\nAs soon as you receive word from Mr. Rougier that the Grey's have accepted this offer you can notify Miss Sturges and Miss Cooper of their transfer to Laxklesap. You should advise the Department of the date of their transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, February 5, 1918.\n\nS. A.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing the returns of the Lakalsap Day School for the month of October and those of Aiyansh for the months of November and December last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary of Miss Sturges was sent you by telegram on the 5th of December last covering the months of October, November, December and January 31st.\n\nThe Department is now forwarding under separate cover, a cheque for $150.00, being the salary of Miss Sturges for the months of August and September last. As owing to the agreement made her salary is to be paid for a full year instead of for 10 teaching months. From the quarterly forwarded by you it is shown that Miss Sturges has only taught a period of 30 days since July last, namely, 15 days at Lakalsap during the month of October and 15 days after her transfer to Aiyansh during November and December.\n\nIt is recognized that Miss Sturges was put to considerable inconvenience on her way to Aiyansh and by the floods at that place after her arrival. It is hoped, however, that she and the matron are both comfortably settled and that the school will be kept open regularly each\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert\nB. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (R: 10, Volume 6390, File 610-1, part 1)\nteaching day until the next summer holidays.\n\nThe Department has been under a large expense in connection with this school and it is hoped that in view of the salary which Miss Sturges receives that she will devote her full energies and time to the work at this place. You should inform her of the Department's expectations in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, December 6, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in further reference to the request for the balance of salary for Miss Lydia Hays, late teacher of the Aiyansh Indian Day School, and enclosing copies of the correspondence that has taken place between the Department and yourself regarding this matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the Department's letter to you of December 1, 1916, in which it was stated that salary would be allowed for twelve months instead of for the ten teaching months only, the Department will allow Miss Hays one month's salary for the month of July, last.\n\nA cheque for $75.00 will be sent her in your care, which upon receipt you will be good enough to see that she receives. This is the full amount which the Department can pay Miss Hays.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. R. H.

In reply, I beg to inform you that Mr. Benson is not now in the service of the Department, having been superannuated two years ago.\n\nWe have no record of any authority having been granted you to conduct an Indian school at this point. You were informed on a previous occasion when you forwarded returns for a school which you conducted at Aiyansh during the years of 1913, '14 and '15 that the Department would not pay salary for any unauthorized work done by you. If you consider that you have any claim to be remunerated for your services, you should take the matter up with Mr. W. E. Collison, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.

The Chiefs were gathered in Mr. Smith's house and I listened to them for two hours. They referred to the letters and petition they had sent in some months ago praying for a school for their children. They explained that in past years they had opposed schools and wished to be left to their old way of living. But that two years ago Mr. Superintendent Vowell and Mr. Indian Agent Morrow visited them and advised them to give up the Potlatch, Indian Dances, Whiskey making and all the old Heathen customs; that they accepted the advice, gave up those practices and settled down to civilized life.\n\nThey also stated that the Superintendent and the Agent assured them that if they would do so, the Department would help them, and furnish the Government row to give them a school for their children, and they desire a white teacher to be engaged by, and under the control of the Department. I found that there were only two children of school age in the village. I never saw them anxious for a school. They said they would give the Department use for a School House for the present if a teacher was engaged, and that whenever the Department should consent for a school, they would give all the work and make a good job of it, if the Department would furnish the material.\n\nThere are young progressive men and I am sure they mean well.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 2)\nThey are so well disposed toward the school that they have made a start with the building. The Indians have approved the village of old men and women being open all of the year. There are no white people on the Reserve at present. A suitable white male teacher for the village would cost fifty dollars ($50.00) per month.\n\nAs these Indians acted so quickly on the advice given them by the Department, and have abandoned all those objectionable practices, and for a year and a half have conducted themselves well, I respectfully but strongly recommend that a Day School teacher, a male white, be given them.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith two letters, each dated the 3rd instant, received from the Rev. A. H. Green, Inspector of Indian schools in British Columbia, in the matter of a request made of him by the Chiefs and people of the Kitlackadamax village for the erection and equipment of a day school building at the payment of the salary of a teacher therefor at the rate of $50.00 per month, or $600.00 per annum. The Department will perceive on a perusal of the enclosures that the people decided as a result of a visit made to their reserve by the local Indian Agent and myself to abandon for all time their old heathenish customs, including the celebration of the potlatch, dancing and indulgence in intoxicants. The people are evidently in earnest to better their condition as well as that of their children. They having determined to settle down to a civilized mode of life are anxious to make a good beginning by having the benefit of the services of a teacher constantly in their midst to instruct their offspring as well as to stimulate them from day to day in their new mode of life and to afford them\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 2)\nthe benefit of his advice in the many matters confronting them from time to time.\n\nAs to the erection of the school the matter can be left in abeyance for some little time, provided the Department have not the funds on hand at present to commence the work of building. It is essential, though, that action be taken at the very earliest date possible to provide a good teacher for the school as the people are now enthusiastically looking forward to the Department's meeting; their wishes in this respect. To delay matters would perhaps only tend to discourage the Indians and result probably in their gradually drifting back into their old heathenish customs and practices. I trust, therefore, that provision for the payment of the salary of a teacher at the rate named be made as soon as the Department can secure the funds.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

File 3430/6. Letter to Bishop Lee Vernet.\n\nG.H.M.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th of October last with reference to the proposed establishment of an Indian day school at Kitadamax, I have the honor to enclose herewith for the Department's information therein a communication of the 24th ultimo received from Mr. Agent Merrew, of the North West Coast Agency, from which it will be seen that up to the time of writing the Agent states that he was unable to visit the locality and in consequence is not in a position to report fully in the premises. As he suggests, I think it advisable to wait until the return of His Lordship Bishop DuVernet to Metlakatla when Mr. Merrew will fully discuss the matter with him before writing further thereon.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. G.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 2)\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No 215-A dated October 5th/06 enclosing report of Mr School Inspector Green as well as his personal note, with reference to the establishing of a Department Indian day school at Kitlaadamax on the Nass River.\n\nI have delayed answering in the hope that I might have been able to visit that distant village, but up to the present time this has been impossible.\n\nMr Green sets forth however the absolute necessity of a day school, and as he has visited the Reservation, seen the people, and held a meeting with them, he certainly is beyond question of doubt, the best judge as to what should be done.\n\nThese Indians are supposed to have joined the Church of England during the last year, and I have been given to understand that they are mostly all members of that body. I may say in this connection, as it appears to be the policy of the Department to work in harmony with the various churches engaged in missionary work in this Agency, that if these Indians are found to be members, or adherents of that Church, that it might be well to ask His Lordship Bishop Du Vernet to have a white teacher placed there, if he fails to do this or the people reject such a proposal, then it would be in order for the Department to supply the teacher.\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent\n\nVictoria B.C.\n\nAgain\nAgain the question arises, if a teacher is sent there by the Department, independent of any Church or Society as an employee of the Indian Department, at twice the salary allowed the Churches for day school teachers, what effect be, more particularly as we now request the Churches to provide white teachers. These are points that I think should be taken into consideration, at the same time Kitlaadamax people ask for a school, and teacher, claiming them on the grounds set forth in Mr Green's letter, and I assure you that I am fully alive to the necessity of endeavouring to meet their request, but think it advisable for all concerned to try and arrange for same without any friction, however, it is for the Department and yourself to decide.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Du Vernet has been away for some time, and I have been unable to take this school question on the Nass river up with him, but will do so immediately on his return, and ascertain if these people are claimed by him as members or adherents of his Church, and if they are, what steps will he immediately take to provide them with a white teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nMar 1, 1910.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Dept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter No. 343016, dated Feb 5th, in which you say that the Department will be glad to hear from me in regard to several matters relating to Indian Schools.\n\nWill you allow me to say first of all that the Government's long delay in giving a decided answer to the Indians in regard to the land Question is having a most disastrous effect upon our educational and religious work among the Indians. Our Church of England missionaries in this Diocese of Caledonia (Northern B.C.) have steadily counselled the Indians to be law abiding. In consequence of this the Indians say that we are servants of the Government trying to get their land from them. Our Indians have been stirred up by agitators. They have been asked to raise a large sum of money to carry their case to the Privy Council. Money is being freely given for this purpose. Our Missionaries hold aloof from this telling the Indians that if they will only wait patiently the Dominion Government will see that they are treated fairly. Not very long ago Indian Delegates from all parts assembled at Vancouver to arrange to carry their claims to England. I think the Department should inquire who presided at this meeting. I am informed that it was an official of the Indian Department. Since then the attitude of our Indians towards our Missionaries is more marked. Our missionaries are loyal to those in authority while at the same time telling the Indians what will be best for them in the end.\nTo give a specific example of what I mean:\n\nOur Massett Indians were not in the least agitated about the land question, they were quite contented in mind until they received a letter from Rev. Mr. Tait a Methodist Missionary more than 500 miles away. He and the Rev. A.R. Green seem to be the chief movers in this matter. Rev. A.R. O'Meara, Church of England, does not belong to this Diocese, and has no authority from me. No doubt some of our missionaries think that the question of the Indian Title should be authoritatively settled but as a Body we hold that the Indians being wards of the Dominion Government, this Government should have the question settled without this most unwise stirring up of the Indian mind. This is by way of introduction to what I have to report.\n\n1. With great difficulty and at much expense I secured a male teacher for Gitladamika, the uppermost Indian village on the Nass river. Mr. R.J. George has an expert knowledge of gardening and farming & has an earnest desire to show the Indians of this village how to cultivate their rich lands. Accompanied by Archdeacon Collison, who knows the language well, I took him up the river last summer and introduced him assuring the people that he was not after their land, but only wished to teach them and do them good. They received him most kindly until the delegate from this land conference returned from Vancouver. Now Mr. George writes me as follows:\u2014\"At a Council meeting at Gitladamika to consider the matter of setting apart a piece of land for the Mission house they were so undecided that they came to no decision. I inquired the cause and was told they considered me the thin end of the wedge. They summed up the situation thus. The Bishop, the Archdeacon, Mr. McCullagh and myself are the servants of the Government and are seeking to deprive them of their land. Seeing that I am regarded as a traitor by them...\"\nI have concluded after prayerful consideration that the only thing for me to do is to leave the river.\n\nMr. A. R. Smeath, our School teacher at Lakkalzap on the same river, writes by the same mail in much the same strain. I shall endeavour to persuade these men to hold on, but you will see how this land agitation is upsetting all our work. The feeling up the Skeena has been intense but is a little easier now. Our Missionaries urged the Indians to wait patiently till the Commissioner came from Ottawa. He came but only to repeat the same message which had so often been given before\u2014\"I will report to Ottawa all you have to say\". The Indians have great respect for authority. All that is needed is a decided answer.\n\n2. In regard to Massett a new industry has developed at North Island a fishing Company is erecting a station there with a steamer carrying fish to Prince Rupert. In consequence of this large numbers of the Massett people have gone from the Village. What Rev. Mr. Hogan recommends is that Miss Edenshaw should continue teaching the little ones at Massett and that Mr. Sherwood should follow the bigger children to North Island and teach school there. If the Department will make a grant of rough lumber 3,000 ft at $17.50 per thousand, with shingles &c the natives will put up 30 x 20 with a \"Lean-to\" at back for teacher to live in.\n\nI wrote about this to the Indian Agent, Queen Charlotte Islands, but as Mr. Perry was leaving about that time the letter may be waiting for the new agent, whoever he may be to arrive. I hope the department will make this small grant. It will be seen from this that owing to this new move on the part of so many of the people the question of tents must be deferred for another year. This will show the Department what we have to contend with in trying to carry out any plan.\n\n3. I asked Mr. Fuller the Carpenter to whom I referred to in my previous letter if he would undertake the work of teaching the Indian young men & older boys carpentry but he sees too good an\nopportunity for work in Prince Rupert to accept such a position. I think that this is a matter which the Indian Agent should take in hand.\n\nLet me say in closing that I fully appreciate the difficulty in connection with the Indian Title and the dispute between the two Governments but there is no denying the fact that our whole Indian work is suffering because of the lack of a decisive answer from those who represent \"The King.\"\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(sgd) F. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nDear Sir,\n\nAs there was no communication with Aiyansh when I received your letter No. 299590/1, it was impossible for me to reply.\n\nTo Mr. Perry, the Indian Agent, visited Aiyansh & Gitladauniks and conferred with our missionary Rev. J.B. McCullough shortly before your letter was written regarding the proposal of a union school. I thought it best not to express an opinion without being able to hear what Mr. McCullough had to say.\n\nI gather from Mr. Perry that the scheme does not seem to be practicable at present. The Indians cannot be driven into accepting any plan however wise it may be. Local rivalry between two adjacent villages is not easily overcome. We find it most trying in our Church work because Aiyansh has a resident clergyman. Gitladauniks make one place because Aiyansh has a school teacher. Gitladauniks must have one also whereas the total population of the two villages is too small to justify such expenditure. For us the Church is concerned. However, Mr. McCullough writes that the 3 villages, Aiyansh, Gitladauniks, and Gitladauniks, are getting round and better than ever.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Many of the Indians were away, but I saw those that were here, including the head Chief. I enquired of them the reason of their objection to the erection of the school house in their village by the builder who was under instructions from the Department and who had a lot of material on hand; after, they, the Indians, had for years asked for such a building. They said that they wished to have a school, and to have their children taught, but that the Rev. Mr. McCullough of Aiyansh had told them it would not be wise to have a day school, but to wait a little and then they would have a large boarding school, or an industrial school, halfway between the villages of Kitlakdamox and Aiyansh, where the children would be fed and clothed by the Government.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that no further steps be taken re school in this village until the Indians are in a more settled condition.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, June 15, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Green in his report recently received on the Kitladamax and Aiyansh villages states that he has ascertained that one of the objections of the Indians of each of these villages to the continuance of day schools was the fact that a promise had been held out to them by Rev. Mr. McCullough that a boarding school to accommodate both villages would be erected and maintained by the Department.\n\nI may say that Rev. Mr. McCullough had no authority for making any such statement and you should take the first opportunity to inform the Indians that the Department has no present intention of taking such a step. There would not appear to be any reason why day schools with efficient teachers would not provide adequate educational facilities for the children of these Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.

(RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 2)\nI beg to inform you that since the Royal Commission has visited the Nass River and held meetings with the Indians of the several villages, it is deemed advisable to recommend the appointment of a Government teacher and Field Matron for service at Aiyansh and the upper Nass.\n\nI have, therefore, pleasure to make this recommendation. I would advise that a teacher be secured at a salary of $75.00 per month; and a Matron at the same salary. If two suitable persons can be found who will live together and work in the same manner as do Miss Capper and Miss Sturges at Lek-kalzap, the Field Matron's salary could be $50.00 instead of $75.00.\n\nThe Field Matron's duties should include periodical visits to Gitlakdamike Reserve, and Gitwanshiltqu, and also to the several fishing camps on the upper river, when convenient.\n\nThe school building already provided for can be erected in the spring. The teacher could find convenient quarters both for school and residence in the meantime.\n\nFuel and light should be provided for these officers, and their transportation up the Nass should be paid by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime a teacher could find suitable quarters for the winter.\n\nIn a letter of even date, I recommended that a Field Matron be appointed, with headquarters at Aiyansh. If appointed, this Matron could take charge of the interests of the Gitlakdamiks, and co-operate with a teacher stationed here.\n\nFuel and light should be provided for this teacher.

Oct. 20th 1915\n\nHASS AGENCY.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Indians of Aiyansh, Citladaanike and Gwinaha have requested that teachers be appointed and schools established at their respective villages, but as there are no white people resident at these places, it might be somewhat difficult to procure a teacher who would be willing to undertake this work single-handed. The arrangement followed out at Lachalzap where Miss Sturgiss has been appointed as teacher and Miss Capper as Field Matron seems to be giving satisfaction, and I would respectfully suggest that this idea be carried out at the above villages. On interviewing Miss Sturgiss and Miss Capper as to the treatment received by them from the Indians, they both spoke most highly of the Indians and stated that they had received every courtesy from them. The Indians in turn expressed their appreciation of the services rendered by these two ladies. Should the Department consider it advisable to carry out some such arrangement at Aiyansh, Citladaanike and Gwinaha, I would suggest that Mr. Inspector Cairns, Mr. Perry and myself be authorized to go into the question more fully. The estimated cost of such appointments would be from $5000. to $6000. per annum. This to include three teachers and three field matrons, together with rent of buildings, fuel etc.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nDUNGAN C.

CAIRNS ON THE METLAKATLA SCHL.\n\nI met Mr. Perry and discussed with him the educational problems of his agency.\n\nThere is a village on the Nass River called Aiyansh which has a large number of children of school age but for several years there has been no school.\n\nThe Royal Commission visited the Nass Agency in October going up the Nass river in gasoline launches.\n\nIt is Mr. Perry's opinion that something could, perhaps, be done for these people after his visit. It appears that for some time these people have refused to have a school erected in their village. However, I met some of these people at Prince Rupert and had conversation with them. From the tone of their conversation I think these people are prepared to be sane and reasonable.\n\nWe also discussed the subject of trained teachers. The greatest factors in any educational system is the teachers. I would, therefore, recommend that vigorous effort be made to have trained teachers appointed to fill any vacancies that may occur.\nI have the honor to acknowledge of your telegram of October 28th which reached me on my return from the villages of the Nass River, whither I had been on a lecture trip with the lantern, dealing with the subject of tuberculosis etc. I got back on the night of the 2nd.\n\nI proceeded to Prince Rupert yesterday\u2014the 3rd\u2014to consult with His Lordship Bishop Du Vernet relative to the appointment of teachers and a Field Matron. I found that the Bishop was in the Peace River country, a great distance from communication, and that is was not known when he would return.\n\nHaving in mind that the Nass River might freeze over at any time, and that it is necessary to act quickly, I wired to Inspector Tyson, Vancouver, asking him to kindly interview Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Schools and arrange suitable appointments, subject, of course, to your approval. I knew of no suitable persons in the north.\n\nI am not sure if you are aware of the resolution of the Anglican Synod here made some time ago, the burden of which was a decision to discontinue the nomination of teachers for the schools of the Anglican Mission villages, and leaving such nominations absolutely\n\nTuncan C.

I am therefore much surprised to receive your letter stating that the Department is prepared to pay only three hundred dollars a year for a field matron. I am sure the Department will not get a competent field matron for such a meagre consideration. A woman would deserve that amount as a bonus for being willing to isolate herself in a place like Aiyansh.\n\nMeanwhile the Inspectors are busy trying to engage suitable officers for the Nass River. In fact, they may have already engaged a field matron at $50.00 or $75.00 a month. I took the precaution, however, to request Mr. Tyson to wire final arrangements to Ottawa before sending the teacher forward.

Original on 299590-7\n\nThe progress of these pupils has been slow in consequence of their having been no teacher here for some time. Miss Bowen is working at a disadvantage, particularly as it becomes necessary for her to walk the distance from Aiyansh to Gitlademicks. The teacher should rightly reside in Gitlademicks. The Indians themselves object to the present arrangement, but Miss Bowen insists that she must live with the teacher and field matron at Aiyansh.\n\nIf, in the near future, a change can be made by putting in a person of wider experience, the interest of this school will be better served.\n\nSgd.

The\ntwo first named teachers have been given a month's\nnotice to vacate their school.\n\nConsent has also been given to discontinue\nthe Field Matroncy at Gwinoha and to the appointment\nof a male teacher who will be able to minister to the\nneeds of the small Gwinoha population, so that it will\nbe no longer necessary to have a second person appointed\nsimply for company for the teacher.\n\nI would inform you that in accordance with\ninstructions of the Deputy Superintendent General, I\nhave taken steps to have suitable appointments made\njointly by the School Inspector and Inspector of Agenc-\nies, at Vancouver, who will have any assistance I can\ngive.\n\nI trust that the steps proposed to be made\nwill have the effect of producing more efficient and\neffective work, and that the schools of these villages\nwill be in operation under good teachers when the Fall\nsession commences.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCharles C.

General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached, you will find a copy of a letter written to Mr. Perry in answer to his of July 13th:\n\nWhile on my vacation in Vancouver, Mr. Perry saw fit to discontinue my services without assigning any other reason than that he had decided to appoint a resident teacher at Gitladamiks, and it was only quite natural that there should be two or three unpaid accounts left behind. For when I left, it was with the understanding that I was to go back. For this reason I cannot understand why he should write stating that it was an offence for any one in the employ of the Indian Department to buy anything from the Indians, when both he and Mr. Tyson both assured me it would be quite permissible to buy what little souvenirs I might wish for my own use.\n\nI wrote to Mr. Perry regarding my return fare, which I understood the Department would pay, but he has not had the courtesy to answer, and I would like to have you advise what will be done in this matter.\n\nMy pay cheques for the second quarter is now overdue, and as the pay cheques for all the teachers on the river have been held up last winter for at least three weeks each time, I would like to see some action taken to correct this, and not make it necessary for the various teachers to write to Mr. Perry to forward the cheques.\n\nYou will see in the copy of letter attached, that several other little matters are touched upon, and I will be pleased to have you advise regarding them, for I think that I am at least entitled to fair treatment, and it is my intention, if I do not get it, to go the right quarter, and demand an investigation into the various little irregularities of the Naas River Agency.\n\nHoping to be favored with a reply, I beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Perry,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of July 13th, your file G.S.:\n\nI am indeed surprised to receive such a letter from you, after being told both by you and Mr. Tyson, that it would be quite all right for me to buy such little things as souvenirs from the Indians.\n\nIt is my understanding of this act, that it is meant to stop employees of the Indian Department from dealing with the Indians for their own personal gain, and while on this subject, I would say that it is a matter of common knowledge that Constable Phillipson does a regular trading business in furs with the Indians, and this is a matter easily proved.\n\nRegarding the accounts you mention as being due, I would state that I have itemized them below, and it is only due to the various Indians' own special request that they were not paid before, as they specifically asked that the amounts be paid after they had returned from the cannery.\n\nThe amounts are as follows:\n\nRent. $8.75.\nFelix Wright. 7.00\nAlice Woods 6.25.\n\nThese amounts will be paid in September by me, as originally requested.\n\nMr. Tyson was quite surprised at the way that the pay checks were held up all winter, and I have not yet received my June check, which I trust will come by return mail.\n\nOn account of the irregular manner in which things are being handled in your department, I consider it necessary to write to the Ottawa authorities, and also to the member for this district in the House of Commons.\n\nI might add that you have not given the customary month's notice in advance discontinuing my services at the summer school at Port Nelson, and I hold your telegram and letter employing me for the summer months of July and August.\n\nNow, Mr. Perry, the whole transaction looks like a frame-up, and I hope, for your own sake that you will be able to finish it, for I am certainly going to be fairly treated.\n\nFrosting that you will see this matter in the proper light.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nOlive C. Bowen\n\nCC: Mr Scott\nOttawa, October 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Inspector Cairns in which he states that Mr. Frank Vangorder has been sent to take charge of the Gwinotha school, that Mr. and Mrs. R.

He has taught for years. He has just completed a two years term at Kitsalas where he did good, faithful work. He showed a marked interest in his pupils and was very kind and patient with the Indian children. He also cultivated a small garden and in this added a new interest in the lives of the pupils. Mr. Vangorder has had Normal School training. He is fifty years of age. I expect that he will do excellent work.\nMr. and Mrs. R. R. Johnson have gone to Aiyansh. Both are teachers. Mr. Johnson was trained as a teacher in Ireland where he taught two years before coming to Canada. He has been in Canada six years and for five years was in charge of the Mail Order Department in Woodward's store, Vancouver. He supplied for a few months in British Columbia Schools. He is thirty years of age. Mrs. Johnson was also trained and taught six years with success. She is a musician both vocal and instrumental. They will give faithful service. Miss Lydia Hayes who is twenty-four years of age has gone to Gitlakdamiks. She has had a full course of training in the Normal at Vancouver. She has taught two and one half years in a rural school. Miss Hayes is a quiet and patient young woman. She gave me the impression that she would do good, conscientious work.\n\nHerewith, I enclose vouchers covering expenses of the teachers from Vancouver to Kincolith.

The enrollment was sixteen and the salary $90.00 per month for twelve months in the year. Our Provincial educational Dept. find it impossible to get teachers for the isolated schools unless the salary is increased. The salaries for these small outlying schools under the Public School system runs from $80.00 to $100.00 per month, twelve months in the year.\n\nThese teachers that have been sent North to the Nass River are all trained teachers, and would not have gone had we stated the salary was for ten months in the year.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nOttawa, November 27, 196.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of reports of inspection made by Mr. Agent Perry on the Indian day schools at Aiyansh and Gitladamiks.\n\nHe informs the Department that Miss Hayes, who was appointed to the school at Gitladamiks, has been sent to Aiyansh, where she will have company, which she would be deprived of were she stationed at Gitladamiks, and that, on account of there being no white residents at Gitladamiks, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson have been sent there. He states that these teachers understood from you that they were to receive a salary of $75.00 per month for the whole year, and not for the ten teaching months only. The former teachers at these schools were only paid for the ten teaching months in each year and I may say that the Department, when engaging teachers at a monthly salary, only agrees to pay for the ten teaching months. You will be good enough to inform the Department of the exact terms on which you engaged the services of the above named teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. McLean,\nAsst.

This allowance will be paid quarterly upon receipt of vouchers forwarded by you in the usual way. You should inform Mr. Johnson accordingly and forward a voucher as soon as possible for the amount due up to the 31st ultimo, so that it can be paid out of last year's appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from report of Agent Perry on the Gitlakdamiks Indian Day School for the month of February, 1917. Original on 299590/7.\n\nMr. Johnson, the teacher, has pointed out that the price of sugar is $13.00 per 100 lbs., flour $14.00 per barrel; butter 55\u00a2 per pound and milk $7.50 per case; and has requested that the Department meet the cost of rental of his residence at $10.00 per month. The Department, by letter No. 299290/1 dated Feb. 27th, 1917, has not given encouragement in this direction. Mr. Johnson has written lately to the effect that he will be obliged to leave the Nass River at the end of the year in consequence of financial pressure.\n\nIn a conversation two days ago with Mr. Tyson, Inspector of Agencies, Mr. Tyson expressed the opinion that the Department should be asked to reconsider its decision and commence immediately to pay rental\u2014in fact to pay rental since Mr. Johnson took charge, for which the Indian owners are waiting. I feel the same conviction in the matter.\nOttawa, February 27, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant stating that Mr. Redmond R. Johnson, teacher of the Gitlakdamiks Indian Day School, has informed you that he finds the expense of living in the Nass Valley so great that he finds great difficulty in meeting his rent account of $10.00 a month for his residence and has asked you to ascertain if the Department would be willing to pay the rent for him.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as Mr. Johnson is receiving a salary of $900.00 per annum and fuel and light, the Department is not prepared to make any further allowance at present. He has only been in charge of the school for a short time and the Department will await further reports in regard to the success he is meeting with before considering the question of making any allowance for rent for his residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nO. O. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Redmond R. Johnson, Indian day school teacher at Gitlakdamike, Nass River, has informed me that he finds the expense of living in the Nass Valley so great that he finds great difficulty in meeting his rent account of ten dollars per month for his residence. He has asked me to ascertain if the Department would be willing to pay the rent for him.\n\nI am of the opinion that the Department will find it necessary to undertake the payment of rent or furnish a residence for teachers in these remote places, if teachers are to be retained for any length of time.\n\nIn the case of a married man like Mr. Johnson, who is doing well and is a gentleman in every respect, and whose wife (also a fully qualified teacher) is sacrificing a possible salary in order to keep home for her husband at Gitlakdamike (the remotest village on the Nass River), I would recommend that the Department assume payment of the rental for the teacher's residence at Gitlakdamike.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI have not much to say about this place except to remark that after the flood of Nov. 1917, the so-called school and teacher's \"lodging-house\" is no longer fit for habitation and are to be demolished in July this year.\n\nThe whole village is moving to Kitladamicks, so that a new school is expected by the Indians. What will happen is unknown to me. The only way to make progress up here is to have a nice new school building where a teacher can enforce all the usual school laws etc. The children and people are far behind those of the other reserves on this River owing to their want of education. I have never seen such an antiquated way of teaching even in Turkey. It is money thrown away with no results.\n\nDate of Report.-March 30th, 1918.\nOctober 30th, 1917\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the returns of the Citlakdamike Indian Day School, Nass River, for the September quarter last.\n\nI would inform you that Mr. Johnson has reported that the Indians have only within the past few days returned from their fishing camps.\n\nI would further report that I have just returned from the village of Citlakdamike and that Mr. Johnson has resigned in order to accept the headmastership of the Lytton Boarding School where he and his wife will both teach.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 22, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss S.

McCullagh recommend the appointment of Capt. Jackson as teacher of the Gitladamicks Indian Day School, to begin duties the 1st instant and to teach until the end of March next.\n\nIn reply I have to confirm the following telegram which was sent you on the 29th ultimo, \"May engage Capt. Jackson as teacher Gitladamicks at terms mentioned your telegram.\"\n\nIn view of the above recommendation the Department will approve of this school being re-opened during the winter months and will allow a salary at the rate of $75.00 per month and will also pay for the fuel and light required and rental of the school building and teacher's residence at $10.00 and $5.00, respectively. You should give Capt. Jackson every assistance you can in carrying on the work at this school. It is hoped that there will be a good and regular attendance and that the teacher will meet with every success in the work.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, for the salary due each month and also for the expenditure incurred in supplying the fuel and light required and for the rent of the school building and teacher's residence. The teacher should forward a return showing the attendance, etc., on the paper form for that purpose at the end of December and again at the end of March next.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. E.

D.I.A.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nThe school at Gitlakdamiks has been closed since November, 1917.\n\nWhen this school was in operation the teacher received a salary of $75.00 per month and $100.00 a year for rent of teacher's residence. He was also allowed fuel and light.\n\nAt the time this school was in operation there was an enrolment of 18 children, with an average attendance of 10. In a report to the Department dated March 31st, 1918, from Miss Sturges, who was teaching at Aiyenash, stated that, after the flood of November, 1917, the whole village of Aiyenash was moving to Gitlakdamiks and that a new school was expected by the Indians at that point.\n\nI am unable to ascertain the number of children of school age there are at present at Gitlakdamiks, but no doubt there are sufficient to warrant the re-opening of the school.\n\nThe terms under which Agent Collison wishes to engage Capt. Jackson are the same as were allowed the former teacher of this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, November 29, 1919.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st inst., confirming your telegram of the 29th of Nov. last, relative to the appointment of Mr. D.B.M. Jackson as teacher of the Gitlakdamiks Indian day school.\n\nI have written to Mr. Jackson advising him regarding his new duties, and hope before long to be able to forward a favourable report of the work of the school. The usual school return forms have been forwarded to him, and I have asked him to furnish me with a weekly report of progress and attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit the enclosed Returns of the Gitlakdamiks Indian Day School for Quarters ended December 31st., 1919 and March 31st., 1920.\n\nOwing to the continued cold weather which has interferred very much with mail communication from the upper Nass, it has not been possible to get the School Returns in earlier.\n\nMr. D.B.M. Jackson, the school teacher, has been obliged to resign his position as teacher of the Indian Day School, as he finds that indoor work does not agree with his health. His resignation dates from the 31st of March. As there are no children at Gitlakdamiks just now, the people being away hunting and fishing, I am not doing anything to fill the position until I can visit Gitlakdamiks and see for myself the requirements of the place. The school situation at Gitlakdamiks has not been satisfactory, and will continue so, until a proper school building can be erected and better arrangements made for housing the school teacher.

A large box stove in the school room gives all the heat necessary.\n\nWhilst Mr. Priestley has no professional qualifications as a teacher, he has had some experience in teaching, having had charge of the Aiyaneh Indian Day school during the years 1909-1910.

This room is better adapted for school use as it is much warmer and at the same time well ventilated. For the present no rent will be charged. Arrangements were made, however, that all necessary repairs resulting from wear and tear would be paid for and new stove pipe supplied. Fuel and light will be provided as before. An out-house for the boys and one for the girls were necessary and arrangements for the erection of these buildings were completed before I left Gitlakdumik. The whole cost will not exceed $15.00 and I trust the Department will sanction this expenditure.\n\nMrs. Thorne is a thoroughly capable teacher of wide experience having taught in Manitoba before coming to the coast. Her qualifications are as follows:\n\n- Public School Certificate, Second Class, Manitoba, 1910.\n- Diploma for Agriculture, Manitoba Agricultural College, 1909.\n- Certificate for Basketry and Sewing, Manitoba School of Handicrafts, 1914.\n- Dominion Certificate of Physical Training for Public School Teachers, 1914.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 24th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, informing the Department that Mrs. Gertrude Thorne, who was appointed teacher of Gitlakdimiks Indian Day School for the period from October 1st to March 31st, next, has assumed her duties and opened the school on the 3rd instant. The qualifications which Mrs. Thorne possesses have been noted.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged for the use of a room in the Mission House for classroom purposes and that no rent will be charged.\n\nYour action in having out houses for the boys and girls erected is approved, and you may forward properly receipted vouchers covering the expenditure, which you state will not exceed $15.00.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of any new stove pipe required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOn the third of September I left Prince Rupert on an extended trip to the Upper Nass River, visiting all the Indian villages. At Gitlakdamsi I presided at the election of the new Indian Council and swore in the new councillors. I remained in the village a few days and personally superintended the transfer of school books and other school material from the Indian house which was formerly used for school purposes, to more suitable quarters in the Mission house where school will be held during the winter under the charge of Mr. Gertrude Thorne, the newly appointed teacher. The new arrangement is much better and I look forward to much progress being made by the children in their studies under the direction of Mrs. Thorne who possesses splendid qualifications and has taken a real interest in the school work.\"\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Gitladamicks Indian Day School for the month of March, 1922.\n\nAccording to past arrangements this school will now be closed until next October.\n\nMrs. Thorne has given notice that she will be unable to take on the school work when it again re-opens on account of the pressure of household duties.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith copy of my Daily Journal for the month of April.\n\nMrs. Thorne, teacher of the Indian Day School at Gitlakdamix has informed me that she will be unable to take on the school work next fall. It will therefore be necessary to appoint another teacher from the outside to take charge of the school for the entire teaching year at full salary. There has always been a difficulty in obtaining teachers for isolated places like Gitlakdamix, and unless an arrangement like this can be made, I am afraid it will not be possible to secure the services of an experienced teacher to take up the work for six months only. In the past the Department had teachers at Gitlakdamix and also at Alynnah on full salary. Now these two villages have amalgamated, the Alynnah Indians having moved to Gitlakdamix and there should be no difficulty in securing a school attendance throughout the teaching months of the year.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, June 6th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to that portion of your Daily Journal for the month of April, last, regarding the services of a teacher for the Gitlakdamiks Indian Day School. It is noted that Mrs. Thorne will be unable to resume duties as teacher when the school re-opens next Fall. Your suggestion that this school be conducted throughout the ten teaching months of the year, as there will be no difficulty in securing a school attendance for that period, is also noted.\n\nThe Department would consent to have this school in operation during the full number of teaching months in the year if the attendance would warrant the same, and would be prepared to pay salary for the full year. If you consider that these Indians will reside permanently at Gitlakdamiks, and that there would be a sufficient and regular attendance of Indian children throughout the year, you may take the necessary steps to engage the services of a teacher to continue duties for the full ten teaching months in the year. The salary allowed a teacher having the necessary qualifications would be at the rate of $750 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nThe name, qualifications and experience of any applicant received by you for this position should be submitted for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYou should give this matter your attention, and, if possible, endeavour to secure the services of a teacher to begin duties on or about the 1st of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour #299590-1, dated June 6, in reply to mine of April 15 last, recommending that a teacher be secured to take charge of the Gitlakdamiks Indian Day school for the full teaching months of the year. I am afraid the salary viz., $750.00 per annum with legal bonus, which is offered by the Department would not be sufficient inducement for a teacher with proper qualifications to take the position, especially when it is known that the school teacher at Lakgalzap, an Indian village on the Nass River more conveniently situated - is receiving a salary of $900.00 per annum with bonus and allowances for fuel and light. It has always been most difficult to obtain teachers for the Indian Day schools of the Upper Nass River chiefly on account of the trying isolation, and the difficulty and expense of reaching these out of the way Indian villages.\n\nGitlakdamiks is about 60 miles from the nearest point of steamer call, which is Mill Bay, wharfery at the mouth of the Nass River. The Mill Bay conveyance to Gitlakdamiks is consequently has to be made by Indian canoe or boat. Under these circumstances, I would suggest that the same salary and allowances be granted for a teacher at Gitlakdamiks as is allowed for the teacher at Lakgalzap. It has been my constant endeavour to follow the strictest economy in all matters where any expenditure is involved, but judging from past experience in connection with securing teachers for the Upper Nass River, I feel sure it would be most difficult to secure the services of a qualified teacher for Gitlakdamiks unless sufficient inducement can be offered.\n\nTrusting the Department may give this matter further consideration,\n\nI remain,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 21, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to securing the services of a teacher to take charge of the Gitladamicks Indian Day School for the full teaching months of the year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if a teacher with proper qualifications is obtained for this school, we will be prepared to pay the same salary as is allowed at Lakelsap, viz.: $900 per annum plus any bonus provided by law. We will also provide the fuel and light required, and accounts for this purpose will be paid upon receipt of properly certified vouchers.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to obtain the services of a teacher in time to begin duties on or about September first, next.

I enclose the Constable's report of his marriage which took place at Prince Rupert on the 13th of September last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 11, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, requesting that, for the reasons stated by you, Mrs. E. G. Newnham (nee Miss Winstone) the teacher of the Gitladamix Indian Day School, be retained in her position until next spring.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report as to the closing of navigation for the next six months and the impossibility of obtaining the services of another teacher, Mrs. Newnham may remain for the balance of the present school year, or until the end of June, next. You should inform her that her services will not be required after that date and endeavour in due time to nominate a teacher having the necessary qualifications to take over this work when the school reopens after the summer holidays next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter #168-3247, dated Nov. 6th, informing me that owing to the marriage of Miss Winstone, she can no longer be retained in the service of the Department, as teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School.\n\nI regret this very much, as Miss Winstone (now Mrs. Newnham) is a very capable teacher, and it will be a difficult matter to replace her.\n\nI would point out, however, that it would be impossible to make any change now, as the Nass River is closed to all navigation for the next six months. Even if Mrs. Newnham were to resign her position immediately, she could not get away nor could a new teacher reach Gitlakdamix until next spring. Under these circumstances, and in view of the difficult situation, I should be glad if the Department could possibly make some special arrangement whereby Mrs. Newnham's services might be retained until the end of next May, when the River will again be open.\n\nAs school at Gitlakdamix generally closes on the 15th of June, it would not be worth-while getting a new teacher until school re-opens in September.\n\nHoping the Department will be able to make a special exemption in this case,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Winstone, teacher of the Indian day school at Gitlakdamix, to Constable E. G. Newnham.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Order in Council of March 12th, 1921, provides as follows: \u2014 \"Any female employee in the Public Service shall, upon the occasion of her marriage, be required to resign her position.\" In view of the above, I regret that the Department cannot retain the services of Mrs. Newnham as teacher at this school. She may remain in charge for the present, but you should make an immediate endeavour to secure a properly qualified teacher for this school. The names, qualifications and experience of any applicants received by you for this position should be submitted for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Pressure of other work prevented me from making separate reports for each month, and I trust this will be equally satisfactory.\n\nAn application has been received from Miss Winstone of McConnell, Manitoba, for the position of school teacher at Gitlakdamix, now vacant through the resignation of Mrs. Newnham.\n\nW. H. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the GITLADAMICKS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on October 7th, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 168-32A-6.\n\nI do not believe that any great success can be attained by this school till we have a trained teacher working in a properly designed schoolroom quite separate from the Anglican Mission. This present plan of having an untrained missionary attempt to teach the school, as well as do his other missionary work is very unsatisfactory.\n\nI attended a village council meeting, after my inspection of the school. It was made quite clear to me that the people wish for the proper education for their children, and that they are very anxious to have a separate school building, better situated in the village.\n\nI inspected several sites, and believe that one on open ground, to the back of and between the houses of Mrs. Brown and Mr. Wilkans, would prove very satisfactory for the small school which this village so badly requires.\nOttawa, July 25th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter return of the Gitladamiks Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that this return is signed by Rev. Samuel Kinley and states that he took charge of the school on May 13th. In preparing the return, he states that the school was open for thirty-three (33) days during the quarter and it would, therefore, appear that the return that has been forwarded only covers the period during which Rev. Mr. Kinley has been in charge of the school. As you will note from official letter of April 10th, last, the Department understood that Rev. Mr. Flores would continue in charge at Gitladamiks until June 1st, on which date he would be succeeded by Rev. Mr. Kinley.\n\nPlease let me know for what length of time Rev. Mr. Flores conducted the Gitladamiks School during the June quarter in order that the amount due both Mr. Flores and Mr. Kinley may be paid. If Mr. Flores was in charge until the date Mr. Kinley apparently arrived, it would appear that the fairest way to divide the salary would be to pay one and a half months to each. No payment will be made, however, until your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.

Henry Flores as teacher of the Gitladamix Indian Day School. Rev. Mr. Kinley will begin duties at Gitladamix on or about June 1st, next, and he will be allowed salary at the rate of $85 a teaching month.\n\nRev. Henry Flores is being transferred to the Kitwanga School.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will give the Rev. Mr. Kinley every possible assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

S. Kinley as teacher of the Gitladamix Indian Day School, to succeed Rev. Henry Flores, who is being transferred to Kitwanga, is approved.\n\nRev. Mr. Kinley will take charge of this school on June 1st, and salary is to be allowed him at the rate of $85 a teaching month.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of Sept. 5th and Nov. 6th relative to the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School.\n\nDuring my visit last month to Gitlakdamix I interviewed Mr. Flores regarding the school work and he assured me that he would give the full regulation time to teaching the school. Whilst Mr. Flores is not up-to-date in his methods of teaching he is painstaking and interested in the school work, and I am sure the children will make progress under his charge.\n\nI regret it was not possible to answer your first letter until I had an opportunity of visiting Gitlakdamix and making a personal inspection of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC JJ.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 6th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has just received the September quarter return of the Gitladaanix Indian Day School. It is noted that the school was opened on September 10th by Rev. Henry Flores and he is being allowed salary for two thirds of a month, or $50.\n\nIn connection with his appointment, I would refer you to official letter of September 5th, to which no reply has yet been received. The Department would appreciate your early answer to the letter mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, September 5th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in which you state that Mrs. Mae Studly has tendered her resignation as teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School.\n\nI note that you recommend the temporary appointment of Rev. Henry Flores, at a salary of $75 per teaching month. The temporary appointment of Mr. Flores is approved, but, before making the appointment permanent, the Department desires a report stating whether he is prepared to conduct the school during regular hours. If, owing to his missionary duties, he would only be able to keep the school open irregularly, it is considered that it would be advisable for you to make immediate efforts to secure a teacher who would devote full time to the school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that Mrs. Mae Studdy, teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School has tendered her resignation, same having been received today.\n\nHer resignation which was quite unexpected on her part was occasioned through the transfer of her husband, a telegraph operator, from Aiyansh to another district.\n\nOn account of the short notice, and the fact that it will be impossible to obtain a new teacher by September 4th when school reopens, I would recommend the temporary appointment of the Rev. Henry Flores, Missionary at Gitlakdamix at a salary of $75.00 per month. Mr. Flores is willing to take charge of this school, and whilst not a certificated teacher is well qualified for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC J.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing an application from Mrs. Mae S. Studly, together with copies of testimonials, for the position as teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Mrs. Studly, her retention in the position to depend upon the success she achieves as shown by reports from yourself and Mr. Inspector Cairns. It is noted that, on account of the difficulty in obtaining a teacher, and the fact that there is no accommodation provided, and also in view of your recommendation, the Department will consent to Mrs. Studly taking charge of the teaching services at this school. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $55 per teaching month. I have to request that you will later inform the Department whether she accepts the position and also the date upon which she begins duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that an application has been received from Mrs. Mae S. Studly of Aiyansh, Nass River, for the position of teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School.\n\nThe husband of the applicant is employed by the Dominion Telegraph Service as operator at Aiyansh. Whilst she has not been teaching of recent years, she was trained as such, and held positions in the state of Washington, U.S.A., copies of her testimonials being enclosed for the Department's inspection.\n\nOn account of the difficulty of obtaining teachers for such places as Gitlakdamix, and the fact that there is no accommodation as yet in the Indian village, I would recommend the employment of Mrs. Studly for the present, as I think she may be able to fill the position satisfactorily.\n\nAs her teaching may not be as up-to-date as a more recently trained teacher, I would suggest that her salary commence at $85.00 per month.

School was closed on May 27th, as most of the children had left the village by that time.\n\nWhilst Paul Mercer is not a properly trained teacher and his education is more or less of an elementary character, he is giving good service and the school was kept open regularly during the time he was in charge. It is hoped that when a new school and teacher's residence are erected, it will be possible to obtain the services of a proper teacher.\n\nI would recommend payment of Mercer's salary for the months of April and May at the rate of $50.00 per month as approved in your letter of November 24th last, #168-32A.1.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC, JJ.\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 22nd, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that you have appointed Paul Mercer, a native, as teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School and that he commenced duties on the first instant. The Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Mercer temporarily until such time as it is possible to secure the services of a qualified teacher.\n\nWe note that the salary to be paid will be at the rate of $50.00 per teaching month without allowances. The Department approves of the arrangements made by you in securing this teacher to carry on the work at Gitlakdamix. You will be good enough to see that he prepares returns showing the attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of the present month and, subsequently, at the end of each quarter during the period of his engagement. These returns he should forward through your office, to be certified by you and transmitted to the Department when payment of salary due him at the above rate will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Arrangements have been made, subject to the Department's approval to secure the services of a native teacher to carry on the school work temporarily until it is possible to appoint a proper white teacher.\n\nW. E. Collison.\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department that you have been unable to find a suitable man to take charge as teacher at the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School, and recommending that, rather than having the school remain closed, the services of a native teacher be employed to carry on the work until a competent teacher can be obtained.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if you can obtain a suitable native worker, who would be able to conduct classes with some benefit to the Indian children, the department will approve of the appointment. The salary we would pay a native teacher would be at the rate of $50 per teaching month, without allowances. If you can arrange to obtain a native teacher, you may have him open the school and carry on the classroom work until such time as a qualified teacher can be obtained. I shall be pleased to be informed of the name of the native worker whom you have been able to secure, and any particulars, also the date upon which he begins duties. You should endeavour to have the worker at this school commence at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWith reference to your recommendation that travelling expenses be allowed the teachers taking up work at this school and at Lakalsap, I beg to say that it will not be possible to pay travelling expenses of teachers proceeding to and from the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAas. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th inst. relative to the Gitlakdamix Day School, I beg to state that I have been unable to find a suitable man to take charge of this school although several enquiries were received regarding the position, and as there will be no other white person at Gitlakdamix during the coming winter months, it will not be advisable to send a lady teacher.\n\nRather than that there should be no school I would recommend that the services of a suitable native teacher be employed to carry on until a proper teacher is appointed. The salary required for a native teacher would be $50.00 per month without allowances. If this is satisfactory to the Department, I shall endeavor to make the appointment at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI have pointed out before that the Greenville and Gitlakdamix schools are the most difficult to find teachers for in the Agency, on account of the isolation during the winter months and the expense and difficulty of reaching these places. The river trip to Gitlakdamix in particular, a distance of 57 miles by Indian gasboat, is a dangerous journey, and most trying to those who are not accustomed to it.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would strongly recommend that travelling expenses be allowed as an inducement to teachers taking up work at either of these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Should you, however, be able to obtain a suitable teacher for this point before the river closes, I shall be pleased if you will forward the name, qualifications and experience of the person whose services you obtain.\n\nIt is also noted that, as there will be no resident missionary at Gitlakdamix this winter, it will be impossible to send in a lady teacher. It is hoped, rather than that the school work at this point be discontinued during the coming winter, it will be possible to obtain the services of a man with the necessary qualifications in order that the school work can be carried on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There will be no resident missionary at Gitlakdamix this winter therefore it is impossible to send a lady teacher as there is no place where she could board. Should I be able to obtain a man for this place before the river closes, I shall do so.\n\nW. E.

I may say that, if a teacher with proper qualifications is obtained, we will be prepared to pay salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. We will also provide the fuel and light required. We will, however, be unable to pay any transportation expenses for the teacher in travelling to the school.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to obtain the services of a teacher to begin duties on the date mentioned above.

It is, therefore, regretted that we will be unable to grant any assistance towards the payment of Miss Winstone's travelling expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nMiss Helen Winstone, who was recently appointed to take charge of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School, has written to ask whether the Department would favorably consider allowing a small grant to assist her with her travelling expenses from McConnell, Manitoba to the Nass River. These expenses were heavier than usual both on account of Miss Winstone having to wait over a week at Prince Rupert before she could get a steamer to take her to the Nass, and having to hire a launch to take her up the river to Gitlakdamix, a distance of over fifty miles.\n\nThe Department made a grant of $30.00 for this purpose to Mrs Newnham, the former teacher, in October 1922. I think if a like amount were given to Miss Winstone it would be of great assistance to her.\n\nI am glad to be able to state that Miss Winstone is proving herself a capable teacher and is doing good work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 7th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department is approving of the appointment of Miss Helen Winstone to succeed Mrs. Newnham as teacher of the Citladaumix Indian Day School.

This has, I understand, been reported on by Mr. Collison, the Indian Agent, who was with me throughout my inspection and, of course, at the Council Meeting in the evening when the affairs of the School - Day and Residential - took up several hours, and at which I spoke at some length.\n\nThe attendance at this Day School is poor and irregular BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE FOR THE CHILDREN TO ATTEND. The teaching for years has evidently been so bad that the better educated Indians are simply disgusted with the school. I can see no reason why any Indian would want to send his child to this very unattractive room in the Mission House, where the so called teaching is more or less hopeless. These people are, in my opinion, in the right and are certainly entitled to a proper school taught by a CERTIFICATED TEACHER.\n\nI have the honour to again inform the Department that no great success can be attained in the education of the Indian children of this village till we have a trained teacher working in a properly designed schoolroom. It was made clear to me that the Indian people wish for proper education for their children and that they are very anxious to have a school building located in their village. They are perfectly ready to have the children attend regularly if they are given a teacher who knows how to teach, and who would be able to take a lead in the activities of the young people of the village.\n\nThe present plan of having an untrained missionary attempt to teach the school as well as to do his other missionary work continues to be most unsatisfactory. I should have recommended a change of teachers long ago, had there been any place for a trained teacher to carry on a school. The building of a proper school house with a small teacher's residence is a matter of the utmost importance to the life of this Indian community.\n\nMr. Collison is, I know, in agreement with my views on the situation and has, no doubt, reported to the Department with regard to the clearly expressed wishes of the Indians.\n168-32A-1 CLOSED\n\nFROM 5/10/06\n\nTO 19/12/32.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 3)\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR BARRY\nHIS INSPECTION OF THE GITLADAMICKS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n** DATE OF INSPECTION MAY 5, 1936.\n\nName of teacher: Rev. S. Kinley.\n\nThe Reverend S. Kinley is the local Anglican Missionary. He has had no Normal Training whatever. In 1934 he attended the summer school in Victoria and received the usual Provincial certificates in Primary Work as well as the usual Provincial certificates in Rural and Indian Problems. His Summer School work helped him during the following year. I have done my best to indicate and demonstrate the best methods to be followed in teaching these Indians' children but the result of all the effort expended here has been very disappointing in that very poor progress is being made by the pupils.\n\nThe Missionary is of course doing his best to instruct the children, as well as to carry on the other duties that fall to his lot, Missionary Work, care of the sick, Etc. Owing partly to his lack of professional training, but more to his natural lack of teaching ability, he simply is not able to get worth while results in this school.\n\nIn addition to again demonstrating methods and indicating the extent of work to be covered in each Grade and Sub Grade, I particularly asked the Missionary to be much stricter with the children, particularly the small girls, whose conduct in school leaves much to be desired. On several occasions during my tour up the Coast the Indians from this village complained to me that the children are permitted to play in school, talk when they should be working, and even carry on heated discussions on such subjects as witchcraft, making accusations against each other, and being carried on by many of the families of other children. All this above, I am informed, takes place in Indian and without the knowledge of the teacher, who appears to the Indians to be quite unable to control the children. I instructed the teacher to punish the children if necessary, but to get control in any case, and I informed him that the Indians were complaining, though he knew this as they had spoken to him also about the lack of discipline. The Indians like the Rev. S. Kinley as a Missionary but ask for a trained teacher in his place.\n\nI would strongly recommend that as soon as possible a proper school be built in this village, and a trained teacher appointed who is also a trained nurse. Such Anglican teacher-nurses are available. A male teacher who had been trained at a Normal School and who had successful Provincial experience in some Province, with a wife who was a trained nurse, would also be suitable in this out-of-the-way village. I know that Doctor McQuarrie would like some one here who had regular training as a nurse, and I told him so, recommending a teacher-nurse in my report on the Gitladamicks School. Such a person could no doubt live with the Missionary and his wife in the Mission House. In any case the need for a proper Indian day school to accommodate at least forty children is urgent, and I hope that the Department will give favourable consideration to my recommendation.\n\nThe Indians are quite well aware that the teacher is neither able to control their children or to teach them. They do not trouble to see that the pupils attend regularly. In fact the attendance is highly irregular. The Register, which is well kept shows that many children only attend for half a day, and even that is not regular. The percentage attendance would appear to be well below 50% in the winter quarters and far less in the summer time when many of the people are probably out of the village.\nOttawa, May 30, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nFor the past three years Inspector Barry has reported that the services of Rev. S. Kinley, teacher of the Gitladamicks Indian Day School, are unsatisfactory. The Department has deferred bringing this matter to your attention, hoping that Mr. Kinley would gain by his experience.\n\nHowever, the report of Mr. Barry's visit to this school on the 5th instant reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The teacher, Rev. S. Kinley, is the local Anglican Missionary. He has had no Normal Training whatever.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 3)\nGITLAKDAMICKS: At the present time school is carried on in a room in the mission house under conditions which are not entirely satisfactory both as regards accommodation and location. The present teacher, Rev. S. Kinley, is not a trained teacher, and whilst he does his best to instruct the children, the school is not making the progress it should, with the result that the Indians are dissatisfied, especially as they know other villages on the river have fully trained teachers in charge of the schools.\n\nI would strongly recommend, as I have done in previous reports, that a suitable school building be put up at the earliest opportunity, and that a fully trained teacher be appointed.\n\nA married man would be preferable, especially if his wife were a trained nurse capable of dispensing simple drugs, and attending to the needs of the sick in the village. Being cut off completely from the outside from November to April in each year on account of the winter freeze-up, the people of Gitlakdamicks have a special plea in this regard, and the appointment of a nurse or field matron would go far in solving the problem of medical service for the Indians on the upper Nass.\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe. No. 168-18-1.\n\nIn reply to your letter dealing with the change of teachers at Kitkatla, I have already arranged this and have so informed the Indian Agent at Prince Rupert and in due time you will no doubt hear from him.\n\nRe. No. 168-32A-1.\n\nI regret to read that the Indian School Inspector has reported unfavourably of the work Mr. Kinley of Aiyansh and Gitladaimicks has been doing. Mr. Kinley has the highest respect of myself and of all who know him, the natives included. The children could have nothing but profit in their association with this most excellent man and this cannot be considered a small matter, but rather the most important feature of the work.\n\nAs the Inspector says, Mr. Finley profited by his special summer training at Victoria and I am wiring him to go there again this summer, and I have no doubt but that he will again be helped and we shall see what will be the result at the end of another year.\n\nHe is such an outstanding man that I hesitate to lose him.\n\nA couple of years ago the Inspector sent in a most unfavourable report of Mr. Flores at Gitwangah, but through my solicitation he was tried out further with the result that Mr. Barry's recent reports are quite favourable.\n\nI believe the result will be the same in the present case if you will be good enough to let the matter continue as at present.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeo. Caledonia.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-1, part 3)\nOttawa, June 22, 1936.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to Rev. S. Kinley, teacher of the Gitladamicks Indian Day School. It is noted that Mr. Kinley will take another summer school course this year. Under these circumstances, the Department agrees to his remaining in charge of the school for the academic year 1936-37.\n\nHowever, if on the occasion of his next visit, the Inspector does not find that there has been a decided improvement in the academic work at the Gitladamicks School, the Department will be unable to consider re-engaging Mr. Kinley after June 30th, 1937.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

It appears from this report that progress during the past year has been very unsatisfactory and it is further stated that the teacher, Rev. S. Kinley, is quite unable to control the children.\n\nWith regard to Reverend Mr. Kinley's services as a teacher in this school, I would refer you to official letter of June 22nd, 1936, in which you were informed that, unless there was a decided improvement during the academic year just ending, the Department would be unable to consider re-engaging Mr. Kinley after June 30th, 1937.\n\nIn view of the report now received from our Inspector, I trust that you will arrange to nominate a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school on September 1st.\n\nAs Indian Agent Collison, Prince Rupert, B. C., is fully conversant with conditions at Gitladamicks, it would be advisable for you to select two or three qualified teachers and have them interview Mr. Collison. He will decide which is the most suited for the Gitladamicks Indian Day School and the name and qualifications of this teacher will then be forwarded for our approval.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This is due, no doubt, to the fact that he is not properly qualified and, in addition, apparently lacks ability to properly control the children.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, it has been decided to allow Mr. Kinley to remain as teacher of the Gitladamicks School until the end of June, 1938. An endeavour will be made to provide funds in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 for the erection of a new building at this point. However, it should be distinctly understood that, whether or not a new building is erected next year, Mr. Kinley's services will have to terminate on the date mentioned above.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Rev. G.A. Rix, D.D., in which he writes as follows regarding the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School:\n\n\"I believe the Inspector urges that two teachers be provided for Aiyansh or, as it is sometimes called, Gitlakdamix. There are certainly two teachers needed here. The number of pupils warrants it and there is a house provided for one. Where such an extra teacher can be found I do not know. This year neither the Indian Agent or myself have had any applications from teachers. In case an extra teacher can be found and the Department consents to an appointment at Aiyansh, then my suggestion is that a qualified teacher be sent there as senior teacher and the present teacher, Mr. Kinley, be retained as junior. If a senior teacher is not sent, and I doubt if one can be found, then my suggestion is that Mr. Kinley be again left in charge. He at least does fair work as a teacher and has many other qualities of a most valuable nature.\"\n\nYou were written regarding the teaching services at this school in official letter of the 17th ultimo. It is apparent from the recent letter received from Bishop Rix that he is still insisting on retaining Rev. Mr. Kinley.\n\nNo reply will be sent to the Bishop until we hear further from you and I should appreciate an early answer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Under these circumstances, the transfer of Mrs. E. I. Smiley from the Massett School, to take charge of the Gitlakdamix School, is approved, and she will be allowed the same salary, viz.: $90.00 a teaching month.\n\nIt is not definitely stated in your letter whether, or not, you consider a second teacher necessary for the current academic year. We overlooked providing salary for a second teacher, but if you believe a second teacher necessary, I think it will be possible to provide the funds required. You should let me hear further from you on this point.\n\nAs recommended in your letter of July 5, the Department approves the operation of this school for an 8 month period, viz.: from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

Another staff questionnaire will not be required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental letter 168-32A-1 of the 25th instant with reference to the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School.\n\nIn my letter 15/6394, dated June 29, 1940, the transfer of Mrs. Isobel Smiley, at present teacher of Division 2 of the Massett Indian Day School, to take charge of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School was suggested. Inspector Barry informs me that Mrs. Smiley is very anxious for a transfer from the Massett school where she has been highly successful and I consider her transfer to Gitlakdamix previously suggested would be in the best interests of the Indian children there.\n\nWith particular reference to paragraph 4 of the Departmental letter quoted above, the suggestion that the Inspector recommended a seven month academic year from October 1st to April 30th is obviously a mistake for in the covering letter of his last report on the Gitlakdamix school forwarded to the Department under my letter 15/6/5990 of June 5th, an eight month academic year from October 1st to May 31st was recommended. It is presumed that the Department approves of the reduction of the academic year at Gitlakdamix to one of eight months.\n\nShould the Department approve of the transfer of Mrs. Smiley as recommended above, purchase of necessary furnishings for the teacher's quarters will be proceeded with.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of June 5 you enclosed Inspector Barry's report on his inspection of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School and it is noted that he again recommends that the services of the teacher terminate on the 30th instant.\n\nIn your covering letter you make no special reference to the Inspector's recommendation but from the information contained in your letters of January 10 and February 19 it is evident that you have been in communication with Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix with a view to securing properly qualified teachers to take charge of this school during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nI should appreciate your advising me as soon as you can conveniently do so what the prospects are for obtaining new teachers as it is apparent from the Inspector's report that Mr. Kinley's services are not very satisfactory.\n\nIt is also noted from the Inspector's report that he suggests that this school operate on a seven-month basis only; namely, from October 1 to April 30. This recommendation meets with our approval.\n\nIn the event of new teachers being obtained I would refer you to the last paragraph of official letter of February 13 last authorizing an expenditure for the purchase of furnishings for the teacher's quarters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School inspected on May 15, 1940.\n\nWhile Mr. Kinley, the Anglican Missionary, is doing all he can to teach the children the fact remains that progress is most unsatisfactory in this school. The Indian parents as represented by the local Council are insistent that a qualified teacher, married if possible, be provided for the senior room and another qualified teacher for the juniors. They do not wish for the Missionary as a teacher either of the Senior or Junior class.\n\nThe circumstances of this case were explained in my report to you dated October 9, 1938. Since then the new school has been erected, and Mr. Kinley has been permitted to continue for the time as teacher.\n\nThe services of the Rev. S. Kinley should in my opinion be terminated without fail as from the end of June, 1940, and the school equipped with proper desks and blackboards, teachers rooms simply furnished, and a married man appointed teacher as from October 1, 1940. An assistant lady teacher for the junior room will also be required in my opinion particularly if Coqualeetza is closed as a school, there being a number of children there from this village who have quite good homes and who could be educated in Gitlakdamix at less cost to the Department than were they to remain at a residential school.\n\nI would recommend that this school in future operate on an eight months' basis, that is from October 1 to May 1 yearly.\nExtract from letter from Major Mackay dated January 10, 1940.\n\nA second teacher has not been thus far secured for Gitlakdamix, and Bishop Rix informed me yesterday that he is continuing to make inquiries for a suitable teacher but at the moment had no one whom he could nominate.\n\nI may say that every effort is being made to secure qualified teachers for the existing vacancies in our Indian Schools, all of which happen to be in the Diocese of Caledonia. The Provincial Department of Education has been asked to assist but owing to the scarcity of fully qualified teachers the province is faced with a similar problem to our own and is not at present, at least, in a position to help.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Oct. 16, 1939\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR SEPTEMBER.\n\nThe construction of the new two-roomed school and teacher's residence at Gitlakdamix was finished September 28th and was officially opened at a public gathering in the evening attended by a brass band playing suitable music, and speeches from the Chief Councillor, Rev. S. Kinley, Dr. M. Barbeau, and the Agent.\n\nJ. Gillett.\nIndian Agent\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAugust 16th 1940.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have read with care Departmental letter 168-32A-1 dated August 13th last.\n\nThe last two words of your letter of August 6th 15/8/7074 addressed to the Department, Paragraph 2 should read Gitlakdamix school. Mrs Smiley wishes to remain at the Massett school.\n\nThe services of Rev. S. Kinley, the former teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School should not in my opinion be again made use of under any circumstances. A number of more or less adverse reports have been made on this man during the past five or six years. He has had no Normal School training nor does he hold a teacher's certificate in any Province of Canada. He is the Anglican Missionary in Littlehampton and of course the Rt. Rev. G.Rix is anxious that he be retained as teacher for in that way the Anglican Church is saved by far the greater part of Mr. Kinley's salary as Missionary.\n\nI have explained in earlier reports that the Indians as represented by their Council told the Indian Agent Mr. Gillett and myself that they wished for an efficient trained teacher. They wished in fact for two teachers, but I can not see my way clear to recommend two teachers this year, partly because of the need for economy and partly because I wish an experienced trained teacher to organize the school properly before the children are divided into two sections. Division. The second teacher will probably be needed next year. The Indians told Mr. Gillett and myself that in any case they did not wish to have Mr. Kinley even as the junior teacher. They consider that they have not been treated properly in that they are not given a certificated teacher when other schools have such teachers.\n\nMrs Henderson, Age 42, widow of a returned man and with some twelve years experience in Alberta schools is willing to go to Gitlakdamix, and I consider she would do very well there. She has an Alberta First Class Certificate.\n\nMr Noel Stewart wishes for a transfer from the senior Division at Alert Bay where he has been such a very great success. He would also do splendidly at Gitlakdamix.\n\nI previously explained that there would be no difficulty in finding a teacher for Gitlakdamix. The above named candidates were recommended by me to write to Bishop Rix which they did, and I do not see any reason for his statement that teachers were hard to find or that he did not have suitable candidates.\n\nI certainly trust that the Department will not permit the reappointment of Rev. S. Kinley. Rev. W. Green has taken the place of a lay teacher at Kincolith and this should satisfy Bishop Rix.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nInspector of Indians\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is also understood that Bishop Rix has nominated Miss Kate Smith, B.A., as senior teacher at Massett and I would appreciate being advised if the appointment has been approved. Miss Smith is a graduate of the University of Manitoba and holds in addition a B.C. Academic Certificate. She has had in all thirteen years teaching experience, the last eight of which have been as senior teacher at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton.\n\nThe services of Mrs. Jewel Henderson, who has an Alberta First Class Certificate, are available for Gitlakdamix. I have before me a letter from Mrs. Henderson applying for the position and I would recommend that her appointment as teacher there be approved.\n\nThe services of a second teacher are not considered necessary until after this school has been organized properly by an experienced teacher holding the requisite qualifications. I regret that I cannot see my way clear to recommend the retention of the Reverend Mr. Kinley as his services as teacher have not been satisfactory.\n\nA copy of Inspector Barry's letter relating to the foregoing matter is attached and also a copy of a letter from the Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix, D.D., covering the Indian Schools in the Diocese of Caledonia.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have recently visited Aiyansh and found that there were quite too many children there for one teacher. The natives themselves saw this and urged two teachers. Both the Inspector and the Indian Agent also realize the necessity of this. Especially is this true when through the closing of the Coclitza School a considerable number of children will be added to the Aiyansh School and one room of the school will not be able to contain them and certainly one teacher will find it extremely difficult to handle them.\n\nI hope that in this outstanding need the Department will find it possible to appoint two teachers. One of whom will be Mrs. Henderson and the other Mr. Kinley. This I find will be satisfactory to Commissioner MacKay, Inspector Barry and Indian Agent Gillett and certainly to myself and the natives.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Caledonia.\nAiyanaah P.O.,\nHaas River, B.C.,\nMarch 4th/43.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI am enclosing an income tax bill of some kind.

This is a rather high enrolment but scarcely one that would justify the employment of two teachers unless the average attendance from day to day amounted to approximately 45 pupils. Unless the Public School Acts have been changed recently, public schools can only qualify for the payment of grants to two teachers when the enrolment exceeds 46.\n\nI regret to state that it was not possible to include in this year's estimates the amount necessary to provide two teachers at this school, regardless of what the enrolment might be. All Indian day schools are, as you know, operating on a nine month rather than a ten month basis and, in addition to this, we simply have been unable to secure the funds to open a number of our seasonal schools in the outlying districts. I can only express the hope that this critical and exacting period in which we find ourselves will pass quickly and thus enable us to make more adequate provision for the education of our Indian wards, particularly in the outlying sections of the Dominion.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

These two ladies, mother and daughter, are in a village which will not receive any mail for the next two or three months should the river freeze as it may at any time.\n\nIt will be appreciated if at all possible that the action requested may commence with the December cheque.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nRe yours of December 12th, 1947, file 12-11-2, re Miss Violet Wishart, the date of October 10th given in my letter of December 5th was a typographical error. Miss Wishart's statement that duties commenced on October 15th had reference to the date on which she left Prince Rupert for Aiyansh. She actually commenced duties on Monday, October 20th. It is recommended however that in view of the heavy expense incurred by these teachers at Aiyansh in having to take in with them a winter's supply of food that payment of both Miss Violet Wishart and Mrs. Lucy Wishart be as from October 15th if at all possible.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nGitladamixs Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 12-11-2 of December 30th.\n\nEnclosed please find the following documents:\n\n(a) Non-professional Certificate (Third Class) for Miss Lucy Leflar issued by the Advisory Board, Department of Education, Province of Manitoba. Certificate dated September 15, 1911.\n\n(b) Third Class Teaching Certificate issued by Department of Education, Province of Saskatchewan to Miss L. Leflar. Certificate dated March 1, 1912 and expired on June 30, 1913.\n\n(c) Marriage License for Miss Leflar to Sydney Wishart dated August, 1913.\n\nIn other words, Mrs. Wishart holds a Third Class Non-professional Certificate (not a license to teach) from the Province of Manitoba and a Third Class Certificate from the Province of Saskatchewan which expired some thirty-four years ago. It is also noted that she was given a temporary British Columbia Certificate which was extended to June 30, 1946.\nIf you will refer to article No. 47 of the April issue of the Bulletin, you will find that clause nine reads as follows:\n\n\"Teachers holding Third Class Certificates, Teaching permits and similar licences based upon short teacher training courses and incomplete high school academic standing will be classified as Grade 1 Teachers only\". This means that Mrs. Wishart would normally be entitled to a maximum salary of $112.00 a teaching month. However, the salary schedule also provides \"that no teacher in 1947-48 and thereafter, shall while holding the same position held in 1946-47, receive a lower salary than the total amount paid him in 1946-47\". As Mrs. Wishart was receiving $131.00 a teaching month previous to the inauguration of the salary schedule, the Department has continued to pay her at this rate and she is not entitled to any increase in salary until she produces evidence of holding a higher class of teaching certificate.\n\nBernard F.

Lauchlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Gitlakdamix Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware, Miss Sarah Freeman and Miss Martha L. Nichols have been appointed as teacher at the above mentioned school. I am in receipt of advice from Supt. Anfield that the Nass River is presently completely impassible and it will be necessary for these teachers to be flown in to Aiyansh from Terrace, B.C. A plane has to be chartered for this purpose as there is no other method of transportation at this time and Mr. Anfield has requested that, if possible, the Department pay some portion of this cost. As the usual boat transportation is not available I feel that consideration should be given to this request and would recommend that the teachers be required to pay half the plane charter, the Department to pay the other half. I have today written to Mr. Anfield asking him to advise what the fare will amount to and will forward this information on to you when received.\n\nMiss Nichols left Vancouver last Wednesday to connect with the plane chartered by Supt. Anfield. However, just prior to her departure a wire was received from Mr. Anfield advising that due to icy conditions the plane would be unable to land at Aiyansh. We were unable to contact Miss Nichols in time to prevent her sailing and she is now at Prince Rupert awaiting improvement in weather conditions. Under the circumstances and as the delay is something over which Miss Nichols has no control, I would recommend that salary be paid her as from February 5th, the date on which she arrived in Prince Rupert.\n\nW.S.

However these teachers left by chartered plane on February 17th from Prince Rupert for Aliyansh. We have not had confirmation of their arrival but it is assumed that they have now taken over their duties.\n\nAs you are probably aware this is an isolated point and mail contact is most irregular.

The temporary appointment of Mr. Flores is approved, but, before making the appointment permanent, the Department desires a report stating whether he is prepared to conduct the school during regular hours. If, owing to his missionary duties, he would only be able to keep the school open irregularly, it is considered that it would be advisable for you to make immediate efforts to secure a teacher who would devote full time to the school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Kinley as teacher of the Gitladamix Indian Day School, to succeed Rev. Henry Flores, who is being transferred to Kitwanga, is approved.\n\nRev. Mr. Kinley will take charge of this school on June 1st, and salary is to be allowed him at the rate of $85 a teaching month.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter return of the Gitl\u00e4damiiks Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that this return is signed by Rev. Samuel Kinley and states that he took charge of the school on May 13th. In preparing the return, he states that the school was open for thirty-three (33) days during the quarter and it would, therefore, appear that the return that has been forwarded only covers the period during which Rev. Mr. Kinley has been in charge of the school. As you will note from official letter of April 10th, last, the Department understood that Rev. Mr. Flores would continue in charge at Gitl\u00e4damiiks until June 1st, on which date he would be succeeded by Rev. Mr. Kinley.\n\nPlease let me know for what length of time Rev. Mr. Flores conducted the Gitl\u00e4damiiks School during the June quarter in order that the amount due both Mr. Flores and Mr. Kinley may be paid. If Mr. Flores was in charge until the date Mr. Kinley apparently arrived, it would appear that the fairest way to divide the salary would be to pay one and a half months to each. No payment will be made, however, until your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.

B. M'o Cullagh, a worthy missionary and a successful Teacher amongst the only loyal band of Indians on the Upper Naas River. This application after being delayed on the way down the river has been mislaid at my office for some months.\n\nI am very anxious that the Government should in some way assist this band of Indians living in the midst of the most disloyal of the heathen Indians in British Columbia.\n\nTheir Chief Abraham assisted by Mr. M'o Cullagh continues to maintain the cause of the Government against the combined influence of disloyal bands on every side of them. The old log house built by Mr. M'o Cullagh and the Indians was accidentally burned down last winter. I trust that you can recommend the assistance and recognition of these Indians by a donation of at least half the amount asked as sufficient to build a suitable school house.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Signed) C.

In asking for this grant I would invite attention to the fact, that up to the present the C.M.S. has borne all the expense connected with the secular education of these Indians: no assistance having yet been rendered by the Government.\n\nI hope therefore, that this application may be favorably entertained.

Vowell and the letters which accompanied it from the Indian Agent Todd of Metlakatla and Rev. James B. McCullagh of Aiyansh Mission, Nass River, B.C., all having reference to an application made by the last named gentleman for a grant to assist the Church Missionary.\n\nTo the Hon.\nEdmunds\nDept. Civil & Ind. Affairs\nSociety in rebuilding a school house, which was destroyed last winter by fire on the Gitlakdamiks Indian Reserve.\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that the statement made by Mr. McCaugh, that up to the present the Church Missionary Society has borne all the expense connected with the education of the Indians owning that Reserve, and that no assistance has been rendered by its funds, is correct.\n\nThe population of the Band consists of 67 souls. Of these 25 are children, and 17 of the latter are of school age.\n\nNo provision has been made in the\nEstimates for a grant towards the erection of the school building in question; and consequently the undersigned fail to see, even if the Sup't General is disposed to accede to the application, how the amount can be paid, unless additional Supplementary Estimates for 1890-91 are to be submitted to Parliament and an item be inserted therein.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBy Sup't Gen'l of Ind.

Mr. Collingsworth for school material, I beg to report that in his letter of the 19th August last, Mr. Moffatt enclosed one from Mr. Collingsworth in which he asked for some school material for a school which he has kept open for the past seven years at Aiyansh on the Nass River & for a school which he states he is desirous of opening at the heathen village of Gitlakdamiks about two miles above Aiyansh before taking any decided action in the matter the Dept. thought it well to have some particulars from Agent Todd. That officer states that the number of scholars attending the Aiyansh School is 31 & that the School is distant from the nearest Methodist School about -\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\n\n35 miles. Gittakalamik, he states, is a large village (wooden) about 8 miles above Sigamish 450 miles from the mouth of the Nass River. A school has been built there an attendance of 40 scholars.\n\nThe supply asked for is not very large & as the information given by Agent Ford appears to be satisfactory I moved respectfully recommend that the requisition be filled.\n\nJohn McLean\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the House has granted the sum of $500 towards a rebuilding of a schoolhouse at Sibley's Creek. As the letter we stated the willingness of the Dept. to assist the Church Missionary Society in this work was dated & they go it in support that the building is now completed.\n\nThe grant is now available until the 30th September next. To place it before the 30th June, under the Act, you shall not place the Dept. in possession of the facts.\n\nIn order that the grant may be paid to the Church Missionary Society, it will be necessary to\nhave a full description of the building erected with a statement of the total cost supported by invoices. I must ask you to give the matter your earliest attention so the time for action cannot be extended beyond the 30th September next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will now be too late to notify Mr. McCullagh of the Department's desire to aid in the erection of the building and have it completed, furnishing the necessary description and vouchers of cost before the 30th September next, as there will not be time for that gentleman to obtain the necessary lumber and assistance and complete the work, Tillakdamicks being a long distance up the Nass River and out of reach of regular postal communications.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVestig.

Mr. Lorenz points out that the Reserves of these two Bands of Indians adjoin one another and that one school situated at the boundary line, which is about 1 mile distant from each village, would serve for the children of both Bands and that the Bishop of Caledonia, with whom he states he discussed the school question, favoured the suggestion. The Indians it seems, from what the Agent states, were in October last in favour of one school for the two villages and he does not anticipate any difficulty with the Indians in securing the necessary land to erect a Day school building and from my own observation it may be added that when at the above places last Spring the matter was discussed between the Indians and myself and they decided that one school, as suggested between the two Reserves, would be acceptable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to advise you that new Indian day school buildings are required at Aiyansh and Kitlaedsmak.\n\nIn connection I beg to state that the reserves of these two bands of Indians are adjoining one another, and that one school situated at the boundary line, which is about one mile distant from each village, would serve for the children of both bands.\n\nThe Right Rev. F.H. Du Vernet, Bishop of Caledonia, with whom I discussed the school question, is favoring my suggestion, adding that an improved day school, as outlined by the Honorable the Superintendent General, be supplied, and in this instance a mid-day meal would meet the difficulty.\n\nThe Indians at Aiyansh and Kitlaedsmak, who I visited last October, were then in favor of one school for the two villages, and I do not expect that any difficulty will arise with the Indians in securing the necessary land to erect the Day School building.\n\nTrusting that you and the Department will favorably consider the erection of one day school building for the two villages,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.W.

They asked that I procure aid from the Department for them which I promised at the same time advising them to forward to me a written request embodying what they were particularly in need of. I am now in receipt of two communications, dated 15th instant, one from Chief James Ksidiyawug, and one from the Rev. J.B. McCullagh, who has done so much as Missionary amongst them during the past eighteen years, or so, copies of which are herewith enclosed. A perusal of these two letters will, I think, be pleasing to the Department and I have no hesitation in strongly recommending that the not unreasonable request of the Kitlackadamax Indians be acceded to.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.W.

Since your visit we have been thinking about these things and have concluded among ourselves to ask the Indian Department to make us a grant of a Planer for our saw mill in lieu of the lumber necessary for the school. This would help us in every way. We could then produce the building material for the school free of any further expense to the Department, with the exception of nails, windows, doors, shingles and other fittings.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\nJames Kaidiydug, Chief\nper James B. McCullagh, J.P.\nOttawa, October 25, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to refer Your Lordship to previous correspondence in connection with the erection of a new school building for the Kitladaanax Indian reserve. The Department has lately heard with much regret of the destruction of the building on the Algonkian reserve and it is thought that this might be an opportune time to again give careful consideration to the question of a union school for these two villages. A building which could be erected on the boundary between the two reserves would only be one mile from each of the villages. The Department would be prepared to erect a suitable building and provide an adequate salary for a qualified teacher. It might also be deemed expedient to furnish the children with a light midday lunch.\n\nMr. Perry, the Agent, has been asked to go more carefully into this matter and I should be pleased if Your Lordship also would take it up with the resident Missionary and obtain the views of all those interested including the Indians. Building operations cannot be undertaken now till next spring, but it would be well to have everything in\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nreadiness for an early start. The Department would be pleased to hear from Your Lordship in reference to this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, October 25, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn official letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the erection of a day school building at Kitladamax it was stated that it might be well for you to look into the matter of erecting a union school. This was again referred to in a letter of recent date following the receipt of the information that the Aiyansh building had been destroyed.\n\nIn view of the difficulty in securing competent teachers for these schools it is thought that a union school at a point equally distant from each of the villages would, in some respects at least, best serve the interest of these people. The distant would not be too great as a central point would be about a mile from each of the villages. If the Indians are agreeable the Department would be prepared to pay for the services of a properly qualified teacher and it might also be deemed expedient, under the circumstances, to provide a mid-day lunch for the children. As nothing can be done before next spring this matter ought to be very carefully looked into and the opinion of the Indians obtained. In the meantime the Department will write to His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. C.

But it was evident that the Indians of the two villages were not able to agree to this proposal because of the promises made by Mr Vowell and Mr A.E. Green, that there would be a school for each village, therefore there has been an element of dubiuousness as to the working of either plan. This was one of my reasons for asking that Inspector Neelands and Inspector Green accompany me to these villages this month.\n\nThe plans for the school are nearly ready. The delay is to be regretted, but it takes some time to communicate with these villages.\n\nBefore anything can possibly be done it will be necessary to find out just what to do in settling the matter of a school at these places.\n\nYour letter to me dated June 16th, last No 299590 stated that the Department had decided that the matter of a school for Kitladamiks should stand over till next season for reasons assigned therein.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your report upon the existing conditions at Alyush and Kittadamox, it is considered that a school building should be provided in each of these villages. The Department will be prepared next year to erect a building in the Alyush village on the plans of the one recently completed at Fort Washington at a cost of approximately $1800.00 and you will be good enough to submit a sketch plan of a building you think would be suitable for Kittadamox to cost about $1000.00, giving details as to materials, prices, etc.\n\nThe appropriation provided by Parliament for Indian education during the current fiscal year is sufficient to meet the cost of both these schools, but it is too late now to proceed with the work. The Department would like to know, however, if it would be possible before March 31st, next, to purchase either all or a large portion of the necessary material for construction, in order that it can be paid for out of this year's vote leaving only the labour to be provided for next year. If this material can be purchased at Prince Rupert it might be stored till next spring, provided there is a suitable place available where it could be safely cared for.

The rough lumber will be supplied by the Indians from their own mill, but finished work will have to be freighted up the river in the spring when navigation opens. The cost of material for this school will be $728.95, inclusive of the necessary furniture and fixtures, and will be ordered upon my receiving instructions from the Department.\n\nAs to a suitable site\u2014this was selected on my last trip to that village, and should be satisfactory in every detail.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nMy dear Mr. Perry,\u2014The Indians here and at Gitlakdamiks had an united meeting yesterday for the purpose of discussing the school question, particularly as regards the erection of the school buildings now about to be put up at Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks. A deputation from the meeting waited upon me afterward with a request that I write to you immediately as follows:\u2014\n\n1. The Indians unitedly ask that no buildings shall be erected until after their claims for an entire and final settlement be heard and adjusted. They set forth that the continual reception of Government financial assistance is inconsistent with the position they have taken up at the present time, and that such a course on their part is likely to prejudice their case or obscure the issue in its final consideration.\n\n2. They have definite ideas regarding education and look forward to the acquisition of special facilities in this regard when a final settlement is made with them regarding their land &c. They claim that the government day school does not meet their requirements and does not produce results commensurate with the expenditure involved. They assert that the two villages being only two miles apart it would be more efficient if a common school were built on the boundary line between the two villages, and the separate school grants now made devoted to the payment of a duly qualified teacher.\n\n3. They request that if it is too late now to stop the work, that the material for the separate schools now assembled and awaiting transportation up river be incorporated into one building on the boundary line. But they would deem it a special favour from the Department if the whole thing were held in abeyance for a time.\n\nThe canoe is starting immediately and this is all I am able to say at present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 1)\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nMatlaskatla, B.C.\n\nSeptember 21st, 1911.\n\nI have the honor to inclose you herewith a copy of a letter received today from the Rev. J.B. Mc Cullagh, missionary to the Indians at Aiyansh, Nass River, in relation to the schools proposed to be erected on the Nass River.\n\nThe school at Lek-kalnap is now being erected, and it was my intention to proceed with the Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks schools immediately upon the completion of the former school, but for reasons assigned in the letter the Indians are stated to require the cessation of the work pending the final settlement of their land grievances by the Imperial authorities.\n\nI would remind the Department that in September of last year I met the Indians both at Aiyansh and at Gitlakdamiks to discuss the school situation. At that time they protested strongly against the idea of a joint school, and were delighted at the prospect of having separate schools.\n\nWhile on the Nass River in June last taking the Indian Census I discussed the matter fully with the Rev. Dr. Mc Cullagh, and afterwards selected the site for the new building in the village of Aiyansh, while the same site had been decided upon before. Mr. Mc Cullagh was pleased with this arrangement.\n\nSince that time, however, the matter appears to have been reconsidered, and the Indians, through Mr. Mc Cullagh, request that the matter of building be held in abeyance.\n\nThe idea that the Indians have definite ideas of education etc., seems to be absurd, to say the least. They do not know their own minds. At the same time I can understand the discontent of the Indians in the matter of the Day school at\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 1)\nAiyansh. They have never had a proper building to hold school in, therefore they do not know anything about a properly conducted and equipped school.\n\nI would further state that, since the adjustment of their land grievances has been deferred pending the conclusion of the Coronation function, and further held over until after the general election (as they have been told) the Indians have taken for granted that the Government is trying to shuffle the issue, and they do not want any concessions or favours from the Government until this\u2014the business of all businesses with them\u2014has been settled.\n\nThe Department will know that in April of this year the Naze Indians were offered a gift of new lumber in order to replace old and unsanitary camping shacks at Fishery Bay, and they refused to consider the matter on the grounds of their impression that the Government only wanted to put them up new houses so that it could afterwards claim a right to the land on which the houses stood.\n\nI think that if the material now at Lak-kalzap and awaiting favourable water conditions for shipment by canoe to Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks when the Lak-kalzap school is finished were carefully stored and placed in charge of the Lak-kalzap council until the spring of next year, the Indians might then be willing to have the schools built.

You will recollect that arrangements were made to store this material at Prince Rupert and presumably it was moved from there to Lakalsap in the spring. I would also ask you to state whether you kept the material for the three schools on the Nass River separate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C.

Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have carried out your instructions in connection with the Nass River schools, and have closed all school work.\n\nThe school at Lak-kalzap is complete, and ready for use. The materials for Aiyansh and Gitlakadnike schools already sent up river are stored at Aiyansh, as the people at Gitlakadnike objected to the landing of school materials at their village, the chief objector being Jimmy Woods I understand.\n\nThe materials are in charge of John Davis, of Aiyansh; the remainder of the materials are stored at Lak-kalzap, in charge of Samuel Mc Kay, the destroyed material is stored in his house, and the lumber under the canvas cover in safe protection from the weather.\n\nI have forwarded to you all receipts, in duplicate, hoping they have reached you safely.\n\nYou can understand that this work on the river has caused me to advance quite an amount of money on behalf of the Department to enable the work to be carried through thus far successfully, and that I have given up my contract work for the best six months in the year to be able to carry this school work to a satisfactory conclusion, and now the work has been stopped my position is one I think, which entitles me to some compensation for the loss of at least six month's wages. I should be much obliged if you will lay my case before the Department, pointing out that I have given up my work elsewhere to carry out the Nass work; and now that it has closed so soon I stand at a considerable loss. It can easily be understood that I, a contractor, could not afford to give up my contract work to go up the Nass for a period of only two months on a wage of only five dollars per day.\n\nThe work I was engaged to carry out was at least six months' work, so I ask that, as compensation, the Department pay me for two month's work at the rate of five dollars per day, making a sum of $250.\n\nI will be much obliged if an early settlement of the accounts already in could be made, as the delay will cause me further loss, and hamper my endeavour to make good the loss I must suffer under the circumstances of this alteration of arrangements.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.H. Wiseman.\nKincolith, Nass River,\nOctober 19th, 1911.\n\nTo J.W. Wiseman, Esq.,\nLak-kalzep,\nNass River.\n\nSir:\n\nI have conferred with Archdeacon Collison with whom I arrived at Kincolith last night, on the matter of coming to Lak-kalzep, to see the school and wind up the work of school construction for the present year.\n\nI am informed that the Indians are engaging in a big potlatch tomorrow, preparations for which are in progress today. In consequence I do not deem it advisable to visit Lak-kalzep just now, as it would be impossible to arrange a meeting of the Indians, and my presence at Lak-kalzep just now would belittle my influence, the Indians being quite likely to suspect that I was there to watch their movements. I thought of sending you a letter by specially chartered launch today, but an second thought that the Indians might suppose that by this message that I had deputed your agency to act as spies or special constables, and decide to send it by Archdeacon Collison at the best and earliest opportunity.\n\nI beg to request that you will kindly see that the materials on hand for the construction of the Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks schools are carefully stored and in charge of safe parties. I would suggest that the materials now on the bank near Gitlakdamiks, as also that at Lak-kalzep, be covered securely with a lumber covering where it stands to protect it during the winter.\n\nAlfred Mc Kay could be asked to keep an eye on the goods at Lak-kalzep and James Smythe these at Git-lak-damiks, or other reliable men. You could tell these men that, when the materials are removed, the Government will give them five dollars apiece for their trouble.\n\nTo save the nails, etc., from getting rusty these could be taken to the homes of Mc Kay and Smythe another reliable men.\n\nI shall also thank you to find out and report to me the names of the Indian who ordered the materials not to be landed at Gitlakdamiks or Aiyansh, and the names of the men engaged to convey the materials to these points.\n\nI would suggest that you make no reference to schools to the Indians, and that you pack up and leave the river as soon as things are in order as above.\n\nYour accounts could be forwarded to me for payment, and I could see you at Prince Rupert on your way down.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nCharles Clifton Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. \"Get a receipt for materials from Mc Kay and Smythe or others in charge. I return to Port Simpson by S.S. 'Venture' today. C.C.P.\"\nI beg to enclose you herewith voucher No. 150 for the payment to Messrs Weight & Wiseman for advances made in connection with the construction of the Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks Indian Day schools. These schools being within two miles of each other I regret that conditions on the river resulted in the materials getting mixed up together, and consequently the joint treatment of the accounts.\n\nI beg also to supplement the petition recently sent in this connection from the Aiyansh people with copies of correspondence between the foremen engaged to supervise the construction and myself. This is enclosed herewith and will be self-explanatory.\n\nI would urge that the Department give the representations of Mr. Wiseman its earnest consideration, as the non-erection will mean all he says it will, and I think the firm is entitled to compensation as suggested.\n\nI further enclose receipts for the payment of wages, in connection with which you will see that receipts from the foremen are for payment at the rate of $5.50 per day, the extra 50 cents being charged in lieu of provisions which the Department has stated it will not allow. Hence the alteration by me in the pay-list.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith Cheque.\n\nOttawa, 15th December, 1911.\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 27th ultimo, I beg to transmit herewith cheque No 1762 for $401.00, in favour of Messrs Weight & Wiseman.\n\nThe Department regrets the stoppage in the work undertaken by the above mentioned Firm, as well as the loss which they may have sustained thereby, but I may say that the Department does not feel called upon to make any compensation in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Wiseman.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th December last, I beg to inform you that I communicated the contents of the said letter to Mr. J.W.

Mr. Wiseman does not appear to be satisfied with the Department's views in respect to their account.\n\nI have talked the matter over with Mr. School Inspector Green, for whose visit I have held the letter in abeyance, and now beg to enclose herewith correspondence which will show the Department what led up to the rendering of the Labor Returns showing the foreman's wages at $5.50 per day, the extra 50 cents being in lieu of provisions.\n\nI may say that, at the time of this firm taking up the matter of provisions, I gave Mr. Wiseman to understand that, while the purchase of provisions by the Department had not been authorized, the Department may or may not approve of the payment of an extra 50 cents per day in lieu of provisions; and that, if such an item were inserted in the Labor Return, an explanation could be furnished the Department, and a request made for payment.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Report of the Schools in the Neas Agency by Inspector A. M. Tyson with the Royal Commission on Indian Affairs, October 19, 1915. Original on file 427021-61\n\nThe school buildings of the Neas Agency are for the most part good substantial structures and kept in excellent condition both inside and out. They are well supplied with the necessary furnishings and other school equipment. The children appear to be bright and healthy and clean and comfortably clothed. Their progress in the different lines of work is for the most part satisfactory.\n\nThe different villages of this agency all brought before the Royal Commission the question of the establishing of Industrial schools somewhere in the Neas. At each village where the meetings were held, they offered to give a site for the establishment of such an institution wherever the Department might select.\n\nAt Aiyansh, Gitladamike and Gwinahs they are most anxious to have day schools established. In the past the Indians of these villages have opposed this on the grounds that they would not have the schools established until the land question had been settled, but as the Commissioners informed them that the establishment of the schools would in no way affect their aboriginal title, and as the Land Committee has apparently failed, these Indians are now desirous that schools be established as soon as possible. They seem to realize that the education of their children is a step in the right direction. I would respectfully suggest to the Department that teachers be appointed to these villages as soon as practicable.\n\nSgd. A.M.Tyson.

McCullough, and his family, had been left destitute.\n\nWith their reports of the occurrence are meager, it was stated that the fires started from a spark from the chimney. The roof caught fire and the wooden building was soon blazing fiercely.\n\nIt had gained great headway before it was discovered and although an alarm was sent out to the neighboring Indian villages and the vicar made every effort, the building was consumed with all its contents, including the supplies and the clothing of the missionary and his family.

In reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn of this occurrence and approves of your action in authorising the purchase of a small quantity of lumber to fix up a temporary school room.\n\nIn your letter you refer to the proposed new school to be erected next Spring. It is presumed that you have reference to a building on the Kitlakumix Reserve. This would appear to be an opportune time to take carefully into consideration the erection of a school that would serve both villages, and a full report should be forwarded by you.

(RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 2)\nOttawa, October 25, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn official letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the erection of a day school building at Kitlakmak it was stated that it might be well for you to look into the matter of erecting a union school. This was again referred to in a letter of recent date following the receipt of the information that the Alyanah building had been destroyed.\n\nIn view of the difficulty in securing competent teachers for these schools it is thought that a union school at a point equally distant from each of the villages would, in some respects at least, best serve the interest of these peoples. The distant would not be too great as a central point would be about a mile from each of the villages. If the Indians are agreeable the Department would be prepared to pay for the services of a properly qualified teacher and it might also be deemed expedient, under the circumstances, to provide a mid-day lunch for the children. As nothing can be done before next spring this matter ought to be very carefully looked into and the opinion of the Indians obtained. In the meantime the Department will write to His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nO. G. Perry, B.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n\nActing Deputy Dept., General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, October 25, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to refer Your Lordship to previous correspondence in connection with the erection of a new school building for the Kitladanak Indian reserve. The Department has lately heard with much regret of the destruction of the building on the Algonksh reserve and it is thought that this might be an opportune time to again give careful consideration to the question of a union school for these two villages. A building which could be erected on the boundary between the two reserves would only be one mile from each of the villages. The Department would be prepared to erect a suitable building and provide an adequate salary for a qualified teacher. It might also be deemed expedient to furnish the children with a light midday lunch.\n\nMr. Perry, the Agent, has been asked to go more carefully into this matter and I should be pleased if Your Lordship also would take it up with the resident Missionary and obtain the views of all those interested including the Indians. Building operations cannot be undertaken now till next spring, but it would be well to have everything in\n\nRight Rev. F. H.

The Department would be pleased to hear from Your Lordship in reference to this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Dept. General of Indian Affairs.\nto warrant the erection of a separate school.\n\nGitlakdamiks is another kind of place altogether. It is composed of nearly half old Indian houses, and the people seem to be just merging from the most primitive conditions.\n\nThere are fewer children, and I should say that if a good and substantial building were erected at Aiyansh, and a less expensive school put up at Gitlakdamiks the needs of the both villages would be fully met.\n\nI would suggest that a building on the Port Essington plan, a little better finished, for the village of Aiyansh would meet the need there. This would cost about $1800.00.\n\nA building costing about a thousand dollars would meet the need at Gitlakdamiks.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReferring to your letter No 67,340-5, dated Oct 20th ult., re the matter of a school for the villages of Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks, I have the honor to state that I have recently returned from these settlements, where I examined the ground proposed to be covered if a joint school were erected.\n\nI would point out that the matter of a joint school has been a bone of contention since the last visit of Mr Supt Vowell to Gitlakdamiks and Aiyansh, when the Indians were at both places, promised a separate school. Mr Inspector has also told the Indians (so they tell me) that the Department would likely build two schools; and it would appear that both Mr Vowell and Mr Green went so far as to look into the matter of a site at both places.\n\nIf it were decided by the Department to erect a joint school between the two villages which are about one and a half to two miles apart it would be necessary for the scholars to walk over deep snow the half distance throughout a long and bitter winter, and in my opinion the school would be very poorly attended.\n\nIt is evident that both Mr Vowell and Mr Green felt that separate schools would be best, at the same time they may not have taken into consideration the difficulty in securing teachers for these remote settlements.\n\nI may say that Aiyansh is one of the neatest and well ordered villages on the Nass river. It has some of the most creditably built and designed houses to be seen in the North. Streets have been made, houses have been erected on surveyed blocks, and the people appear to be industrious. There are enough children at Aiyansh...\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your report upon the existing conditions at Aiyansh and Kitladamax, it is considered that a school building should be provided in each of these villages. The Department will be prepared next year to erect a building in the Aiyansh village on the plans of the one recently completed at Fort Rossington at a cost of approximately $1600.00 and you will be good enough to submit a sketch plan of a building you think would be suitable for Kitladamax to cost about $1000.00, giving details as to materials, prices, etc.\n\nThe appropriation provided by Parliament for Indian education during the current fiscal year is sufficient to meet the cost of both these schools, but it is too late now to proceed with the work. The Department would like to know, however, if it would be possible before March 31st, next, to purchase either all or a large portion of the necessary material for construction, in order that it can be paid for out of this year's vote leaving only the labour to be provided for next year. If this material can be purchased at Prince Rupert it might be stored till next spring, provided there is a suitable place available where it could be safely cared for. The Department will be glad to hear from you in reference to this proposition at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO. O. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMatlakatla, B.C.\n\nAsst.

As the accounts were not sent to this office in duplicate form, the firm supplying the material has been written to in this regard, and the accounts will be forwarded to you without unnecessary delay. Should any delay, however, be occasioned in the transmission of these accounts causing inconvenience in fiscal reckonings for the current year, I would point out that the material secured, inclusive of the necessary desks and fixtures, amounts to the sum of $959.75, and an accountable cheque for that amount could be sent to this office, from which amount there would be no unexpended balance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mc Cullagh\u2014the resident missionary\u2014states that suitable premises were temporarily secured, which he thought to be cheaper than the expenditure of $150.00 with Mr Mc Cullagh upon his application after the fire, with the approval of the Department by letter dated October 20th last, No. 67340-5, would be in the best interests of the children and also the teacher, and for the rental of which the reverend gentleman appears to require the Department to pay the sum of ten dollars per month instead of the sum of $100.00 or $150.00 approved, as aforesaid, for the temporary repair of the old schoolhouse, the lumber for the use of which could afterwards be utilized in the construction of the new school.\n\nBy the same mail as that by which the returns were received came a letter from Mr Priestly\u2014the teacher\u2014who states concerning the room now in use for school purposes, as follows:\n\n\"The school is a great disadvantage just now as the room is also used as courthouse, feast hall and council room, and so is upset every evening. The attendance is very poor this quarter and consists of just those who want to or are willing to learn.\"\n\nThe use of a building that is in continuous use for other purposes such as is mentioned above is more unsuitable and undesirable, and the greatest possible encouragement of tubercular disease that could be imagined by any one who is familiar with\nthe way in which these public halls of the Indians are kept unless under strict supervision. I was surprised at Mr Mc Cullagh's action in consideration of the fact that theoretically he is an advocate of healthy sanitary conditions.\n\nI cannot, therefore, recommend the payment by the Department of the rent asked for, and as five months have elapsed since authority was given for the temporary repair of the old building for school purposes, and in anticipation of the early erection of the new school, for which material has been purchased, also that from now on most of the children will be away from the village to the fishing camps with their parents, it would seem advisable to discountenance the repair mentioned above, and to advise Mr Mc Cullagh accordingly.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA.**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS BRITISH COLUMBIA.**\n\n| DATE   | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1911   |                                                                      |        |\n| April  |                                                                      |        |\n| 16th   | Paid to Timothy Derrick, for transport of school supplies, Kincolith to Alyansh........ | $ 2.00 |\n| 1910   | Oct 11                                                                |        |\n|        | Paid to Jesse Allen & Co., for 34 school primers for Alyansh school....... | $ 6.00 |\n\nTotal $ 8.00\n\nI hereby Certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed, and that the charges are fair and just; also that all the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Weight & Wiseman for material supplied for the construction and partial equipment of the Indian Day School at Aiyumsh, Nass River; and in reply I have to inform you that in view of the fact that there is a charge of $18.00 in the account for 6500 feet R.M. Rough Lumber the Department fails to understand your remark that the articles supplied will be stored at Prince Rupert \"with the exception of the rough lumber which will be supplied from the Indians' own mills, and which has been purchased by arrangement with the firm supplying the material, who will take the responsibility of storage and supply the lumber at sawmill prices\".\n\nIf Messrs. Weight & Wiseman did not supply the 6500 feet rough lumber you should not have allowed the charge to stand in the account, and if the rough lumber required for the building is purchased from the Indians a voucher in their favour should be submitted for payment after delivery has been made. A full explanation in this connection is desired.\n\nThe arrangement to have Mr. Wiseman act as working foreman in connection with the construction of the building is quite satisfactory to the Department.\n\nCheque No. 2970 for $2971.75 is being sent forward to you in payment of the amount from Messrs.

Weight and Wiseman, for material supplied for the construction and partial equipment of the Indian day school at Aiyansh, Nass River, details of which may be seen in the accounts attached to the voucher.\n\nI beg to say that these articles will be stored at Prince Rupert, with the exception of the rough lumber which will be supplied from the Indians' own sawmill, and which has been purchased by arrangement with the firm supplying the other material who will take the responsibility of storage and supply the lumber at sawmill prices.\n\nI am hoping that present arrangements will be effected, by which Mr. J.W. Wiseman, of the firm of Weight & Wiseman, will undertake the personal supervision of the erection of the three schools on the river as working foreman, on condition that his firm be given the order for material.\n\nMr. Wiseman undertook the building of the Kinkolith Indian day school, of which workmanship the venerable Archdeacon Collison speaks in the highest terms; moreover I know of no one who is better entitled to the patronage of the Department than this firm. Mr. Wiseman was the Agent of Mr. W.T. Kerbin, M.P.I., during the recent Provincial campaign. He also thoroughly understands the Indians and has no difficulty in getting a crew together and work with them.\n\nWe shall be fortunate in securing the\nservice referred to, as few men will spend any length of time on the Nass river in the summer on account of the mosquitoes which are terrifying in the hot weather, and as the cost of living on the river is much higher than on the coast because of the difficult navigation, and wages offered by the Department, i.e.-$5.00 per day for working foremen-no higher than that obtainable in the coast cities.\n\nI trust that this arrangement will be in every way satisfactory to the Department.

The second, covering the purchase of books from Messrs Allen & Co, of Prince Rupert, was contracted by the teacher without the approval of the Department. In the latter Mr Priestly does not wish the Department to pay for the Prayer-Book, but asks for the sum of $3.60 to cover cost of two dozen school primers which he states were needed for the school.\n\nI am inclosing a voucher for payment in case the Department is willing to grant Mr Priestly's request, together with the latter's letter of explanation.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir \u2014 I am in receipt of your dated 8th March, Victoria, and have just had an interview with the sawmill manager here to whom I read and explained your order. In the first place, I have to say that there are no logs and no lumber on hand at the mill. In the second, it is doubtful if the mill can be put in running order before May or June. There new tubes have to be put in the boiler, and these are not even ordered yet. Of course, I am trying to encourage them as much as possible, for I want to get on with my own house. I have now a party of men out logging to whom I have given a contract for 50,000 feet, and I told them that very likely you would be wanting logs for the building of the schools so they had better go up to 100,000 feet. But at the very least pace this will only give you green lumber for all purposes. I reckon it will take 2 seasons for me to get through my house. All this is very indefinite for you but you can take it as quite definite that the lumber you require could not possibly materialise by June. Better have the lumber cut and dried this year & build next.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 2)\ncannot supply the lumber this year. The order was given four months ago, for the rough lumber. This also applies to Git-ladamiks, which school would have been supplied from the Aiyansh mill.\n\nSome time since a planer was asked for by the Lek-kalzap Indians, but as the Department had given no reply the Indians made a purchase of a planer in Vancouver, in the delivery of which there has been delay, resulting in the inability of the Indians to prepare the lumber in time to have it dry for the building this spring. It is understood the planer has just arrived, but the lumber will not, if cut by the Indians, be dry soon enough to be suitable for building this spring. The Indians will probably be able to furnish the rough lumber, and the remainder will be shipped to Lek-kalzap.\n\nThe river will not be navigable for scows of lumber until the end of July. Everything will be got ready by then, and the Indians will be on hand to ship the material up the river on their return from the fishing camps.\n\nThe Naas river is a very difficult country for transportation. If you will please refer to the pamphlet in reference to this district, which accompanied my letter to you on matters dated July 7th last, No C.M.C., you will realize a few of the difficulties attending the prosecution of the work of building the schools on the Naas.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nMetlakatla, B.C.,\n\nMay 16th, 1911.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No 67340/5, dated 10th April, with reference to the remark contained in my letter to you on the subject of the lumber for the Schools on the Nass River, I have the honor to inform you that the sentence to which you refer in the same was/I regret, incomplete. To it should have been added \"in the event of the Indians being unable to turn out the lumber.\" I think this will be clearer to the Department.\n\nI would point out that the Indians here will not under any circumstances get out timber from the woods until they are certain that the money is in hand to pay them for their labor and for the lumber. This being so it was necessary to safeguard the Department against the possibility of the Indians not being able to supply the lumber through lack of ready payment, and the item for lumber was included by the arrangement referred to in the account of the firm supplying the other material.\n\nThe wisdom of this course is now proven by the fact that when on the river with Mr Green, Inspector of schools, I found that the Indians had not even cut down a tree to be turned into lumber at their sawmill, and the arrangement with Messrs Weight & Wiseman will find the lumber supplied and shipped at sawmill prices.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter received from the Rev. J.B. McCullagh, of Aiyansh, in which it is stated that the mail is under repair, and that the Indians...\nC. C. Perry Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla,\nB.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Wars schools\n\nIn regard to purchase of materials from Wars River sawmill, I may say that I received my order back again from Mr. McCullough of Anspach stating that the mill is out of action and no lumber will be obtainable for the erection of the schools.\n\nBut as I had previously guaranteed to supply the same I have obtained the lumber elsewhere and fitted it together with all materials necessary for the three Wars school, at Prince Rupert and I agreed to do.\n\nEverything is now in readiness to commence work as soon as the River is navigable.\n\nAs you will know the River rises in June & July owing to the snow melting on the mountains and becomes extremely dangerous, and the Canyon impassable especially with a loaded canoe.\n\nMAY 27 1911\nMETLAKATLA, B.C.\nSo it will be far better to wait until the end of July or August before attempting to go up with any material, and another thing, the natives will then be returning from the summaries and available with their canoes for the transportation of the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The tonnage included groceries, personal effects, furniture, books, and supplies ordered by the Inspector of Agencies, Mr. A.M. Tyson.\n\nConcerning the last item of this account, I beg to inform you that Mr. Phillipson was instructed to go to the Indian in whose care the school desks are which were purchased in 1911 for the Aiyansh school, and to get the desks from him with his account for storage to date. But because the Constable had not the money wherewith to meet the Indian's bill for storage, he was refused access to the desks and was obliged to have some desks made. I would inform you, however, that there will be need for these other desks when the proposed new school is open.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 2)\nWith reference to the personal request made to you by two of the Nass Indians, who were here today, for compensation for an Indian who is said to have conducted school at Aiyansh for short periods during the years 1913-14 and 1914-15 I beg to say that the Aiyansh School was closed at the end of the March quarter, 1911. No returns have been received since then until the December quarter, 1915.\n\nMr. Inspector Tyson in his report on the schools in the Nass Agency for the year 1914 states as follows:\n\n\"At Aiyansh and Gitladamicks conditions are very unsatisfactory. The new schools which were to be erected at these places have, as yet, not been built, owing to the fact that the Indians want industrial schools established in place of the ordinary day schools, and although part of the lumber and other materials have been provided for the new schools work has not been commenced.\" Again, when he visited the schools with the Royal Commission, in speaking of Aiyansh he states that \"Visited the 9th of October. School has been conducted here by an Indian named Mercer, who...\"\nwho receives a small remuneration from the Indian people. They are, however, very anxious to have a qualified teacher appointed and ask that if it is possible to have one sent in at once, arrangements will be made to secure a temporary school building.\"\n\nJudging by Mr. Tyson's report there was no school conducted during the year 1913-14, but you will see from his second report that an Indian named Mercer had been conducting a school there and received a small remuneration from the Indians. This Indian never received any authority to open the school from the Department and no returns were sent in and the Department had no knowledge of it until Mr. Tyson's report was received in November of last year. As the school was apparently not in operation no notice was taken of this report. The Department does not know how much the Indians paid Mr. Mercer, what benefit the children received from his teaching or how long he conducted the school and the only way to find out would be to obtain a report from Mr. Agent Perry.\n\nWe have no reports from either the Agent or the School Inspector regarding this school since it was closed. Rev. Mr. Green, late School Inspector, visited Aiyansh in May, 1912, in company with Agent Perry, and found the school closed and he recommended that it be not re-opened until there was a proper understanding with the Indians in regard\nregard to school matters and until the church authorities obtained a qualified and suitable teacher approved by the Department.\n\nNothing was done about re-opening the school until late last fall, when Miss Vera A. Chasteney was appointed teacher. The school was again opened at the end of December, last.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was thought advisable to send these teachers before the close of navigation, principally to meet a special request of the Indians. Of course, we should not pay the accounts without question if they are not in every way satisfactory.\n\nD. S. G. I.

Upon one or two occasions the Department has paid for fuel for the field matron, but such payments were inadvertently made. It is not usual for the Department to furnish either fuel or light for field matrons, and it is not proposed to do so in the case of Mrs. Phillipson. Kindly inform her to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter, No. 67340-7, dated October 19th, I have the honor to transmit herewith vouchers Nos. B-76 and 77, attached to which are hotel accounts, for the Misses Sturges and Capper, of Lak-kelzap, Nass River, and Miss L. Hays, Indian Day School teacher, Aiyansh, who were delayed en route to their stations on the Nass River.\n\nAccompanying these accounts is a report received from Miss Hays giving an account of the circumstances under which she was unable to proceed to her school.\n\nI have taken up the matter with the local steamship agent, who has informed me that his Company is in no way responsible for the accident to the steamer, and therefore cannot pay the account.\n\nI am personally of the opinion that these accounts should be paid by the Department, particularly in view of the fact that Miss Hays' appointment was somewhat irregular, having been made through a teachers' agency, instead of in the ordinary way.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir;\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMr. Perry,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter last night. I'm sorry there is any trouble about my stay in Prince Rupert. I had no wish to get off the boat (after sitting up until one o'clock in the morning) and go out into the black night in the pouring rain at Prince Rupert. But my last directions, when leaving Vancouver were, \"If Mr. and Mrs. Johnston do not meet the boat at Prince Rupert, get off and wait for them.\" That's what I did; there were many things I was not aware of one was, that every boat doesn't call at Mill Bay.\n\nI intended asking Mr. Cairns quite a number of questions the night I sailed from Vancouver, but he sent a message...\nsaying that he couldn't come. So I had to be satisfied with Mr. Douglas' answer. Then, to my dismay, I found out the next morning that Mr. and Mrs. Johnston had gone on to the Naas, and there was no chance of me getting there for another week.\n\nThen that boat came in to Prince Rupert late and had to return to Vancouver for repairs. And I had to waste more time in Prince Rupert.\n\nI admit that it was partly my fault, but we all make mistakes once in awhile.\n\nIf the department considers the disadvantage we must put up with, and the many unexpected expenses to living up there, on a very ordinary salary, it will pay my expenses at Prince Rupert.\n\nI am making the best of the\nSurrounding conditions, and think our school work will be a success if our supplies come in time. We are beginning to think about our Xmas. I entertainment, intend having a school concert and tree with mostly presents made by pupils at school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLydia Hayes.\n\nP.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, December 2, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on your Agency for the month of October, last, regarding the providing of a new building for day school purposes at Gitlakdamix, I have to say that the Department has no funds this year to provide any expense in connection with the getting out of logs and cutting the necessary lumber for this building. We can hold out no promise as to when funds for the purpose can be provided. In the meantime, the school work will have to be carried out under existing conditions. The need of a new building will be kept in mind and an effort will be made to obtain the funds necessary at the first opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Nov. 17th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit the following report for the month of October.\n\nDuring our stay at Gitlakdamix, I was fully occupied with interviews and sundry matters brought to my attention. An inspection of the day school was carried out by Capt. Barry. The pupils were medically examined and vaccinated by Dr. Macdonald who was also kept busy attending to the needs of sick Indians in the village.\n\nIn the evening of the 5th inst. accompanied by Capt. Barry, I attended a public meeting. Numerous matters were brought up for discussion. A strong request was made for the construction of a proper school building, and the appointment of a qualified teacher. School is held at present in a large room in the mission house, and is taught by the Rev. S. Kinley, Anglican Missionary at the village. The room is very unsuitable as a classroom, the light conditions being bad and accommodation quite inadequate when all the pupils attend.\n\nIf funds are available, I would strongly recommend that favorable consideration be given to the request of the Indians in this matter, and that the preparation of plans and specifications for an up-to-date building be authorized at the earliest possible time. I would point out that this is the only village in the agency without a school building.\n\nSome years ago, the Department provided a small sawmill for Gitlakdamix, and it was then understood that in the event of a school being constructed for the village, the lumber would be supplied without charge by the Indians. In view however, of present conditions and the fact that the Indians at Gitlakdamix are badly off this year, I would recommend that the building be put up as a relief undertaking at the charge of the department. I would further suggest should it be decided to provide the school, that the Indians be authorized to get logs and cut the necessary lumber this winter so that it may be well seasoned and ready for construction purposes next year.\n\nW.

S. Kinley, who is the teacher and also the missionary on the Reserve, occupies the balance of this house. Under these circumstances, it is considered that $10 a month is rather high rental.\n\nThe Department would be prepared to allow $5 a month and, if this is satisfactory, you may submit a voucher at the end of March for the amount due for January, February and March, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I believe it is the policy to pay a rental for such accommodation, in fact this is being done in other parts of the Diocese of Caledonia. I believe a fair rental would be ten dollars per month.\n\nI would be pleased if this matter could be taken up at your convenience.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to send me a favorable reply, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"G.A.

S. Kinley, that he had obtained a new desk for the school to replace the very dilapidated one formerly in use, at a cost of $15.00. I personally inspected the desk which was particularly well made, having two drawers and well varnished. The cost is much less than would have been paid for a similar piece of furniture obtained from Prince Rupert or Vancouver.

This village, with a school enrollment of about 37 children is the only village in the agency without a proper building.\n\nAt present, school is carried on in a room in the mission house which is not large enough, or suitable for the purpose.\n\nA sum of $3000.00 was placed in the 1934-35 Estimates, also in the 1935-36 Estimates increased to $4000.00, and I would strongly recommend that the Department authorize the construction of a suitable building at the earliest possible date.\n\nThere are other places in the agency where new schools are needed, but I consider a school for Gitlakdamix should receive first consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWEC JJ\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 26, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the need for the erection of a new school building for the Gitlakdamix Village, on the Upper Nass River.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that owing to the many demands for new buildings, repairs, and equipment at other schools, it was not found possible to provide the funds in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year to erect a new school at Gitlakdamix.\n\nThe Department is aware of the need for a new school building at this point.

The present teacher, Rev. S. Kinley is not a trained teacher, and whilst he does his best to instruct the children, the school is not making the progress it should, with the result that the Indians are dissatisfied, especially as they know other villages on the river have fully trained teachers in charge of the schools.\n\nI would strongly recommend, as I have done in previous reports, that a suitable school building be put up at the earliest opportunity, and that a fully trained teacher be appointed.\n\nA married man would be preferable, especially if his wife were a trained nurse capable of dispensing simple drugs, and attending to the needs of the sick in the village. Being cut off completely from the outside from November to April in each year on account of the winter freeze-up, the people of Gitlakdamix have a special plea in this regard, and the appointment of a nurse or field matron would go far in solving the problem of medical service for the Indians on the upper Nass.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I am therefore bringing the following matters directly to your attention.\n\nIn the village of Aiyansh or sometimes called Gitlakdamics, there never has been a building for an Indian Day School. A large room in the Mission House being used for this purpose. This is not as suitable as it should be, by any means; which fact is agreed to both by the Inspector of Indians Schools, the Church, and the natives themselves. The Indian Agent, Mr. W.E. Collison, agrees with this also. May I, therefore, urge your department to take this matter under advisement and I trust you will find it advisable to provide a good school for this somewhat important village in the near future.\n\nAsking for consideration of the above, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n30th June, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter No. 9E-11867 dated 18th June, received from Mr. Indian Agent Collison, with regard to the need for an Indian Day School building and teacher's residence at Gitikadamix, on the upper Nass.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with Inspector Barry, who states that he has strongly recommended in his reports on the present Gitikadamix Indian Day School during the past few years that a suitable school building with classroom accommodation for at least 40 children, and accommodation for a married teacher, should be erected at the earliest possible date. A teacher whose wife can dispense simple drugs and look after minor ailments would be of great advantage in this Village. The nearest Medical Officer is Dr. McDonald at Kincolith, and it is pointed out that during the winter months, boat travel is impossible as the river is blocked with ice.\n\nCapt. Barry is further of the opinion that little or no progress can be hoped for in the way of the education of the Indian children under the present conditions. The room in the Mission House now being used as a classroom is in many ways inadequate, but the real reason for the lack of progress in this Village is the fact that the teacher, Rev. S. Kinley, the local Missionary, is entirely untrained and unsuitable for the work he is attempting to do in the classroom.\n\nWhile Capt. Barry has on several occasions reported to the Department that he was not entirely satisfied with Mr. Kinley's work, and while the Department itself has suggested\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nto the Right Rev. G. Rix, Archbishop of the Diocese of Caledonia, Prince Rupert, that a change of teachers at this point would have to be made, the fact remains that, owing to the lack of a proper school building and residence for a married teacher, the actual employment of a new teacher is a most difficult matter to arrange. Inspector Barry is well aware of these facts and wishes to give any assistance he can to Mr. Hoey in the matter.\n\nI would recommend that, as the sum of $5,000.00 was placed in the Estimates for the present fiscal year, the Department authorize the construction of a suitable combined school and residence at the earliest possible date. I wish to draw the attention of the Department to the great difficulty which would be experienced in freighting lumber and material up the Nass River from Kincolith or Mill Bay, the nearest ports of call by Union Steamships, to Gitlakdamix. The distance between Kincolith and Gitlakdamix is almost 70 miles. Small shallow-draught river boats, which are the only ones that can go upstream, have to pass through three rapids on their way to Gitlakdamix.\n\nI am in agreement with Mr. Indian Agent Collison when he suggests that the common lumber and heavy framing required for the proposed school be sawn at the Indian Sawmill at Aiyansh, a mile or two below Gitlakdamix. If this is approved, it will be necessary to notify the Indians at an early date as they will have to obtain the necessary logs.\n\nIn conclusion, I may say that Inspector Barry considers the matter a most urgent one, and that while a building consisting of one large classroom, and accommodation for a married teacher asked for by the Indian Agent, is the present minimum, it would be far better when designing the school to allow for two good-sized classrooms, each capable of accommodating from 35 to 40 pupils. Even if the second classroom was not absolutely necessary during the first year, the Inspector points out that the room could be made use of for Vocational instruction, and further suggests that as at\npresent there are a number of children attending the Indian Residential Schools at Alert Bay and Cqumloetza who, in the event of the erection of a suitable school at Gitlakdamix, could be accommodated in their home Village, at great saving to the Department in the matter of per capita fees. The enlarged Day School would be from a financial point of view, the better investment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in which you point out the necessity of erecting a combined school and teacher's residence at Gitlakdamix on the upper Nass river.\n\nAs no provision was made in our current year's appropriation for a new school at this point, I therefore regret that at the present time it is not possible to favourably consider your recommendation.\n\nHowever, we are making a special note of your suggestion and will endeavour to secure the necessary funds in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nMajor D.

Collison,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nA Petition\n\nWe the Council, parents and people of the Gitlakadimc Band humbly petition the Government of Canada through the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources to establish an Indian Day School in our Village.\n\nWe ask for a modern school building to accommodate at least fifty children with a teacher's residence attached. We wish to have a trained teacher who has been at normal school in British Columbia and has a certificate in the province. If possible we should like a married man whose wife is a trained nurse who could look after the health of the village, particularly of the women and children, the nearest doctor being at Prince Rupert 47 miles away.\n\nWe have a small Sawmill established with the help of the Department.\nof Indian Affairs a number of years ago. Since we can cut logs and thus obtain most of the lumber for our school which would cost more if built of lumber bought in from the coast, river freight costing some $30 or $40 per thousand feet. We have heard that such a school as we ask for has been recommended for several years by our Indian Agent and Inspector of Schools but that the Government of Canada could not give us a school as they were no funds for this purpose.\n\nWe have also heard that new Indian Day Schools have been built at a number of other places during the last few years. We therefore respectfully urge that we be given a suitable day school so that our children need no longer be sent hundreds of miles away.\nto residential school at Alert Bay and Coghataetga. We have 53 children of school age in the village. Copies of this petition have been sent to the Honorable Minister of Mines and Resources.\n\nAlof Hanson, Esq., M.P.,\nMajor D.M.

Mac Millan\nSamuel MacMillan\nJohn MacMillan\nJoshua Morrison\nJohn Brown\nStanley Adams\nReggie MacMillan\nAdam McKay\nMarch 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of February 10th regarding the proposed Indian Day School at Gitlakdamix.\n\nThis matter has been further reviewed with Inspector Barry, a copy of whose report is enclosed herewith. I have also discussed the probable costs of such a school with Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water and Power Bureau.\n\nThe school at Gitlakdamix should be along the lines of the Bella Bella Indian Day School, now in course of construction, but could be somewhat smaller. I understand the contract price of the Bella Bella Day School was $7,907. Some $1400 of this amount was provided for electric lighting and cement work.\n\nHaving these costs in mind, I doubt if we could build the same school at Gitlakdamix, with cement foundation and full basement, for $6400. I feel, however, that the building should rest on cement pillars, instead of cedar posts as suggested, or on heavy cedar posts resting on foundational cement blocks. Capt. Barry has informed me that a suitable dry sloping site is available. The use of such a site would reduce excavation costs considerably and would provide the space required for a heating plant. In such a site the length of the foundation pillars, either cement or wood, would of course be governed by the slope of the ground. The building should be heated by a good wood-burning furnace and the warm air conveyed to the various rooms of the building by asbestos covered pipes. The fire box of such a furnace should be sufficiently large to take 4-foot lengths of wood.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nA cement foundation with full basement, similar to the Bella Bella School, is of course very desirable, but I feel it is out of the question considering $6400 to be the maximum available. I should say, however, that we could build a two-room school at Gitlakdamix along the plan of the Bella Bella School utilizing to the fullest extent the lumber produced by the local Indian sawmill for $6000, leaving $400 to go towards the costs of equipment. As the Indians are very much interested in the provision of a suitable school for their children, we could count on their wholehearted co-operation, both in the production of such lumber as could be sawn at the local mill and the provision of the necessary Indian labor. It might also be possible to secure a reasonable reduction in river transportation rates on the building materials brought in from outside.\n\nUntil it will be necessary to provide a separate room for vocational training, provision for which could eventually be made in the basement, the second classroom should be used for this purpose, as the proposed school would have accommodation for about 70 pupils and the most that would be available to attend during the first two years of the school's life would not likely exceed 50.\n\nI am inclined to agree with the Agent's suggestion that the school be built by Indian labor under the supervision of an experienced and responsible white carpenter-builder. I should like to suggest that the Architect's Branch provide a rough draft plan of the school along the lines suggested and forward same here for examination and the views of Capt. Barry and myself before the final plan is agreed upon. The suggestion of Mr. Indian Agent Collison regarding making early arrangements for the production of the rough lumber required, so that the Indians can proceed to get out the necessary logs, is approved.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O.Box 444  \nVancouver, B.C.  \nFebruary 21, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nP.O.Box 70,  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:-\n\nWith reference to the proposed Indian Day School at Gitlakdamix on the Nass River, Skeena River Agency, which you have asked me to briefly report on, I may say that the provision of a cement basement is in my opinion out of the question, no matter how advantageous. The cost of transporting materials up the Nass River through three rapids makes it necessary to use as far as possible the lumber which can be prepared in the local Indian saw mill.\n\nI agree with your observations as contained in the last paragraph of your letter 15/8/4048 of June 30th 1938 addressed to the Department. The provision of two good sized classrooms would be a great advantage. One of these could at first be mainly used for Vocational Work and Arts and Crafts. It would not be long before it was required as a classroom when the local Indians understand how much a trained teacher can do for their children.\n\nWhile provision should be made for a married teacher it might be well to have at least one extra bedroom for an assistant teacher, for I feel certain that two teachers will be required within the first three years of the school's life. Mr Hoey is of course quite correct in his opinion that 50 pupils are too many for one teacher. In B.C. we try to have a second teacher when the attendance is over 35 and certainly when over 40.\n\nA school with the above accommodation and in addition a small room for the usual \"Drugs\" which could be used as a dispensary, if placed on cedar post foundations leaving room in the basement for a simple Manual Training Shop lined with shiplap lumber, should not cost more in my opinion than around $5,000.00 leaving the balance available for the complete furnishing of the two classrooms with desks blackboards etc.\n\nI do not agree with Indian Agent Collison that the plan used at Kitselas should be followed. You have I believe a plan of a good two room Provincial Day School prepared by the Provincial Architect, while the Department has lately erected two schools of the type required, one at Port Simpson and one at Bella Bella.\nI agree with Mr Collison that the order for all rough lumber should be placed with the local Indians at as early a date as possible. These Indians will have to get the necessary logs to their saw mill.\n\nWhile the building of schools by contract is as a rule the best method, the peculiar circumstances of this village may incline the Department to follow the Indian Agent's advice. While many of the Indians build quite well there would of course be the need for a responsible \"white\" carpenter builder, who could supervise and take part in the erection and remain at Gitlakdamix till the school was completed and painted. I know nothing of the man suggested by Mr Collison.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 an amount of $6400.00 was provided for a new school at Gitlakdamix.\n\nRecently Indian Agent Collison was written for the information which is required by the Surveys & Engineering Branch before plans can be prepared. For your information I enclose a copy of his reply. I should appreciate receiving any comments that you care to make in connection with the Agent's letter. I might add that I have also read your letter of June 30 last in connection with the erection of a school at this point.\n\nIs it possible for you to let me have an estimate of the probable cost of erecting a school at Gitlakdamix? As noted above the amount of $6400.00 is provided and under no circumstances does the Department wish this amount exceeded.\n\nWe would prefer to place a cement basement under the building and use the basement for vocational training purposes. Owing to the high freight rates it would appear that Indian Agent Collison does not consider this advisable. What is your opinion of the matter? If a basement cannot be provided possibly it would be preferable to build a two-roomed school. I do not favour a classroom large enough to accommodate 50 pupils as this number is really too large for one teacher to handle.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Jan. 10th 168-32A-5 enclosing building data form relative to the construction of the proposed day school building at Gitlakdamix on the upper Nass river.\n\nAs you may already be aware, the Indian village of Gitlakdamix is situated about 67 miles distant up the Nass river from Mill Bay Cannery which is the nearest point of steamer call. From this point freight is transported up river by Indian motor boats. The usual charge for river freight is $1.50 per lb. and for lumber from $25. to $30. per thousand feet.\n\nSome years ago, the Department supplied the Gitlakdamix Indians with a small sawmill with a capacity of 3,000 feet per day. This mill cuts for local needs when required. From this it will be seen that the cost of transporting lumber and material from the Coast to Gitlakdamix reserve will be a heavy item in connection with the construction of the proposed school.\n\nI would suggest if possible, all rough lumber and heavy framing might be cut at the local sawmill leaving the hardwood flooring and other dressed lumber to be shipped from the coast.\n\nThe Indians have a small planer in connection with the mill and might be able to supply the shiplap lumber required for the building, but not the siding.\n\nIn order to make this possible, it will be necessary to place the order for lumber required with the mill at Gitlakdamix at the earliest opportunity, giving quantities, dimensions etc., so that the Indians may have ample time to get out the logs and proceed with sawing, particularly as the lumber should be dried before it is\nused on the work.\n\nWith a few minor changes including increased classroom accommodation for 50 pupils, I would suggest that the plan of the Kitselas day school and teacher's residence might be suitable for Gitlakdamix. The cost of river freighting being so high, I would also recommend that a cedar post foundation be put in instead of cement.\n\nDue to the location and conditions of transportation, building by contract will probably be very expensive, and I would suggest that the work be carried out by day labor under the supervision of a responsible builder who should remain on the ground until the work is completed. In this connection I would suggest that the work be placed in the hands of Mr. J.R. Mitchell of Prince Rupert who has had considerable experience in the construction of day schools for the Department at Massett and Kitselas.\n\nIt would be advisable to employ Indians of the village, many of whom have a working knowledge of carpentry. This would give needed employment.\n\nOwing to the distance and expense of travel, it will be impossible for me to give frequent supervision to the work as I was able to in the case of the Kitselas day school.\n\nThe data required by the Department has been supplied as far as possible in the form attached.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclos.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mitchell, during the construction of the new school.\n\nWhen the Kitselas Indian school was built in 1937, the foreman was paid $7\u00bd per hour. At the Bella Coola school $6\u00bd per hour was paid, and the Department stated that the foreman's wages were not to exceed $1.00 per hour.\n\nMr. Mitchell has asked for $1.25 per hour or $10.00 per day. He claims that he has always been paid this amount for similar work. Taking into consideration the out-of-the-way conditions of the place etc., I would recommend that Mr. Mitchell be allowed $10.00 per working day.\n\nI have been up the Nass River and made arrangements with the manager of the Mill Bay Cannery for storage space for the material which will be delivered there by the fortnightly steamer on July 24th. I have also contacted several Indians who would transport the material up the river beginning July 28th. I will be at Mill Bay on this date and will then go on to Gitlakdamix taking Mr. Mitchell as well.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver B.C.\n\nJ.

R. Mitchell, of Prince Rupert.\nIndian labour will be employed. The lumber will be\nsecured from a sawmill owned and operated by the\nGitlakdamix Indians. In this way the heavy expense\nof having lumber shipped from Vancouver will be\navoided.\n\nMajor MacKay, in a letter dated May 26, is\nanxious to secure the authority necessary to permit\nhim to purchase for the erection of this school any\nadditional supplies that may be necessary, such as\nwindow frames, hinges, etc. Major MacKay is anxious\nto proceed with the construction at the earliest\npossible date, and I should appreciate a decision\nfrom you with respect to the additional purchases.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nOttawa, May 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Construction of G\u00eelakdamix School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 26th instant, in which you intimate that the extra costs involved in making certain necessary changes at the above noted school will amount to approximately $500.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, it has been decided to allow this additional amount.\n\nI am today communicating with the Minister's Office in respect to the authority necessary for you to purchase the supplies required for the construction of the school. Just as soon as this authority is secured, I shall communicate with you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe File 168-32A-5.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 27th and subsequent correspondence in the matter of the erection of a new Day School at Gitlakdamix, Skeena River Agency. Plans have been drawn by Mr. Mitchell, the carpenter-foreman engaged, along the lines of the Port Simpson Day School but somewhat smaller and with a few changes in order to bring the costs within the amount authorized, $6,000.00. Provision has been made for two classrooms, each to accommodate 32 pupils, which should be ample for some years to come.\n\nInstead of cement piers, substantial cedar posts on cement blocks will be put in for the foundation. The present plan provides for one bedroom only, but as two teachers will undoubtedly be required, I have instructed the Agent to make provision for a second bedroom in the attic. Inspector Barry examined the plans in Prince Rupert recently and telegraphed recommending a second bedroom and additional excavation to provide for a Manual Training room in the basement.\n\nIn view of the likelihood that Coqualeetza will be discontinued as a Residential School and the necessity of providing additional Day School accommodation, I consider the additions suggested at Gitlakdamix should be provided. It is not considered that the extra costs involved in making the above-mentioned changes should exceed $500.00, which, if approved, would bring the total estimate up to $6,500.00. The Agent has been given very definite instructions with respect to the necessity of keeping within the amount provided. I should appreciate being advised at the earliest possible date if construction may proceed allowing for the additional accommodation herein above referred to.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn ...\nIn the matter of the purchase of materials where the amount involved is in excess of $50.00, should tenders be submitted to Ottawa for approval before the Purchase Order is placed or may I place Purchase Orders up to $500.00 on tenders received here without reference to the Department? I should like to be very clear on this point before any purchase is made. It is presumed that for lumber supplied by Indians payment can be made from the cash advance of $2,000.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n5th May, 19\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Indian Day Schools,\nGetladamix.\n\nI am forwarding copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer in which you will note that he does not consider the plans for the Bella Bella School suitable for the Getladamix School on account of the difference of site conditions but considers that the plan for the Maria Indian Reserve school would be more satisfactory. Copies of the plans can be supplied if desired.\n\nYou will note also what Mr. Mills has to say in connection with the erection of schools by Indian Agents in regard to provision for drainage and toilets.\n\nDirector.\nMay 2, 1939.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Wardle\n\nRe: Indian Day Schools.\n\nWith regard to your memorandum of the 18th ultimo, regarding the above, it is noted that the Indian Affairs Branch proposed to use the plans of the Bella Bella school for the building at Getladamix, Saskatchewan. As the Bella Bella plans were prepared for particular site conditions, namely, solid rock at two feet below grade, it is felt that these plans would not suit the site conditions at Getladamix. Plans of a similar building with normal depth foundation walls have been prepared for the Merla Indian Reserve school, and it is felt that these plans would be more applicable to building conditions in Saskatchewan. Copies of these plans will be provided for use of the Indian Affairs Branch, if so desired.\n\nIn connection with the erection of Indian Schools by Indian Agents, where authority is granted to carry on construction without plans, or where plans of other schools are used without reference to this Service, it is felt that in all cases 4\" weeping tile drains should be laid around the building at the level of the wall footings. This drain should be graded at a run some distance from the building as a precaution against water infiltration through the basement walls or floor.\n\nIt is also considered advisable that in all schools erected under the same conditions that toilet accommodation should be provided for teachers, separate from that assigned to the pupils.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

An accountable cheque for wages and the purchase of the lumber amounting to $2000.00 is being forwarded to you and if further funds are required please let me know.\n\nNo doubt it is your intention to proceed with the purchase of the other materials that may be required.

Indian Commissioner Mackay recommends that the work be carried out by day labour employing Indians under the supervision of a competent carpenter-foreman. In this connection Commissioner Mackay mentions the name of Mr. J. R. Mitchell of Prince Rupert who has had considerable experience in the erection of schools in this vicinity.\n\nThe Citlakdamix Indians have a small saw mill and all the rough lumber and heavy framing required could be cut at this saw mill and thus avoid the heavy expense of having it shipped from Vancouver.\nCommissioner Mackay considers that the school can be erected by day labour in charge of a competent carpenter-foreman for an amount not exceeding $6000.00 which would leave $400.00 to provide necessary equipment for the building.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Honourable the Minister would concur in the Commissioner's recommendation and in that event please let me know the name and address of the person who is to be employed as carpenter-foreman.\n\nDirector.\n\nDr. Macmillan\n\nMinister approves of the construction of this school\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th inst. and would confirm my telegram or even date, as follows:\n\n\"Reference your letter eighth instant one six eight dash thirty two dash one received today (stop) Letter forwarded to Department January twenty eighth with information regarding proposed school Gitlakdamix see also Aiyansh.\"\n\nAs stated in the telegram, my reply on the 25th Jan. to official letter 168-22-A of Jan. 10th was forwarded together with data requested by the Department.\n\nIt is just possible that the names \"Gitlakdamix\" and \"Aiyansh\" have caused some confusion, as Gitlakdamix is the name of the Indian village and school; and Aiyansh 1\u00bd miles distant, is the post office address. Frequently mail for Gitlakdamix is addressed to Aiyansh.\n\nIn case the letter has been mislaid, I am enclosing copies of same and building date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nPrince Rupert B.C.\nJan. 28th 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Jan. 10th 169-32A-5 enclosing Building Data form relative to the construction of the proposed day school building at Gitlakdamix on the upper Nass river.\n\nAs you may already be aware, the Indian village of Gitlakdamix is situated about 67 miles distant up the Nass river from Mill Bay Cannery which is the nearest port of steamer call. From this point freight is transported up river by Indian motor boats. The usual charge for river freight is $1\u00bd per lb. and for lumber from $25. to $30. per thousand feet.\n\nSome years ago, the Department supplied the Gitlakdamix Indians with a small sawmill with a capacity of 5,000 feet per day. This mill cuts for local needs when required. From this it will be seen that the cost of transporting lumber and material from the Coast to Gitlakdamix reserve will be a heavy item in connection with the construction of the proposed school. I would suggest if possible, all rough lumber and heavy framing might be cut at the local sawmill leaving the hardwood flooring and other dressed lumber to be shipped from the coast.\n\nThe Indians have a small planer in connection with the mill and might be able to supply the shiplap lumber required for the building, but not the siding.\n\nIn order to make this possible, it will be necessary to place the order for lumber required with the mill at Gitlakdamix at the earliest opportunity, giving quantities, dimensions etc., so that the Indians may have ample time to get out the logs and proceed with sawing, particularly as the lumber should be dried before it is\nused on the work.\n\nWith a few minor changes including increased classroom accommodation for 50 pupils, I would suggest that the plan of the Kitselas day school and teacher's residence might be suitable for Gitlakdamsx. The cost of river freighting being so high, I would also recommend that a cedar post foundation be put in instead of cement.\n\nDue to the location and conditions of transportation, building by contract will probably be very expensive, and I would suggest that the work be carried out by day labor under the supervision of a responsible builder who should remain on the ground until the work is completed. In this connection I would suggest that the work be placed in the hands of Mr. J.R. Mitchell of Prince Rupert who has had considerable experience in the construction of day schools for the Department at Massett and Kitselas.\n\nIt would be advisable to employ Indians of the village, many of whom have a working knowledge of carpentry. This would give needed employment.\n\nOwing to the distance and expense of travel, it will be impossible for me to give frequent supervision to the work as I was able to in the case of the Kitselas day school.\n\nThe data required by the Department has been supplied as far as possible in the form attached.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nW.E. Collison\nIndian Agent\nBuilding Data relating to construction of proposed new day school at Glikadamix on the upper Nass, Aiyansh P. Office\n\nCopy of copy or form ........\n\n(Day Labour recommended)\n\n1. Several Indians with working knowledge of carpentry available, also common labor.\n\nOne storey frame building. Classroom to accommodate 50 pupils.\n\nStandard Equipment: combined washroom and cloakroom.\n\nTeacher's residence including living room, bedroom, kitchen and storeroom. Attic space for extra storage purposes.\n\nSchool and residence properly protected from intense cold in winter. Suggest cedar posts instead of cement for foundation, half basement for furnace accommodation.\n\n2. Level ground; soil sandy loam, no rock. If basement provided, drain age with 4 inch tile pipe, sketch of village site attached.\n\n3. Water obtained from wells. Water tank should be provided for fire protection.\n4. Outside toilets (Pits) for school and residence.\n\n5. Hot air furnace. Wood fuel\n\n6. Oil lamps recommended. Small electric lighting plant in village not dependable.\n\n7. Usual school standard equipment. Book cupboard also etc. Blackboard space to be determined when plan of classroom available.\n\n8. Nearest shipping point Mill Bay Cannery at mouth of Nass river. Distance Mill Bay to Gitiakdamix approximately 67 miles. River transportation Mill Bay to Gitiakdamix by Indian motor boats. Recommend tenders be invited for river freighting.\n\nOwing to location, distance and conditions or river transportation construction by contract will probably cost more. Recommend work be carried out by day labor under supervision of capable foreman builder undertaking all responsibility and authorized to employ Indian labor, and services of one white carpenter if necessary.\n\nIndian Agent W.S.

I returned the account, advising the Agent that I was not prepared to recommend payment as no authority had been issued from this Office covering the expenditure and, in any case, the charge was excessive. At the same time I informed Mr. Gillett that, under the circumstances, I was prepared to recommend that an amount of $50.00 be paid for the services rendered by Mitchell & Currie for the preparation of the plans, etc., as this was quite as much as I considered the work was worth. The Contractors were evidently willing to reduce their fee, as I am now in receipt of an amended voucher from the Agent covering their account for $50.00.\n\nThere is on deposit in the B.C. Indian Trust Account a balance of $75.25 from the cash advance in connection with the Gitlakdamix School construction, from which Mitchell & Currie's account could be paid if it would be in order to do so.\n\nI should appreciate your instructions at an early date in this respect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOctober 23rd, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of October 19th with enclosed Voucher 9738 covering account of Mitchell and Currie, Contractors, for preparation of plans, blue prints and specifications in connection with the construction of the new school at Gitlakdamix.\n\nIn this connection I beg to advise that Mr. Collison was not authorized by this Department to employ the firm of Mitchell and Currie to prepare plans and specifications. It was expected that whatever plans were necessary would be based on the plans of the Bella Bella Day School and those of Port Simpson and Kitselas which were made available to the Agent. Mr. Collison was asked to consult Mr. Mitchell, who was to be employed as foreman carpenter, vide my letter of April 12, file 15/8/8802, regarding the plan of the building.\n\nIt is recognized that plans and specifications were necessary, but a builder usually supplies such information when he tenders or is employed on proposed construction without cost to the Department. Quotations are being asked for from day to day by this office which frequently necessitate plans and specifications which require considerable time and preparation but I can recall no instance where the Department has been called upon to pay for such work. As you know, $6500 was provided for the Gitlakdamix School with instructions that under no circumstances was this amount to be exceeded. From the returns received, the actual cost is somewhere in the neighborhood of $6425, leaving a balance of $75 of the appropriation unexpended.\n\nAny draughtsman could prepare the rough plans supplied in this case in a matter of three days at the most and the blue prints should not have cost more than $3.00 per set. The most I would be prepared to do in the matter is to recommend that the Department favorably consider providing a sum not exceeding $50.00 for the plans and specifications provided. You might therefore discuss the matter with Messrs. Mitchell and Currie, and if this arrangement would be acceptable to them, to have the accounts and vouchers amended accordingly, and please submit same to this office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"D.M. MacKay.\"\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI submit herewith, for the Department's consideration, No. No. 9728, amounting to $125.00 in favor of Mitchell & Currie, contractors, Prince Rupert, for preparing plans and estimates in connection with Gitlakdamix new school.\n\nWhile the Department authorized Mr. Collison to secure Mr. Mitchell to draw up the plans, no agreement as to cost was made.\n\nI recommend that the Department pay Mr. Mitchell what is considered fair and just.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.G. Gillett, Indian Agent\n\nMajor B.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Credit Vouchers Nos. 9594, 9694 and 9737, of the Skeena River Agency, for labour and material in building the new Gitlakdamix Indian Day School. These three Vouchers, amounting to $3,724.75 should be made a charge against the advance of $3,800.00 forwarded to me for the building of this School.\n\nReceipts - Form No. 531 - for payments other than wages are attached, except Receipts for Cheques Nos. 10198 and 10200 on Voucher No. 9594, which the Indian Agent states have been forwarded direct to the Department with his August cash book return.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith the balance ($25.25) cheque No.33930 of cash advance received for labour, etc., in connection with the construction of the new school at Gitlakdamix.\n\nThe building is a 38' x 55' frame structure, with two class rooms and teachers' residence. The basement was subdivided to provide a furnace and fuel room and a manual training room.\n\nThe school was built within the estimate provided ($6500) and Mr. Gillett has reported that the materials supplied were good and all the work in connection with the construction of the building and the installation of the heating unit was well done.\n\nFrom reports received I should say that the new school at Gitlakdamix compares very favorably with other schools with similar accommodation constructed for the Department in the past two years.\n\nWhen the Inspector of Indian Agencies visits the Skeena River Agency, he will arrange to visit this school and make a report. The enclosed snapshot was received from Mr. Gillett and is forwarded herewith together with a copy of his letter of October 19th.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

(RG 10, Volume 6390, File 810-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 168-32A-5.\n\nI have received from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett a list of furnishings required for the teacher's quarters of the new school at Gitlakdamix. The equipment asked for is similar to that supplied for the residence section of the new school at Bella Bella and will cost approximately two hundred and twenty-five (225) dollars f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nA second teacher has not been thus far secured for Gitlakdamix, and Bishop Rix informed me yesterday that he is continuing to make inquiries for a suitable teacher but at the moment had no one whom he could nominate.\n\nI may say that every effort is being made to secure qualified teachers for the existing vacancies in our Indian Schools, all of which happen to be in the Diocese of Caledonia. The Provincial Department of Education has been asked to assist but owing to the scarcity of fully qualified teachers the province is faced with a similar problem to our own and is not at present, at least, in a position to help.\n\nReverting to the requisition referred to for furnishings for the teachers' residence, I should appreciate being advised if the Department intends to provide these, and if so, I should like to have your instructions as to purchase.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 13, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 10th ultimo with reference to the furnishings required for the teacher's quarters at the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School.\n\nAs yet we have not received any nomination for a second teacher for this school and I presume that the present teacher, Rev. S. Kinley, is residing in the Missionary's residence and not in the school. If this is correct there is no immediate need for furnishings.\n\nOur funds at the present time are practically all assigned and consequently it is not possible to consider paying for new furnishings for this school. However, if you consider that the teacher's quarters should be furnished either now or at any time within the next month or so you may do so provided you can arrange with the firms supplying the goods to wait for payment of same until our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 is available. In the event of your deciding to make purchase of these furnishings it is understood that the cost will not exceed $225.00 f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 168-32A-5.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of February 13 regarding furnishings for the teacher's quarters of the new Indian Day School at Gitlakdamix.\n\nI may say that it is hoped to obtain a married teacher for this school for the academic year 1940-41, whose wife might look after the health work among the Indians of the local village, but as there are few if any qualified teachers available in British Columbia at the present time and that it is now too late to send a teacher to Gitlakdamix before the end of the current school year, it is not considered necessary to provide furnishings for the teacher's residence until early in the new fiscal year or prior to the opening of the school year in September, next.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 25, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of June 5 you enclosed Inspector Barry's report on his inspection of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School and it is noted that he again recommends that the services of the teacher terminate on the 30th instant.\n\nIn your covering letter you make no special reference to the Inspector's recommendation but from the information contained in your letters of January 10 and February 19 it is evident that you have been in communication with Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix with a view to securing properly qualified teachers to take charge of this school during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nI should appreciate your advising me as soon as you can conveniently do so what the prospects are for obtaining new teachers as it is apparent from the Inspector's report that Mr. Kinley's services are not very satisfactory.\n\nIt is also noted from the Inspector's report that he suggests that this school operate on a seven-month basis only; namely, from October 1 to April 30. This recommendation meets with our approval.\n\nIn the event of new teachers being obtained I would refer you to the last paragraph of official letter of February 13 last authorizing an expenditure for the purchase of furnishings for the teacher's quarters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

This authority was renewed in the last paragraph of departmental letter of June 25, 1940. It is desirable that the furnishings should be purchased by you and supplied at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

After heavy rains, the floor is covered with water varying in depth from a few inches to a foot.\n\nThe basement, which contains the furnace and is used as a store room for the wood, measures 38'x16'x8'. It has a cement floor and board walls which are leaking. It will be necessary to have the walls only one foot above the surrounding ground. A diagram is attached, giving the dimensions of each wall. The total measurement for an 8\" wall is 14 cubic yards. The materials required are listed on form 37, which is attached herewith, showing the cost of same, together with a tender from McGaffery's for cement. The lumber can be purchased from the Aiyansh saw mill and the hardware from Gordon's Hardware at Prince Rupert. The approximate cost will be $475.00, which is much less than the amount shown in the estimates. Mr. Mitchell, the builder of the school figured on a cement wall completely around the school, whereas I consider it necessary to enclose only that portion which is used for the furnace and store room, the remainder of it is not excavated. Indian labor will be available about September 15th. As it should not take any more than one week to complete the job I would go to Gitlakdamix and stay until it was finished, as it is not possible to secure a white foreman. If the Department approves of the above I would recommend that an advance cheque for $250.00 be forwarded here, so that I may pay for the labor.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSeptember 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo requesting authority to expend $475.00 for the construction of a concrete basement for the Gitlakdamix School in order to prevent it from being flooded by heavy rains.\n\nIn reply I would advise that after discussion of this matter with Mr. Inspector Barry, the item was deleted from your estimates for the current fiscal year. Mr. Inspector Coleman informs me that when he visited the school he found there was a tendency for the ground at the rear of the school to drain towards the building and bring about the condition complained of but that he discussed with you the matter of constructing a drain behind the school to carry away this water to some low ground or a small creek to one side of the building. It appears to me that if this could be done and it would remedy the situation, that it would be far less expensive than the work which you proposed to undertake. It would be appreciated if you would advise me if any attempt was made to construct the drain in question.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\n(COPY)\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gitlakdamix School\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd inst., I beg to say that the ditch back of the school was cleared and deepened and it improved the situation as far as preventing water from going through the basement wall was concerned, and we had thought this was the only source of the trouble. The winter of 1941 Mr. Henderson discovered that the chief source of the flooding was through the front wall of the basement. I also verified this in October last.\n\nIt is possible that the down pipe on the eave trough which enters the drain pipe near the front wall of the basement is the cause of the trouble. If it is this could be remedied by having another outlet from the drain near the down pipe to the back ditch. This would mean running a ditch approximately 75 feet long, varying in depth from 2 to 6 feet. I think it would also be necessary to place a board drain in the ditch approximately 6 inches x 4 inches, and it may also be advisable when we have the ditch open near the school to put an extra lining of boards on the outside wall of the basement, arranging them so they would cover up the seams in the present wall.\n\nIt will require approximately 300 feet of rough lumber 1x12, 1x6 and 1x4. The approximate cost of the lumber would be $9.00, and it could be purchased at the Aiyansh sawmill. The labor would cost approximately $25.00 for this job. Nails and incidentals would amount to about $6.00.\n\nI will delay my trip to Aiyansh until I receive word whether or not this work can be done.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nJG/dce.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's requisition of August 14th for authority to expend $475.65 for the construction of a concrete basement for the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School, together with copy of my reply of the 3rd instant and Mr. Gillett's further letter of the 11th instant, from which it will be observed that he considers that an expenditure of $59.00 for labour and material will provide sufficient drainage to keep the school basement dry.\n\nIf funds can be provided for the purpose, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI received a wire and a letter from Miss Brunton, teacher at Aiyansh, in which she asks for the articles listed on Form 37.\n\nWe cannot purchase the grate and deck chair in Prince Rupert. The bureau and other material can be purchased locally for the prices that are listed. I recommend that all the article be purchased with the exception of the paint which she requires for the ceiling in the schoolroom, to give better light reflection. The ceiling is now oiled. I think this matter could be left until next year when I visit the school and make an investigation and an estimate of the labour. I would recommend that she be supplied with a gas lamp for the schoolroom.\n\nI consider the bedroom bureau necessary as she claims that she has no place to keep her clothes. Unfortunately, there was none supplied with the original list of furnishings.\n\nThe deck chair he wishes is to be used as an easy chair. She states that the bottom is broken on the wicker chair which was supplied with the original furniture order. I will see if this can be repaired. It is not a comfortable chair, however, and I notice that Miss Brunton has a deformed back. It may be possible that the deck chair would be more comfortable for her.\n\nI would suggest that the grate and deck chair be shipped care of us as we may be able to contact some party going up to Aiyansh. The next boat connecting with Aiyansh mail service will not be going up until the middle of December.\n\nJ.

I would suggest that we put up what might be called a porch roof, so ice coming off the roof would strike the porch roof and slide down each side of same, rather than come direct on the veranda as it does now.\n\nJG/K\n\nIndian Agent.\n| QUANTITY | Purpose for which required | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|----------------------------|------------|-------|\n|          | Repairs to school.         |            |       |\n| 5        | 36\" cream blinds           | $1.10      | $5.50 |\n| 100 ft.  | BM Shiplap                 | $57.00     | $5.70 |\n| 40       | 2x4                        | $60.00     | $2.40 |\n| 60       | 4x4                        | $60.00     | $3.60 |\n| 1 lb.    | Shingle nails              | $1.12      | $.12  |\n| 2        | 2\u00bd\" nails                  | $1.12      | $.24  |\n| 2 bundles| Shingles                   | $7.30      | $3.65 |\n|          | Labour                     | $10.00     | $7.00 |\n|          | Freight by steamship and river boat | | |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

The standard rate for all freight on this river is 1\u00bd\u00a2 per pound. The item for 75\u00a2 is for delivery at Aiyansh from the dock to the school. It is impossible to obtain freight receipts from Indians as they have no letterheads, neither are they licensed to carry freight. These supplies are taken up as a convenience to the Department by the Indians and their rates are really very reasonable.

Anfield's letter of December 13th that the teacher at the above mentioned school incurred an expenditure of $30.00 for repairs to and tuning of the piano, apparently not aware that authority should be secured for such expenditures.\n\nUnder the circumstances and inasmuch as Mr. Anfield has advised Mr. Shaffer, the teacher, of the procedure to be followed in such matters I would recommend that the cost be met from appropriation.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nApplication is made for authority to spend $30.00 on repairs and tuning of the piano bought by the Department for the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School. This machine is completely out of tune and requires the following replacements:\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| Damper felt springs and flanges | 8        | $4.00      | $32.00  |\n| Jack springs @ 50\u00a2             | 10       | $5.00      | $50.00  |\n| Key felts @ 50\u00a2                | 6        | $3.00      | $18.00  |\n| Key bushings @ 1.00            | 2        | $2.00      | $4.00   |\n| Action flange @ 1.00           | 1        | $1.00      | $1.00   |\n| Tuning machine, complete       | 1        | $15.00     | $15.00  |\n\nTo be perfectly frank this job has been completed already. A Mr. Hancock, piano tuner who was in the Naas River country in November cleaned up all the pianos in Aiyansh. Mr. Shaffer, the teacher, not knowing that these things had to be authorized by the Department, instructed him to repair and tune the school piano. I have written to Mr. Shaffer stating that there is no guarantee that the Department will meet this account and that in future he is not to incur any expenditures of this nature without authority from the Department.\n\nHaving in mind that the piano was in dire need of tuning and repair, I would recommend that if possible the account be met and the work authorized.\n\nF.

Indian Day School\nPost Office (nearest): Prince Rupert\nProvince: British Columbia\n\nI hereby certify that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\nAt Atyansh last week-end, I made a careful check of seating capacity at the Day School. There are only enough desks in this school to accommodate one room. They are mostly double desks which were moved from the Mission House when the new school was built. They are, however, adequate for a year or two for the senior room.\n\nAttached please find requisition for primary tables and chairs for the junior room. It is considered that the purchase of these is essential for this junior room. Present indications are that 34 children will be in the junior room this fall when they all get back from the canneries and about 31 in the senior room.\n\nIt is recommended that these primary tables and chairs be purchased and shipped to this office from where we will make arrangements to have them moved up to Atyansh.\n\nF. Earl Amfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nJune 15, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Gitlakdamix Day School\n\nAttached is a requisition from Mr. Superintendent Anfield for 7 primary tables and 42 primary chairs, for use in the above mentioned school. The supply of these will provide for the increased enrolment and make it possible to discard some of the very unsuitable double desks at present in use.\n\nIt is recommended that the purchase of this equipment be approved. Quotations have been received for the above as follows:\n\n7 primary tables @ $28.50 ........... $199.50\n\n42 chairs for above @ $3.20 ........... 134.40\n\nW.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant, your file 12-11-4 (168), with reference to primary chairs and tables for the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School.\n\nIn your letter you quote the price of the tables at $28.50 each. (Using the word \"primary\" tables, we presume you mean kindergarten.)\n\nWe can secure these at a great deal less cost in the East than that quoted in your letter. Possibly, the price mentioned is incorrect.\n\nPlease let me hear further from you.\n\nPP/BT\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nReference your 12-11-3 of May 30th, 1949, our file 1-11-3-166, Gitlakdamix Indian Day School repairs. Attached please find requisitions for material. Bids have been obtained from Gordon & Anderson Ltd. and Gordon's Hardware this city, which prices are the same as Vancouver, less 10%.\n\nIt is proposed to paint the roof of two coats as it is presently in extremely bad condition. This means a coverage of 6,000 ft\u00b2 and will take 25 gallons of cedar tone shingle coating. It is recommended that the exterior walls be done with one coat of Martin-Senour undercoater no. 410 and a coat of 100% pure paint, cream. Windows, trim and porches will be done with no. 541 special green.\n\nThe interior is presently done in cedar V-joint and the place is dark and gloomy. It is planned to paint the entire interior with an coat of undercoater no. 410; the ceilings and walls with Ivory no. 595 with a cost of golden brown no. 588 on the walls four feet from the floor. The floors will be painted Brazil Green no. 527.\n\nThe teacherage will be painted throughout with an undercoat and a finish coat of Ivory with cream walls and a brown base, floors to be painted green.\n\nAt prices submitted by Gordon & Anderson Ltd., the material for the roof will cost $91.25; for the outside $189.75; for the interior $170.40 with an extra of $25.00 for brushes, turps, cleaner, etc. Total material cost $381.15.\n\nLabour will cost as follows:\n\n| Labour | Cost |\n|--------|------|\n| Roof   | 6000 sq. ft. (2 coats) 3 men for 4 days @ $12.00 per 10 hour day | 144.00 |\nExterior 3 men for 15 days @ $12.00 per 10 hour day 540.00\n\nFreight and delivery of material 30.00\nScaffolding, nails, cleaning up, etc. 25.00\n\nTotal labour cost $739.00 for which an accountable advance is requested.\n\nThe total cost of a complete job of the interior and exterior will, therefore, cost $1120.15 which is some $400.00 less than the contract price of doing the Port Simpson School two years ago. I have already engaged three reliable Indians to do this work in August and the Department's instructions to proceed will be appreciated.\n\nF.

The size is $3\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4$, with masonite top. They can be shipped with the legs detached at the price of $16.50. As you are probably aware, delivery from the Penitentiary Branch is sometimes uncertain and consequently, we might not be able to secure the 7 tables you request for 3 or 4 months.\n\nThis might cause inconvenience to you and consequently local purchase of the 7 tables at the price mentioned on your requisition of June 1st is approved if you feel that it would be preferable to have these tables at the school for September 1st.\n\nIf it is possible for you to anticipate your requirements for any further number of these tables we could place the order with the Penitentiary Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nJune 28, 1949.\n\nAir Mail\n\nYour 810-5 (E.1) June 22nd\nRe: Gitlakademix Indian Day School\n\nThe item \"primary tables\" included in our requisition for the above mentioned school are tables 4' x 5', approximately 24\" high, covered with Masonite tops and are, I believe, sometimes referred to as Kindergarten tables. These tables accommodate six pupils.\n\nWe have been equipping a number of our primary rooms with this type of seating accommodation and have found it most satisfactory.\n\nThe type of table for which we quoted has detachable legs which facilitate their shipment by small boat up the Nass River to the Gitlakademix School.\n\nW.S.

Ever since the Autumn of 1899, the children of that settlement received the constant attention of Mr Ensign Therkildson their teacher, by whom the furniture of the school house, blackboards, maps and so forth were made.\n\nThe teacher is fully qualified, and the pupils aside of doing well looked after in general, are making good progress, and can highly recommend the matter under consideration in regard therewith, as well deserving the Department's approbation.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obed't Servant,\nSgd) R.E.

Loring, Indian Agent, 232400\nHazelton,\nUpper Skeena, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs is known to you, the settlement of Indian Salvationists known as Glen Vowell, near Hazelton, was established in 1895, and supplied with an Salvation Army Officer, Ensign Thorkildson, in October in 1899.\n\nHe has been very successful both in his missionary work among the Indians, and his educational efforts among the children. There is now a permanent population of 72 people in the place, whose behaviour has been most exemplary, and Ensign Thorkildson has erected on behalf of the Salvation Army, three buildings\u2014a hall for meeting purposes, a dwelling house, and a school house. He has fully learned the native language during his stay, and has put forth every effort to teach the children. Our educational efforts however are much handicapped for the lack of funds to find books and the necessary material.\n\nThere are at present 26 children at the village of which 16 are of school age. On behalf of these children and in view of the commendable results already achieved, I would petition the Indian part of the Government, through you, to allow the Salvation Army at Glen Vowell the annual school grant as given in other missionary schools, and in order to enable our officers to teach the children more effectually in the future.\n\nI have no doubt that this respectful request will be considered only just and in order, and will be dealt with favorably by the Government, and have your sincere endorsement.\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Evangeline Booth\nCommissioner of the Salvation Army in Canada and Newfoundland.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, August 27th, 1902.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith for the information of the Department, copy of a letter dated the 7th instant, from Mr. Agent Lorong, Babine Agency, B.C., together with the enclosure therein referred to, being a communication dated July 3rd from Miss Evangeline Booth, Commr. of the Salvation Army in Canada, etc., asking for the regular grant for the Indian Day School which their officer, Ensign Thorkildson has established at Glen Vowell, near Hazelton on the Upper Skeena River; and in view of the stated population of this village and the number of children of school age, I beg to concur with the Agent in commending this matter to the favorable consideration of the Department, and suggest that permission be given to place the usual sum granted to Day Schools in the estimates for the year 1903-1904.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6391, File 811-1, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n23rd September, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nAs you will see from the correspondence hereunder, Miss Evangeline Booth, Commissioner of the Salvation Army in Canada asks for a grant for a day school which has been carried on by the Army for the past three years at Glen Vowell near Hazelton on the Upper Skeena River. Mr Loring in whose Agency this school is situated, states that the teacher there is fully qualified and that the pupils are doing well and he recommends this case as deserving of the Department's consideration. Mr Supt. Vowell agrees with the Agent and asks permission to place the usual grant for this school in next year's estimates.\n\nThe Church of England had a school at Hazelton but as no returns have been received for the past year it is presumed that it has been closed.\n\nI am aware that the Salvation Army has been doing missionary work among the Indians and there would appear to be no reason why they should not receive the same consideration as any other denomination carrying on educational work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Commissioner Coombs, however, has told me of his interview with you, and of his having mentioned my name. The Commissioner told me that you very kindly promised to consider the question of giving us a grant towards our Indian work.\n\nI had hoped to have been able to come to Ottawa ere this, and to have seen you, but have been kept so busy in different parts of the Dominion that this has not been possible.\n\nI have personally been to see our Indian Work, especially that connected with Glen Vowell. The Salvation Army has spent a considerable amount of money in the laying out of this village and carrying on work among the Indians. We quite understand that it is not possible for you to recoup us the full amount, but I was wondering whether you could arrange for us to have a grant of \u00a31000.00, with some prospect of an annual subsidy. I know you will give this\nOttawa, March 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in which you request a grant of $1,000.00 to the Salvation Army for money expended on improvements in the Glen Vowell Indian Village, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is regretted that there are no funds from which to make this grant. I may say that the work being performed on this reserve by the teachers and officers of the Army is very much appreciated and as a recognition thereof the salary of the teacher was increased from $400.00 to $600.00 per annum. At a recent date it was also arranged to allow Ensign Sharp a grant of $100.00 per annum to enable him to continue his work in the way of teaching gardening, etc., to the Indians on the reserve. We hope that this will be satisfactory to the officers concerned and that it will prove an incentive to continued good work.\n\nThe erection of a new day school building in the near future is also contemplated; it may be possible to undertake this work during the summer of 1912.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nASST.

This costs the Army about Twelve Hundred ($1200) Dollars per year. We are hoping that you will be able to give us some assistance towards this outlay.\n\nWe also appreciate your kind promise to erect a suitable school building and residential quarters for Ensign & Mrs. Sharp and family, and Lieut. Law, the teacher.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity of thanking you for the interview which you granted Commissioner Rees and myself, and we appreciate the deep interest that you take in our work and are encouraged to hope, by your kindly remarks, that you will be able to render us good assistance in reference to the above mentioned.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, and with best wishes,\n\nBelieve me,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This Saw Mill was established in the interests of the Indians, in that, not only does it find occupation for them, but also gives them an opportunity of learning this character of work.\n\nThen with regard to the farm, which is a quarter of a section in extent, we have paid One Thousand Six Hundred and Thirty Two ($1632) Dollars.\n\nAs to the establishment of the village, such as the building of houses, laying out of the streets and general improvements, it has cost the Army something like Five Thousand ($5000) Dollars.\n\nThe above will give you an idea of what the\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your work, however, is appreciated and the Department is prepared to do what it can in recognition thereof.\n\nWith regard to a residence for the teacher on the Glen Vowell I would ask you to be good enough to forward to the Department a sketch of a building that you think would be suitable with particulars in regard to construction and means of erection as well as an estimate of the cost. It is understood that Ensign Sharp would be willing to supervise the work. There are no funds at present available and, should it not be possible to find any for this purpose this summer, the matter will be borne in mind and Parliament will be asked to grant an appropriation for the purpose next session. In the meantime it would be well for you to get the information above asked for and submit it to the Department.\n\nIt has also been decided to increase the salary of Mr. Rankin, who is at present the teacher at the Andimaul Henry W.

Glen Vowell\n\nBy\n\nClipping from Salvation Army\n\n\"War Cry\"\n\nRec/1/3\nA Christmas Dream\n\nBy Major Margaret Balkwill\n\nA fierce storm was raging in a great forest, on the borders of which stood the log hut of a Woodman.\n\nThe wind howled and shrieked and the snow blizzed upon the small window in sudden gusts. The ancient trees groaned and trembled, and the crackling of the fire and the sharp crack of broken branches could be heard as they were torn from the trees.\n\nInside, all was bright and warm and cheerful. The Woodman sat by the fire, resting after his day's work, while his little girl sat close by at his father's feet deep in the adventures of some old rabbits. From another room came the sound of a child's voice crying out piteously and fell in the hall or rush of the storm.\n\nPresently the door opened and the simple cottage was filled with the light of a girl's grey eyes and lips that smiled reassuringly.\n\n\"I'm glad you're awake, father; it's worse at the back. I began to wonder if it would blow the hut down.\"\n\nHildegarde spoke the words, set a flaming dish on the small round table that stood near the fire beside her father's chair, that she might cheer him up, and then she began to brush his hair daintily, though her eyes were large with anxiety.\n\n\"No, no, child,\" said the Woodman, laying his hand gently on her shoulder. \"I am better now. You must go to bed, my dear, and I will turn to the supper table and begin ladling out the soup into the plates. We have a nice fire somewhere, but it is a poor storm than this.\"\n\nThe home is safe enough, so don't fear.\"\n\n\"It is strange that they should come,\" said the Woodman, turning his head towards the door. \"No, not a bit afraid father\u2014but then I'm a boy, aren't I? I couldn't help.\"\n\n\"Not more of spiders?\" asked Hildegarde softly.\n\n\"Spiders,\" said Ivan, reddening, \"of course not.\"\n\n\"It's not so very long are you come begging me to take one off your pillow because you didn't like the feel of it, and I had to take it away,\" laughed the girl.\n\n\"Oh that's different, that's a girl's work,\" and Ivan raised a spoonful of the delicious soup to his lips.\n\nA silence fell, a silence that comes for a second or two in the midst of the greatest storm when for a moment the wind sweeps away only to return with redoubled fury.\n\nThe children were bent upon each other, for the splintering and tearing sounds in the forest were deafening. Two years ago the children had lost their mother, and Ivan, the eldest, the wife he had loved so well, since that time little Hildegarde had done her best to make her father happy and to be a mother to him. She scrubbed and washed and cooked and tended and all day sang about her mother and her father.\n\nShe gathered sticks for the fire and berries in their season and knew where the birds' nests were and where the wild flowers grew. The children were seldom lonely though their father was away all day. Sometimes he took them with him, but they never went far, for though they were poor, they were frugal and had enough.\n\nAs the bell came for a moment Ivan pushed back his plate and spoon, but Hildegarde held up her hand.\n\n\"Listen!\" she said, \"what was that?\"\n\n\"Noticed it,\" the Woodman answered, and said her father that he would pick up a paper and sat down in his chair by the fire. \"Best try and tell.\"\n\n\"That, father, I heard a knock.\" Hildegarde said with startled eyes. \"Who can it be\u2014and to-night?\"\n\n\"You are dreaming, Hildegarde. Let's wash up and target the outside, it's easy enough in here,\" said the little boy, seeing that his sister was really alarmed.\n\n\"But I'm sure I heard a knock. There it is again,\" cried Hildegarde.\n\nThis time they had all heard it, and the Woodman rose to his feet. \"I'll see, but I expect it's only the trees. No one comes at night.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he took down the heavy wooden latch and opened the door, but the furious wind burst the door open, knocking down little Ivan with its force and almost hurled into the street. The Woodman rushed out, covered with snow and drenched to the skin.\n\n\"Hildegarde\u2014Hildegarde!\" called the man over and over, but though he shouted at the top of his voice, no sound was heard.\n\nBut Hildegarde, who at first had stood with eyes wide open watching, moved forward and caught the child in her arms as he fell whilst her father struggled with the door. After some moments of effort, the door was closed, and then silent with the effort and astonishment, he stood looking down at the child who was sobbing in his hands. The snow was melting and little streams of water began to run over the child's cheeks. His golden hair hung uncerced and damp, his face, which was very beautiful, was wet with tears.\n\n\"Give me some of the broth,\" he said, and the child gave him some of the soup.\n\nSo lovingly and carefully, they all waited on the little stranger until the storm abated. No sooner was the child's head on the pillows than he was asleep.\n\n\"Who is he? Where does he come from?\" asked the Woodman, who was standing by the fire and looking thoughtfully down into it.\n\n\"He must have got lost in the forest, though I am not sure as to who he can be. I know all the people around, and he belongs to none of them. And I've heard that there is a mysterious castle that will be in sore trouble to-night, I reckon, over him. When the storm has lessened I will go and find out. Now I must go to bed and sleep.\"\n\nThey all slept at last, worn out by the storm and the excitement of the night. When the sun shone late and the wind was gone; the sun was shining over the soaking earth, but the little bed in the corner of the Woodman's room was empty.\n\nNo trace was to be found of the child who had sought refuge in the hut. The Woodman visited the neighbors poor and rich, but no one knew the child or had heard of any like him in the region of the forest.\n\nMany weeks had passed. Snow and wind and cold had given place to warm days, sunshine and flowers. Hildegarde and Ivan often talked of the beautiful stranger who came by night, as they played in the forest or worked at home.\n\n\"How did he get out of the hut, Hilde?\" asked Ivan one day for the hundredth time of his sister.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Hildegarde lightly, \"you have done that, Ivan, when father has locked the door by mistake.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how could he find out the secret of the hut?\"\n\n\"Boys know everything, don't they?\" returned his sister, mischievously. \"See, Ivan, father, he sat there for a minute and then ran towards the hut.\"\n\n\"Have you heard any music, children?\" asked the Woodman as the painting boy and girl reached the hut. Ivan was standing at the door of the hut listening.\n\n\"Music? No, where?\"\n\n\"Hush, Ivan, I hear it,\" whispered Hildegarde, and Ivan turned pale.\n\nIn the distance exquisite strains of music could be faintly heard\u2014growing more distinct each moment, until it seemed as though it came once in the forest whence the sounds came, eyes that grew wide in astonishment and bright with wonder, and then the music died away, and the stillness returned.\n\nNearer and louder grew the music and then a procession of richly robed figures appeared. They were playing as they walked, and at their head and a little in advance moved the figure of a young girl, whose dress was white, richly embroidered in silver and in one hand he held the branch of a tree.\n\n\"Father, it's the boy\u2014the boy who came to us,\" stammered Hildegarde. \"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"Oh father,\" the Woodman said as he bowed his head to stand, and the beautiful boy, advancing alone, came and stood straight and noble before the Woodman and his children\u2014and spoke.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, and his voice was like an echo of the sweetest music. \"I have come to thank you for your kindness to me. I know you are ungrateful, but I could not come before to thank you on behalf of my Father and myself for your kindness to my little friend. To show you how we appreciate your kindness to a stranger I have brought you a gift. To-day this and every day for evermore, and on the anniversary of the day you saved my life this branch will bear golden fruit for you and yours.\"\n\nA wonderful radiance of light seemed irradiated his face, and fell upon the little group who stood speechless as he turned away and took up his place at the head of the procession. Amid strains of music the boy and his followers passed out of sight.\n\nThus did I dream on Christmas eve, and I wouldn't be too much told.\n\nIf I hope that it brings to you the same quality of spiritual meditation upon it provides for me, then am I holding a big hope for you this Christmas tide.\nAmongst the Redskins\n\nGlad Tidings Proclaimed in Northern British Columbia and Alaska\n\nWhat a happy task to write of Alaska, Northern British Columbia, and their native peoples, \"Natives.\" And for here be true natives. We are wont to call citizens of the Southern Republic by the name of \"Americans,\" whereas they are really \"U.S.-statans.\" But here among the sea-girt islets and along the rock-bound coasts of the north we have found the true Americans.\n\nAnd, be it known, the peoples of the land have a long history and pedigree of which we whites scarce can boast. Long before the intrepid De Soto followed the winding Mississippi northward, the great Balboa first cast eyes upon the mighty Pacific; yes, and even centuries before the dauntless viking Leif Ericson set foot upon the new world, the proud red men of the north had subdued the people of Alaska in possession of an unique civilization. Here the proud tribal chiefs smoked their pipes of peace, here conflicting tribes met in death-dealing battle, here the brave died and here the stories of the past were told; here these pre-historic redmen tilled the soil and bartered their furs; here the black-eyed, intelligent Indian chief, freed from ancient superstition, the forbidden charms of the evil eye, showed them skin shirts adorned with the art of crude native warfare. Yes, and off the primeval forests were heard the weird funeral chants, as one by one the proud warriors of their race were gathered to their fathers. Thus did the red men of the north, with buckles numberless enliven the New Land.\n\nThey were a great people whose first American traits they had no cause to hide. They knew the friendships that unites the brothers of the climate to believe in the Infinite\u2014be those children of the north-west to bend knee to tolerate gods, pray to the sun's fiery orb, and suffer tortuous persecutions under intolerable conditions.\n\nIt was among such a people that, in 1879, the Rev. Robert Tomlinson boldly attempted to establish a Protestant Mission. Not many miles from where the Indians had been now gathered, Mr. Tomlinson had sought to establish a distinctly Christian village, where all who would renounce their idols might occupy claims of land unmolested. As a young bride came to her husband's side, so did the missionary face the perils etc. Mrs. Tomlinson still lives, and it is her delight to narrate or those thrilling early day conquests. It will interest readers to know that two hundred years hence, when the white man has disappeared, they help in furthering the splendid work which their parents pioneered.\n\nIt was about 1880 that a Salvation Army Captain was first sent to command operations among the Indians. Glen Vowell, who founded the first Salvation Army village, was the first point of attack. To-day, after twenty-four years of effort we may boast of a thriving Army of uniformed Salvationists, who have erected churches, schools, hospitals, orphanages, charitable Officers' Quarters and School-houses. The acorn has become an oak.\n\nAdjutant Jackson of Regina, who was stationed for a number of years in Alaska, tells a rather romantic story of an heroic Indian maiden who frustrated the murderous schemes of her own people, that they might one day have a \"white teacher\" sent them.\n\nIn a certain village of the upper Skeena River there grew a legend of the white man's influence, and both a plan and means were devised to \"white\" village and massacre the people. At the most, there were but a handful of settlers, who could make but little resistance against the surging tide of savagery. It was known that the Indians who were coming, who had met with The Salvation Army at the Coast, and among them was a young girl who refused to slip away and influence the Indians against the proposed attack. Also, with her was her village friend, The Army to whom she send teachers to her people. She realized that any assault upon the white men could make the impossible, and would place great limitations on her tribe. Her daring and excellent conduct led the way in the midst of the rushing Skeena, where her canoe was safely fastened, and in the dead of night crossed those perilous waters, then, on foot, traversed her way sacred charge, she is helping to spread the glad tidings of Him Whose Name we are now commemorating.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott  \nDeputy Superintendent General  \nIndian Affairs  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing you in the absence of Mr. Hyde, the Indian Agent, on a matter that we are wanting to get under way as soon as possible.\n\nOne of our leaders visited us a few days ago and he is anxious that we do more for our School children in fact all our little ones.\n\nAs you are probably aware when the parents go away at different times of the year they take the children away from school because there is no place to leave them where they will be taken care of. We have in mind taking a large house in the village which we want to fit up and make a home of it where the children will be left and be taken care of by the teacher also another Army Officer then when the people return the children can go back to the parents, this is only a small thing now but we have in mind a proper Residential School for all Salvation Army children on the Skeena River.\n\nWould you give me the amount that the Dept allows per child taken into a home or Residential school of this kind, also, if you allow any grant towards the equipment.\n\nWe are anxious to do all we can for the Indian Children and we are sure you will do all that lies in your power to help us. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Hyde so that he will not think that we are writing over his head.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention\n\nI Remain  \nYours Truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnsign  \nCommanding Officer\nNovember 18, 1929.\n\nDear Ensign Yarlett:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the establishment of a small boarding school for Salvation Army Indian children at Glen Vowell. It is true that very effective educational work can be carried on when children are taken into residence; but before the Department sanctions the scheme or gives favourable consideration to a grant for current expenses, we must be satisfied that proper facilities will be provided and that suitable care and supervision will be given. Further, I should state the other churches have found the small boarding school a constant source of expense even and above whatever grant the Department can allow. I therefore wish to urge you and the Army officers to give very careful consideration before undertaking any expenditure.\n\nYou should indicate how many children you propose to maintain and you should forward a report concerning the building you would use. It will be necessary to know the size of the children's dormitories, something of the heating, lighting, fire protection, water supply, sewage disposal or other sanitary arrangements. The number and duties of the staff should be indicated. I assume that, at the outset, you intend to look after some of the pupils of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School and that they will take their classes as formerly. I also understand that it would be only for part of the school year that the arrangement would be necessary. The Department does not wish to discourage any improvement in the educational work that you are doing; but the funds at our disposal do not permit us to assist with the establishment and maintenance of small boarding schools, located wherever a few children appear to require residence facilities while attending school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nEnsign W.

(RG 10, Volume 6391, File 811-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 14th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the September quarter return of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School and it is noted that it has been signed by Ensign W. Yarlett. The Department has received no previous intimation of the appointment of this teacher and I would appreciate your advising if Miss Brierly has resigned. If so, you should state Ensign Yarlett's age, qualifications and experience. Payment of the salary due for the September quarter will not be made until your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. C.

It was the intention of the Salvation Army Mission to appoint a suitable teacher in her place; this has now been done, the new teacher Ensign A.F. Parkinson commenced duties on October 1st 1930. Ensign Yarlett was only temporary, for the month of September 1930. No doubt in my mind that Ensign Yarlett was qualified, but he also was transferred to Alberta.\n\nHaving no data in this office respecting the appointing and transferring of Indian Day School Teachers, may I respectfully suggest that the Department of Indian Affairs supply me with all information in such matters.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nG.C. Martimer\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, November 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, informing the Department that Ensign A. F. Parkinson has been appointed teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School and commenced duties on the 1st ultimo. The Department has no other information regarding the appointment of Ensign Parkinson, and I shall be pleased if you will ascertain the qualifications and experience which he possesses and inform the Department, as the salary allowed will depend entirely upon his qualifications.\n\nIt is noted that Ensign Yarlett was only temporarily in charge of the school during the month of September, last. Payment is being made him for one month at the rate of $85, and cheque is being sent in your care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. C.

Glen Vowell, B.C. Ensign and Mrs. Yarlett have served there for between three or four years and at their urgent request we gave them a change of appointment. We have appointed in their stead Ensign and Mrs. Parkinson who will be looking after the station, giving oversight to the School and Farm, and Mrs. Parkinson who has had experience in nursing will very agreeably fill the position of Field Matron. I feel quite certain that these officers will meet the requirements very acceptably. The matter was discussed with Mr. Mortimer, your local representative, who seemed quite satisfied with this arrangement.\n\nWe will be glad if you will see that the Grants which we have received in the past will be continued so that we may carry on this work which has been in operation for so many years and which I trust is proving of real permanent good to the Natives in that section of the country.\n\nWe are trying to give some special oversight also, to the Natives in the town of Hazelton and trust this will be of value to the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary.\nOttawa, January 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, informing the Department of the change in your officers at Glen Vowell, B.C.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that Ensign and Mrs. Yarlett terminated their services at the end of September last, and that, in their stead, Ensign A. F. and Mrs. Parkinson have been appointed. Our local Indian Agent, Mr. G. C. Mortimer, Hazelton, B.C., has been informed of the approval granted for the appointment of Ensign Parkinson as teacher of the Indian day school at Glen Vowell, with salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month. Mrs. Parkinson is to perform the field matron's duties, and will receive salary at the rate of $300 per annum.\n\nRelative to the appointment of Ensign Parkinson as farm instructor, I have to say that we are taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Mortimer, and you will, no doubt, be informed by him in due course of the grant that will be allowed for this service.\n\nIt is hoped that Ensign and Mrs. Parkinson will meet with every success in their work at Glen Vowell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. W. Peacock, Esq.,\nField Secretary,\nThe Salvation Army,\n1091 Portage Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Salvation Army\nCanada West and Alaska U.S.A.\nTerritorial Headquarters,\n1081 Portage Avenue\nWinnipeg, Canada\nJanuary 13, 1931.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours 151-13-1 of the 10th instant with reference to our Glen Vowell, B.C. Mission Station, is to hand for which please accept our thanks. We are glad to know that you have made the necessary arrangements in regard to the transfer of Ensign and Mrs. Yarlett and have in their stead placed the names of Ensign A.F. and Mrs. Parkinson.\n\nWe note that the salary of $55.00 per teaching month will be granted to Ensign Parkinson but are sorry to note that for the Field Matron's duties the grant has been reduced from $40.00 to $25.00 per month. Is it not possible for you to continue the Field Matron's grant on the former basis as we really are in need of it in connection with this work, and in Mrs. Parkinson we have an experienced woman for this work. I will, therefore, appreciate it if you will kindly give the matter further consideration with a view to having the grant restored to the former amount.\n\nWe also note that there is no mention of the Farm Grant which was $25.00 a quarter. Ensign Parkinson is an experienced farmer and in addition to his duties as the school teacher will be able to give considerable help to the Natives in regard to the Farm work. The Ensign having been a farmer in the Province of Saskatchewan is properly qualified for work of this kind as well as being able to take care of the school.\nI am sure you will appreciate the difficult position we find ourselves in in regard to this Mission Station, and we will be glad if you can re-consider the whole matter.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(P.

W. Peacock)\nChief Secretary.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our letter of May 15th in reference to the circular regarding the Indian Day Schools.\n\nWe have been in touch with our people on this matter and they deeply regret there is a possibility the Indian Schools will not be opened until October 1st.\n\nThe enrolment and average attendance at our Glen Vowell Day School for the month of September since 1932 is as follows:-\n\n| Year | Enrolment | Average Attendance |\n|------|-----------|--------------------|\n| 1932 | 14        | 13.3               |\n| 1933 | 17        | 17                 |\n| 1934 | 20        | 18.5               |\n| 1935 | 20        | 18.2               |\n| 1936 | 19        | 16.8               |\n| 1937 | 20        | 14                 |\n| 1938 | 19        | 16.14              |\n| 1939 | 20        | 16.9               |\n\nOur Officer at Glen Vowell urgently presses that this matter be reconsidered and that you will look favorably at the request to open the School on September 4th.\n\nIt is our understanding that the schools for the white children will be opened as usual; is there not a danger of the native people getting the idea that they are being treated unjustly?\n\nFurthermore, the Native Schools are more or less in competition with the White Schools and should have the same advantages.\n\nCont'd.\nOttawa,\nJuly 25, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Peacock:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to conditions now confronting us it was only found possible to provide in the current year's appropriation an amount sufficient to pay the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools for a period of nine months during the current fiscal year. This applies to all Indian day schools in Canada.\n\nAs a result of the decreased appropriation it was suggested that day schools remain closed during the month of September as in many cases the attendance is smallest during that month. It appears from the information contained in your letter that at Glen Vowell they always have a very regular attendance during that month. Consequently the Department would have no objection to allowing the school to be opened in September. However, it will have to be closed for some other month between September 1 and March 31 as the Department will only have funds for the payment of the teacher's salary for a period of six months between the dates just mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Peacock,\nChief Secretary,\nThe Salvation Army,\nJames and Albert Streets,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJuly 26, 1940.\n\nEX'D.\nG\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to official letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the Glen Vowell Indian Day School. The Chief Secretary of the Salvation Army has written to this Branch pointing out that the average attendance during the month of September at this school for the last 8 years has been extremely good. It is just possible that it would be preferable to allow this school to operate during the month of September and close for some other month between September 1 and March 31 during which the average attendance would be smaller. I should appreciate your recommendation in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nJuly 27th, 1940.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of the 25th instant with reference to the Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nWe appreciate very much the arrangement the Department has made that the School may be opened during the month of September, but it is, of course, disappointing that the appropriation covers a period of only nine months instead of ten as in other years. You will realize that the teacher must be carried on just the same if the School is opened or not in September and even if a month has to be taken out in the middle of the year.\n\nWe were hoping that the Department could have seen its way clear to extend the payment for ten months seeing our attendance average for September at Glen Vowell is so favourable, and trust that even yet some arrangement can be made. Is it not possible for this to be done?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Geo. W. Peacock)\nChief Secretary\nDear Mr. Peacock:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo with further reference to the Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nAs I stated in my letter of the 25th ultimo provision was made in the current year's appropriation for an amount sufficient to pay the salaries of teachers of all Indian day schools in Canada for a period of 9 months only during the current fiscal year. As a consequence all Indian day schools will only be operated for a 9 month period instead of a 10 month period during the coming academic year. I regret that no exception can be made in the case of the Glen Vowell School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Peacock,\nChief Secretary,\nThe Salvation Army,\nJames and Albert Streets,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to Glen Vowell Indian Day School and the operation of same during September and closing it some other month between October 1st and March 31st, I would advise that it is not very obvious which month would meet the requirements of the Salvation Army as, according to Mr. Inspector Parry's report of the 5th ultimo, there has been a higher average attendance during the other three quarters of the term. Consequently I do not feel justified in recommending any change from the original schedule proposed that it operate from October 1st to June 30th.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

I enclose cost-of-living bonus form and T.D. 1 form.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nCommissioner D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe.: Glen Vowell.\n\nDear Commissioner MacKay:\n\nOur Territorial Headquarters feel it necessary to move Captain A. S. Hagglund and in view of this I would like to nominate Captain Ethel Brierly for the position at Glen Vowell.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Matt. Junker,)\nLieut. Colonel,\nDivisional Commander.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI would refer to your letter of July 17, 1944, File 151-13-1, approving of the appointment of Captain A.S. Hagglund as teacher at Glen Vowell Day School and enclose herewith a letter dated the 25th instant received from Lieut. Colonel Matt. Junker advising that his Headquarters feel it necessary to move Captain Hagglund and replace him by Captain Ethel Brierly. His services have been very satisfactory.\n\nSection 155 (j) of the B.C. Provincial \"School Act\" provides for a teacher giving thirty days notice of his resignation, which period of notice shall terminate with the close of the school term. I believe the usual penalty is suspension of the teacher's certificate. This provision is, of course, to avoid disturbance of school routine during the term.\n\nIn the interests of our educational work, I feel that the Salvation Army authorities should refrain, as much as possible, from removing these teachers during the term. They apparently fail to realize that they are in the employ of the Department while engaged at these day schools and would also be subject as our employees to the requirements of the Selective Service Branch. If there is some urgent necessity for the employment of the teacher's services elsewhere, which, in this case, has not so far been indicated, then the Department is entitled to suitable representations.\n\nIt was anticipated that the Salvation Army would nominate Captain Ethel Brierly for the position of teacher at Gwinsha School, which has not yet been filled.\n\nThis would, no doubt, be an opportune time to discuss the nature and term of these appointments with Salvation Army Headquarters at Toronto.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nChief Treasury Officer, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Captain A.S. Hagglund late Teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School of this Agency, enclosing the attached cheque in your favour for $44.23.\n\nCaptain Hagglund taught at the above named school up to and inclusive of October 16th last and the amount of the enclosed cheque represents the amount of salary for the untaught portion of October, namely October 17th to 31st.\n\nCaptain Hagglund also informed me that he was unable to return the Department's salary cheque as it was sent direct to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Prince Rupert, B.C., for the credit of his account.\n\nFor your information I wish to advise that Captain Ethel Georgina Briery, successor to Captain A.S. Hagglund, commenced teaching at the above named school on October 23rd last.\n\nS. Mallinson\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nDecember 4, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Glen Vowell Indian Day School\nNo. 811\n\nIn my memorandum of November 22, I notified you regarding the change in teachers at this school and gave dates on which one of the teachers had left and the other had begun duties. A subsequent report from Indian Commissioner MacKay indicates that the dates given in that memorandum were incorrect and consequently I wish to amend it in the following manner:\n\n1. Captain A.S. Hagglund taught the school for the period October 1 to October 17 inclusive. As he received his cheque for the full month of October he has refunded the amount that he has been overpaid.\n\n2. Captain Ethel Brierly began duties as teacher on October 23, 1944, at a salary of $95 a teaching month, plus bonus. If she has already received her November cheque she should be paid for the period October 23 to October 31.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nRETIREMENT FUND APPLICATION FORM\n\nDepartment: Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nThe Superannuation Division,\nDepartment of Finance,\nNew Post Office Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDate: December 27, 1944.\n\nRETURN OF THE AMOUNT AT CREDIT OF THE UNDERMENTIONED EMPLOYEE IN THE RETIREMENT FUND IS REQUESTED.\n\nName: Haglund (surname) A.S.

Please let me know Mrs. Griffith's Christian name.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have your letter of December 12th and attached communication from Capt. H. Collard, teacher at the Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nCapt. Collard's letter apparently has reference to her employment as Field Matron prior to the time she assumed duties as teacher. The need for a Field Matron at this point has not been established and the Salvation Army officials were informed some time ago that it was not the intention to continue to employ a Field Matron at Glen Vowell. The matter will be referred to Dr. Tennant for such action as he considers necessary.\n\nWith reference to Capt. Collard's employment as teacher, I wrote under date of December 6th forwarding an application form and questionnaire, advising that Miss Collard assumed her duties on October 21st. T.D.l form is not applicable in this case as Miss Collard is single without dependants.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C\nHazelton, B.C.\nDecember 29th, 1946\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour File 1-11-2\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th inst. advising that the Department evidently intends to make payment of salary to Mrs Griffiths as temporary teacher at Glen Vowell Indian Day School I would advise that this will not be necessary as she was, according to my information, employed and paid by the teacher, Miss Brierly, who wished to proceed to Toronto to attend a convention, expecting to return in the course of a week or so. However, her name is Mrs. W. Griffiths.\n\nSo far Miss Collard, who took over from Mrs Griffiths, has received no salary and in consequence is finding difficulty in financing her affairs. I wrote the Department in this connection as there seems to have been some delay in payment of teacher's salaries here. Mrs Massey received her cheque for September, October and November only two days ago following my urgent request of the Department. As you know, it is extremely difficult to secure and hold teachers for this Agency and once they become thoroughly dissatisfied it is almost impossible to induce them to remain.\n\n(James Coleman)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nP.S. Miss Collard has just informed me that she paid Miss Griffiths personally.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 151-13-1 (W.T.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of December 18th in connection with the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, I am enclosing Inspector Coleman's letter of December 29th from which it will be noted that Mrs. W. Griffiths was employed by Miss Brierly, the previous teacher, as a substitute, and that her salary during the period October 7th to 18th has been paid by Miss Collard, the present teacher. It would appear that if arrangements could be made to pay Miss Collard salary from October 7th the matter would be satisfactorily adjusted.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nHazelton, B.C.\nDecember 28th, 1946\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nIt would be appreciated if a cheque could be forwarded to Miss H.P. Collard, teacher at Glen Vowell Indian Day School, who has been forced to retire in order to undergo an operation shortly.\n\nAccording to the files in this office she commenced teaching on October 18th and continued until the school closed for the Christmas holidays on the 20th inst. It is possible that her predecessor, Miss Brierly, was paid to some date subsequent to this but I have no information whether or not she was granted any sick leave as she broke her leg while attending a conference on October 11th at Toronto. She paid her substitute up to the time that Miss Collard took over.\n\nAs Miss Collard will not be returning as teacher after her operation I would recommend that no deductions be made for superannuation.\n\n(James Coleman)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 7 January 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Glen Vowell Indian Day School No. 811\n\nPlease refer to my memorandum of Nov. 2 requesting no further payment of salary to the teacher, Miss Brierly. It is understood that she was paid at the end of October.\n\nOwing to her illness it was necessary to employ Capt. Helen Sophia Collard from Oct. 7 to Jan. 1, 1947. Cheque in payment of her salary should be made for the period mentioned at the rate of $125.00 a teaching month. Please have cheque drawn in her favour and send by airmail to Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nStaff Questionnaire is enclosed.

We are not prepared to agree with that contention as insufficient information was supplied originally. It is realized that this was not due to any oversight on the part of anyone in particular but likely occurred due to the change in the office of Indian agents in the Babine Agency.\n\nBernard F.

Coleman\nInspector of Indian Affairs\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Coleman:\n\nI am pleased to inform you that after careful consideration, it has been decided not to send Miss Brierly back to Glen Vowell.\n\nOur Hqts in Toronto has now appointed Captain John Cooper (unmarried) to Glen Vowell and I take pleasure in nominating him as the teacher for the school in that Village. The Captain should arrive about January 20th. He has previously been in Nova Scotia and is highly recommended by Lt. Colonel Carruthers, who spent some twenty years as Divisional Commander for Northern British Columbia and Alaska. I am asking Adjutant Rendell to meet him on his arrival at Hazelton and introduce him to you. He will then proceed to Glen Vowell.\n\nThe Captain has not a teachers certificate, but I understand has the equivalent of Senior Matriculation and it is thought he will fit into the requirement quite well.\n\nI am sorry the school is losing so much time, but it is my fault, I expect, as I was unwilling to re-accept Miss Brierly. I feel sure you will quite understand.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. Gillingham\n(J.T. Gillingham)\nDivisional Commander.\nHazelton, B.C. January 26th, 1947\n\nMajor D M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith the nomination of Brigadier J.T. Gillinham, dated 13th inst. of John Orman Cooper as teacher for the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, who has just arrived and submitted enclosed application of the 22nd inst. for the position.\n\nI have interviewed Mr. Cooper and as we are unable to secure a certificated teacher for the position I would recommend his appointment on a temporary basis as he appears very well qualified apart from professional standing. The \"temporary\" appointment only is recommended as I do not consider we should consider the more or less permanent retention of other than qualified educational personnel.\n\nI am not recommending any salary as I do not have with me a copy of the \"Cameron Report\". It should be kept in mind, however, that the Salvation Army built the school and teacherage at their own expense and maintained them except for a few minor repairs during the past year or so. I understand these \"Army\" teachers turn their salaries back into the \"Army\" work, retaining only their actual needs.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Cooper is single but is engaged to be married as soon as he can secure \"Army\" consent. In my opinion married status on these Reserves is preferable.\n\nI would recommend his appointment.\n\n(James Coleman)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner\nFrom: R.F. Davey, District Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRe: Appointment of Mr. J.O. Cooper\nto Glen Vowell Indian Day School\n\nI agree with Mr. Coleman with respect to the \"temporary\" appointment of Mr. Cooper to the Glen Vowell School.\n\nBecause Mr. Cooper has no professional training he would receive $1000 per annum under the B.C. Basic Salary Schedule for Grant Purposes.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Salvation Army built both the school and the teacherage and the preference expressed by Mr. Coleman for a married teacher I recommend that the salary of Mr. Cooper be set at $125. per month.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nAirmail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Inspector Coleman's letter of January 28th and enclosures referred to therein in connection with the proposed appointment of Mr. J.O. Cooper as teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nA copy of School Inspector Davey's memorandum is attached and I would recommend that Mr. Cooper's appointment be approved at a salary of $125. a teaching month.\n\nAt the same time I should like to point out that under the B.C. Basic Salary Schedule Mr. Cooper would receive salary at the rate of $100. a teaching month, and although it might be preferable to pay him at this rate and allow the Salvation Army a reasonable rental for the use of their buildings at Glen Vowell it is felt that this might complicate the matter and an all inclusive salary of $125. a month until the end of the current academic year is recommended.\n\nD.

But according to the Commissioner's letter this has not been done. Furthermore, this means that my salary is considerably lower than the lowest grade Welfare Teacher, and I think I am at least entitled to a grade 1 Welfare Teacher's salary.\n\nI received a letter some time ago from Mr. B.F. Neary the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, stating that my salary was $1250.00 but there was no reference to any rental being included.\n\nAs the Salvation Army headquarters has requested a separate cheque covering the rentals for the buildings, and I feel entitled to the amount stated in Mr. Neary's letter in view of the fact that I am doing welfare work here, I shall appreciate it very much if you will have the proper adjustment made.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) John O. Cooper.\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Mr. J.O. Cooper teacher at the Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nThe teacher has apparently been paid a salary which included the rental of the Salvation Army buildings at that point, one of which we use as a school and the other, the Mission House, is tenanted by the teacher who in recent years has always been a member of the Salvation Army.\n\nMr. Cooper has not a teaching Certificate and presumably is receiving the basic salary of $1,000 per annum. To this is added $25 a month for rental of buildings and I would suggest that some letter to this effect from your Department be forwarded in order to clarify the situation of Mr. Cooper.\n\nThe matter of Welfare teachers is one which is difficult to settle without reference to the Indian Health Service from whom I have recently requested a decision as to the continued establishment of dispensers at each of several reserves. At the present time some teachers and missionaries are dispensing drugs and rendering some medical assistance to the Indians without any additional remuneration at all and I feel that some provision should be made for a nominal compensation to these persons. This should properly of course be paid by the Department of Health and Welfare.\n\n/lt\nIt is not quite clear to me whether it is the intention of our Department to provide for these duties by the payment of Welfare Teachers, if so, and failing a satisfactory reply from the Director of Indian Health Services I shall shortly make an application for a change of status of some of our teachers, Mr. Cooper among them.\n\nMeanwhile it would be appreciated if you would forward a letter clarifying Mr. Cooper's question of salary.\n\nJ.V.

It is not clear what further information he requires but it has occurred to me that the method of paying salary and rental in one cheque might lead to some confusion with regard to liability for income tax. I would therefore recommend that commencing with the next payment a separate cheque be sent to Mr. Cooper to cover rental of the buildings.

In Departmental letter 151-13-1 dated 30th January last, I was advised that Miss Bryenton's salary had been increased from $600.00 to $700.00 per annum, or this I advised the teacher. According to your letter 1-1-3, September 17th, 1923, school teachers' salaries are now paid on the basis of ten teaching months in the school year; therefore, it seems that a mistake has been made in Miss Bryenton's salary for September last, amounting to $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA.\nProvince of BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFor Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1923\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Amount Gross or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Lillie I.

This letter and voucher has been held in this office since the 18th ultimo awaiting for Messrs. Hibben & Co. to show a receipt from the Hudson's Bay Company for freight of $1.65 paid on the shipment. The firm claim to have lost the original shipping receipt and cannot seem to get the Hudson's Bay Co. to furnish a duplicate; there being some misunderstanding between them as to whether the amount was paid or not. The department will have to use its discretion and say whether the account under the circumstances should be paid in full or the $1.65 deducted.\n\nMarch 16th, 1910\nMr. H. E. Loring,\nIndian Agent, Hazelton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nKnowing that you have always shown a practical interest in the welfare of Glen Vowell, and that you also are fully acquainted with the progress made from the very beginning of the settlement, so it will not be necessary for me to go into lengthy explanations, I simply desire herewith to lay a matter of very great importance to the Village, before you, and your Department, in the hope that you will be able to help us.\n\nAs you are aware, I came to Glen Vowell in the fall of 1899. And the Village - if it could then be called such - was composed of the name, and three temporary log cabins. I shall not enlarge on the hardships in connection with the building up of a new Town, as that can only be understood by those who have had a similar experience. It will suffice to say, that with a lot of unstable people only, at your back, misunderstood by some, doubted as to the final outcome of the undertaking, by more, with no means at my disposal, and practically no outside help - you will understand that I have had to do many things temporarily, that at the time could have been done permanently.\n\nFirst of all, when arriving here I saw that my hope would lie in educating the children and younger people, to the best of my ability, realizing that failing there, I would fail irretrievably. Consequently I erected a small log-house for a school, even before having a comfortable dwelling myself. In course of time it proved too small, and although\nnot in a position, from a financial standpoint, to build a better house, yet seeing to wait until I should be, would be disastrous to the work - I did manage to build another frame building, 16' x 24', which we have been using as a school building now since 1904.\n\nBut now I am confronted by the same difficulty again viz., the building being too small and not properly ventilated, in fact altogether inadequate to accommodate the steady increasing number of children here.\n\nTherefore dear Sir, feeling that personally, I have done all that it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, and fully believing that it is not only your desire; but also the desire of the Department you represent, that the children should have a chance, and be properly taught in a proper building, where health and sanitary conditions would be all that could be expected - I herewith take the liberty to ask for your help and influence to secure a school building for Glen Voell, at the earliest possible date.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ.P. Thorvaldson\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith an application, dated the 21st instant, from Mr. J. P. Thorkildson, the Teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, in regard to a grant from the Department to enable a School House being erected in the village of Glen Vowell, on the Sikedach Indian reserve.\n\nIn regard to the same, I would respectfully recommend the measure to be attained on the subject applied for.\n\nThe school is one of the very best in the district; it commands about the largest average attendance of any, and the all-round progress made thereat, cannot easily be excelled.\n\nThe plans regarding ground floor, elevation and specifications of the School House Building, intended for New Kitsegukla - sent in under date of the 14th ultimo - would likewise easily fit the present occasion.\n\nBut here beg leave to add that the material, such as\n\nRough Lumber, per m., has lately risen to $25.00\nTongue & Grooved \" 32.00\nRustic \" 30.00\nDressed & Shiplap \" 26.00\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.

Thorkildson, teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School asking Departmental aid to construct a school house on the Sikedach Indian Reserve.\n\nThis application was received by Mr. MacLaughlin, before his illness, and has been held since thinking he might be able to return to the office, when his views regarding it might be embodied in a letter to the Department.\n\nHowever, as he is not here yet, I thought it best to forward it.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 26, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of March 26th, last, addressed to the Superintendent's office at Victoria, B.C., enclosing an application from Mr. J.

Your work, however, is appreciated and the Department is prepared to do what it can in recognition.\n\nWith regard to a residence for the teacher on the Glen Vowell, I would ask you to be good enough to forward to the Department a sketch of a building that you think would be suitable with particulars in regard to construction and means of erection as well as an estimate of the cost. It is understood that Ensign Sharp would be willing to supervise the work. There are no funds at present available and, should it not be possible to find any for this purpose this summer, the matter will be borne in mind and Parliament will be asked to grant an appropriation for the purpose next session.

Jackson, the missionary of that locality gave me a letter of the 26th ultimo, and attached thereto an estimate of costs, complete, and which papers I beg to enclose herewith proving the total cost to be $229.40.\n\nSince the the Glen Vowell school building very much needs remedying in that respect, and the school has all along been and is doing splendid work, and consider the expense to be incurred reasonable, and the work is calculated to be done during the coming holidays, I would respectfully recommend the authority to be granted to the measure here proposed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have an attendance of 25 to 30 children and the school building is only 29 by 16 ft - we request the addition of 15 feet which if granted would probably meet the requirement for some few years to come.\n\nI enclose an estimate of the material necessary for such addition, also cost of labor etc.\n\nHoping that you will be able to put this before the Department. I am\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nH K Jackson\nOttawa, May 10, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Ensign H. K. Jackson, in which he requests that the Day School building at Glen Vowell be enlarged and enclosing an estimate of the material necessary for such addition and the cost of the labour.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter is receiving the consideration of the Department, and, as soon as a decision is arrived at, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR.

In my previous report, I suggested that a new school should be built at this village but as this is not feasible this year on account of financial conditions, I would recommend that the building be lengthened fifteen feet at an estimated expenditure of about $200 or $225.\n\nShould this improvement be carried out the building would probably answer the purposes for a year or two.\n\nReport dated, June 7th, 1916.\nOttawa, July 20, 1916.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of April 24th last in connection to application of Ensign H. K. Jackson, Missionary, for a grant of $225 for the purchase of material to enable them to extend the length of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School building by an additional 15 feet, thus providing the accommodation necessary for the pupils enrolled at that school, and in reply to inform you that the Department will make a grant of $225 for this stated purpose on condition that the work is at once proceeded with and completed, the money to be paid on certificate issued by you stating that the erection of this addition has been completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.
