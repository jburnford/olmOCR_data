A considerable amount of clearing of bottom lands has been done. This will give good pasture. The irrigation system has been improved and more land brought under cultivation. The new dairy herd was looking fairly well, though not at their best. This was probably due to their just being turned out to fresh green pasture. The useless cows are being gradually killed and eaten. The young departmental bull was in fine shape, and in the end this herd should be one of the best. Mr. George Hay, once of the Agricultural Department, and now in charge of Consolidated Herd (now famous), takes a lot of personal interest in the school herd.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nJanuary 7, 1932.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the Ayrshire heifer \"Culdares Pansy\" purchased from Miss Ogilvy-Wills for the Kootenay Indian Residential School, examined by myself in October last, the Reverend Principal pointed out to me that this heifer had not freshened as was expected and I therefore gave her a thorough examination for that particular defect.\n\nI found on this examination that she was affected with a stenosis of the vagina and that it would be impossible for this heifer to produce a calf. I would like to point out that making a general examination of these animals at the time of purchase Culdares Pansy was supposed to be in calf, therefore it was impossible to detect this malformation without my attention having been drawn to it. I would say that the present value of this heifer is what she would bring as beef.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. W. Rutledge, V.S.\nGranbrook, B.C.,\nJanuary 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that when Dr. J. W. Rutledge examined the dairy herd at Kootenay Indian Residential School on September 15th last he stated that one of the heifers purchased from Miss Jeanette Ogilvy-Wills in October, 1930, and registered as \"Culdares Pansy\" No. 141025, born April 27, 1928, was a non-breeder and that it would be impossible for the animal ever to freshen. I beg to enclose herewith a letter from Dr. Rutledge in connection with the matter.\n\nRecently the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Residential School, called on Miss Wills to discuss the matter, and although Miss Wills stated that she did not feel that she was obliged to do anything in the matter, she offered to exchange for the heifer a young registered Ayrshire bull of exceptionally good breeding and registered as \"Culdares Peter\" No. 149711, born March 7th, 1931. The Reverend Principal states that he will be in need of another bull next summer, and as Culdares Peter should then be ready for service, he is of the opinion that the exchange would be of benefit.\n\nWill the Department kindly advise me if such an arrangement meet with approval.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 16, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing a communication from Dr. J.

R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith vouchers Nos. 952 and 953, each for $6.00, covering fees of J. W. Rutledge, V.S., for an operation on a cow owned by Indian Baptiste Andrew of St. Mary's Reserve on April 3rd and treatment given the registered Ayrshire bull at Kootenay Residential School on April 30th.\n\nI beg to submit that the cow of Indian Baptiste was in very bad shape, and as she was the only milch cow he owned and the milk was badly needed for his children, I was anxious that the animal be saved if possible. The operation was entirely successful.\n\nThe herd bull at Kootenay Residential School was suffering from bowel trouble and I am quite certain would have died without proper treatment. I am pleased to report that the animal has recovered and is now apparently in good condition.\n\nI trust the Department will consider payment of the accounts.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Patterson, O.M.I.,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nGranbrook, B.C.\nThe Kootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nJanuary 20, 1936.\n\nMr. Robert Howe,\nActing Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Howe:\n\nWe need badly for next harvest the following:\n\n1. A Binder.\n2. A Mower (two horse)\n3. A Horse Rake.\n\nA small Threshing Machine would be of great service to us, as we have to engage outsiders at an exorbitant price per bushel.\n\nA small Saw Mill (run by electricity) is a necessity to saw lumber for the School and for our Indians on our Reserves. We are trying to encourage and help our Indians to build homes for each one of their families. We have the loan of a Saw Mill belonging to a Mr. McPhee, a neighbour, but he wants it returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMichael Murphy, P.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Michael Murphy O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, in which he makes application for a Binder, Mowing machine, Hay Rake, Threshing machine and a portable Sawmill.\n\nI will be glad to hear the Departments wishes in this regard in order that I may advise the Rev. Principal accordingly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Howe\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, the Department regrets that, owing to lack of funds, it is impossible at the present time to authorize purchase of the machinery requested by the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is also doubtful just now what amount, if any, will be available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-37. You might, however, write again to the Department about the middle of April in connection with the Principal's request, but it should be distinctly understood that at the present time the Department is not in a position to state whether or not his request can be granted in April.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRobert Howe, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe Department desires to purchase one mowing machine and one rake for the Kootenay Indian Residential School, at Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nI would be pleased to have your instructions as to the names of local dealers who may be given consideration. I may say that it is customary to obtain prices direct from manufacturers through their local dealer.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nOttawa, June 13th, 1956.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of the Doorley Indian Residential School advises that their alfalfa is now ready to cut and that he finds himself with an old mower that cannot be made to work, and without a rake of any kind.\n\nFather Murphy quoted from the International Harvester Company prices delivered at this school on St Mary's Reserve as follows:\n\n1. 5 ft. McCormick Seeding Boxer $27.00\n1. 10 ft. McCormick Seeding Rake $6.50\n\nIf approved by the Department kindly advise at earliest convenience and delivery can be made on a days notice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irvine\nIndian Agent\nMinister's Office\n\nJuly 2, 1936.\n\nDR.

D. McBride\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, July 3, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo, with reference to the request of the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School for a mower and rake.\n\nPlease obtain prices for this machinery from the following firms:\n\nParks & Company, Cranbrook, B.C.,\nJ. D. McBride,\n\nPurchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. If it should happen that both firms quote the same price, the mower should be purchased from one and the rake from the other.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nJuly 24th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter, No.155-0-5, of July 3rd, concerning a mower and rake for the Kootenay Indian Residential School I beg to advise that the Rev. Father Murphy informed me that he had had his old machinery so well repaired that he thought he would be able to manage for this season. Today, however, he called at the office to state that the old machinery had entirely broken down and that he would need a new mower and rake to handle his second crop of alfalfa which will be ready to cut about the second week in August.\n\nAs directed by your letter I called on Parks and Company also Mr. J. D. McBride. The former advised that his firm does not handle farm machinery. Mr. McBride, however, gave me a price on a McCormack Deering mower, five foot cut, at $127.50; M.D. rake ten feet, $66.50. Kindly advise if it would be in order to make these purchases from Mr. McBride or if some other firm or firms such as might be recommended by His Worship, Mayor T.M. Roberts should be given an opportunity to compete for this business. The purchases should be made early in August. Kindly advise and oblige.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAI/SH\nMr. C. C.

Feb. 15th, 1937\n155-0-14\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe have been contemplating for some time the planting, on departmental property, an orchard (apple mostly) of pear and cherry trees. Our budget for 1936-37 included an item of expense for this purpose. We are very anxious to set out the trees this spring, and we are asking the Department to supply us with 100 trees.\n\nMay we suggest that the trees be purchased from a nursery where the saplings have been insured to rather severe climatic conditions during winters. May we suggest also that in selection of varieties, a goodly number of the winter varieties (of apples) be selected out.\n\nThe Indian children are particularly fond of apples and pears, and we are planning an apple-juice day (4 P.M.) for each pupil throughout the term.\n\nThanking you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Murphy, M.A.\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 26, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, requesting us to supply 100 fruit trees.\n\nYou should discuss this proposal with the Principal, and advise the Department if you favour the idea. If so, you should let me know from where the trees could be obtained and at what cost. In his letter the Principal mentions apple, pear and cherry trees. Consideration might be given to crab apple trees, as the fruit from these could be used for canning purposes.\n\nWhen your report is received, the Principal's request will receive further consideration, but, at the present time, I am not in a position to state definitely whether or not funds for the purpose can be provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hasy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 155-0-14 of February 26th I wish to enclose herewith a list of fruit trees and prices submitted to Rev. Michael Murphy, Principal of the Lower Kootenay Indian Residential School, by H. M. Eddie and Sons Ltd., of Sardis, B. C.\n\nI may say that the site favored by the principal appears to be an excellent piece of land and admirably located for the purpose of establishing an Orchard. My short residence in the District, however, of less than a year, would scarcely warrant me in expressing an opinion as to whether or not the trees as listed would be likely to succeed. But I can say this, that the location is ideal and there is no apparent reason why they should not succeed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

Little and Atchison of Cranbrook, B.C. submitted by Mr. Indian Agent Irwin for the supply of seeds.\n\nWhen Mr. Inspector Coleman visited this Agency in February in connection with the status investigation of the St. Mary's Band, he discussed with Mr. Irwin the possibilities of demonstrating to the St. Mary's Indians cultural methods of gardening in view of the wartime necessity for such development and, in this connection, held a conference with the local Provincial Agriculturist, a Mr. Allan, and Mr. Irwin. It was considered that for this year the best method of educating these Indians would be to establish an \"Illustration Plot\" on the school grounds adjoining the Reserve, having it cared for by the children in order to demonstrate gardening methods to them as well as the adult Indians, and Mr. Allan agreed that he would make a periodical visit to the school and the reserve giving the children and the Indians talks on the plot.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Irwin has marked his voucher as a charge against Vote 79 B.C. Special but if the Department considers that it is equally a school project they may feel justified in charging it to the technical education grant. Actually it serves either purpose.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1944.\n\nSchool:\n\nThe usual activity prevails at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, perhaps a little more so now when seeding operations are in full swing. On the occasion of my last visit, the children under the direction of the Rev. Principal Forbes were busy planting a large number of raspberry and a few currant bushes, about 700 in all. These operations will be followed shortly by the planting of a School garden which will consist of illustration plots of vegetables and grasses. The seeding and developing of this garden is made possible by the action of the Department in supplying the necessary seeds, fertilizers etc. The seeding and developing of the plots will be carried on by the children under the supervision of the Agricultural Representative Mr. James Allan, the Rev. Principal Forbes and the Indian Agent.\n\nThe interior of this school is always kept very clean. The meals served are well prepared, composed of wholesome appetizing food. The children too in keeping with the general environment appear to be happily and certainly very clean.\n\nThe laundry rooms, never as bright as they ought to have been for lack of proper lighting, have been kalsomined a clean and cheery white which has the effect, despite poor lighting, of making them appear very bright.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nSchool:\n\nThe holiday season has witnessed the return of the pupils of the Kootenay Indian Residential School to the various Reserves in the Agency as well as to the Okanagan from which Agency several were in attendance. In addition to the regular school routine during the last two months, gardening has had a very important place. Seeds supplied by the Department for a school garden were put in by the children. The responsibility of proper cultivation and irrigation was placed on their young shoulders under the immediate direction of Principal Forbes. So far the results are most gratifying. The plot has been carefully weeded by hand, and worked with a single horse cultivator as well as with teams of children using hoes. This fine school's garden if given the same attention by the staff during the holiday season as from the pupils during the last two months. The honours of heavy production may well be shared with the best the Cranbrook District may have to offer. That is how it looks at the end of June.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST, 1944.\n\nSchool Garden;\n\nThe School Garden has proved to be a project of real importance. Under the direction of Principal Forbes and the muscle and brawn of the pupils, a fine result has obtained, large quantities of vegetables, potatoes etc., are being produced. Sufficient and to spare for the requirements of the School for the remainder of the Fall and Winter months.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDIVISION FILE NO. 46E 1074/3-17\nSUB-DIVISION DETACHMENT Cranbrook\n\nPROVINCE British Columbia DATE October 31st-1946.\n\nRE: Jacob WHITE and Augustin WHITE (Indians)\nTransferred from St. Eugene Residential School,\nSt. Mary's Indian Reserve.\n\n1.

A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM No. 414.\nA.

STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Marie Lorne from about 2 P.M.\n\nThe immediate cause of death was fractured skull with severe brain injury.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was blow on head.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? The child was found at the time of my arrival.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nconsider death to have been entirely accidental.\n\nJ.K.

In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nThe Principal is of the opinion that additional precautions could be provided.

It can be concluded that only extraordinary and elaborate precautions could have prevented this fatality.\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nJanuary 22, 1950.\n\nStatement of circumstances regarding the death of Mary Antoinette Pascal, aged 8, pupil of the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nAt approximately 1:45 P.M. on Saturday, January 21st, 1950, I was called by the Sister in charge of the girls, Sister Mary Joan, to come at once as one of the children had been struck by ice falling from the school roof. I rushed to the girls' yard to find the above-mentioned child lying on the snow near the building with large pieces of ice surrounding her. I picked her up immediately and assisted by the nurse, Sister Paul of the Cross, brought her in the school building and laid her on a bench. A doctor was immediately summoned by telephone. While awaiting his arrival every effort was made to revive her by loosening her clothing and applying wet compresses to her head. The doctor covered the six miles from Cranbrook to the school in record time in spite of the snow and arrived I would say within fifteen minutes after the accident. On his examination he pronounced her dead.\n\nAn unusual mild spell following after several heavy snow storms had caused considerable ice to form on the edges of the school roof. The children had been warned of the danger of falling ice and had been told to keep away from the building while playing. This warning had been repeated less than ten minutes before the accident when the junior girls had been sent to the yard to play. The Sister in charge states that she personally directed them to play along the snow banks around the rink where they were making snow-men, which is about a hundred and twenty feet from the side of the school building. During the course of play the victim of the accident forgetting the warning that had been given, began running around the yard and in so doing came close to the school. Her sister and a couple of other girls shouted at her to come away from the building as Sister had said it was dangerous. Their words were hardly spoken when a quantity of ice was dislodged from the roof and fell about thirty feet striking the child and knocking her to the ground. It was in this condition that I found her when summoned.\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I., Principal.\nMr. W. S. Arneil.  \nFebruary 3, 1950.\n\ntemperature from -4 to 42 degrees above zero over a period of five hours and when I arrived at the school on the day of the accident around 2:30 P.M., the south, east and west sides of the school roof were completely clear of ice. The fatality occurred on the east side of the school.\n\nPupils questioned stated that they had been warned by the school staff not to play near the building and that at the time of the fatality they had been amusing themselves by watching the ice falling from the school roof. The dangerous condition prevailing at that time was apparent to all and in my opinion this fatality was entirely accidental with no blame attached to anyone.\n\nIn the matter of added precautions against future accidents of this kind, a flat roof protecting both east and west walls as now proposed by the Rev. Principal would, in my opinion, have been considered extraordinary prior to this accident. Any attempt to keep the roof itself clear of ice is considered impractical and would be highly dangerous to workmen. It is proposed to discuss this matter with Mr. Davies, School Inspector, during his projected visit in the near future.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,  \nSuperintendent.\n\nJSD:FSB\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, Memorandum of an inquiry into the cause and circumstances of death; copy of findings of Dr. T.J. Sullivan, Coroner; a statement by the Rev. G.F. Kelly, Principal; and a statement by Caroline Williams who witnessed the accident, in connection with the death of Mary Antoinette Pascal, born February 26, 1942, the daughter of Gustaf and Josephine Pascal, Shuswap I.R. No. 5, who while in residence at our Residential School was killed by ice falling from the school roof.\n\nThis regrettable fatality occurred at about fifteen feet north of the girls' east entrance and about twelve to fifteen feet from the east wall of the main school building. Ice dislodged from the main roof fell approximately thirty feet striking the sloping metal roof protecting the girls' sub basement entrance and bounced about six feet before striking Mary who had apparently momentarily forgotten the danger, that was apparent to all, in her excitement of a game of tag with her companion.\n\nThe ice formation on the school eaves was common to all homes and buildings in this district. Snow falling on the roof is melted by heat of the building and again freezes at the eaves and had built up to about six or eight inches over a period of extreme cold weather.

I have no objection to the choice of that locality. I think that either Cowichan or Saanich would be desirable, but as to which much depends upon the best and most convenient site which may afford a sufficient quantity of good cultivable land\u2014say 75 or 100 acres\u2014to be found in other district.\n\nIf the Department would decide that the building should be erected at Cowichan or Saanich I would visit all the reserves with the local Agent, and if you concur select\n\nThe Honorable\nThe Supt. General\nof Ind. Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\nSelect a suitable site for I consider Cowichan the more convenient of the two, owing to the facility with which supplies could be carried there by railway from Victoria which would of course lessen the cost of maintenance.\n\nIndeed the letter of Mr. MacKenzie in the \"Colonist\" wherein he suggests North Vancouver as a desirable point for the Island School.\n\nI do not however concur in this, as the West Coast of Vancouver Island is at present very isolated and communication with it is only occasional and limited. During the winter season it is completely shut out.\n\nThe Indians there although industrious with abundant facilities for getting food etc., are very backward and not by any means so far advanced as those on this side of the Island; hence, if only one Island School is to be established, at the present time, it seems almost absurd to choose the most distant and isolated part of the Country as the most appropriate location for such an establishment. Leaving aside the important question of getting supplies there the opportunities for inspection would be so seldom as to render such a duty impracticable.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Missionaries\nMissionaries are doing good work among the West Coast Indians, and I am of opinion that it would be better to help them in the maintenance of Indian education and industries, at least until further appropriations by Parliament may permit of the establishment of other schools than those now provided for.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.

Now Tom is a staunch Roman Catholic, but\n\nJ. W. Powell Esq., M. L.

H. Knowles.\nDear Mr. Dewdney:\n\nIn reply to your note of the 18th instant enclosing an extract from a letter from Mr. J.A. Mara, M.P., respecting the opening of the Industrial School at Kamloops which he states ought to take place at the beginning of the year, as the building is nearly finished and everything, he says, can be got in readiness by that date. I beg to state that the person mentioned by Mr. Mara, viz. Mr. Hagan, as principal of this Institution, was strongly recommended in April last to him by Rev. Mr. Lejacq, Principal of the St. Louis Mission, who states that Mr. Hagan has a good many points of qualification that would fit him for such a situation.\n\nI have recently received a letter from Mr. Lomas, our Indian Agent at Cowichan, reporting that the Industrial school buildings at Kuper Island have been completed.\nand that the Agent of the Department of Public Works had communicated with his Department in the matter. Mr. Lomas urges the necessity for someone being at once placed in charge of the buildings and that fires be kept in it to prevent injury to the plaster and fittings during the damp weather. He adds that the Indians throughout the Agency are looking forward to the opening of the school, and that if it be managed on the non-sectarian system he has no doubt of its success.\n\nYou will remember that for this school we have promised Mr. Gordon, M.P., that Mr. McKinnon should be appointed to the Principalship; and as respects the question of the Industrial schools at Kamloops, Kuper Island and Kootenay being of sectarian or non-sectarian character, you will remember that the point was conceded at the solicitation of the M.P.s. for the localities in favor of the Roman Catholic. Mr. McKinnon possesses high testimonials, and he is a graduate of the University of Halifax and of St. Francis Xavier College. He has degrees of M.A. from each of these Institutions. He also holds first class grade S School Teacher's certificate for British\nColumbia and first class grades B and S Academic from the Council of Public Instruction in Nova Scotia. He has taught twenty-one years in all, and was, and is still, I suppose, teaching at Mayue Island, B.C. Mr. McKinnon states that he held the position of Principal of High School for 14 years and the Principalship of Richmond County Academy, Nova Scotia, for 5 years preceding his arrival in British Columbia. Mr. McKinnon's certificates and diplomas are on file in this Department.\n\nAs respects Mr. Hagan, the proposed Principal for the Kamloops Institution, we have no knowledge of his antecedents as, or if he ever was, a teacher.\n\nIn the first instance Sir John announced in the House, when the Estimates were up for discussion in regard to the several Industrial Schools in British Columbia, that they were to be non-sectarian, the Members of Parliament for the Districts in which the schools were to be established, although they had expressed their satisfaction with Sir John's announcement, subsequently wrote favoring the claims of the Roman Catholic to the over sight of these Institutions and the\npoint was virtually yielded. Promises were made to Mr. McKinnon, a Roman Catholic, and to the Church Authorities that he would be appointed Principal of the Kuper Island, and it is probable that a similar promise was made to Mr. Mara's nominee for the Kamloops school, viz. Mr. Hagan.\n\nThe amount voted by Parliament as a capitation grant for each of these Institutions was $3,250 for the year, at the rate of $130 per head for 25 pupils. No salaries for teachers, matrons, or other employes were voted, but if it be decided to appoint both or either of the gentlemen above named no doubt the fact that none of the capitation grants has been used since the 1st of July will enable us to pay a salary or salaries to the Principals for the remainder of the year, should the salaries not exceed $800 each, which is the amount paid to the Principal of the Metlakahtla Institution. Of course besides their salaries, the Principals and other employes would have free board and lodging at the respective Institutions.\n\nThe Hon. E. Dewdney,\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs,\n\nSincerely yours\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemo Mr. Van Rongen.\n\nI think Mr. Hagan should be appointed to Kamloops school & Mr. Simon to Wapser School at $800 each per an. say from the 1st January. In the meantime I presume furniture will have to be provided. Have we any money for that purpose? If not can we use any of the appropriation for capitation grants. We will have to go slow with these schools at first and keep down the number of pupils.\n\nIf our Catholic Inspector was any good it would have been well to send him over. I suppose it would not do to send Mr. Rae.\n\nVowell I hear will be ready for duty 1st December. He might attend to the furnishing. Beds & fancy should be sent from here. I will run over & have a talk with you on these matters sometime today.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\nDear Mr. Dewdney,\n\nIn reply to your note of this date respecting the Kamloops and Super Island Industrial Schools, I beg to state that I think we should have sufficient money to pay for the furniture for these institutions, as well as for supplies of food to start them, besides paying the proposed salaries to the Principals, but we shall have to get a supplementary vote to carry us over the fiscal year. I shall have an estimate made of what amount will be required. There will be no objection to our using the Capitation Grant for the above purposes, as a large portion of it, you know, is unexpended.\n\nI note what you say about the necessity of\nof keeping down the number of pupils for the present.\n\nI do not think it would do to send Macrae to supervise the provision of furniture. Vowell, no doubt, when he assumes his duties could attend quite efficiently to this, but Moffatt is quite competent himself to purchase what is necessary, and I do not think he would be extravagant at all.\n\nI suppose I had better write to Lomas to place some respectable person in charge of the Cuper Island School, who would keep it moderately heated, so as to prevent the injury from dampness being done to the plaster and fittings as apprehended by him.\n\nWhen the institutions are under way we shall have to provide a Matron and a Cook at least, for each, and probably a Housemaid as well, but I think we can manage all this, pending our obtaining a\na supplementary vote.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon. E. Dewdney,\nSupt. General of\nIndian Affairs.\nDear Mr. Lomas,\n\nI have your note of the 11th instant, reporting the completion of the Industrial School buildings at Rupert Island, and recommending that stoves be at once placed therein, and the building kept heated in order to prevent serious injury to the plaster and fittings during the damp weather. I note what you say also in regard to the keys of the building being still with the officer of the Dept. of Public Works, likewise that the Indians are looking forward to the opening of the school and that if this be done on the non-sectarian system there will be no doubt of its success. I shall write Mr. Moffatt at once in respect to the matter of the heating of the building, and the appointment temporarily of a caretaker. The officer of the Public Works will no doubt deliver over the keys to you when he learns that a person has been appointed to take charge.\n\nAs regards the religious character of the Institution, I have to state that it is to be Roman Catholic, and that Mr. M. McKimmon, who holds very good certificates and is an M.A. of the University\nUniversity at Halifax, that of St. Francis Xavier College, and who has been a Principal of a High School for nineteen years, is to be appointed to the Principalship of the Institution.\n\nI &c.\nH. Moffatt, Esq.,\nActing Indian Visiting Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that I am advised that the buildings for the Industrial Indian Institution at Kuper Island have been completed, and those at Kamloops nearly so. It has been represented to the Dept. that it is desirable that during the damp season they should be kept heated in order to prevent injury to the plaster and fittings. I have to request that you will communicate with the Indian Agents for these localities, and instruct them to place some reliable persons as temporary caretakers in the buildings, and you will furnish such stoves as will be sufficient to heat the buildings, so as to prevent the injury apprehended.\n\nThe keys of the Kuper Island, I am informed, are still with the Dominion Engineer, but he, no doubt, will deliver them over to the person whom you may nominate as caretaker, upon his being informed of his appointment.\n\nI enclose a statement of the furniture which it is thought it will be necessary to supply to each of these Institutions.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\nI should be glad if you would revise the same, and inform me whether you consider it will answer, or what additions or deductions you would recommend therein. You might, pending final instructions, ascertain on what terms most favourable to the Dept. the articles enumerated in the list, or such others as you may consider necessary, can be purchased.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\nconsidered as an official offer on the part of the Indian Department (which you represent) to this Company to undertake the management of the School in question. Will you be so good as to favour me with an explanation of the information of the Company, and at the same time kindly let me know whether there is any chance of the arrangements as to Roman Catholic Management being considered.\n\n(2) Conditions of Government Grants to Indian Schools.\n\nAs was stated to you by the Commissioners at this juncture, the income of the Company is much less than it was a few years ago, and the Company having been informed that the Dominion Government, through the Department which you represent, is in the habit of giving large subsidies to several Indian Schools, I am disposed to ask on what conditions a similar grant might be made to the Mohawk Institution. I venture to think that the past work of the Company is a sufficient guarantee that any subsidy so granted will be wisely used, and such a grant would enable the Company to extend the usefulness of the Institution in many ways.\n\nYou may be interested to know that in the recommendation of their Commissioners the Company desired to adopt that policy dealing with the Mohawk Tribe, and Mr. Bentzfeldt, which you have found enough to support to the Commissioners and Mr. Ashton at this juncture.\n\nSept 18th 1845\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLETTER FROM W. H. LOMAS, ESQ.\n\n3.\u2014W. H. LOMAS, ESQ., to the CLERK.\n\n[Received 15th December.]\n\nCOWICHAN INDIAN AGENCY,\nQUAMICHEAN, B.C.,\nNovember 19, 1885.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014It was reported some time ago that the New England Society contemplated, at some future date, establishing an Industrial School for native children on their station at Kuper Island, Chemainus.\n\nAs I have held the appointment of Indian Agent for some years, I take the liberty of addressing you on the subject. I do this at the present time that I may urge the great benefit that would be conferred on the Indian children if an orphanage were established at once, if only on a small scale, to be afterwards enlarged and extended into an industrial establishment if thought advisable.\n\nI know of no locality on the coast so well adapted as Kuper Island, where you already have some good buildings.\n\nThe expense of establishing an orphanage school there would not be great, while it would have so many advantages. I think that suitable buildings and furniture might be provided for \u00a3200, and that a similar yearly outlay would, with the aid of the Dominion grant to Indian schools and subscriptions from Europeans and natives, be sufficient to pay all expenses for a few years to come. I think an orphanage would be the best method starting an industrial school, from the fact that orphan children among these Indians are often neglected, and when at school would not be liable to be taken away, like other children, by the wandering habits of their parents; and, were a good school established, it would naturally draw to it many day scholars, and I fancy also distant Indians would soon be willing to send their children, paying for their board. Of course I mean those Indian who live in isolated positions.\n\nShould your Society be in a position to make any move in the matter, I should be happy to confer with Mr. Roberts.\nDear Sir,\u2014I take the liberty of again urging upon your Society the great benefit they would confer upon the Indians of this coast by opening an Orphanage and School in connection with your Mission on Kuper Island.\n\nI trust the funds of the Company may this year be in a more flourishing condition, and that you may see your way to make a start (even on a small scale) towards the commencement of an institution of this kind.\n\nAt the present time there is a strong wish on the part of Indian parents to have their children educated, and there is no place near Chemainus so suitable as yours on Kuper Island; there are so many Indian villages within easy access of it, and no one of them has enough children to ask for a School for themselves; but many of the parents have expressed a wish to send their children as weekly boarders if Mr. Roberts could accommodate them.\n\nMrs. Roberts is very popular with the Indians and has their confidence, and, I think, would make a successful matron of an establishment of the kind, having under her an assistant and an Indian steward.\n\nI feel sure the Indian Department of the Dominion would be willing to give substantial support to any Society commencing an Orphanage and Industrial School, and none could do so with such a small outlay and with such prospects of success as yours.\n\nThe Indians have already requested me to reserve a piece of land adjoining your farm for a School Reserve.\n\nA very great improvement has taken place in the Kuper Island Indians since the residence of Mr. Roberts on the Island; and although the School is small, and Indians often away, the parents are beginning to see the advantage of having their children educated. Last winter, Mrs. Roberts had a night school for young men, and if they were slow in mastering the three \"R's\" the result has been very beneficial in other respects.\n\nTrusting to hear from you on the subject,\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

The only references to the subject to be found in the correspondence addressed to the Company are semi-official ones in letters written by Mr. W. H. Lomas, Indian Agent at Cowichan, of which I enclose copies. Mr. R. J. Roberts, the Company's missionary at Hope Island, also referred to the matter in the following terms in a letter dated the 16th Nov., 1885: \"I wish to inform you that a few short time ago, Mr. Lomas, Indian agent, told me that he is again making an effort to raise funds for the establishment of an orphanage for Indian children on this island, or elsewhere and that he and Mr. Powell (Indian Superintendent) would probably make another application to the New England Company for a grant in aid of that object.

Vaughtonner Esq.,\nDeputy Chief Council,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg respectfully to draw your attention to the \"rumor\" prevalent in this Province concerning dissatisfaction & indignation among many members of different Native Churches,\" viz., that the Industrial School for Indian Children, established on this island for the benefit of the tribe along the East Coast of Vancouver Island from Porte & Cowichan is about to be handed over by the Indian Department to the management & the supreme control of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI hope the rumor is not true, I hope it is an account of the report I have always had to hear from the Indian Department, & for the Governor who represented British Columbia in the House of Commons.\n\nAs I reside on this island, I am here as a missionary of the New England Company, I have been here the last two years. I wish to bring under your notice the following facts:\n\n1. For 17 years I was a missionary of the New England Company at the Big Nation Indian Reserve, County of Bamfield, B.C. My health failing me I came to this province & in the year 1879 Mr. Gilbert & Mr. Powell (both at that time officials of the Indian Department) induced the New England Company to purchase 100 acres of land here, to establish a mission & day school. I paid an official visit to this island in 1879, to see if suitable inquiries as to the land, the desire of the Indians for a school, etc.\nI said that bird at the request, given in writing by Mr. Sproul. He recommended this island and the adjacent islands as a most desirable sphere for the operations of the New England Company, the oldest Protestant Missionary Society to Indians existing in England. Neither Mr. Sproul nor Dr. Powell informed me that there was a Roman Catholic Mission on this island, neither did the Indians inform me. And moreover the Indians here assured me that they would be glad to have a missionary sent to them to a day school established among them by the New England Company. In the year 1870 that Company bought the land here, and established a Mission, a day school for the Indians, and ever since that time I have been constantly resident on the island, and the day school & Mission have been in operation. It was some months after I came here that I learned that a Roman Catholic Priest was in the habit of paying a monthly visit of a day or so to the island. He came from Cowichan, some 16 miles distant. He did not reside on Skopey, but I have been constantly residing here. The New England Company expended large sums of money in building a Mission House, a school house, and in carrying on their work for the spiritual & secular improvement of the Indians. I have also expended between four or five hundred dollars in the purchase of medicines for the sick Indians & ministered to the sick no matter what denomination they belonged. I treated them to the best of my ability, looked after all their troubles. Being constantly on the island it was to me all the Indians of Rupert\nMany from other places came & in advice in their trouble & help in sickness when provisions were scarce, I would also like to mention that I got a road made from one end of the island to the other.\n\nNow after these 10 years of labour and expenditure begun at the instance of officers of the Indian Department it is reported that your department has actually given the Industrial School over to the control & management of the Roman Catholic Church or the Priest of that Church who resides N.W. on the island but 16 miles away at Cowichan.\n\nNow Sir I would respectfully ask you kindly to give me the information which for want of order I will in the following numbered questions.\n\n1. Is it true that the Roman Catholic Church or the Priest of that Church are to have the management of the Industrial School here?\n\n2. Are the Managing Priest privileged to take up their abode in the school for one or more days & nights whenever they please?\n\n3. Are they to have the privilege of selecting the pupils?\n\n4. Are they to prescribe the studies, the books & the instruction to be imparted to the pupils?\n\n5. Are they privileged to give the Indian pupils religious as well as secular instruction, and train them up in the tenets or dogmas peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church?\n\nWas the money voted for this Industrial School by the House of Commons, Sir?\nat the time it was voted or at any other\ntime, to be used solely for a non-sectarian\nsecular education; or was it provided to\npermitted by Act of Parliament that\nthe money voted for the school should or\nmight be applied to the dissemination of\nthe tenets or dogmas of the Roman Catholic\nChurch, &c., the exclusion of all other religious\nteaching?\n\nIs this Industrial School to be classified a\nRoman Catholic Seminary?\n\nAs I am a missionary of the Church of England &\nin the employment of the New England Company\nCompany, &c., friend of the Indians, you will\nsure see that it is important for me to have infor-\nmation on the point above mentioned. And I\nam sure you will kindly give it to me.\n\nMany of the Indians here have attached themselves\nto our Mission. The Wesleyans have a good many\nadherents at Manawago & other places in the district,\nfor which the school has been established, but\nfrom lack of means &c., &c., if the\nschool is not be Non-Sectarian\u2014& though paid for by the State out of the\npublic funds\u2014it is to be a close preserve\nfor the Roman Church, it is certain that a\ncasting disatisfaction with the action of\nthe Indian Department will exist, &c.,\npersistent opposition be given to the\nsame.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRobert James Robert,\nChurch of England Missionary\nOf the New England Company\nCopy of letter from Mr. Chisholm dated April 5th 1890\nOriginal on file 48462\n\nDear Mr. Sinclair,\n\nMr. Macrae & Mr. Gordon M.R., have both been informed that as soon as the Industrial schools at Kamloops and Tusper Island are sufficiently advanced Mr. Macrae will be sent over to assist in starting them.

Sir:\n\nI beg to ack. the receipt of yr letter of the 13th ult. relat. to the Ind. School for Ind. Children which this dept has established on Kuper Is. & in reply I have the honor to inform you, that the Govt., in the exercise of the responsibility which devolves upon it in connection with such matters, decides that the Institution in question shall be a R.C. sch.. The favorable principle therein which I believe led to the Govt coming to this conclusion was the fact that the Ind. adherents of the R.C. ch on Vancouver Is. do far exceed in number those of the Protestant.\nand denominations, that it was well known that were this institu-\ntion to be made a Protestant or non-sectarian such the\nR.C. parents would be pro-\nhibited by their clergy from allow-\ning their children to be educ-\nated therein. With regard to\nthe statements made by you\nin reference to your own ser-\nvices as a missionary among\nthe Indo Coth of Ont. & B.C.\nI beg to inform you that the\ndefect was not previously un-\naware of the facts stated\nby you, so as respects the\nencouragement given you by\nMr. Gilbert Speer & Mr.\nPovell to establish a mission\n& day school & super had\nto be conducted for the benefit\nof the Indo under the auspices\nof the New England Co., I\nhave to remind you that the\nestablishment of the Indenture\nschool was the same held\nnot interfere with yr work in connection with the mission or day school which has been hitherto conducted by you; as regards the action of the two gentlemen above referred to, this dept does not hold itself responsible for advice given by its officers in such matters to missionaries, & I may state that Mr Short was not a permanent officer of the dept but was merely employed as Ind. Res. Commr., an office which he subsequently occupied for which will not be continued after all the Res's in B.C. have been allotted to the Indians.\n\nWith regard to the management of the industrial institution at Kupa I do beg to inform you that the R.C. priests are not to be consulted therein but that a Principal, Mr. McKinnon, a most competent man, has been\nappointed to manage the institution. The Principal will, after consultation with the advice of such other parties as he may consider competent to give advice, select the pupils for the Institution. The curriculum to be followed thereafter will be determined by the Dept. The money voted by Parliament was for the establishment of an Ind. Industrial School for the benefit of said children in Vancouver Isd. I am not aware that there will be any objection to the children of Protestant Jews entering the Institution notwithstanding that it is to be conducted under the auspices of the R.C Church.\n\nWith regard to the excluding portion of the letter I beg to state that had the Industrial School in question been constituted a Protestant or non-Jewish...\nInstitution there is no doubt\nThat as much, if not more\ndissatisfaction would be occasioned thereby among the adherents of the R.C. Church as persistent opposition would be given to the same, so an affluence will be the result of its being having been constituted a R.C.

Any arrangement which your Department can make with His Lordship by which the School will with its entire staff be under the complete control of the Roman Catholic Church except in the\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n3 stories with music, and being as a race passionately fond of music, there would be no difficulty in keeping the number of scholars fully up to the capacity of the building. It would also relieve the Government from the disagreeable effects of the over officiousness of Protestant subordinates thrusting upon the school books, servants, etc., utterly distasteful to the Church; as to any popular cry against the Government were they to accede to His Lordship's request you need not have any fear. A half dozen agitators do not make the communities who are conscious of the successful efforts of Catholic clergy under most trying circumstances.\n\n2 matter of Government inspection as in the denominational schools in the N.W.T. will I am confident prove the only sure road to success among the Indians and that above all other considerations is I know to be the desire of the Department, and to give full effect to His Lordship's wishes will be also carrying out your assurances to myself in your private letter dated Feb 15th 1889. The experiment of conducting the school with lay teachers already indicates failure. To the mind of a young Indian there is no charm in the drill that of a lay teacher's A.B.C., whereas as under a clerical teacher their exercise would be inter-\nIn elevating the Indians of British Columbia and of Cowichan particularly. At any rate in so far as I am politically or otherwise concerned I am willing to take my full share of the responsibility. I advising you as one of the Government to accede to His Lordship's wishes and place the School directly under his charge.\n\nTrusting that you will give the propositions herein referred to your earnest and favorable consideration,\n\nI am, my dear Sir,\n\nYours Truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum\n\nThe Department has been informed by Mr. Supt. Vowell, who has forwarded Mr. Inspector Macne's report of his inspection of the Indian Industrial School at Kuper Island, that Mr. McKinney, the late Principal, proved to be incompetent to exercise that function in the school, and had been requested to tender his resignation. The Dept. has been informed that he has done so, and that the Rev. G. Douchele has been appointed acting Principal. I have no doubt that, while in British Columbia, you will be made fully aware of all the facts in connection with this matter, and the offer which has been made by the Bishop of Vancouver Island to assume the sole control of the Institution on the following terms:\n\n1. A yearly grant of $1,800 certain.\n2. A yearly allowance of $140 per pupil.\n\nThe alternative arrangement is that the Dept. will furnish provisions, clothing, tools and all other necessaries and of salaries, board and lodging of employees.\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Vankoughnet and in view of the fact of your presence in British Columbia, I have decided to impart to you these details in the hope that definite steps may be taken during your stay in British\nBritish Columbia to settle the matter.\n\nActing Supt.

Indian Office\nVictoria Nov 19th 1890.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith the letter of the Right Revd Bishop Lemmens accidentally omitted to have been enclosed in Superintendent Vowell's communication of yesterday's date No. 285.X.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.Moffatt.\n\nL. VanKoughnet Esq.,\nDeputy Dept. General\nof Ind. Affairs.\nExtract from Hon. J. David's letter to the Minister of Justice Oct. 13th, 1890.\n\nRe. the Industrial School at Rupert Island.\n\nI recently visited this school, which is being carried on under the care of Father Donchel\u00e9, one of the Missionary Priests of the diocese, and I was surprised and pleased at the manner in which it is conducted. Although having been but six weeks in operation when I visited the school about a month ago, these children show great advancement. There were only 16 children, but scores of others would be willing to come.\nWhen Father Donckle took charge, it was difficult to get any of the boys to remain there at all, but his efforts have made the school an inviting place for the boys, and you could hardly drive away those who are there now.\n\nImprovement to the system, and cheapening to the Dominion Govt might, however, be made, if the priests were given more control. As it is, they find themselves impeded by the regulations, which require them to submit every proposal for expenditure, however small, to the Indian Office; and which require all of the supplies to be ordered by the Indian Agent, and not by the priests. The Indian Agent does not and cannot understand what is required, and the consequence is\nis that utterly useless articles are furnished for the use of the school. For instance, instead of small iron bedsteads, which could be procured at slight expense, large three-quarter bedsteads are provided for each boy, one half of the number of which bedsteads only can be put in a room which could accommodate a suitable number of smaller bedsteads. The bedding is necessarily more, and the work considerably in excess of what would ordinarily be required. Clothing is ordered by contract, and is supplied without any regard whatever to the ages of the youths who are to make use of it. The material is of the worst, and it is quite plainly to be seen that some storekeeper has had, and taken advantage of.\nof an opportunity for throwing in all the refuse stuff, for the use of the boys, which he could sell to nobody else. The supply of provisions is also upon the same plan. Large quantities of butter and bacon, which the boys could not consume in a year, are supplied, the inevitable result of which is that much of it will go bad\u2014has gone bad in fact already\u2014and be entirely lost; and probably it was not an article fit for food at the time it was purchased.\n\nBeing Catholics, of course there is no meat eaten on Fridays; and the regulations require that fish shall be given to the boys at least once a week. It is hardly necessary to remark that there are no fish markets around Rupert Island, and...\nand, as you may imagine, the only chance of getting fish is from the Indians, who are there, almost daily, in their canoes, and from whom the article can, at all times, be procured on the spot. But there, again, the regulations step in and prevent the Fathers from getting any fish at all unless they pay for it out of their own pockets, because, before an article \u2014 whether it be a pound of fish or a pound of candles \u2014 can be purchased, permission has to be obtained from the Indian Agent, who is distant some 25 miles away, and a request and answer could not be made under at least 3 days. The result is that no fish can be procured for these boys, except as\nas previously mentioned. I asked Father D'Onckele whether he could not procure the fish, and send in vouchers for his own reimbursement afterwards, but he informed me that the regulations strictly forbade any such proceeding on his part or the purchase of anything, which he had not first of all permission to buy.\n\nThe above are only a few instances out of many that might be given of the present state of affairs, small matters in themselves, but at the same time, such as might be remedied, with advantage to the institution, and economy to the Department, for if the priests had the furnishing of all these things they would see that...\nthat everything purchased was suitable, and bought at the cheapest rate.\n\nIt was proposed to the Bishop here, by the Indian Department, that he should accept a lump sum per head, to provide, and carry on the institution. This however, the Bishop could not entertain, as such a proposal might result in a loss and possibly in a profit. The priests, in conducting it, ask no profit, but they certainly cannot submit to the possibility of a loss. The Government can be sure of the institution being run strictly at cost, if given an entire charge of the priests.\n\nI thought that mention of matters pertaining to the school might be of service in discussing the\nthe subject with your colleagues.\nOttawa, Nov. 27th, 1890.\n\nDear Mr. Vankoughnet,\n\nI am not sure whether you have seen the enclosed extract from a letter from the Hon. T. Davie to the Minister of Justice re the Industrial School at Kuper Island. In case not, I send it herewith.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.

Please see letter No. 73374\n\nTo Chief Clerk\n\nPlease see letter No. 73376\nLetter 73274.\n\nThe Indian girls at Qu'Appelle Orphan Asylum.\n\nI am not aware that it was the intention to admit girls to the Kuper Island schools. Engrants were made for pupils of the sex, and then no grant from the allowance for maintenance of the children at the Orphan Asylum could properly be charged. It might however be provided in the same way for boys under 16 years of age per annum. This is a very moderate charge but it is problematical what privileges or benefits would be enjoyed by children admitted to an Orphan Asylum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum\n\nIn regard to the matters in connection with the Rupert Island Industrial School referred to in the Hon. T. Davies' letter to the Minister of Justice, an extract from which was forwarded with a note from the Superintendent General to the undersigned, dated the 29th ultimo, it may be stated,\n\n(1) That, as regards Mr. Davies' statement that the regulations of the Department require that all of the supplies for the Industrial School at Rupert Island should be ordered by the Indian Agent and not by anyone in charge of the same.\n\nTo the Honorable,\n\nE. Newbury\nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nsystem prevails in connection with all Indian Industrial Schools, and as to Mr. Davis's statement that the Indian Agent does not and cannot understand what is required, and that the consequence is that utterly useless articles are furnished for the use of the schools, it may be stated that the sooner an Agent familiarizes himself with the requirements of a school so as to determine what is necessary and what is unnecessary when applications for supplies are made, the better it will be in the interests of the Government.\n\n(2) Mr. Davis instances the purchase of double bedsteads instead of single bedsteads for the institution. The undersigned would state that the Indian Agent had nothing to do with the equipment of the school in the first instance, that the articles were purchased by Mr. Vowell, the Indian Superintendent at Victoria, and there was no doubt an error committed by him in purchasing double instead of single bedsteads. This can\ncan, however, be remedied, and the undersigned will write to Mr. Nowell in the matter.\n\n(3.) Mr. Davis states that clothing was supplied without any regard to the ages of the youths for whom it was intended, that the materials of the worst, and that it is quite plainly to be seen that some storekeeper has had, and taken advantage of, an opportunity for throwing in all the refuse stuff for the use of the boys which he could sell to nobody else. The undersigned begs to protest,\n\n(a.) With regard to the clothing not being of exactly a good fit, it must be remembered that the clothing had to be supplied before the boys were at the school, in order that, as they entered the institution, they might be clothed.\n\n(b.) With regard, however, to the inference drawn by Mr. Davis, that there has been some jobbery in connection with the supplying of the material as the latter is of the worst description he says, the undersigned considers that this is a very serious and grave\ngrave statement to make, and he thinks that Mr. Visiting Superintendent Vowell should be informed of the intelligence that has reached the Department in regard to the quality of the clothing, and that he should be instructed to report fully upon the statement that some person has taken advantage of the Department by palming off inferior stuff for the use of the boys. In connection with this matter, however, it is proper to state that Mr. School Inspector Mac Rae, in his report of inspection regarding the Rupert Island School, while he does refer to the large size of the bedsteads, makes no allusion whatever to the inferiority of the material composing the pupils' suits, and it may be further stated that no complaint was ever received from the Principal in regard to either the quality of the cloth or the manner in which the clothing was made up. The supplies were purchased from C. Stone & Co., Victoria, and it may be added that...\nthat this firm has furnished similar clothing for the Industrial School at Mactaquac and at Kamloops, and that no complaint in respect to the quality of the same have been received.\n\n(c) As respects Mr. Davis's further remark about the large quantity of butter and bacon supplied, and the risk of the same going bad, and the statement that some of it \"has gone bad in fact,\" and that in all probability it was not an article fit for food at the time it was purchased, it may be remarked that as regards the quantity of butter, 145 lbs were purchased in March last, and no more was required until October, when 66 additional pounds were purchased. This does not appear to be a very extravagant consumption of butter within seven months, in an institution containing between 20 and 30 boys, besides the Principal, Matron and servants, though a less quantity might perhaps, at times, than 145 lbs, have been purchased. With regard to bacon, 207 lbs were...\nwere purchased in March, 5\u00bd lbs. in September and 160 lbs in October.\n\nThe remarks above made in respect to the quantity of butter are also applicable to the bacon.\n\nAs regards fresh meat, beef has been supplied in moderate quantities, and as respects fish, salt fish has been sent from Victoria in sufficient quantities. And in regard to fresh fish being purchased by the Principal when required, in which Mr. Davis states he is not now allowed to do, the undersigned thinks that there could be no objection to permitting the Principle to buy, under certain restrictions, a limited quantity of fresh fish, but he is of the impression that the purchasing power generally for such institutions should not be vested in other than the responsible officers of the Department.\n\nShould the Superintendent General approve, the undersigned would write to Mr. Superintendent Vorwell in respect to these various subjects of complaint and\nand request a full report from him in regard to the same.\n\nA.

General of Indian Affairs.\nKuper Island Industrial School,\nFebruary 9th, 1891.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you, that acting upon your suggestion, I have asked the Sisters of St. Ann to assume the Matronship of this School and discharge the other duties which now are performed by the Curran girls and they have answered me that they consent to do so.\n\nI have not mentioned to them any conditions but I suppose that they will enjoy the same privileges as in the Kamloops Industrial School; if I am not mistaken but there are at that school, two Sisters and a lay Assistant.\n\nI would respectfully request you to be good enough to communicate with the Sisters in Victoria, on the above subject or else to let me know your directions in that matter.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Macdonald\nPrime Minister\nof Canada\n\nI am informed by\nthe local Indian Com-\nmissioner or Superintendent\nMr. Bowell, that from\nthe 1st Jan. next the Indian\nIndustrial school of Naden\nIsland B.C. is to be\nconducted on the \"per\ncapita\" plan, with a\nyearly allowance of\n$130.00 per pupil, according\nto the average attendance.\nTrust the Indian Depart-\nment will see fit to re-\nconsider the conditions\nproposed.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\nbased, at least in re-\ngard to the sum allowed,\nwhich is far too small\nfor the school, as will\nappear from the following:\n1st With the present ac-\ncommodation the school\ncan admit only about\n35 pupils, the average is\nnot likely to be much\nover 30, yet the expenses\nof salaries for Principal,\nteacher and servants will\nbe the same as it would\nbe with fifty pupils.\n2nd The school being\nsituate on an island,\nwithout regular com-\nmunication by steamer,\nthe expenses for freight\nare very considerable.\n3rd For the same reason\nwhenever it is necessary to\nsend for a doctor, the fee\ncharged is in proportion\nto the trouble and loss of\ntime.\ntime occasioned by a visit to the island.\n\n4th There are about 30 acres of land connected with the school. In order to bring that portion of it, which is fit for agricultural purposes, under cultivation, it will be necessary to spend money in draining and clearing the same. So far there is only a small garden patch, cleared by the boys, under cultivation.\n\n5th There are also several out-houses, such as workshops, laundry, bakery, etc.\n\n6th The children will have to be fed as plentifully and clothed as comfortably in the future as they have been till now. It is owing mainly to the substantial food and good clothing provided that...\nthat we have been able\nto induce the Indians to\nsend their children to\nthe school. The Indians on the coast\ndo not, like those in the\ninterior, suffer from want\nof food; they can with\nbut little trouble procure\nthe necessaries of life;\nhence their children are\nused to being well fed\nat home; and the school\nwould soon fall into\ndisrepute with the Indians\nif the meals provided for\nthe pupils be lacking,\neither in quality or in\nquantity, as they of ne-\ncessity must be with\nan allowance such as\nis proposed.\n\nI believe the allowance\nof $130.00 will be sufficient\nwhen there is accom-\nmodation for such an\nactual attendance of at\nleast\nleast 50 pupils, with a few acres of good land under cultivation.\n\nIn the meantime I fear that the sum will be considerably increased, or else that the school be conducted as before. It would be a great pity to impair the usefulness of the institution, which is certainly one of the best factors in the work of civilization among the Indians. And in view of the great good that is being done in these Industrial schools, I would be willing to make a sacrifice for the one entrusted to us rather than see it lowered in the esteem of the Indians by a system of undue economy. But I cannot believe that a government which had the\nthe necessity of establishing these schools throughout the land, should have the intention of shifting on to other shoulders a part of the burden of their maintenance.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that Mr. J. Scott, Assistant Commissioner at Regina, be sent out hither to enquire into the probable cost of a school like that of Upper Island. He could at the same time see the one at Kamloops. I have full confidence in the integrity of this gentleman, and am willing to accept what he shall consider a fair estimate.\n\nHave the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n1895, Vancouver, BC\nSir,\n\nI am informed by the local Indian Commissioner or Superintendent Mr. Vowell, that from the 1st of Jan. next the Indian Industrial school of Kuper Island B.C. is to be conducted on the \"per capita\" plan, with a yearly allowance of $130 per pupil according to the average attendance. I trust the Indian Department will see fit to reconsider the conditions proposed at least in regard to the sum allowed, which is far too small for this school, as will appear from the following:\n\n1. With the present accommodations the school can admit only about 35 pupils; the average is not likely to be much over 20; yet the expenses of salaries for principal, teachers and servants will be the same as it would be with fifty pupils.\n\n2. The school being situated on an island, without regular communication by steamer, the expenses for freight are very considerable.\n\n3. For the same reason whenever it is necessary to send for a doctor, the fee charged is in proportion to the trouble and loss of time occasioned by a visit to the island.\n\n4. There are about 30 acres of land connected...\nwith the school. In order to bring that portion of it, which is fit for agricultural purposes, under cultivation, it will be necessary to spend money in draining and clearing the same.

It is owing mainly to the substantial food and good clothing provided, that we have been able to induce the Indians to send their children to the school. The Indians on the coast do not, like those in the interior, suffer for want of food; they can with little trouble procure the necessaries of life; hence their children are used to being well fed at home, and the school would soon fall into disrepute with the Indians, if the meals provided for the pupils be lacking either in quality or in quantity, as they of necessity must be with an allowance such as is proposed.\n\nI believe the allowance of $150 will be sufficient when there is accommodation for and an actual attendance of at least 50 pupils, with a few acres of good land under cultivation.\n\nIn the meantime I beg that the sum be considerably increased, or else that the school be\nconducted as before. It would be a great pity to impair the usefulness of the institution, which is certainly one of the best factors in the work of civilization among our Indians. And in view of the great good that is being done in these Industrial Schools, I would be willing to make a sacrifice for the one entrusted to us, rather than see it lowered in the esteem of the Indians by a system of undue economy. But I cannot believe that a government which had the generosity of establishing these schools throughout the land, should have the intention of shifting onto other shoulders a part of the burden of their maintenance.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that Mr. Forgette, Assistant Commissioner at Regina, be sent out hither to inquire into the probable cost of a school like that of Kapler Island. He could at the same time see the one at Kamloops. I have full confidence in the integrity of this gentleman, and I am willing to accept what he shall consider a fair estimate.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. N. Emmens\nBp. Vancouver Jt.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\n\nI forward herewith copy of a letter from Bishop Emmens of Vancouver Island, taking exception to the proposal to apply the per capita principle of allowance to the Rupert Island School after the 1st January next.\n\nI will remember that, in accordance with\nInstructions received from Mr. Sup't Vowell was directed to notify the Church authorities under whose auspices the Industrial Schools at Temiskaming and at Kamloops are conducted that the Dept. from the 1st January next would limit the allowance to be made to each of these schools to the per capita grant, and that while it would continue the payment of the salaries to the officers of these institutions until\nthe 30th June next, in order to prevent any interruption in the work of conducting the school, after that date the officers of the institutions, as well as the other expenses, would have to be paid out of the per capita grant. I place herewith a copy of the letter which was written to Mr. Vowell in the matter.\n\nWould you be good enough to inform me as\nto what reply should be sent to the Bishop's letter?\n\nI may add in this connection that the original proposal in regard to the contribution from this Dept to these schools was that no more than the $130 per capita allowance was to be granted; but, owing to representations made by members of Parliament in favor of certain parties,\nthis was departed from\nand salaries were included\nin the estimates.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon. E. Demassey\nDept. Sect. of Ind. Affairs.\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nNov. 10th. 1891.\n\nMr. A. W. Vowell\nSupt. Indian Affairs\nVictoria.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn reply to your letter informing me that, from January 1st. 1892, the Kuper Island Indian Industrial School is to be conducted on the \"per capita\" plan, I beg to state that I trust the Indian Department will be induced to reconsider the conditions proposed in that plan, at least in regard to the yearly sum allowed, viz $130 per pupil according to the average attendance, which sum is far too small for this school, as will appear from the following considerations:\n\n1. With the present accommodations the Kuper I'd School can admit only about 35 pupils, and the average attendance is not likely to be much over 30, the expense of salaries for teachers and servants being the same as it would be with 50 pupils.\n\n2. There about 30 acres of land connected with the School, and in order to bring that portion of\nof it, which is fit for agriculture, under cultivation, it will be necessary to spend a large amount in draining and clearing the same. There is only a small garden patch, cleared by the boys, under cultivation so far.\n\n3. The school being situated on an Island the expenses for freight are very considerable.\n\n4. For the same reason, whenever it is necessary to send for a doctor, the fee charged is in proportion to the trouble and loss of time occasioned by a visit to the Island.\n\n5. There are as yet no outhouses such as workshops, laundry, bakery etc.\n\n6. The children will have to be fed as plentifully and clothed as comfortably in the future, as they have been till now. It is owing mainly to the substantial food and good clothing provided, that we have been able to induce the Indians to send their children to the school. The Indians on this Coast do not, like those in the Interior, suffer for want of food; they can with little trouble procure the necessaries of life; hence their children are used to being well fed at home, and the school will soon fall into disrepute with the Indians if the food provided be lacking either in quality.\nquality or in quantity, as of necessity it must be with an allowance such as is proposed.\n\n7. I might add that on account of the rocky nature of the beach where the children have to play, their shoes wear out very fast, which causes an increase of expenditure which is not to be overlooked; but enough has been said to show that the \"per capita\" allowance of $150 is inadequate for the present requirements.\n\nI believe the allowance will be sufficient when there is accommodation for and an actual attendance of at least 50 pupils, with a few acres of good land under cultivation.\n\nIn the meantime I beg that the sum be considerably increased, or else that the school be conducted as before. It would be a great pity to impair the usefulness of the institution. I have no hesitation in saying that it is one of the best factors in the work of civilization among the Indians, and the Government deserves deep gratitude from the natives and the highest praise from all those who have the natives' best interests at heart, for having established these Industrial Schools throughout the\nthe land. And in view of the great good that is done by these schools I would be willing to make a sacrifice for the one that is entrusted to us, rather than see it lowered in the esteem of the Indians by a policy of exaggerated economy. But I cannot conceive that it is the intention of a Government that had the generosity to establish these schools, to shift onto other shoulders the burden of their maintenance.\n\nFeeling assured from a knowledge of your own sincere concern for the efficiency of the Kuper Island School and for the welfare of the Indians in general, that the above considerations will receive your kind attention.\n\nI remain\n\nRespectfully yours\n\n(Signed) J.

Gordon, Esq., dated at Nanaimo on the 2nd inst., addressed to the Hon. the Premier, and in respect to the subject matter of which the Supt. General of Indian Affairs, before leaving for the North West, desired that the undersigned should furnish a report to the First Minister, the undersigned begs to make the following statement:\n\nThe rumour mentioned in Mr. Gordon's letter as having recently reached him, that the Principal of the Industrial School at Kuper Island had been notified that after the 1st of January next the Department of Indian Affairs would limit the allowance to be made to that school to a per capita grant of $130.00 per annum for each pupil, the aggregate amount of such allowance to be regulated by the average attendance as shown by the quarterly returns received periodically from the school, is correct. Both the Principal of the Indian Industrial school at Kuper Island and the Principal of a similar\n\nTo the Hon. J.J.C. Abbott,\n\nPremier, &c., &c.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\ninstitution at Kamloops received a notification to the above effect. Since the notice was forwarded, however, to the Principals, protests have been made to the Department by the Roman Catholic Church authorities, under whose auspices the institutions are conducted, against this alteration in the system of payment for the education and support of the pupils, being made; and in a letter received recently from His Lordship Bishop Lemmens, of Vancouver Island, in respect to the proposed change, as regards the Kuper Island institution, His Lordship states that the number of pupils which can be lodged at that institution being at the utmost thirty, the per capita grant of $130.00 per annum would be insufficient to pay the expenses of the institution; that were there, however, lodging capacity for fifty pupils he is of opinion that the Church authorities might undertake to conduct the same on the proposed per capita basis.\n\nThe undersigned is of opinion that, while it may not be advisable to at present make the proposed change from the system hitherto followed, namely, the Dept. paying all expenses whatever they may be to the per capita system, it would be advisable to recommend to Parliament that a sufficient amount be voted to admit of such additions being made to the buildings as will increase their lodging capacity to such an extent that accommodation can be afforded to at least fifty pupils at each institution; and the Dept. might then, in the event of this being done, apply the per capita principle of payment for the management thereof to these institutions.\nIt may, however, be stated that an institution of no greater lodging capacity than either of the above institutions is conducted in the Kootenay country on the per capita principle, namely, $130.00 per annum for each pupil; and the Department has not been advised that any difficulty has been experienced in meeting the expenses thereof.\n\nIn regard to the comparison made by Mr. Gordon between the cost during the fiscal year 1890-91 of management of the Industrial Schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories with the cost of conducting similar institutions in British Columbia, the undersigned finds that Mr. Gordon has, no doubt unintentionally, overstated the cost of the institutions in the North West Territories (he gives no figures respecting those in Manitoba).\n\nThis doubtless has arisen from Mr. Gordon's taking into account the cost of building and additions made to the institutions, as well as the cost of education and industrial training, clothing and feeding of the pupils. Of course the cost of building should not have been included in an estimate of the per capita annual cost of the pupils. The latter as shewn by the books of the Dept. amounted to for the year 1890-91:\n\nAt Battleford $257.56, instead of $404.02 as stated by Mr. Gordon.\n\nAt Qu'Appelle $144.31, and not $171.79.\n\nAt High River $208.00, instead of $219.41.\n\nAnd at Metlakahtla (B.C.) $191.81, instead of $217.88.\nAnd as respects the two institutions of a similar type in Manitoba, viz., at St. Paul's, near Winnipeg, and at Elkhorn they are conducted on the per capita principle of payment and receive only $100 for each pupil.\n\nThe cost per capita of the Kuper Island, Kamloops and Metlakahtla institutions in British Columbia during the same fiscal year, viz., 1889-90, was:\n\n- Metlakahtla........$191.81\n- Kuper Island......157.69\n- Kamloops..........153.40.\n\nIt may be added that the per capita principle was that upon which it was, in the first instance, proposed that the institutions on Kuper Island and at Kamloops should be conducted; that is to say, that the Roman Catholic Church authorities were to be given the per capita allowance of $130.00 per annum for each pupil and they were therewith to manage the institutions, viz., to feed, clothe, educate and impart industrial training to twenty-five pupils at each institution, or to as many as the buildings would accommodate. Influence was, however, brought to bear by Members of Parliament, and, if the undersigned is not mistaken, Mr. Gordon was one of them, to have additional amounts included in the estimates for those schools, for salaries of employees. Consequently there was a departure from the original intention in the matter of the financial support to be afforded by the Government to the institutions; and now it is found to be most difficult to revert to the more economical scheme.\n\nAll of which is most respectfully submitted.\n\nD. S. G. of I. A.\nNanaimo, Dec. 2nd, 1891.\n\nDear Mr. Abbott:\n\nI have recently been informed that the Principal of the Industrial School at Kuper Island has been notified by direction of the Supt. General of Indian Affairs that after the 1st of January next the Department will limit the allowance to be made to that school to the per capita grant of $130 per annum for each pupil voted by Parliament according to the average attendance shown by the quarterly returns.\n\nIt is urged and I think fairly that if this order is carried into effect the Church having charge of the school would either have to abandon it, or incur a large annual indebtedness, neither of which is believed to be the desire or intentions of the Government.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that you cause the order to be suspended pending an enquiry into the cost and management of all the Industrial schools of Manitoba, the N.W.T., and B.C., with a view of arriving at a just basis of allowance in each case. The differences observable in the cost of several schools which I hereto append prompts me to make this request before an injustice may be inflicted that will be more difficult to remedy, should the order I have quoted be carried into effect.\n\nThe Returns up to 30th June 1890 for fiscal year for the several schools are as follows:\n\nBattleford 55 pupils $22,221.38 per capita $404\nQu'Appelle 146 pupils $25,082.05 per capita $171.\nHigh River 52 pupils $11,409.61 per capita $219.\nMetlakahtla 24 pupils $5,224.51 per capita $217.\nI know you will pardon me for troubling you at this time. It is a matter of great importance to the Indians and to the Rev. Gentleman whose success with the Indian pupils is the marvel of all who have visited the school and who I am sure is doing all that is possible to conduct the school on the most economical principles.\n\nHoping for an assurance from you on this matter,\n\nBelieve me, &c.\n\n(sgd) D.W.

Yesterday many of them went up Esquimalt, where they were cordially received on board the warship. The venerable Father La Come, whose history was briefly narrated in Sunday's Columbian, went up to Kuper Island on Sunday afternoon with four other priests. Spoken to by a representative of this paper, he said very pleasantly: \"We were all most surprised and pleased at the excellent line of railway that carried us up to Esquimalt. We met there Father Donkels, and we thought he looked very well. He seemed quite refreshed.\"\n\nFather Lacombe spoke of his visit to Esquimalt, saying: \"We were very pleased with the arrangements made, and I was astonished with the great progress that has been made. When we had looked over the place thoroughly, we went to the hospital, visited Indian villages, and the whole population, men, women and children, turned out to welcome us. We found the Indians interested in the two chiefs, being the first Indians to see the whites. They were very friendly, and nothing would satisfy them, after we had been shown around the village, but that we should take them to the church. So we all went to the steps of the church, and I addressed the Indians in my language translated into French to Father Donkles, who in turn translated it to Bishop Demers. I spoke at some length, and told the Indians how much I admired their good behavior. I then asked Father Donkles what pleased his own people would be when he got home to know that their friends on Kuper Island were living such happy, contented lives. He answered me that there were about 6,000 men to live in peace with white men always, and to follow their example in all things. The Indians, who had never seen so many of them well dressed and good.\n\n\"I cannot give too much praise, said Father Lacombe, to Governor Royal for their liberality to the Kuper Island settlers or to any of those who have visited among them. For children under his care were the best behaved I have seen for a long time. I saw everything in order, and I am stating that the school is the finest in the Dominion. I have never heard of one at all. It is a magnificent school no doubt. I addressed the Indians myself before we left the mission, and I thought it would encourage them in well-doing. I hope the school will be continued, and that we may make a report to Ottawa about the advisability of doing this soon as I get home.\"\n\n\"Do you consider Canada's Oldest Priest, father, do they not?\" asked the reporter?\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I have done my best for 40 years. I came here to live at first with the whites, and I think that I have succeeded to some extent. I have done my best.\"\n\n\"This afternoon we took the Cree chiefs down to Esquimalt, and on our return to the Warship, we found that they had been ill-fed or constricted by the treatment we received from the whites. We therefore pointed out that the Indians we had with us were big chiefs, did their best to send them back to their homes. After dinner, they took them down among the big guns, worked on deck, and recovered sufficiently from their asthmatism. They were sent back to deck and recovered thereafter. They were not only healthy, but appeared to be able and 'jolly' (grand). I never saw men so nonplussed as when we returned to the city. Our visit must have been the last appearance of any kind of news on board, and it is not to be wondered at.\"\n\nThe reporter, through an interview with Father Lacombe, learned the opinions of the Warships from the Chiefs, but the attempt to make them understand the difference between the Catholic Church and the Protestants had recovered sufficiently from his asthma- tism to eat his dinner, let alone speak of it.\n\nArchbishop Duhamel, of Ottawa, came over from Portland, Oregon, last week, and visited the Bishop Le Pointe, of Three Rivers, visited Bishop Le Flambeau, of Ottawa, just after his second visit to Rome to make arrangements for the Holy Roman Empire, assistant at the Papal Court, and also the Secretary of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and an Advocate of St. Peter's.\n\nFather La Come is the oldest Roman Catholic bishop in Canada, having been consecrated by his predecessor, the strongest Ultramontane prelate in the Dominion, and is a well-known authority on religious questions and of great research. He was seen, last night, by a very intelligent old man, who speaks English fluently. He has not at all been to speak of his impressions of British Columbia. He declared that he had visited every part of the country, and says that the C.P.R. and the Japan steamers together will succeed in bringing a great number of thousands of people. \"I am really astonished,\" he said, \"at the wonderful growth that has been made in this beautiful city. In our church we have always been obliged to turn away a great many poor mission, and when Bishop Demers came to this city he brought officers, but only had one priest with him. Now I see a flourishing place with a large population. Everything is cheaply and plentifully utilized everywhere, and a general air of prosperity and plenty that proclaims progress.\n\nTruly you people are progressing. Why, much of what you have here could three times as old cannot yet be seen.\n\nTo-night the sisters at St. Joseph's Convent will give a dancing class, and a supper for which Governor Royal and Judge Routhier accepted invitations. Father Lacombe will go to Vancouver and tomorrow the whole party will take their private yacht and go for a cruise again. Bishop Le Comte will conduct them all safely back. Rev. Father Pay, in Vancouver, will finally before his departure entertain them at a pleasant dinner in his garden.\n\nKUPER ISLAND SCHOOL.\n\nLaosome Tribe Is the Best Industrial School in the Dominion.\n\nThe party of Roman Catholic prelates proceeded up to Kuper Island on Saturday to inspect the Industrial School there, returned to the city to-day. The party consisted of Rev. Fathers Lacombe and Bishop Le Comte and Sabine, accompanied by the two chiefs of the Crees and the chief of the Stoisy tribe. Father Lacombe, who has travelled all over Canada, inspected the industrial schools conducted by the Church of Rome, and who is therefore better qualified to speak on the subject than any man in the Dominion, says he is delighted with the Kuper Island institution, and has no hesitation in saying that it is the best in the Dominion. The one fact observable is that it is becoming rather scarce for the Indians to visit it. The building was erected by the Dominion government and is conducted by the Sisters of St. Joseph for the benefit of the Indians. Success has rewarded the efforts put forth by the religious orders of the natives, and the results attained are reason for patronage.\n\nFather Lacombe is enthusiastic over the Kuper Island school, and will probably make another inspection when he returns east.\n\nBishop Broindel arrived in Victoria today after an absence of nine years. He was astonished and pleased at the change which he perceived everywhere in the appearance of the city. Many parts of the town that he had been changed by the business blocks constructed since he was last here. Bishop Broindel is now ministering in Helena, Montana.\n\nThe prelates who attended the Passion Play at Mission last week will arrive in this city this evening. Bishop Duhamel and the prelates accompanied him to Seattle to arrive this afternoon on the Kingston from that city.\nIndustrial School,\nKuper Island, June 1st 1892.\n\nL.

Fries\n2/11/92\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nI have read the correspondence herewith relating to the Kuper Island Industrial School. The Principal, the Rev. Mr. Donckele, seems to be labouring under a misconception of the way in which the expenditure for his school is being provided for during the current year. It will be remembered that an attempt was made to enlarge the building at this school, and to provide a per capita grant for 50 pupils. These items went into the Supplementary Estimates for the current year, and were, unfortunately, disallowed, and the Department was thrown back for the maintenance of the school upon the appropriation of $3900 which was provided in the Main Estimates. Of course it would be impossible to carry on the school for one year upon this limited appropriation, and it was never intended to do so. On July 6th I addressed a Memorandum upon the subject to the Acting Deputy Minister, in which I pointed out that the full appropriation for Industrial Schools for the year then commencing was $24,390, and also that, as the expenses for the fiscal year 1891-2 had amounted to $21,300, the Department would not be embarrassed in continuing the schools in the same position as they occupied during the last fiscal year. It was therefore not the intention of the Department to confine the expenditure at the Kuper Island School to $3900; so long\nlong as the expenditure did not exceed what it was in 1891-2 the Department would be satisfied. The Rev. Mr. Donckele seems aggrieved that the sewing machine and a boat were disallowed by the Department, but he has rather himself to blame for this disallowance than the Department, because when he made a requisition for them he did not give any special reason for requiring them, although at the time he forwarded the requisition he wrote a special letter with it. I think the sewing machine might be allowed, if there is any special necessity for it, and there seems to be such a necessity.\n\nAs regards the boat, that I think might also be allowed, if the Principal finds it absolutely necessary. I need hardly say that there is no distinction whatever made by the Department between the Industrial Schools in Canada. It is true that Mr. Scott's salary was increased this year from $800 to $1000, but he had been in the Service for some years, and it was thought that for very many reasons he deserved the increase. I need only cite the fact that Superintendent Vowell was given authority this summer to erect a Laundry and Dry House at the Kuper Island School at a cost of $263 to show that the Department was doing its best to meet the wishes of the Managers of these Institutions. The request for this building was accompanied by a full report showing how desirable it was to erect it, and no similar report was received with the requisition for the sewing machine.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\nOffice of the Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\n\nWill the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs be good enough to examine the enclosed correspondence and furnish the undersigned, for council, with a memorandum of the particulars referred to therein.\n\n[Signature]\n\n2/11/92\n\nSee pte to Sir John 9 Nov 92\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your requisition of articles for the Kuper Island Industrial School for the quarter ended the 30th of Sept. next, I have the honour to inform you that the following items have been disallowed:\n\n1. Sewing machine.......................... $40.00\n20 Yds. Cotton for sail.................... 3.50\n2 Prs. oars for boat....................... 5.00\n\nAnd as the total appropriation for the school for the year 1892-93 is only $3,900 a further reduction to the amount of $175 should be made in the requisition. This might be done as follows:\n\nProvisions........... 125.00 less\nFuel and light...... 7.50 less\nClothing............. 10.00 less.\nMiscellaneous....... 32.50 less.\nTotal $175.00, it being considered that larger supplies have been requisitioned for than the requirements of the Institution in the first would justify.\n\nI have &c.\n\n(sgd) H.

Donckele, Principal.\n\nP.S.\n\nFor your information I might further remark that in all other parts of the Dominion the Principals of Government Industrial Schools have a salary of $1,200 or at least $1,000 a year and the Kuper and Kamloops are allowed only $800.\nIndustrial School Kuper Island\nJuly 29th 1892.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Davis,\nPremier of the P. of B.C.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn compliance with your request to let you have a copy of a letter which I received yesterday re reductions in supplies and total appropriation for the year 1892-93, also to furnish you with a comparative statement of the expenses incurred during the passed year by the three Indian Industrial Schools conducted on the same basis in the P. of B.C., I have the honour to enclose a copy of the above mentioned letter and to give the following information:\n\nAccording to the last official report (see blue-book part 2, page 39 to 42) the total expenses amount to:\n\n| Metlakahtla School | Kamloops School | Kuper Isld. schl. |\n|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Protestant         | Catholic        | Catholic         |\n| Total expenditure $5,711.61 | $5,302.46 | $5,237.52 |\n| Principal's salary 800.00 | 800.00 | 800.00 |\n| (but now raised to 1,000.00) not raised | not raised | not raised |\n| Tradesman salary 1,360.00 | 600.00 | 600.00 |\n\nThe number of pupils was, I believe, about the same, viz., 25.\n\nAt present the total number of pupils in our school is 25 boys and 12 girls\u2014thus 37, and for this number I am now informed that the total appropriation for the next year will be only $3,900.00; if in this sum the yearly salaries of the officers and employees is included (Principal $800.00, Foreman $420.00, besides $180.00 for carpenter, $180 for shore-maker, matron $400, Assistant teacher $300.00, cook $250, laundress $200, in all $2,730) there will remain for the year's maintenance and clothing of 37 children.\nand the board of the officers $1,170.\n\nI am, however, not quite sure whether the Department intends to include the salaries in the appropriation of $3,900; if they do I am entirely at a loss to see how it will be possible for any one to meet all the expenses to be incurred for food, clothing, furniture and school materials with the allowance of $1,170.\n\nI have been now in charge of this school for two years, and besides the Government grant I had to sacrifice nearly every cent of my salary in order to make a success of the school, and although we have endeavoured to be as economical and saving as it was in our power, still according to the last report the expenses of the Kuper Island School amounted to over $5,000, and that for 25 pupils only; whereas now we have 37.\n\nIt is somewhat surprising to me that in the Dominion of Canada where nearly the half of the population is Catholic a certain discrepancy should be made between Catholic and Protestant Industrial School. (I merely allude to the schools conducted on the same basis as ours). Now for instance at Metlakahtla they raise the salary of the Principal to a $1,000 a year, the foreman or trades instructor to $1,000 and $350 for his host, and their salaries are paid regularly in the beginning of the month without sending in vouchers for the same, whereas here and in Kamloops, we have to send in monthly vouchers for our salary, and then wait about 3 months before any remittance is made. The reason of this is I believe because we Catholics were only appointed on probation. Very strange indeed, a probation of two years although I have been informed on good authority that Mr. Supt. Vowell considered our school is the best conducted in British Columbia.\n\nI am very sorry that the Indian Dept. has come to the conclusion of curtailing the expenses which were necessary to keep the school in\nits present healthy condition, as the school is doing much good amongst our Indians.\n\nI have &c.\n\n(sgd) G. Donckele, Principal.\n\nP.S.\n\nFor your information I might further remark that in all other parts of the Dominion the Principals of Government Industrial Schools have a salary of $1,200 or at least $1,000 a year and the Kuper and Kamloops are allowed only $800.\nKuper Island Sept. 28th 1892.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Th. Davies,\nVictoria,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. D. Gordon, M.P., has sent me Sir John Thompson's answer to his letter re reductions in grant. As you have kindly promised me to confer with the Hon. Minister of Justice re our school, I take the liberty to enclose herewith the answer of Sir John, so that you may be in a better position to understand the whole affair.\n\nI have written to Mr. Gordon to inform him that the Indian Dept. had not correctly stated the matter to Sir John Thompson, for we have now as we had last year 37 and not 30 pupils. Of this the Indian Dept. is aware, as we have to send in our quarterly reports.\n\nI may further state that since the opening of the school there was (until the last Estimates was passed) no question of basing the allowance on $130 per pupil; they allowed a round sum I believe. I have seen that it was something like $6,270 per annum.\n\nIt appears to me that the Indian Dept. wished to convey to Sir John Thompson the impression that this year as in former years they had made the $130 the base of the allowance, which is not true. In previous years they did like they do yet now for Metlakatla make a certain grant to cover all expenses.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention towards our school and wishing you a present journey,\n\nI am &c.\n\n(sgd) G. Donckele.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nP.S.\n\nIf you happen to visit Vict., Exhibition do not fail to see and examine the boys' and girls' copy-books and sample writing. also some stockings knitted by our pupils.\n\n(sgd) G.D.\n\nIn haste.\nOttawa, 8th Sept., 1892.\n\nDear Mr. Gordon:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th ultimo which arrived during my absence from the Capital, I am informed that the vote of $3,900 to which you refer is based on an estimate of 30 pupils at $130 each.\n\nWhen it was proposed last autumn to adopt the per capita system the Church authorities objected but agreed to a suggestion that the school be enlarged and that the system be applied when the attendance should reach 50.\n\nIt appears that the item which the Minister proposed as necessary to carry out the arrangement did not pass with the other Estimates, and the consequence is that for the present at least the Department must continue to pay the salaries and the maintenance of 30 pupils as heretofore.\n\nYours &c.\n\n(sgd) John Thompson.\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nreally appear to me that there is some scheming going on for us to be shut out the official blue book we have in our hands been advantageous during the first year of the establishment of the school on the contrary we have tried to exert every endeavor has we could even in such a manner that when the Dept refused to give us the same credit we thought ourselves ill.\n\nThe Sisters too I have done much more than they should have done, for besides purchasing a considerable amount of clothing for the boys, they have bought all the clothes of the girls (with the exception only of the sisters)\n\nIn order to be in a position to acquire more clothing they extended the terms of borrowing a second sewing machine so that we could work together further for lack of clothes for a little while.\n\nIt seems that the more we know\n\nthe more they will control us. I have wrote up the want to strictly confine myself to my duties, alike it is done in the other schools, and I have told the Sisters to do the same, that we demand buy the clothing every quarter instead of sending it off the Island.\n\nWhen the school was opened they sent us from Ottawa an approved scale after which they allow to the pupils, and I am not aware that we have in any way gone beyond that scale, and yet the cost of our school has increased less than $154.00. See Account, and the present year, without keeping the same book they want us to settle it out to see how much more clothes each pupil for the same.\n\nTo Mr. Smith for Account of our establishment and the School Account M. H. School $39.00\n\nSalary for officers $27.50\n\nCost for 100 pounds of flour $78.00\n\nLeaves for bread and flour $39.00\n\nTotal for each pupil for term $2.50\nNanaimo, Aug. 26th 1892.\n\nRev. Father:\n\nI herewith enclose a note I have just received from Sir J.S.D. Thompson to whom I had written protesting against the notice you had received in reference to the reduction of grant for the Kuper School.\n\nI have no doubt but Sir John will look into the matter with a view of having justice done in the premises. I also sent him a copy of my letter to Mr. now Sir John Abbott of last autumn against placing your school on the per capita basis in January last as had been proposed by the Department.\n\nTrusting that all may yet be satisfactory in every respect, and that this may find yourself, the Sisters and your other assistants and pupils well and in good cheer,\n\nBelieve me &c.\n\n(sgd) D.W. Gordon\n\nP.S.\n\nThanks for the copy of the Departmental letter which you kindly forwarded to me.\n\nI asked Sir John Thompson to call on the Department for a copy of it that he might be fully informed as to the propositions and suggestions by the Department at that time.\n\n(sgd) D.W.G.\nSt. Andrews, N.B.,\n17th August, 1892.\n\nDear Mr. Gordon:\n\nI do not know the particulars about the Kuper School but will communicate with Mr. Dewdney at once.

The said would prove insufficient to meet the expenses of the Institution; the undersigned have to report that although it was proposed last season to add to the amount voted for the Expense of the Institution $500.00 each at the Hudson's Bay Institution, the gross amount to cover the cost of maintenance and tuition of the pupils thereof, was not sufficient to meet the same and an additional amount...\nTo enlarge the building so as to admit of its having a capacity sufficient to lodge the above number of pupils, and although all necessary amounts for the above purposes were included in the Supplementary Estimates for the current year, the Board of Education Board allowed its share, and the District consequently gave up the appropriation for the amount of \u00a3100 0s. as provided in the Main Estimates.\n\nIt became therefore necessary to make an appeal that it would be quite impossible to carry on the School upon this limited allowance; and as the full appropriation for Industrial Schools in British Columbia for the current year amounted to \u00a324,370 0s., and the expenses for the past fiscal year had only appreciated \u00a32,300 0s., it was apparent that the District would...\nwould not be under-\nruled by Contingency\nto conduct the Schools\non the same financial\nbasis that as before, and\nit was never intended\nto continue the expenditure\nat the Rupert Island\nSchool to be $300.00\nbut it was considered\nso low as the expenditure\ndid not exceed the amount\nspent for at that School\nduring the fiscal year\n1871-72 the same could be\nmet without difficulty.\nThis, therefore, intended,\nand was from the commence-\nment of the year,\n& continue to pay, not\nonly for the Board of\nthe Children and Officer\nof the Institution, but\nlikewise the salaries of\nthe latter, as heretofore,\nuntil at least Parliament\nwould consent to grant\nthe necessary subsidy\nfor the education of the\nchildren to amount of 50\nand to provide the necessary additional per capita amount which would afford, at $1.30 each, $65,000 for 50 pupils.\n\nThis amount will be sufficient to cover all the costs of conducting the Institution; that is, to pay for the cost of board, food, tuition, and industrial training, as well as provide for the Board of the Officers of the Institution.\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be observed that there is no intention of curtailment, as stated by Mr. D'Arcy, the expenses necessary to keep the Upper Island School in its present healthy condition, and that it was through no fault of the Department of Indian Affairs that an increased grant was not made.\nby Parliament to that School for the current year.\n\nWith regard to the refusal of the Indian Department at Victoria to provide a sewing machine and two pairs of oars for a boat for the Upper Island Institution, of which Mr. Doucette complains, it would not appear from the correspondence that Mr. Doucette showed that any pressing necessity existed for these articles being furnished, and the Officer who was acting in his absence, for the Indian Dept. for British Columbia, knowing that the amount appropriated for several purposes for the School was limited, suggested that the sewing machine and the oars should be disallowed.\n\nAs regards the sewing\nmachine, the amount at\nthe credit of the Institution\nSchool Fund for British\nColumbia will be so re-\nduced, allow at the cost\nof the same item incurred by the Dept. of\nthe Principal shall\nconsidered that the above\nwas a necessity. And,\nas respects the care for\nthe boat, they could also\nbe paid for by the Dept.,\nas well as the captain for\na sail, the latter's\nbeing only $6.50.\n\nIn conclusion, it may\nbe stated, as an instance of\nthe desire of the Dept. to facilitate\nas much as possible the proper\nmanagement of the Institution at\nPiper Island, that this year\nauthority was given to the Dept.\nat Victoria to have a Laundry\nand Dry-House erected in con-\nnection with that Institution,\nin accordance with the wishes\nof the Principal of the same who fur-\nnished a full report as to the necessity\nfor it; and it may be added that\nno similar report was received from\nhim under the eleven months' prece-\nding period.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA 17th February 1894\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence in the matter I have to inform you that the Assistant Commissioner for Manitoba and the North West Territories has been instructed to forward to you office a Scale of the Dietery and Clothing for Industrial Schools which has been found ample for the requirements of those in the North West Territories, and will be sufficient for similar Institutions in British Columbia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.

Under the fact that I was compelled to have our only pay allowance because the effect of the failure since the kitchen was insufficient even to save on pay, as a result that we paid more than twice what it is altogether useless to make any further reductions in food and even in clothing. It might perhaps not be out of place to congratulate the authorities by what occurred very recently. On the day\n\nA. N. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria\nI returned a few weeks of store goods and a box of crackers which have been distributed by the Agent. Some of the boys had spoken to their parents about returning from school who at once an informal meeting was held at one of the homes and in this meeting it was decided that in case the Government were going to cut down the supplies they would withdraw their children. I assured the Indians that this was not the case.\u2014About three weeks ago an Indian who had a very promising girl at the school withdrew her against my consent. Giving reasons why such a course was taken the Indians gave me to understand that one of his reasons was because his daughter's shoes were only canvas shoe-laces and not worth buying as she could have got some... \n\nNow, Mr. Superintendent, you will agree with me that such actions even amongst Indians who are at times so exacting and tenderly the Indians are both regard to the comfort of their children whilst at school.\n\nI have lived amongst the Indians of the Canadian agency for nearly 17 years and have been in charge of different Indian schools, and by personal opinion, based on past experience, is that if you wish me to continue much over the Indians there will be before many years have elapsed such a better future against the school that it will be impossible to keep the old system at the institution and to secure new ones to fill the vacancies as the Indians feel themselves quite independent without a school.\n\nSince, therefore, it will be impossible to continue the school costs must be incurred at the end of the fiscal year an over expenditure of close to $700 or $800 dollars. I claim it advisable to say just to make at once the expenditure and the grant of this present year.\nby giving the pupils holidays until the 15th of September, and after the holidays to increase gradually the number of pupils to 30, as the appropriation is made only for 30.\n\nI would explain to the pupils and the parents the reason for taking such a step, and I am sure that the announcement would be received with satisfaction.\n\nMr. Freeman Thompson might have charge of the buildings, stock, and garden, whilst the Sisters would retire to Victoria until such time as you desire to return to superintend the school. As for myself, I would profit of the holidays to visit the schools in the North-West and Manitoba, and further extend my journey to Behnne, the Water Country which I have not seen for 7 years. Thus there would be only Mr. & Mrs. Thompson's salaries to be paid; and when the school reopens there would be sufficient funds remaining to continue without interval the management of the school. However, if we have to begin the new school year under the pressure of an over-expense, it will prove to be a constant source of annoyance to the Dept. and to me.\n\nWithout any over-expense and with an attendance of 30 pupils I think that next year I might manage to secure both ends meet.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. Durocher,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, April 14th. 1894.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo No. 82,370 in regard to the maintenance of the Kuper Island Indian School upon a reduced basis, etc.\n\nI have consulted with the Rev. Father Donckele, the Principal of the School, and the only possible way that we can see of getting over the difficulty arising from want of funds is to temporarily close the institution by allowing the children an extended holiday as suggested by the Principal in his letter of the 12th instant, a copy of which I now enclose. This letter was written after our consultation and from it I gather that the proposed measure would not materially interfere with the advance\n\nof\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nof the school which it is hoped could after\nthe time fixed for reopening be kept going\nat an expense not in excess of the sum voted\nby Parliament for that purpose.\n\nI am told\nthat it is thought that a saving of $700.00\nor $800.00 a year could be made in the running\nexpenses of that school; and that reductions\nwill have to be made in the wages account\nespecially. I have written to the Principal\nto discontinue the attendance of the visiting\ncarpenter and shoemaker, the only reduction\nadmissable at present, the saving entailed by\nsuch a curtailment will be but trifling,\nwhile it would be a serious loss to the chil-\ndren to deprive them permanently of such\ninstruction. In regard to the wages now paid\nto the Principal and regular staff of assist-\nants the rate in this part of the Dominion of\nCanada is considered moderate.\n\nI may say in\nconnection with this school that the Roman\nCatholic Church Authorities have always\nrefused to take charge of it upon the per\ncapita\ncapita grant; as they also have in regard to the Industrial School at Kamloops.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Provision is only made for a small number of pupils and the greater part of the amount voted has gone to pay the salaries of the staff, which the Department considers too high, and too many employees engaged for the sum available.\n\nSteps have been taken, however, to remedy the matters complained of to the satisfaction, it is hoped, of all concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHon.

It is hoped that when the Institution is provided with these cows its demands for butter will cease. However, if the cost of providing hay for the oxen and cows is likely to cost more than the hiring of a yoke of oxen, as requested, and the purchase of a small supply of butter for the staff, the Department does not wish you to make the purchase of the cattle but instead to hire oxen and buy a small quantity of butter for the staff. You are at liberty to use your judgment in regard to this matter.\n\nI also beg to refer you to official letter of the 2nd inst.: No.38753/2 in which you were authorized to use your discretion in regard to certain articles of food when a change is asked for, provided the total amount\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq:\nIndian Supt:\n\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\namount of such requisition is within the cost of the articles allowed by the Departmental scale. This concession may apply to the Kuper Island School as well.\n\nReturns of Stores which are called for Quarterly can be filled in on the blank forms sent you for this purpose which save time and trouble of writing them out. The Department wishes these Returns so that it may be in a position to judge how the school stands.\n\nThe Department will consent to allow this school to receive boys only, if they wish to do so and it thinks it would be well to adopt this course, as by so doing some of the female members of the staff could then be dispensed with.\n\nThe quantity of clothing allowed by the Scale is to be given for the number of pupils authorized, but the Department thinks that as they have retained the services of the shoemaker, boots and shoes ought to be made at the Institution if furnished with the requisite lumber &c.\n\nComplaints have been made that the Metlakahtla School is more liberally provided for than other Institutions in B.C. As the Department does not wish that there should be any ground for such complaints, Metlakahtla will be placed strictly in the position of other Institutions.\n\nWhere articles can be purchased in bulk in small packages at wholesale rates the Department does not wish to confine the purchase to the scale when the difference in quantity is small and when a saving can be effected by purchasing the whole package.\n\nPostage\nPostage Stamps for the business correspondence of the School may be allowed.\n\nThe articles in which an increase is asked for are oatmeal, sugar and butter, with a decrease in tea and cheese.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs.\nI have the honour to submit here-\nwith for the information of the Department Copy of\na letter dated 29th ultimo from the Principal of the\nIsland Industrial School giving a schedule of the prizes\nawarded to the pupils of the school for articles of\ntheir manufacture exhibited for them at the several\nProvincial Expositions held during the Autumn\nin this Province\n\nI have the honour to\nSir\nYour obedient Servant,\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Deputy\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have the honour once more to inform you of the Department of the very gratifying success which our pupils exhibited here obtained at the various Provincial Exhibitions viz., at Duncan's, Victoria and New Westminster when the articles were entered for general competition.\n\nFancy Wool Work: 3 First prizes\n1 Second prize\n5 Highly Commended\n\nKnitted Workings: 4 First prizes\n2 Second\n2 Highly Commended\n\nKnitted Lace: 1 First Prize\n1 Second\n1 Highly Commended\n\nLace's Embroidery: 1 First prize\n1 Second\n1 Highly Commended\n\nSewing: 1 Second Prize\n\nMany flattering comments were heard in the Provincial Papers.

It will therefore be necessary to make further reductions to make ends meet.\n\nThe Department can see no other course open to it but to reduce the salaries as they are higher in some instances than those paid at our largest Institutions in Manitoba and the North West Territories, where everything is fully as dear as in British Columbia, and fuel very much dearer. Take for instance the salary paid to the Matron $33:33, while at the Red Deer School with 50 pupils, the Matron only receives $12 a month,\u2014the same salary being paid to the Matron at Elkhorn with 100 pupils. The Matron of St\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq;\nIndian Supt;\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nBoniface\nBoniface School, Manitoba, which is conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, only receives $100 per annum while the Matron at Battleford with 150 pupils and a very large staff of officials is paid $300. To draw a further contrast the salary of the teacher at the following schools is, Qu'Appelle, $12 per month, St Boniface, $40 per annum and at St Paul's $14 per month.\n\nThe full amount of the grant for this school is only $3900, about $2500 of which is now taken for salaries leaving only $1500 for the maintenance, clothing, miscellaneous expenses &c which is not sufficient for the purpose, and as a saving has to be effected, the salaries will have to be reduced. The following reductions are therefore suggested in the salaries of the staff:\n\n| Position   | Current Salary | New Salary |\n|------------|----------------|------------|\n| Principal  | $60            | $65        |\n| Matron     | $33            | $33        |\n| Teacher    | $25            | $25        |\n| Foreman    | $35            | $35        |\n| Cook       | $20            | $20        |\n\nThe services of an Assistant Matron are not required at a school of the size and even if it were possible to provide for 50 pupils, the present salaries would still be too high. All that is allowed Boarding Schools as distinguished from Industrial Schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories is $72 per annum and this covers everything; if more is required it has to be provided by the various religious denominations conducting such schools.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDeputy Supt.-Genl:\nOf Indian Affairs\nBritish Columbia.\n\n379.

Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat Kuper Island, B.C., March 11th, 1895.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., and in reply respectfully state that, acting from time to time former departmental communications, I must confess that it appears to me most likely to be the intention of the Department to make matters so arranged and so understood by us as to compel us to give up the education of Catholic Indian Children.\n\nUnder the fostering and most kind charge of this Institution we expected our treatment and did not for an instant suspect that as soon as the school would be established on a creditable basis that we would be treated every year by some improved change.\n\nUnder the administration of the Hon. Mr. Dewdney and before our own eyes that of the Hon. Mr. Daly, promises were made and pledges given to us that matters would remain unaltered and unchanged until such time as the school buildings would be enlarged. From November 6th, 1893, Mr. Dewney to L. Van den Houte, Secretary of the Kuper Island Industrial School: \"It is therefore intended and was from the commencement of the fiscal year, to continue to save not only for the Board of the Children and Officers at the Institution, but likewise the salaries of the latter as long as they could be continued to meet the necessary expenses for the extension of the buildings to cost the amount of $50,000.00.\"\n\nA.

Conwell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat\n\nAmount which would afford at $150 each for 50 pupils is $7500.\n\nOn December 26th, 1842, the Honorable F. H. Derby wrote to me \"Be assured that it will always be my aim to advance the interest of these institutions as much as I can. You seem to be under the impression that it is the intention of the Department to confine the expenses of the New Island School to the rate of $150 per capita. The Department is not doing this, as you are no doubt aware by this time all the expenses that have been incurred by the school up to the present have been borne by the Government.\"\n\nIn December 1841 Mr. L. Underwood wrote to his Lieutenant Governor Lemmens: \"I am to inform you Lordship that the First Gent. having given the course, duration and weight to the Board's recommendation made in your Lordship's letter has expanded the opinion that matters might remain as they are, pending at least the enlargement of the buildings etc.\"\n\nAt this juncture Lemmens was present on the Board Court of the Island and I am not in a position to ascertain what he intends to do with regard to me; but I am of opinion that the Superior of the Sisters will not submit to such insinuations and that they will withdraw the three Sisters at present employed here and then what will be the consequences? Where in Port. Col. will I find suitable lay people to perform the various duties connected with their Offices for such a moderate Salary? You may say call upon the Authorities of the Church to supply all deficiencies but as far as I am aware no funds are received from foreign missionary societies.\n\nThe\nIndian Industrial School\n\nThe commission which is now before us shows between the Governors of some of the Enclaves of the various schools may appear somewhat plausible but I think that I shall be compelled to agree with the salaries of some of the Principals and other officers of the Board in Manitoba, the N.W.T., and even B.C. But, Sir, the discrepancy would have to be apparent and I am sure that the present salaries paid to the officers of this school are quite reasonable.\n\nFinding that the above remarks may serve the careful consideration of the Secretary, I have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nC. Denevele\nPrincipal.\nIndian Superintendent's Office,\n\nVictoria, 13 March 1895.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further connection with the proposed reduction of salaries paid etc. to staff by teachers etc., at the Klinow Indian Industrial Industrial School, alluded to in your letter of the 26th ultimo, No. 11667, I have the honour to enclose herewith duplicate of a letter received from the Revd Father Donahue, Principal of that Institution, who was duly written to upon receipt of letter above referred to.\n\nI cannot see that there is anything at the moment which should be allowed to take 50 pupils when the Roman Catholic authorities would agree to conduct it satisfactorily under the per capita grant. I think with a moderate expenditure in that direction the school could be sufficiently expanded to admit the increase.\n\nThe Deputy Dept. Paul.\n\nOf Native Affairs\n\nOttawa\nincreased. The cost of necessary expenditure at the present time is to be considerably less than the sum named by the Municipal and Foreman in 1892.

Reductions are being made in all our Industrial Schools.\n\nWhen our schools were first established as an experiment their success was problematical and it was difficult to obtain persons who were willing, under such circumstances, to take positions without\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq:\nIndian Sub.\nVictoria, B.C.\nwithout the inducement of high salaries.

I sincerely hope this is not so.\n\nI am sure that institution has in the past given very satisfaction as far as the results of its education can be proven by the children in the institutions.\n\nThe present salaries are very much lower than is paid to the public school teachers by the Provincial Board ($50.00) fifty dollars per month is the lowest wages paid to the lowest paid teacher in the Province.\n\nI am positive you may make provision for shutting up the place if there\nin this manner you claim to continue\nwhat you cannot get permanently\ncompetent officers to fill the positions\nit would be a great pity to destroy\nor render insufficient our institutions\nthat have been so worthy of\npublic support.\nI sincerely hope you will not make\nthe same mistake to be answered com-\nmunications.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant respecting the Kuper Island Industrial School, I beg to say that I fully appreciate the good work which is being done for our Indians by the Rev. Father Donckole and his staff, and in order that this school may be placed upon a better footing financially, I have provided in the Estimates for the coming year for 50 pupils at $130 each, being an increase of 20 over the number of pupils now allowed. I am assured that the school can meet all legitimate expenses with this number, and the Church authorities claim that they will be able to conduct the school satisfactorily hereafter with this additional number. Up to the present time they have not been able to do so, but have over-run the amount of money provided for it, owing to the fact that the greater part of the grant was being absorbed in the payment of salaries, which in some instances were higher than those paid at our largest Institutions in Manitoba and the North West Territories, where everything is fully as dear as in British Columbia and the cost of fuel very much greater. For instance the salary paid to the matron was $334.33 a month, while at the Red Deer School with 50 pupils the matron only receives $12, the same salary being paid to the matron at Elkhorn. The matron of St Boniface School Men: with\n\nA. Haslem, Esq., M.P.\n\nHouse of Commons\n\nOttawa\n100 pupils, which is conducted by the Roman Catholic Church receives only $100 per annum, while the matron at Battleford with 150 pupils and a very large staff of officials is paid $300 per annum. Only one other matron in the Dominion is receiving as high salary as the matron of Kuper Island School and this is the matron of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School with 225 pupils, and this wage is of long standing. To draw a further contrast, the salary of the teacher at the following schools is Qu'Appelle $12 a month; St. Boniface, $40 a year; and St Paul's, $14 a month, while at Kuper Island $25 a month was paid. An assistant matron was also employed at a salary of $15.00 a month. It is thought that her services might have been dispensed with.\n\nWhen our schools were first established as an experiment, their success was problematical and it was difficult to obtain persons who were willing, under such circumstances, without the inducement of high salaries to take such positions. The condition of affairs is now entirely changed. Our Industrial Schools are in successful working order, and we have hundreds of applicants, highly recommended, who are anxious to obtain positions at reduced salaries.\n\nThe newly appointed Principal of the Battleford Industrial School is only to receive $300 per annum while the Principal of the St Paul's School, who has been many years in the service and has 100 pupils under his charge, only receives $720 per annum. Both these schools have full staffs of paid instructors.\n\nConsidering that the work of the Kuper Island School is largely of a missionary nature,\nnature, the Department does not think that the comparison of the salaries paid to the Public School teachers in British Columbia, and those paid to the teachers of this school, is quite fair in view of the fact that the latter are in receipt of Board and lodging in addition.\n\nAll that is allowed Boarding Schools, as distinguished from Industrial Schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories is $72 per annum per pupil, and this covers everything. If more money is required it has to be provided by the various religious denominations conducting such schools.\n\nShould the Church authorities, however, after the 1st July, carry on the school successfully with the increased grant provided for, the Department will not insist upon the rigid enforcement of its order in regard to the reduction of salaries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the proposed additions to the Kuper Island Industrial School buildings, I beg to confirm the telegram wired you on the 11th inst., which should read as follows:\n\nReference letter 13th March last, two thousand dollars may be expended before 30th June on new buildings Kuper Island, and must be completed for that amount.\n\nIn this connection I have to call your attention to the fact that the sum authorized for this purpose will not be available after the 30th June next, and the Department would like you to see that all purchases of necessary material are made and the accounts therefor rendered before that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\n\nA.W.

In time when some of the educated children give practical proof, amongst their people, of the good derived from such institutions there will be less desire to interfere with the children during their training; and the abuse, it may be hoped, will die out.\n\nI may state in conclusion that at the other schools the children are not so interfered with to any appreciable extent.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

They should not give way to threats or intimidation, as it has been found elsewhere that by the exercise of proper firmness, the parents will ultimately give in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq:\nIndian Supt:\nVictoria, BC.\nDear Mr. Haslam,\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing one from Mr. G.

In view of the change in the arrangement I insisted upon the employees under my charge to accept the reductions in salaries, and thought that the Department would supplement the reductions at the end of the Fiscal Year.\n\nMr. Rev.

I am aware of the fact that the Department grants three weeks holidays and that beyond this limit no payment can be claimed for any further absence from the School.\n\nI would also suggest that you strongly recommend to the pupils to return on the day appointed, and that you expect that their conduct during the holidays, will be such as not to afford any cause for complaints.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nA.W.

I will write to you later on concerning these new pupils, in order to determine whether they will be fit subjects for the school before asking you to sanction their admission.\n\nI am sorry that I have to report the death of two of our pupils, viz., Jeannette Norris, No. 35, and Elley Moses, No. 27. Both girls had been ill for several months and whilst at the school had been carefully nursed and visited by a doctor. For the last four months the two girls had been allowed to stay at home with their parents. Consumption seems to have been the cause of death.\n\nThe pupils, Johnny No. 75 and Teresa No. 35 were with the approval of Mr. Andrews Agent, former authorized to remain home with their parents until such time as their health would improve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n& Son\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nKuper Island, B.C.

We have at present fifty-two pupils all in good health and spirits and a few more are daily expected.\n\nI have written a few weeks ago to you on the subject for the reasons that I wished, first of all, to ascertain the effects of the holidays upon our pupils.\n\nI am glad to state that up to the present time, I have not noticed or heard anything which might militate against the continuance of holidays in future, of course I speak only as far as I have been able to judge.\n\nAll the pupils who were expected to return have come back and they all seem to be animated with the best dispositions. Whilst they were pleased with their holidays yet they all were happy to return and do not join with the officers of the school in respectfully returning thanks to the Department for having kindly granted a few weeks' recess.\n\nFour of the pupils whose school terms had expired were with your consent discharged viz., Michael No. 30 - Peter No. 36,\nMary Louise No. 42 - and Alice No. 114.\n\nThree other pupils viz., James Charles No. 40\nMary Gertrude No. 15 and Annie No. 17 whose school term had likewise expired were set free.\n\nA.W.

The number of pupils, at present authorized by the Department is fifty, but with a few small alterations twenty-five pupils might be accommodated. The expenses incurred by these alterations could be borne by the management of the school.\n\nI am permitted to submit my humble request on account of the great number of Indians who make application for the admission of their children at our school.

April 19th, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour respectfully to request authority for granting the three weeks' holiday conceded annually by the Department during the month of June in place of July.\n\nAs you are aware most of the Indians of this Agency repair to the Fraser River in the month of July in order to find employment in the canneries, and of course their children have to go along and are thus exposed to all kinds of exposure and diseases, evils which they have not to endure so much whilst spending their holidays at home; therefore it is next to impossible to keep any control over the children whilst at the canneries.\n\nBy granting this favour to the parents who are desirous of having their children at home for a few weeks in the month of June I think that the pupils would be satisfied with the arrangement, when if no holidays be granted I would apprehend some serious difficulty in keeping some of the pupils at the school during the month of July.\n\nShould you kindly accede to my request I would take it for granted that I may claim the full quarterly grant for those pupils who are absent during the three weeks.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

The Reverend Gentleman is an experienced and capable teacher and will, no doubt, give the greatest satisfaction to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nUp to the present time I had done myself all the teaching, besides performing the duties of Principal and supervising the boys at recess, fatigue and farm-work, Mr. D. Gallant attending to the stables and carpenter shop.\n\nI consider that the additional number in the staff will be in the general interest of the school and that the small amount paid out for the teacher's salary will be covered by the increased returns of the farm.\n\nWhen the school was organized we had no land under cultivation but now we have between thirty and forty acres of arable soil and the work entailed by farming can no longer be attended to by the teacher. The boys are fond of farming and, in my opinion, it is the most useful and profitable knowledge they can acquire in an industrial school.\n\nTrusting that the Department will kindly approve of the step I have taken,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

They are reported to have accommodation for the extra number asked for, but, if the application was complied with, there would be no good reason why the other industrial schools in that Province should not be similarly treated.

Will you please let me have a report on this.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, May 16, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the application for an increase in the pupilage of the Kuper Island Industrial School, made by Archbishop Orth, I beg to say that similar applications have been made from time to time through Mr. Ralph Smith, M.P., who was informed that the Department regretted that it could not entertain such applications favourably.\n\nThe Kuper Island is one of the oldest of the nine industrial schools in British Columbia and is at present in receipt of a per capita grant of $130 for 50 pupils, which is the highest number provided for at any of these schools with the exception of the Methodist school at Coqualeetza, which receives a grant for 80 pupils. The Kuper Island school carries on an average about 60 pupils, being ten more than is provided for. They have no difficulty in recruiting, as the school is popular and well conducted. They have accommodation for the extra number asked for, but if this application is granted there is no reason why the other industrial schools in the province should not be similarly treated. Further than this the Roman Catholics have five out of the nine industrial schools in British Columbia under their control and in the neighborhood of this school they have the Clayoquot Industrial School, the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School and the Squamish and Sechelt Boarding Schools, so you see the Roman Catholics are pretty well supplied with schools in this part of the province and I do not think they would suffer any hardship if they were left as they are till the whole school question is settled.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 285-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 19, 1906.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the verbal application lately made by Your Grace for an increase in the pupilage of the Kuper Island Industrial School I have the honour to say that the Department regrets that it cannot at present accede to Your Grace's request.\n\nAs, however, the whole school question is likely to be dealt with shortly, this application will receive due consideration when the school policy is being discussed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour Grace's most obedient Servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Supt.

Classen, both on the subject of assistance for the Kuper Island Industrial School, I beg to say that when His Lordship Bishop MacDonald was in the city recently he brought this matter to the attention of Hon. Mr. Oliver and at that time it was fully gone into and it was found impossible to further increase the estimates for the approaching fiscal year to permit of the erection of new buildings at Kuper Island. You will observe that the estimate for 1911-12 is an increase of $100,000.00 over last year and this is to provide for increased grants to boarding schools, of which, of course, the British Columbia institutions receive a proportionate share. Until the new building for the Roman Catholic School at St. Eugene Mission is completed it will hardly be possible to consider the large necessary grant for the Kuper Island School.\n\nRalph Smith, Esq., M.

McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nOttawa, November 16, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department received sometime ago Mr. Inspector Green's report on the Kuper Island Industrial School.\n\nIn many respects this report was satisfactory. The Inspector draws attention to the fact that there was a very small supply of clothing on hand. The boys were in need of shirts and underclothes and the girls needed winter dresses, coats and underclothes. I have to ask you to be good enough to report whether steps were taken by you on the recommendation of the Inspector to supply this deficiency.\n\nThe Department is aware that this is an old building and in some respects not worth any extensive repairs, but the Inspector states that even small repairs are not being attended to. In the laundry there was a broken board in the floor and one of the pupils had her ankle broken by stepping into the hole. There was another hole in the floor near the entrance to the girls' classroom. Minor repairs of this kind should not be neglected and in a case where it is necessary and advisable to make more extensive repairs the Department will, as usual, supply the material provided the school authorities furnish the labour. Mr. Green gives an instance as showing what can be done with very small expenditure for material and labour to improve conditions. He refers to the room which had been fitted\n\nRev. P. Claassen,\nPrincipal,\nKuper Island Industrial School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\nfitted up at a very small expenditure for the reception of the Mother General from Montreal.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the mattresses in the boys' dormitory are in very poor condition and that new ones required. This is equipment that will have to be furnished by the school authorities from the per capita grant and I would ask you to see that these are supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nReport of Inspector Ditchburn for the Month of January, 1912.\n\nSouthwestern Inspectorate, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nHerewith I submit my report of Inspections made during the month of January, 1912:\n\nThe Kuper Island Industrial School was visited on Tuesday, the 23rd. The Principal is Rev. D. Claessen. There were 66 pupils on the roll\u201437 boys and 29 girls. The grant is for 60. Considerable improvement was noted since my visit of last year, principally in the matter of the water closets for the boys. A new water closet building with good sewerage and running water has been installed, and this does away with the objectionable odor noted around the premises on my last visit. The sewer pipe from the girl's water closet is also in a much improved condition from last year, a new tile pipe having been laid, cased partly in cement and now runs out to deep water. The school buildings themselves are very old, and, in places, the foundation posts and sills are rotten. As stated in my report on this institution last year, a new and larger school should be built on the higher ground, as, no matter how much repairs were put into these old buildings, they would still be out of date. There is an excellent farm of forty acres in connection with the school, from which all the vegetables and fruits for the use of the school are procured. The pupils are making good progress with their studies; and the only sickness during the past year were two cases of pneumonia. There have been no deaths. About fourteen pupils have been discharged during the past year, and this has relieved to quite an extent the overcrowded state in the girls' Department.\n\nSgd. W. E. Ditchburn.\nInspector.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of letter dated the 4th, inst., from Rev. P. Classen, Principal, Kuper Island industrial school, informing me that owing to urgent business he will be absent from the school for a fortnight. He is leaving Rev. W.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Ditchburn for the month of August, on the Schools in the Southwestern Inspectorate.\n\nDated Victoria, B.C., October 3rd, 1912.\n\nOriginal copy No. 119704/5\n\nDealing with the matter of new schools to take the place of old ones, I would say that if there is one school within my inspectorate that requires to be replaced by a new one it is the Kuper Island Industrial School, which is owned by the Government. This school, while not being so old as the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School, is not anything like in as goes a state of repair, and the girls department is entirely too small to accommodate the number of pupils they have there at present. I trust that there will be provision made in the Estimates for the coming session for the erection of a new and larger school at Kuper Island in place of the present one. I have already dealt with the condition of this latter school in my report to the Department for December 1910, in my annual report for 1911, in my report for January 1912 and also in my annual school report for 1912.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIt is my unpleasant duty to report upon a very unsavory occurrence that has taken place at the Kuper Island Indian Industrial School during the present month, in which six boys and five girls\u2014all pupils\u2014obtained egress from their dormitories on various occasions between the 13th and 28th, and, while some of them only participated in innocent amusement, four\u2014two boys and two girls\u2014admitted that they had sexual intercourse on at least two occasions.\n\nI was at Duncan, B.C., on the 23rd inst., about to pay a visit to Kuper Island School, when Rev. A. Urlings, the Principal, telephoned to Indian Agent Robertson, asking him to go to Kuper Island as he was in great trouble; he also asked that Constable O'Connell should go to the school.\n\nUpon arrival at the school on the 24th the Principal explained the reason for his message, and upon our holding a very thorough investigation into this disagreeable state of affairs it transpired that on the night of the 13th the boys got out of their dormitory windows in the second storey and let themselves down to the top of the window casing of the first storey, from which they jumped to the ground. After this first occasion one of the boys obtained a key from the carpenter shop of the school with which he was enabled to unlock the outside door at the foot of a set of stairs leading from their lavatories. The girls got out of a small window 14x17 inches in their lavatory which adjoins\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nadjoins their dormitory and crawled out onto a roof a few feet lower down, and from there got to the ground.\n\nThe names of the boys are Lawrence Wilson, Walter Daniel, Willie Joe, Harry Johnny, Baptiste Paul and Michael Underwood, and the girls Elphina August Jack, Cecelia Charles, Alexandria Bazille, Esther Richards and Henrietta Lewis.\n\nAs stated above, a searching investigation was held, when all those implicated were brought before us separately, and it was proved beyond a doubt that the two boys, Lawrence Wilson and Walter Daniel were not only the leaders in the movement to break the school regulations by both boys and girls, but were the ones who polluted the two girls, Elphina August Jack and Cecelia Charles. Both these boys and girls admitted their guilt, all the others denying absolutely that they had done any wrong other than getting out of their dormitories, and I have every reason to believe that this is correct, as both the reverend Principal and Sister Superior had the boys and girls before them for private investigation.\n\nRealizing the necessity of stringent measures being taken in this case, in order that it might prove a wholesome lesson for the future, it was decided that the two boys Lawrence Wilson and Walter Daniel should be arrested and brought before a Justice of the Peace on the charge of seduction, the Principal of the school laying the charge, and this was done on Friday, the 25th, at Chemainus before Mr. A. H. Griesbach, N.P., and on Saturday, the 26th he committed them for trial at Nanaimo at the next court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nWith respect to the punishment of the two girls, Elphina August Jack and Cecelia Charles, I have advised the Principal of the school that they should be expelled, as their presence in the school might have a bad effect upon the other pupils. As the other four boys and three girls have only been guilty of a breach of the discipline of the school in leaving their dormitories, they were left for the school authorities to deal\ndeal with, though the Principal is desirous that the Department should state what punishment ought to be meted out to them.\n\nAs the mere expulsion of the two boys above-mentioned would not have been considered by them as a punishment for their offence, but more in the nature of a reward, and being something for other pupils desirous of leaving the school before their time, to look forward to, I trust that the Department will approve of the action taken in having Wilson and Daniel arrested, for I believe it will have a very good effect in the future.\n\nAt first it might be thought that occurrences of the before-mentioned nature could only result from a lack of watchfulness on the part of those in charge of the school, but in this instance no blame can be attached to them. The fact that some of the children often get out of their beds at night and go to the lavatories is such a natural proceeding that no particular attention is paid to them when they do so. One of the teachers sleep in a little room off the dormitories, and, so long as no noise is created the pupils are not remonstrated with.\n\nIn order that the case of these boys may have the least possible publicity, I have instructed Constable O'Connell to endeavor to have them come up for Speedy Trial at a private hearing. Of course all the pupils at the school have a full knowledge of this matter already, and it will eventually find its way to some of the parents, but otherwise it has been kept from the public, and I trust, in the interest of the Department's educational system, that it will remain so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ult., advising the Department of the result of an investigation by yourself and Mr. Agent Robertson into the misconduct of certain pupils at the Kuper Island Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the action taken in respect to the two boys, Lawrence Wilson and Walter Daniel, is approved, and the Department further agrees with you that the two girls, Elphine Jack and Cecilia Charles, should be discharged from the school.\n\nWith reference to the disciplining of the other seven pupils, this is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the Principal and his staff.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nW. F. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nWith further reference to the matter of the two pupils of the Kuper Island Industrial School, Lawrence Wilson and Walter Daniel, dealt with in my letter of the 31st ultimo,\n\nI beg to state that I have received a letter from Constable Thomas O'Connell in which he informs me that the two boys above-mentioned elected for speedy trial on the 29th ult., and on the 1st inst. were brought before His Honor Judge Barker, who, after giving them a severe lecture, let them off under suspended sentence, informing them that it would depend entirely upon their own conduct for the future whether they would be brought back again and a term of imprisonment given them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a report dated the 28th, of October last from the Rev. A. Urlings, Principal of the Kuper Island industrial school, in regard to the conduct of the pupils mentioned in his report.\n\nI may say that the Reverend Principal and his Staff of assistants were very much exercised over the very unfortunate affair and I can assure you that there was no carelessness on the part of any of the staff I cannot see how it could have been prevented with their present buildings, without some one on watch the whole night.\n\nThe two boys and two girls the worst offenders were expelled, the others were punished at the school, which I trust will deter others from like conduct.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

Mr. Ditchburn, yourself and Mr. O'Connell came to investigate the matter. I write now to acquaint the Department with it. Some of our senior pupils, both boys and girls, have rendered themselves guilty of serious misdemeanor. The following are their names:\n\nWalter Daniel, No. 131\nLawrence Wilson, No. 137\nBaptist Paul, No. 134\nHarry Johnny, No. 145\nWilliam Joe, No. 151\nMichael Underwood, No. 159\n\nThese boys and girls, two or three at a time left their respective dormitories during the night, and repaired to the barn, where four of them viz., the two first named boys and the two first named girls behaved so badly, that on your own and Mr. Ditchburn's recommendation we had not only to expel the two said boys, but even to send them before the judge. The four last named boys and the three last named girls say they just talked without meaning or doing anything bad. They were severely reprimanded and punished.\n\nNo negligence in watching can be imputed to the staff, the way the culprits went about it, it was practically impossible to detect them. As for the two most guilty girls, viz., Cecilia Charles and Elphina August, I think the sooner they are expelled from the school the better it will be.\n\nThanking yourself, and Mr. Ditchburn, and Mr. O'Connell for your kindness on this sad occasion,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCowichan Agency\nIndian Office\nDuncans Station, B. C. Jan. 7th 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to quote the following excerpt from the covering letter, dated Jan. 1st, 1913 from the Rev. A. Urlings, Principal of Kuper Island industrial school. \"Not being able to meet the ordinary expenses I respectfully ask the Department the favor of sending me the full quarterly grant.\" I am writing and informing the Reverend Principal, that he should make separate requisition and submit for your consideration. For the present I submit the above for approval, and will recommend that some consideration be given his request. As about two years ago and previous to this time the school was carrying from ten to fifteen pupils more than the grant was allowed for. During this time a deficit was incurred, which has left the present management of the school financially embarrassed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D.

Principal of the Kuper Island Industrial School with reference to the conduct of certain pupils at the institution.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter was brought to the attention of the Department at the time by Mr. Inspector Bitchburn, who on the 5th of November, last, informed the Department of the action taken to punish the offenders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nOttawa, January 20, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in reference to the grant to the Kuper Island Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has paid the full grant for the number of pupils in attendance at this school as shown by the quarterly return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nSir:\u2014\n\nIn the last two Quarterly Reports, the average attendance at our School has fallen below the 60 mark. The Government consequently cut down our quarterly grant. Considering the present financial state of our institution, we have pretty near a deficit of $2000.00. I beg to request the Department to allow us the full quarterly grant. For many years past, but especially for the last six years, the School has been carrying from ten to fifteen and even at one time to twenty pupils more than the grant was allowed for. During these years a deficit was incurred which combined with the high cost of living makes our financial state very embarrassing. Taking this into consideration I think the Department should have no objection to paying us the full quarterly grant.\n\nTo forestall an objection, I beg to state that this could not be considered as encouraging us to have the least possible pupils. If we have fallen below the average 60, it is, so to say, the fault of the Department, which, for the last two years has repeatedly urged the school authorities to bring down the number of pupils to 60. This has been done; but through circumstances of which we had no control, 4 of the pupils had to be expelled from the school and 6 others had to leave through sickness. These vacancies cannot be filled till next summer, because parents have got used to send their children after the holidays.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nHaving further reference to mine of the 7th, inst., No.199-C-2 in regard to last quarterly grant for Kuper Island industrial school. I beg to enclose herewith a requisition from Rev. A. Urlings, Principal of the school dated the 11th, inst., I trust that the Department will give favorable consideration to the request and will recommend that the full grant be allowed to them.\n\nThe unfortunate fact of having fifty on the roll is not the fault of the management of the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

Principal of the Kuper Island industrial school to yourself and Mr. Agent Robertson, with reference to an increase in the pupilage of that institution. This matter was officially brought to my attention some days ago, and I authorized an increase from 60 to 75. Just at the present time I am not prepared to grant the request of the Principal in full, but at some later date I hope to be able to provide a grant for the total number of pupils for which they will have accommodation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

The new school will have accommodation for 100 pupils as against 60 in the old one, for which number they now receive the Government grant.\n\nRev. William Lemmens, the principal, informs me that he will have no difficulty in filling the school to its capacity, providing that the grant is increased to allow of this being done. I would recommend that if provision has not been already made in the estimates for the increasing of the per capita grant in this school that the matter should be taken up at once in order that when the school is opened they will be able to take in as many pupils up to their capacity as they can obtain.\n\nI learn also that the Indians are all taking a keen interest in the new building and are very desirous of sending a lot of new pupils there, and it would be unfortunate when such a favorable condition prevails, should the school authorities be unable to admit the number of pupils, which they have accommodation, owing to no funds being provided for the increased number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

There 67 pupils on the roll, 33 boys and 34 girls, all making satisfactory progress in their studies. A new teacher has been added to the staff in the person of Rev. H. Dedewert, who will take charge of the small boys, and teach music to all the male pupils. The health of the children had been very good since the beginning of the year, though one girl died of tuberculosis at her home in Saanich during the summer vacation. On the farm this year the crops were only fair, owing to the unusually dry summer. The new school was ready for the furniture and the pupils were all looking forward for the day when they would be transferred from the old to the new building.\n\nSgd W. M.

Gibbons\n\nEnc.\nKuper Island\nIndian Industrial School Opening\n\nThe opening of the new Kuper Island Indian Industrial school was off without a single hitch on Tuesday last. Hundreds of Indians, men, women and children came from near and far for the occasion and, with about a hundred of their white brethren, gathered in the school yard to enjoy the hospitality of the Rev. Father Lemmens and his courteous staff.\n\nIn the morning Rear Admiral W. O. Story and Miss Story arrived on the Maida, Capt. H. H. Shepherd, M.P., and the Rt. Rev. Bishop MacDonald and a guest came on board. They passed along the wharf, decorated with flags and bunting, to the imposing three-story brick edifice which replaces the old wooden school built in 1890.\n\nAfter an excellent lunch in the girls' work room, the ceremony referred to above took place. It was the 26th anniversary of the foundation. Since then 342 pupils had passed through the school. It was the request of the late Bishop Lemmens that the government erected the first school, aid being given by Mr. Gordon, then M.P. for Nanaimo, who said he should be honoured. He paid a glowing tribute to Mr. Gordon, which has been continued in the present building; to the Indian department; to the firm of Gordon Co., Canadian contractors; and to Mr. Myles Morley, inspector of schools.\n\nMr. Gordon most neatly described the credit for the new school to Father Lemmens' persistence and devotion.\n\nAfter the service was held in the beautiful chapel in the building the ceremony of raising the flag was performed by the bishop. Its sprinkling with holy water was prefixed by a prayer. His Excellency said that this was a red letter day in the annals of those noble tribes whose ancestors had dwelt in this land from immemorial times. The building itself was a mark of the provident care which the government had for its Indian wards. They owed it to the government which had always extended its protection to the Indians.\n\nThe bishop had worked first in the field and had proved to be a most helpful friend to the Indians, of which the government had so generously seconded. That work was the upliftment of the aborigines, the normal inhabitants.\n\nIn the past days missionaries went down into the Indian camps and shared their lives; now the government had brought them together, the children of those tribes to share the life that civilization, the arts and sciences enabled.\n\nThis great building was worthy of the government and of the Blessing of God, be the means of doing great good. They had come to help the Indians, dedicated to the service of God and humanity.\n\nFollowing the blessing the Union Jack was raised by the building by Mrs. F. H. Shepherd, Admiral Story's leading lady. The band played while the children sang \"Three Cheers for the Red, White and Blue.\" It also played \"O Canada.\"\n\nMemorable Scene\n\nThe bishop in his robes, with attendant priests and acolytes, stood on the high entrance porch. They looked down on a great gathering. The girl pupils, attired in neat grey and blue and marshalled by kindly sisters, stood in rows. The old Indians of all ages gathered near, while, farther on, the eye travelled down to the wharf where the launch slowly entered, over to the grim grey bulk of the steamer. A picture of the scene had been taken one of the finest views in the province, across the grey, smooth expanse of the Salish Sea, by Mount Brenton.\n\nSpeeches from the porch followed. The first was introduced by Father Lemmens, Mr. F. H. Shepherd, who said he was very pleased by the visit. It was his pleasure as a representative of the Dominion government to congratulate the bishop, fathers and sisters, on the efforts which had resulted in an edifice which would stand for centuries. It perpetuated a tribute to the people whose ancestors had dwelt in this land and an evidence of the recognition of the debt owed to the Indians. We had been working hard at getting to assimilate them.\n\nHe wished to pay the highest tribute to each of those clergy present. He was not a member of it, but he knew the work in the Cariboo and Alaska, its evidence of Christianity in alleviating sickness and distress.\n\nTo Mr. Gordon, Mr. Shepherd said that the building was dedicated for them. Their gratitude, if they responded similarly, would some day bless the fathers and sisters who had done so much.\n\nTo Mr. Duncan Campbell Scott, deputy superintendent of the Indian department, Mr. Shepherd paid a glowing tribute for his help in aiding his representations. The building would stand as a monument to the skill and integrity of the Island builders and craftsmen. He thanked Mr. Shepherd for raising the \"first flag on earth, the flag that never comes down.\"\n\nLesson of Freedom\n\nRear Admiral Story took the flag as his own. It was a symbol which meant that everyone should be free to work out his own salvation. For that was the object of the new school would teach the boys and girls how to earn their living and give them worldly, combined with spiritual wisdom. It was the happiest thing possible to have such a school to do. Here they would learn that what was best for them was best for the world. They would be taught to be good Catholics of whom there were 500,000 in the world, speaking the same head, His Holiness the Pope. If they carried their teaching with them throughout life, they could become citizens of the greatest empire on earth.\n\nMr. W. E. Ditchburn, superintendent of Indian agencies, B. C., recounted his experiences with getting this building project started. Some people were sufficiently ungenerous and unwilling to see that the government did not do enough for the Indians; some were generous.\n\nThe government desired to bring the aborigine up to the standard of the white man and this could be begun only education. He quoted figures showing that in the past ten years $138,697 had been expended on education among the 25,000 Indians in the province, an expenditure of 5.5 cents per head. In the past year $33,279 had been spent in medical and hospital services. If the good work would go on and, if the Indian did not take advantage of the facilities offered, it was not the fault of the department.\n\nSpeeches in Chinook\n\nMr. W. R. Robertson, Cowichan Indian agency, spoke to the Indians in Chinook. His remarks were frequently punctuated with applause.\n\nChief Edward Halibutson, Penelakut, addressed the gathering of men, and presented an address to Mr. Shepherd asking for still more accommodation for educated children. The member promised to do all he could.\n\nBill Quinamuck, of Quinamuck and a picturesque figure and Indian lawyer, completed the speeches.\n\nCanoe racing followed. Cowichan Indians won the big race, seven in a canoe, from Valdes and Indians, by three quarters of a length after a race ranging from Duncan to Cowichan by road. The football game was excellently and beautifully decorated, and at which the girls and boys sang and recited songs and poems.\n\nThere is much to see in the building, of which Mr. R. W. O. O. O. was the architect. A description of it will be given later. The choice of materials employed today were a tribute to the excellence of the culinary department and its staff.\nOld School for Education of Indians at Kuper Island\n\nNEW INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL OPENED\n\nDedication of Kuper Island Institution Takes Place \u2014 Bishop MacDonald and Mr. F. H. Shepherd Present.\n\nTuesday, June 6, 1916, will be a memorable date in the annals of the work of the Government of Canada for the Indians of Vancouver Island. It will mark the successful culmination of a series of efforts extending over many years to secure to the native children the fullest opportunity to enter into the enjoyment of the same benefits of civilization which are possessed by white people and to take their place among the educated citizens of the country. The new building for the Indian Industrial School at Kuper Island is designed to provide the best possible education of Indians shall be equipped with modern educational apparatus and modern comfort should go a long way towards facilitating the task of bringing the ways of civilization and moving them to elevate their standards of living.\n\nThe Indian Industrial School at Kuper Island was built in 1899 by the Dominion Government for the Indians of the Cowichan Agency. Its first principal was the Rev. Father Donceel who, for twenty-three years, worked with untiring zeal amid apparently insuperable difficulties to place the work on a solid foundation. Father Donceel died in 1907, worn out with his labors. The Fathers of the Congregation then took charge of the work. The Rev. Fathers Urschitz, Schuster, and Rev. Father W. Lemmens, who was appointed in 1913, have successively held the office. The services of the Fathers have been loyally seconded by the Sisters of St. Ann, who have had charge of the school since 1907.\n\nFather Lemmens saw at once, on his assumption of charge, that he had reached a stage where the old buildings were neither large nor modern enough to accommodate the increasing number of pupils. He therefore implored Mr. Frank Shepherd, the energetic member for Nanaimo in the present Parliament, to lay the claims of the institution before that body. The Rev. Shepherd did, with such success that it was possible to dedicate on Tuesday last the magnificent new building which was the admiration of all who saw it.\n\nImposing Structure\n\nThe new building is an imposing structure, finished in red brick, and provides accommodation for 160 pupils. Its equipment is of the most up-to-date character. There are classrooms, large airy dormitories, well-stocked workshops for the boys and fully-appointed practice kitchens and laundry for the girls, providing the principal teachers with all possible means of attaining their great object.\n\nA goodly number of visitors journeyed to the beautiful island on Tuesday to take part in the festivities. The Indians began to arrive at an early hour from all parts of the agency, and fully 100 were gathered on the beach by the time the dedication ceremony commenced. Among these were many former pupils of the school.\n\nThe White visitors included Right Rev. Alexander MacDonald, D.D., Bishop of Victoria; Rev. Father Horne, of Nanaimo; Mr. and Mrs. Sheppard, proprietors of the Island; Rev. Fathers Silver, and others, of Victoria; Mr. McLean, of Ladysmith; Scheele, of Port McNeill; of the staff of the school; the Mother Provincial of the Sisters of St. Ann, and Mrs. Horne, wife of the Mayor of the Esquimalt naval station, and Miss Murray; Mr. Frank Shepherd, M.P. for Nanaimo; Mr. Sheppard; Mr. W. Ditchburn, Inspector of Indian Affairs; Mr. C. Carter, Inspector of Indian Schools; Mr. W. R. Robertson, Indian Agent for the Cowichan District; Mr. W. G. Oliver, Post Office Officer; Mr. R. H. Fletcher, Post Office Inspector; with Mr. Fletcher; Mr. Smith, of the Naval Building Committee; with Mrs. Smith; Mr. Miles Morley, superintendent of the school; Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, of the school; Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell, of Victoria, and many others.\n\nThe proceedings began with luncheon, served in the \"catering\" department of the new building. Over 100 guests sat down at table. After Mr. Frank Shepherd had delivered his address, he claimed the whole credit for the completion of the work to the late Father Lemmens, who had left him no peace until he had persuaded the authorities in Ottawa of the necessity of the building. He appreciated the presence of so many visitors testifying to the interest shown in the work and the importance of the cause of uplifting of the Indians.\n\nBlessed Buildings\n\nAfter luncheon the Bishop of Victoria proceeded to the blessing of the building, which was carried out according to custom.\nhe taught the truths of the Catholic Church, and if they lived up to them they would be more likely to attend usual offices of the Mass. The Fathers and Sisters would teach them this, but they might not have the opportunity or the business to do this. Well, he said it too, and he was an old man of the sea who had seen the best and worst of scenes of life. He trusted that the new school would be a great source of material and spiritual benefit to all of them.\n\nHigher Civilization\n\nMr. W. E. Ditchburn, Inspector of Indian Affairs, was the next speaker, and said it afforded him much pleasure at being present for the formal opening of the school. He spoke in view of the fact that he felt that he was to some extent, responsible for its construction, as he had recently visited the Government officers at Ottawa the desirability of replacing the old building by the present substantial structure which had been suited to the Government's policy of educating the Indians, in order that they might reach a higher stage of civilization than that on which their forefathers had been left behind.\n\nAs a representative of the Department of Indian Affairs, Mr. Ditchburn thought it his duty to make a few remarks to those who sometimes say that the Government is doing too much for the Indians, and that the Indians themselves, as well as others who maintain such unsparingly, are far from the Government doing enough for the Indians. To the former Mr. Ditchburn said that the Government of Canada realized its duty to its wards, the Indians, and proposed, if possible, to do so much for them as in the future take his place in the commercial and industrial world along with his white brothers. Mr. Ditchburn said, could only be realized by the Indians rising to the level of the white race. They had been given an education and for this purpose the Government of Canada was spending $1,186,367.16 during the past ten years, which aggregated $11,865,616.24. The amounts are as follows:\n\n| Year | Residential School | Day School | Total |\n|------|-------------------|------------|-------|\n| 1905-6 | 75,000.00 | 31,478.56 | 106,478.56 |\n| 1906-7 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1907-8 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1908-9 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1909-10 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1910-11 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1911-12 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1912-13 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1913-14 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| 1914-15 | 74,000.00 | 31,366.56 | 105,366.56 |\n| Total | 1,186,367.16 | 458,732.32 | 1,645,099.48 |\n\nMr. Ditchburn explained that during the past ten years five residential schools had been built at Alert Bay, St. Eugene Mission, Carcross and the present one at Kuper Island, which had been dedicated that day. A large number of day schools had also been built. He also went on to show that the Indian population of British Columbia had been steadily increasing, the increase close to the 25,000 mark, which would show a per capita cost for the ten years of approximately $45.00 or a total per capita cost of 47 cents. Mr. Ditchburn also said that another item of expenditure in connection with the charge of the Indians was that for their medical care, which included medical attendance, medicines and hospital work in the fiscal year alone reached the sum of $44,370.00.\n\nGood Work to Go On\n\nMr. Ditchburn said that after reading about the school he trusted that the Indians would appreciate the good work the Government was doing in their behalf, but whether or not the fruits of the Government's work were the amount of appreciation they were entitled to, the good work would still go on until each time as such educational facilities were provided for the Indian children of should be loyal to the Government and loyal to the church.\n\nChief's Address\n\nAfter the address Bishop MacDonald, chief of the Kuper Island Indians, read an address to Mr. Shepherd on behalf of the Indians of the Island, thanking him for the efforts he had made to bring about the building of the new school. He thanked Mr. Shepherd for the assistance and the interest shown in the Indians. He took advantage of the occasion to make a point not noticed by Mr. Sheppard that the school was still too small and that not all the children who would like to go there could be accommodated. He asked Mr. Shepherd to use his influence to procure a larger grant permitted by the natives. Later that evening on land, and the whole was concluded by a further address by Mr. Sheppard, Mr. Cowichan and the team of the school, which ended in a draw.\n\nIn the evening a supper and entertainment was provided, chiefly by the girls, although the brass band of the school, under the direction of Father DeWaeer, had already taken a prominent part in the day's proceedings, and further added to the programme. The programme of the entertainments was as follows:\n\nGreensleeves; \"Silver Jubilee\"; jubilee song; physical culture, dumb bell; rope swinging; action song, \"Busy Little Workers\"; \"The Indian Hunters\"; salute to our flag; concert piece, \"Our Beautiful Land\"; song \"O Canada.\"\n\nThese items were interspersed with selections by the band. Those present were struck with the earnestness of the children's enthusiasm, their grateful expression of the kindness of their friends and the general evidence their performance gave of painstaking training. At the close of the celebration, the Kuper Island Schools, gave expression to the deep satisfaction they felt in witnessing the performances and said that they greatly respects the Indian Industrial schools over the province, the paternal schools of the Province. As examples, he mentioned the division of the day into half a day's instruction and half a day's manual training. He said that a scheme was being tried under which still more attention would be paid to the question of manual training, so that it should be more effective. He was very pleased with all he had seen and hoped he would see the new school every success and blessing.\n\nThe singing of the National Anthem brought to a close all the festivities, which will remain long in the hearts of those who had the happiness of experiencing it. The new school promises to be a line to play an important part in the history of the Indians of the Island.\n\nIndian Affairs (RC 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTo file\n\nReport\nDear Sir,\n\nI am forwarding today to the Indian Department in the usual way an application for an increased grant for our school. Last year on our entrance into the new building the grant was increased from 60 to 75, now I would like it increased to 96 the full capacity of our school. According to calculations forwarded to me from the Department our dormitories can accommodate that number. The staff we have at present would be able to handle that many children. Only that Father De Weert, who at present is getting no salary, would be put on the same footing as Father Murphy, and receive a salary of $25.00 a month. I have at present 81 pupils at the school, and have been obliged to refuse more applications than would be necessary to make the 96. The Indians seem to be very anxious to send their children to our new school. The fact that I have been obliged to refuse a great many applications produced a good effect, up to now the Indians thought they were doing us a favor by sending their children, now they see it is the other way around.\n\nI fully realise that this is a poor time to come and ask for an increased outlay of money. But you must admit that it would be bad policy to economise at the expense of education, so I feel sure you will find some means to the increase I ask for.\n\nWith best wishes and kind regards from the Revd.

It is only right that the beautiful new building the Department erected at great cost should be used to its full capacity. According to calculations from the Department at Ottawa there is accommodation for 96 pupils. The present grant is for 75 pupils only. I wish it increased to NINETY SIX. I have at present 81 pupils present at the school, and have been obliged to refuse a great many applications.

It has an enrolment of 82, with an average attendance of 78, with a per capita grant of $140.00 for 75 pupils.\n\nThe proposed increase of ten pupils in the number provided for is required to meet the educational wants of the Roman Catholic children on the Quamichan Reserve in the Cowichan Agency.\n\nThe Day school formerly carried on there was closed last July for want of attendance and for the reason that the building in which the school was conducted was condemned and was totally unfit for occupation. The Indians of this reserve are of nomadic habits and leave the reserve at least six months in the year in order to make a livelihood at the fisheries and as they take their children with them, they receive little or no benefit from the day school and it is thought that by transferring them to the Kuper Island Industrial School, where there are already a number of children from this reserve, they would be in a position to receive a good education.\nOttawa, July 30, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Supplementary Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1918-19 provide for an increase of ten pupils in the number already provided for the Kuper Island Industrial School. This increase is to meet the educational wants of the Roman Catholic children on the Quamichan Reserve in the Cowichan Agency, and this increased grant will be paid only for pupils from that reserve. It is not the intention to re-open the day school on the Quamichan Reserve, as there is ample accommodation in the Kuper Island Industrial School for the children from that reserve.\n\nYou should take the necessary steps as soon as possible, to have these ten extra children recruited from among the Roman Catholic children of school age on the Quamichan Reserve. The principal is being informed of the increase provided for in the number of pupils and you should consult him in connection with the recruiting of these children. Applications and certificates of health should be forwarded for all children sent to the industrial school. It is hoped that you will be successful in obtaining the consent of the parents to allow their children to be sent to Kuper Island school, where they will receive a good education.\n\nAs above stated this grant will only be allowed for ten pupils who must all be from the Quamichan Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. H. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans B. C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa July 30, 1918.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Supplementary Estimates for Indian education for the Fiscal Year 1918-19, provides for an increase of ten pupils in the number for which the grant is allowed the Kuper Island Industrial School. This increase will provide for a total of 25 pupils, there being ample accommodation for this extra number.\n\nAs it is not the intention of re-opening the day school on the Quamichan Reserve, in the Cowichan Agency, this increase in the grant to your school is to meet the educational wants of the Roman Catholic children on that reserve. Mr. Agent Robertson is being informed of this increase in the number of pupils and instructed to take the necessary action, in conjunction with yourself, to have ten children recruited from the Quamichan Reserve and sent to your school.\n\nThis extra grant will only be paid for ten new pupils who must be members of the Quamichan Band. It is hoped that the agent and yourself will be successful in obtaining this number of Roman Catholic children of school age and in good health from that reserve. The recruiting of the children should receive your early attention and you should consult the agent regarding the matter. Applications and certificates of health are to be forwarded for each child secured for your school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRev. Jos.

And the intention of the Department not to re-open the school (Roman Catholic) in this reserve. I beg to advise you that Quamichan day school was never situated on the Quamichan Reserve. The school was first started at the Roman Catholic Mission between the Quamichan and Comeaken villages and near the Clemclemaluts and Khenipson villages, later it was moved to the Clemclemaluts reserve as it was considered more convenient for all the above named bands and including the Koksilah reserve, where it has continued until closed on account of account of not being able to secure a suitable teacher for the salary offered.\n\nFrom information received from Rev. Father E.W. Scheelon, the Roman Catholic Missionary in charge of this Mission, the increase of ten pupils was to be recruited from all the bands in the Cowichan Reserve No.1. If it is not the intention of the Department to re-open the school known, officially, as the Quamichan day school on the Clemclemaluts Reserve it will be a hardship on the children at Clemclemaluts Comeaken, Khenipson and Koksilah, if they have to wait for a vacancy at Kuper Island. You will see by the plan showing\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nthe location of day schools on the Cowichan Reserve, prepared by Mr. A. H. Green, P. L. S. and submitted in a letter from this office Feb. 7th, 1912, No532 -Ar2- in connection with Departmental File No.129635-1- that Clemclemaluts is the central and convenient location for a day school for the above named bands.\n\nIt will also be seen by referring to the quarterly reports of the teacher, that children who attended came from Khenipson, Kokilah, Comeaken and Clemclemaluts,\n\nI will respectfully ask that we be allowed to recruit the ten pupils from all the Bands on Cowichan Reserve No.1.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nAugust 16, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the increased grant of ten pupils in the number already provided for the Kuper Island Industrial School.\n\nThis increase was made in order to provide for the children who attended the Quamichan Roman Catholic Day School which is to remain closed and the children from the Bands who attended the Quamichan Day School may be recruited and sent to the Kuper Island Industrial School, which, as stated by you, will include all the bands on Cowichan Reserve No. 1.\n\nYou may advise the principal of the Kuper Island School accordingly and it is hoped that the ten pupils for which the increased grant is made, will be recruited at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.

During this time Rev. Father A. Murphy would take my place. He has seven years of experience with the children of the School, and has acted already as principal a few years ago whilst my predecessor was taking his holidays.\n\nTrusting the Department will favorably consider this request and proposition, I beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDuncan C.

I hope you will have a good trip and benefit from the change. I am sure that the affairs of the school will be administered efficiently during your absence by Father Murphy. Should you find it convenient to call when passing through Ottawa I should be very glad to see you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joseph Geurts,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Industrial School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\nKUPER ISLAND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nAt the time of my visit to this school this summer, the following matters were brought to my attention: Land is badly needed - there are 75 acres at present. Mr. Agent Lomas would like something done in an effort to quiet the older Indians of the band who insist that they were to have been paid for this property. Fifty acres to the east of the school site is reserve land, not settled and might be acquired.\n\nGrapes, walnuts, fruits of all kinds, all vegetables and some of the potatoes are raised. They have 7 milch cows and 3 horses, but not enough land to raise beef. Water supply and acetylene lighting systems - in good condition. They have enough water to irrigate all of the 50 acres that are cultivated, from the reservoir.\n\nI found here the best gymnasium at any Indian school in Canada. There is a spectators' balcony, dressing rooms, lavatories and playrooms - all in the gymnasium building. There is a splendid Band here: they need a few more instruments at this time. They have splendid manual training equipment, but no instructor. Mr. Cairns suggests a Government manual training instructor to travel among the 5 or 6 residential schools on the mainland.\n\nThe barn is fairly adequate - the hennery and piggery are good - excellent laundry equipment - good bakery and dairy - heating O.K. The bake oven needs repairs and they will write about this. I noticed in the pig pen a splendid swing swivel wall over the trough.\n\nR.F.F.\nI do not think these pupils are well fed. I have gone into this matter with the Principal very thoroughly. All the milk is separated. That means that all the butter fat is taken out of the milk and the pupils receive skim milk. I went into the boys' dining room at supper time. Here is what each boy had: soup, bread and apple sauce, and tea with milk. If I had my way I would banish every separator from these Industrial and Boarding Schools. The pupils need the butter fat so much.\n\nx x x x x x x\n\nEva Hall died May the 5th after an operation for the removal of the appendix. Mary Siah, aged 15 years, died of peritonitis September 3rd, 1922. Joseph Jacob died in July some ten or twelve days after being discharged. I could not find out the cause of death. I presume that he was about 18 years of age.\n\nThen you will see by this report that 11 are now out on sick leave. The Indians are inclined to boycott this school on account of so many deaths.\n\nMay I be permitted to suggest that the Doctor who visits this school monthly be requested to send into the Department a report on the health of the pupils of this school. I would also ask that a copy of his report be sent to me.\nOttawa, Dec. 16, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report dated November 9th, last, on his inspection of the Kuper Island Industrial School, has drawn attention to the food supplied the pupils. He states that he considers they are not well fed; that the children are given milk which has been separated and all the butter fat removed; and that the other articles of diet are meager and not of a nourishing quality.\n\nAs milk is one of the chief articles of diet for children, the Principal should see that an ample supply of pure milk, containing all the butter fat, is furnished for their use. Butter should be made only from any surplus milk after the pupils have obtained a reasonable quantity. You will be good enough to draw this matter to the attention of the Principal and see that the Department's requirements are carried out.\n\nYou should instruct the Doctor who visits this school monthly to examine the children and furnish a report on their health. There have been a number of deaths during the past year and, as a result, the Indian parents are inclined to boycott the school. The Doctor should examine into the food furnished and ascertain whether it is ample and contains sufficient nourishment for the needs of the children. It might be well if he would give the Principal his advice regarding the quantities and kinds of food that should be supplied. We will be pleased to receive a report made by the Doctor regarding the diet supplied at this school, and any recommendations which he desires to make. You will please give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nDuncan Station, B.

Father A. Murphy who has been Acting Principal during my absence.\n\nTrusting both propositions will be favorably considered by the Department, I beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours most sincerely\n\nDuncan C.

On the whole I should say the pupils are very well nourished. There have been a few pupils who looked underfed on admission but these all have markedly improved during the last few months.\n\nThe sickness this winter so far has not been so much as last year, less Tubercular glands and skin diseases and every precaution has been taken to prevent any outbreak and spread of influenza.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) H.

The doctor should, on the occasion of future visits to this school, keep a careful oversight on the diet furnished the children and advise the principal regarding any change in variety or quality that he thinks would be beneficial to the general health of the pupils.\n\nWe further note that whole milk is now being supplied, and forms part of the pupils' daily diet. The younger children, especially, should receive an ample supply of milk at each meal.\n\nIt is hoped that, as a result of the doctor's visit and future oversight there will be no further cause for complaint regarding the quality of the milk supplied, or the diet furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan Station,\nB. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nOur role of pupils, according to present grant, is full; and under present conditions we cannot accommodate more pupils. Yet just now I have already 6 new applications on hand and with a small effort more could be had. I think it is a pity that we cannot give all these children an opportunity of learning something. Some of these applicants are over 10, and live too far away from the day-schools.\n\nTherefore I hereby ask the Department\n\n1c : To raise our present grant from 85 to 100 pupils,\n2c : To supply our school with 32 new beds, 5 ft. long.\n\nBy doing this we easily find accommodation for 100 pupils in the present building. The class-rooms and dining-rooms are big enough. Presently the only difficulty is for the dormitories; but this would be overcome by replacing 24 big size beds (6ft.long for children of 7,8,9 years old) by 32 smaller size beds (5 ft Long). In this way there would be 24 bigger boys and 24 bigger girls in their respective dormitories; and 26 smaller boys and 26 smaller girls in their respective dormitories. I don't think there is any objection from a sanitary point of view; because for those 26 smaller pupils (7,8,9,10 years old) there is an air space of 13/22/42.\n\nNow with regard to those 24 bigger beds taken out of the two dormitories, these would be disposed of in the 2 infirmaries and ex-pupils rooms; because when 10 years ago our grant was increased to 75 some of these beds were taken out of those same rooms.\n\nTrusting the Department will favorably consider this proposition for the welfare of the Indian children, I beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 24, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to increasing the pupilage at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School and requesting 32 new 5 foot beds. I regret that this request was not made a few months ago, so that provision could have been made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year if favourable consideration had been given. The Department is always pleased to increase the pupilage to the safe limit of accommodation; but you will understand that the provision of funds is first necessary.\n\nThe amount of air space in the dormitories will have to be determined quite accurately and I should be grateful if you would let me have the dimensions of all four dormitories - length, width and height. You should also intimate if any space is lost to these dormitories because of staff quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos.

I find that your four dormitories provide accommodation for a maximum of 100 pupils. There is a total air space of approximately 49,400 ft., which provides 500 cubic feet for each of 100 pupils. As I mentioned in my letter of the 24th ultimo, funds are not available to grant an increase at the present time; but you should bring this matter to the Department's attention in the fall, so that an item can be placed in our Estimates for the next fiscal year. At that time, you should also mention what is the minimum number of beds that will be required if the added pupilage is allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt.of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur roll of pupils, according to present grant, is about full; on the girls' side we have even enrolled more than we can accommodate under present conditions. Besides there are quite a few more children of school age in the district; and with a little effort, I think, some of these could be brought to the school.\n\nTherefore I make the following request to the Department:\n1o: To raise our present grant for 85 pupils to a grant for 100;\n2o: To supply our school with 36 new beds complete (5 ft long only)\nBy doing this we easily find accommodation for these 100 pupils in the present building. The class-rooms and the dining-room are big enough. The only difficulty we find just now is in the dormitories; but this would be overcome by replacing some of the bigger size beds (6 ft long) by those 36 smaller size beds (only 5 ft long).\n\nI don't think there can be any objection from a sanitary point of view; because the total air space of the 4 dormitories is as follows: 2 lower dormitories each 34 ft 3 in/25 ft 8 in/14 ft., and 2 upper dormitories each 43 ft/22 ft/13 ft.\n\nNow with regard to those beds (6 ft long) taken out of the dormitories, these would be disposed of in the 2 infirmaries and in the ex-pupils quarters; because when some ten years ago our grant was increased from 75 to 85, some of these beds were taken out of these same rooms.\n\nTrusting that for the welfare of the Indian children the Department will favorably consider this request.\n\nI beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 21, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, requesting that a grant for an increased pupilage at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School be provided, and also that 36 new beds be supplied.\n\nWith reference to an increased pupilage, I beg to say that the Department will allow a grant for 90 pupils from January 1st, 1929, and from April 1st, 1929, an increased grant for 95 pupils. As our appropriation is limited, the increase to 90 pupils is all that can be provided during the balance of the present year. We will arrange to provide, in our Estimates for the fiscal year beginning April 1st, next, for a pupilage of 95 at your School.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding the new beds asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I regret that it is impossible to increase the per capita grant, as it would disturb the schedule of payments to schools of the same kind.

Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter from the Department dated March 9th 1928, No. 152-0-1, it was stated that the 4 dormitories in the Kuper Island Residential School, according to air space, can provide accommodation for 100 pupils. At that time the necessary beds and bedding was supplied. But for some reason or other grant was allowed only for 95 pupils.\n\nNow in view of the fact that at the present time we have more than 95 pupils in the school I ask the Department kindly to consider an increase in pupilage to that 100 limit. This, for the time being, will eliminate the necessity of building a day school in one of the surrounding districts.\n\nFor the welfare of the Indian education, I feel most confident that the Department will favorably consider this request of\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 12, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, requesting that the pupilage for which a per capita grant be provided at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School be increased from the number at present allowed, viz., 95, to 100 pupils, as there is accommodation for this number.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that your request reached the Department too late to be included in the Main Estimates which are to be submitted to Parliament at the next Session. If you find that you can maintain an average of 95 pupils and earn in full the grant at present allowed, you might bring your request to the attention of the Department again next Spring, at which time, if our funds will stand the added expense, favourable consideration would then be given to authorizing any increase in the number of grant earning pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

But I was given to understand to submit it again in the Spring.\n\nNow I may say that for quite awhile already we have 100 pupils present in the school. And so today I come to renew this last year's request viz., to have the grant earning pupilage increased from 95 to 100.\n\nHoping that this request will reach you on time and confident that it will be given a favourable consideration, I beg to remain,\n\nDear Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 30, 1931.\n\nRev.

Modest, would say that under present circumstances I cannot take her.\n\nFurther I would state that even some of the children over 10 years of age, who are making application cannot be admitted.\n\nIn a letter from the Department I was told; \"The number of pupils for which the grant is provided is 95 only.\" Now since we have the required air space to accommodate 100 pupils, and since I have taken the trouble to make the necessary preparations for this number would it not be possible to have a special provision made for these 5 additional pupils and raise the grant to 100? The education of 5 more children is surely worth the small amount involved. And besides, during these hard times, clothes and board will be provided for these children, and their parents will have less reason for applying to the Department for relief.\n\nConfident you will be able to obtain this for the advancement of the Indian education, I beg to remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Jos.

As you will see from the Reverend Principal's letter he has air space according to Department requirements to accommodate 100 pupils, and I would like very much to recommend that he be given a per capita grant for this number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The Father after many years as head of the School has been called to a new field of labor. Before leaving the School he wrote his letter of resignation and left it on his desk to be forwarded. The delay in sending it has been occasioned by the fact that he made a mistake in stating that the Rev.Father X.Lauzon, missionary in the Cowichan district, was to take his place as Principal of the School. The Superiors of the Religious Community, that have had charge of the Kuper Island School since 1907, intended Father Lauzon only as assistant to the Principal. The principalship was to go to the Rev.John Camirand, who had to arrive from Eastern Canada. The latter has now arrived at the School, and I would like to ask the Department to approve of his appointment as Principal of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. Father Camirand is well qualified for the position. For several years he has been connected with colleges both in Canada and the United States. Besides he has had experience as an Indian Missionary, being stationed as such at Kuper Island about six years ago. He is young and energetic, and I feel sure he will make good as Principal of the School. I hope the Department will approve him as Principal of Kuper Island School.\n\nAs district Superior of the Fathers of the Company of Mary on Vancouver Island, I have been asked by our Head-quarters to forward the above information to the Department.\n\nYours truly, Rev.W.Lemmens,S.M.M.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nJan 15th 1939\n\n2nd of the Interior\nIndian Affairs Branch\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nBeing called to another field of action I hereby resign as Principal of the Kuper Island Res.

What view, however, a sane jury would take knowing to what lengths of mendacity Indians can go when pushed on by subversive elements, is an entirely different matter. I am glad you realize I have done all in my power to facilitate the necessary inquiries into the situation and that I will as in the past cooperate with the department to the maximum in achieving any ameliorations suggested. Though quite cognizant of certain lamentable breaches of morality in connection with individual members of certain public institutions in this province, I have always taken the quiet way in quest of amendment because I fail to see any advantage in ruining an institution because of some individual's supposed or even real misdeeds. If in such cases Royal Commissions are going to be accorded generously, then assuredly no one in the Dominion would be out of work!\n(2) In regard to the East Coast Agency I wish to press very strongly for the appointment of Mr Bernard Francis Neary, a talented young man, fond of the Indians and provided with the very best of references. He happens to be a Catholic but I feel under the circumstances this should only add to the opportuneness of his appointment because the majority of the Indians being Catholics, the bishops are growing more and more nettled to find a Catholic nominee never seems to be contemplated. One of their number said \"What we require is an Indian Catholic Emancipation Act\". Moreover with all due respect to Mr Graham, his inefficiency on the East Coast has caused us plenty of inconvenience not to use a harsher word and Mr Chambers the local liberal representative though not a Catholic on his own initiative called on me to state his conviction that Mr Neary would be the logical nominee. To give you some notion of his qualifications I am taking the liberty of enclosing a memorandum in case you may not be personally familiar with the man's standing.\n\n(3) On the West Coast I believe Mr Ashbridge has striven conscientiously to fulfil his duties and though I do not always see eye to eye with him I certainly feel he is a worth while agent in every regard. To my mind the most disturbing factor on the West Coast is the Ahousat School where sickness and trouble seems to be perpetually rife. I am not blaming the present staff but I do feel the Indian Act was strangely contravened when a second residential school was put so close to Christie School and the net result was that the white men's sad religious wrangles were also and quite unnecessarily visited upon the Indians. However things being as they are probably a day school would be the best solution - if any school there at all.\n\nWith personal regards and the earnest hope that Mr Neary's application will be accepted I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCopy for the information of\nDr. H.W.

I think you will find you will not have the same difficulty with him that you had with Mr. Graham.\n\nIn so far as Mr. Henry is concerned, the only way he could be taken into the Service would be through the usual channels. All the positions in the Indian Affairs Branch come under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission; the Branch has not the right to select its own employees.

All of these children who should not ordinarily be able to attend the day school owing to family conditions. A good work is very enthusiastic about the Principal and is certainly giving him every possible assistance. Everything in connection with this school was in excellent condition.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDuncan, B.C., July 2nd, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF JUNE.\n\nAll the day schools in the agency were visited during the month, also the Kuper Island Residential school. Children all went home quite happy and contented and are looking forward to their holidays. The attendance at all the day schools dropped off very badly during the early part of June and in every case the parents of the children leaving had to go to the fishing grounds or berry fields. I am quite convinced that the most suitable arrangement for the day schools in this agency would be to close at the end of May and open at the first of September, rather than a month later.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nSeptember 15/42\n\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs required by the W.P.T.B. I beg to inform that this school has 15 people on its staff and 92 children on the school roll.\n\nI have already filled form A and forwarded as directed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Camirand\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nApril 20/43\n\nMr. R.H. Moore\nIndian Agent\nDuncan B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs regards the date when children of the school may leave for the holidays, I beg to state that every year I have much to contend with, as the parents come and beg that their children be permitted to leave school early in June. They give as reason for this that by the end of that month they must be far up North to make good the opportunity of the run of fish. A trip back to the school at that time would be costly and a lost of good time.\n\nThe Indian parents seem to all agree that June 15th would be a suitable date, as then they would still be at Cape Mudge, where with the facility of train or bus they could come to meet their children or have these come to them at that place.\n\nAs the greater number of Indians who have children in school are now fishing and no doubt will be doing so from now on, this matters in my opinion appears to be of general concern. Therefore may I ask that if the Department sees fit, June 15th be made definitely the date for the holidays, with the understanding of course that August 15th will be the date of the end of the holiday period.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. Camirand\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 885-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDuncan, B. C.\nApril 20th, 1943.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C. P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to submit herewith in duplicate a letter which I have just received from the Rev. Principal of the Kuper Island Residential School with reference to the advisability of closing this school on June 15th next instead of June 30th, and reopening on August 15th, instead of September 1st, 1943.\n\nI would recommend that the Principal be given this authority for the reasons mentioned in his letter and that I be advised as soon as possible so that the parents of the children may be informed before they leave for the fishing grounds.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 20th instant, together with that of the same date by the Reverend Principal of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, requesting authority to close the school on June 15th instead of the 30th, and reopening on August 15th instead of September 1st next, in order to avoid any delay in getting the Indians out on to the fishing grounds. Under the circumstances outlined, I would recommend approval of the application and would request your advice in the matter.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nApril 30, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 26th instant,\nI wish to say that the Department is prepared to\napprove the closing of the Kuper Island Indian\nResidential School on the 15th of June rather\nthan on the 30th of the same month, this due\nto the conditions as outlined in the Principal's\nrequest. It is understood, however, that the\nschool must re-open on the 15th of August\ninstead of the 1st of September.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Male Choir Sings at St. Andrew's\n\nTsuqualete, Indian male choir, formerly trained at Kuper Island School, sang the choral parts of the service from the Missa De Angelis at high mass at St. Andrew's Cathedral Sunday.\n\nMrs. Thomas directed the choir and also sang the solo motets, while Miss M. McKay was organist.\n\nBishop John Cody announced at the mass that all Catholic churches will observe Ascension Day as a holy day of obligation and also stated that the annual novena to the Holy Ghost in preparation for the feast of Pentecost would begin Friday evening in the cathedral. First Holy Communion will take place on the morning of Pentecost and confirmation will be administered in the evening.\n\nRev. Daniel Johnson, who will be ordained to the holy priesthood Thursday in the cathedral of St. John, N.B., will arrive here July 3, to take up his duties as assistant priest of Victoria diocese. He completed his theological studies recently at Holy Heart Seminary, Halifax, N.S.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\n(continued)\n\nA further complication is found in this that the school owns no standing timber; if it did the wood could be cut in times of emergency such as these by the school staff. I have tried to make some agreement with the Indians in that sense, but there is so much wrangling between them to ascertain to whom property or limits belong that if we ventured to do our own cutting, there would be no end to trouble. Even in normal times, with the usual fishing, hop-picking and work in canneries, there is no certainty as to the possibility of one hundred and fifty cords of wood being cut and hauled in due time. As appears the alternative would be for the school to own some woodland where the staff or any other hired help could carry on operations in times of urgent need.\n\nAll this makes it difficult to meet financial obligations with an irregular attendance such as prevails yearly at the beginning of the school year, and proves to militate in favor of some betterment in that regard.\n\nI must admit that the \"bonus\" received in the two past years has helped considerably to tide over these conditions, but I must also say that previous to receiving that help, much of our personal salaries were used to make purchases and that to date some three hundred dollars of back salaries are still to be paid. Lack of experience together with unusual circumstances known to the Department in the beginning of my incumbency accounted to some extent for the necessity of using our personal earnings.\n\nI trust the Department will not consider these statements as critical of its attitude towards the school, but rather as an explanation of conditions I feel it would be of interest to know.\n\nVery obediently yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Camirand SMH\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nOctober 21/43\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan\nChief Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI take the opportunity to inform the Department about conditions prevailing here, mostly all anent the financial status of the school.\n\nYearly there is approximately a decrease of five hundred dollars in the grant for September quarter, due to the fact that the children never return to the school on opening date. A good number are enlisted to work in the hop fields, early in August, and these are the ones who return to school very late; there are some who work in the Canneries, and some who just \"idle\" around.\n\nThis year I had the holiday period begin on June 15th, to end on August 15th, with the hope of having the hop-pickers return to school in due time, but to no avail. Those who were still in the Country filled in one after another by force of the warning they got from the Police or the Indian Agent.\n\nThe hop-pickers are really the ones that create a problem, for the one reason that they are beyond reach of Police action, and for the other reason that they offer those who remain in the Country the pretext that without the full roll of pupils in school, their are no regular class periods and therefore no reason for merely being present.\n\nEvery year, it would be possible of course to fill in vacancies with new-comers, seven and eight years old, but as a consequence the roll would be made up of fifty per cent of these \"tots\", and they are not capable of doing the work required by these Industrial schools.\n\nIt might be desired that I should go and round up the former pupils myself or through one of the staff, but I must say that the location of the school being on an Island as it is, this procedure would prove to be very costly as I would have to hire a car or a truck to cover places all over the Island and nearby Vancouver. To reach these points by boat, would be mere loss of time. However in this regard I may say that this year,\nthere has been some organization on the part of the Indian Agent and\nthe Provincial Police to better this condition, and I am particularly\ngrateful to Mr. Moore for his readiness to cooperate to the best of his\nability, but I beg to state that more should be done, and would suggest\nthat all school children be rounded up previous to their departure for\nthe hop-fields.\n\nI was stating that all these remarks bear a relation to\nthe financial condition of the school and this appears when considering\nthat due to the absence of a good number of pupils at a time when there\nis great need of help on the farm to gather in the crops, the per capita\ngrant being less, I am not in a position to hire much needed help, also\nthat I cannot afford paying for transportation if it be a question of\ngathering the children myself.\n\nAs regards means of transportation for the usual convenience\nof the school, there is this also that we are now using a mission boat\nowned by the clergy of the Diocese, the engine in the school boat being\nunserviceable. I have made a request to obtain another, but was told\nthe school would have to defray the expense. As further consideration on\nthis matter, I beg to state that the present school boat, though in good\ncondition, the engine being left out, is not in keeping with the require-\nments of transportation for an Institution such as this, things being\nsuch nowadays, that trips some five miles across to Chemainus Hospital\nfor various clinics, have to be made with good number of children aboard\nand in any weather. The reason for this organization is that our D.C.\nElectrical plant is not serviceable for X Rays and other equipment.\nA bigger, faster and more comfortable boat would be needed; this the school\ncannot afford to pay for.\n\nAlso that presently we have to buy bread at twice the price\nit takes to make it, due to the fact that our present oven is useless,\nand that the delay occasioned by the purchase of a new one may still be\nextended.\n\nLastly, to be considered also, that fuel wood, a country-\nwide problem, no doubt, offers complications here also, even though there\nis plenty of standing timber all around us. The difficulty lies in the\nfact that even with a raise of one dollar and one half in cost per cord,\nto encourage Indian labor and assure our quota for the year, there is no\nprospect of satisfaction, because the Indians are making big money every-\nwhere else and find good opportunity all year round.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1943.\n\nDear Father Camirand:\n\nI have your very interesting letter of the 21st instant and appreciate the many difficulties under which you are labouring at the present time. Part of them, no doubt, are due to present conditions which other residential schools throughout Canada are also experiencing. I presume that the Indian Agents concerned will give you every possible assistance in returning to the school pupils whose leave has expired. Of course, there is such a demand for labour at the present time that the older boys can easily obtain work and consequently I can understand that it may be very difficult to have them returned to the school.\n\nAs you realize, manufacturing conditions today are very difficult and, as a consequence, there is a great deal of delay in securing any new equipment that is required. The order was placed for the bake oven on the 29th of September and the firm was requested to rush delivery. Immediately on receipt of your letter I got in touch with the Purchasing Branch and they are writing a letter to the firm giving them a special priority and urging them to have the oven shipped at the earliest possible date. In spite of all we can do there will still be some delay, as transportation is rather slow.\n\nI still retain many kind recollections of my last visit to Kuper Island some three or four years ago.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. J. Camirand,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndians Graduated\n\nGraduation ceremonies were recently held at the Indian Residential School on Kuper Island.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the KUPER ISLAND B.C.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the KUPER ISLAND B.C. School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated SEPTEMBER 30 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Duncan BC this OCTOBER 9 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended June 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Duncan B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Cowichan Agency**\n\n**REPORT OF the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended September 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30th 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10/10/1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I A 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island, B.C., School for the Quarter ended December 1942.\n\nPrincipal J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island, B.C., School for the Quarter ended June 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter's per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly grant per each pupil. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per pupil grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 30th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCOWICHAN AGENCY\n\nDated at APR 6 1946 this DUNGAN, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...Kuper Island,B.C....School for the Quarter ended...September...19...46\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated...October 1st...19...46\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCOWICHAN AGENCY\n\nDated at...OCT 9 1946\n\nDUNCAN, B.

The amount per capita grant to be paid quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, page No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount payable per pupil due for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at COWICHAN AGENCY JAN 2 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per pupil. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0439 Nora Jack  | I5             | 63  | I   |      | Penelakut       | SS XII 4 9 0 6 I | I                | Sew Cook                | 60 3-6-39                   | 1448 8     |                                                                                                  |\n| 0461 Adeline Thomas | I6            | I   |      |      | Esquimalt       | I              | \"                | \"                        | 60 I-II-39                  | 92 8       | 0461 remained inschool during holidays.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per capita given.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island, B.C., School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 30th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCOWICHAN AGENCY\n\nDated at APR 3 1948\n\nDUNCAN, B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The average per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 30th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCOWICHAN AGENCY\n\nDated at APR 3 1948\n\nDUNCAN, B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 30th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated APRIL 3rd 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nPUBLIC

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: September 30, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at: Cowichan Agency\n\nCCT 8, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1948.\n\nDated December 30th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at this date, 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kupar Island B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31st 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCOWICHAN AGENCY\n\nDated at APR 21 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 1st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Duncan, B.C.\n\nthis Jan. 4th 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 6584           | Madeline M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper place.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. To ascertain the capita grant due, multiply the average attendance by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island, B.C., School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: December 30th, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReq.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island, B.C., School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated March 31st 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCOWICHAN AGENCY\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at DUNCAN, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30th 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any claim be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kuper Island B.C. School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1959.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st 1959\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 15 1960\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

It is impossible for me to meet ordinary expenses. As you can see by the financial statement I incurred a heavy deficit last year, owing to the high cost of living, and many improvements we made. We cleared and fenced with wire fence 8 acres of land, and planted 2 acres with apple and pear trees. New farm implements being much needed, I bought a wagon and harness. Besides that we lost our best milk cow.\n\nI hope the Department will consider this and grant the request.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nCowichan Agency\nIndian Office\nDuncans Station, B.C., April 11, 1913\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter dated the 8th instant from Rev. A. Uringa, Principal, Kuper Island industrial school, asking that they be allowed the full quarterly grant for sixty pupils, that is $1560.00 for the last March quarter.\n\nI will recommend the Principal's request to the favorable consideration of the Department.

A doubtful case, according to the Agent, had to be taken up with Ottawa. I understood perfectly well that on this account my cheque might be delayed for awhile. But when I heard that the Superintendent of Indian Education had decided upon the case in a letter No 152-0-10 dated Nov. 5th I was under the impression that a cheque should follow almost immediately.\n\nHowever, through some cause or other I was disappointed; and I had to make special arrangements with the Manager of the Bank to honor cheques without funds.

I arrived at the School in the late afternoon of June 19 and completed my inspection at noon of the 21, proceeding by train in the afternoon to the Indian Agency Office at Duncan, to complete my report.\n\nRecords available for examination included Cash Book, Bank Pass Book, cancelled cheques and an incomplete set of vouchers. The books are kept by the Principal, Father Geurts, and his system of recording transactions made a complete examination impossible. The following is a brief outline of his methods.\n\nTwo accounts, one a Savings and the other a Current Account, are maintained in the Canadian Bank Of Commerce, Chemainus, each in the name Rev. Joseph Geurts. Departmental cheques covering the Per Capita Grant were deposited in the Savings Account in order to draw interest, Father Geurts explained. The Cash Book, however, did not show that the School received any credit for interest.\n\nThe balance on deposit at May 31, was $367.06 which included School and private funds.\n\nThe Current Account was started by deposit of a cheque drawn on the Savings Account and thereafter was replenished as required by transfers of $1000.00 from the Savings Account. Cheques drawn on the Current Account included those issued covering payments of School expenditure and many more which the Principal explained were not connected with the School. I would suggest here that the Department might consider the advisability of having the Current Account in the name of the School in place of in Father Geurt's name in the Bank.\n\nThe revenue entries in the Cash Book included Departmental cheques for the Per Capita Grant and salary of the Manuel Training Instructor, with sundry amounts which Father Geurts stated was the correct revenue of the School. Expenditure entries were - Cheques issued for School expenditure, cash expended and entries made quarterly of $1500.00 for salaries of staff. Cheques were not issued for salaries and there was no supporting vouchers for the entries, Father Geurts stating payments were made in cash or from private funds. Cash was obtained from the cashing of cheques for salary of the Manuel Training Instructor, from amounts received from Indians and others to be forwarded and which were forwarded by\n\nN.C. Allen Esq.,\nRepresentative Of The Treasury,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-3, part 1)\ncheque on the Current Account, and sundry amounts received as revenue.\n\nFrom the above it will be noted that Father Geurts never tried to balance the Bank Account with the Cash Book. His theory was to have all Receipts and Expenditures correctly entered in the Cash Book and have sufficient funds in the Current Account.\n\nAs a test audit of the Cash Book for the fiscal year 1933-34, I examined the entries for receipts, scrutinized all entries of expenditure comparing many with the accounts and cancelled cheques and tested all the additions. For the period April 1, 1934, to May 31, 1935, I examined in detail all receipts and expenditures and checked all additions. All entries appear correct in so far as I was able to verify.\n\nIn order to balance the Bank Pass Book with the Cash Book as at May 31, the following statement was prepared:\n\nBalance as per Bank Book May 31-1935 $1,130.56\n\nBalance as per Bank Pass Book (Current Acc't.) $570.92\nLess Unpresented Cheque 16.10\nAmount to be transferred from Savings Acc't. 554.82\nAmount to be transferred from Savings Acc't. 575.74\n\n$1,130.56 $1,130.56\n\nThis statement was embodied in a memorandum to Father Geurts outlining the bookkeeping procedure to be followed in the future, copy of memorandum attached herewith as Exhibit A.\n\nAfter examination of the Cash Book a statement of Receipts and Expenditures for the Fiscal Year ending March 31, 1935, statement #1, was prepared. Receipts are normal and would not appear to call for special comment.\n\nExpenditure shown under the various headings in statement #1 is detailed under sub-headings in statement #2.\n\nFor food $3,328.07 was expended which is high when the amount of foodstuffs grown on the farm, shown later in this report, is considered.\n\nThe cost of Phone, Fuel and Light was $859.32. Phone expenditure of $13.94 is light as the telephone is on the pay-phone basis, there being no service charge. The total expenditure for gas and oil amounted to $496.88 of which it was estimated $120.00 worth was used in the motor boat and is shown under the heading Transportation.\n\nIncluded in the total expenditure of $1,491.16 for Farm and Garden is $1,265.29 for feed which appears high considering the amount of feed grown on the farm.\n\nStatement #3 shows costs of operations for the year ending March 31, 1935, based on the actual expenditure of $15,108.49 as Father Geurts would not attempt to estimate the value of produce from the farm consumed in the School. The average attendance was 99.\n\nInformation re Farm\n\nThe farm consists of 75 acres of which 50 are cultivated. Crop figures for 1934 are as follows:\n\nField Crops\nMay 26 tons, Green Feed 10 tons, Mangles 18 tons, White Carrots 10 tons.\n\nGarden Crop\nPotatoes 8 tons, Tomatoes 3 tons, Red Carrots 2 tons, Cabbage 300 head and considerable crop of beans, peas, celery, asparagus, corn & onions.\n\nMilk\nAverage 250 lbs., per day\n\nButter\nAll that is required.\n\nEggs\nAverage 75 per day.\nGENERAL\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesies of Father Geurts who appears ready to co-operate with the Department and was very willing to adopt any bookkeeping procedure which would assist in future audits and be in line with Departmental requirements.\n\nThe following accompany this report which is in duplicate:\n\nMemorandum re Bookkeeping Procedure.\nStatement of Receipts and Expenditures.\nDetailed Statement of Expenditures.\nCost of Operations; Staff - Occupations and Salaries.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.W. Holmes,\nAuditor.\nEXHIBIT A\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nROMAN CATHOLIC\nKUPER ISLAND - B.C.\n\nMemorandum\nFather Geurts - Principal\n\nI would request that you follow the instructions outlined herein, with reference to banking and book-keeping procedure.\n\n1. Transfer from the Savings Account to the Current Account the amount of $575.74 to balance this account as at May 31, 1935. This amount is computed as follows:\n\nBalance in Current account at May 31st, 1935 $ 570.92\nLess unrepresented cheque to T. Eaton & Co.\nMay 25th, .... 16.10\n\nTrue balance in Bank at May 31st, 1935 $554.82\n\nBalance as shown by Cash Book May 31, 1935 $ 1130.56\nLess balance in Current Account as above $554.82\n\nBalance to be transferred from Savings to Current Account $ 575.74\n\n2. You will please examine the Current Account Bank Pass Book to assure yourself that the teller has transferred to the Savings Account those cheques issued during the period June 1-20, which we instructed him were properly chargeable to the Savings Account.\n\n3. In future all cheques received from the Department covering the Per Capita Grant and salary of Manual Training Instructor, together with revenue to the School from other sources should be deposited to the Current Account in the Bank.\n\n4. A separate cheque book should be maintained for withdrawals from the Current Account. Cheques issued should be numbered, beginning at number 1, on April 1st, and continuing to March 31st, of each fiscal year, cancelled cheques being designated as such in the cheque book.\n\n5. All payments should be made by cheque with the exception of petty cash expenditures which may be made in cash. At your suggestion petty cash expenditures may be handled in the following manner. Cash payments will be made from private funds supported by voucher for payments of any considerable amount and a record kept of such payments. At the end of each month a cheque drawn in your favour will be issued for the amount of the expenditure during the month in support of which will be the petty cash record and vouchers for individual payments. This expenditure will be entered in the Cash Receipts and Expenditure Book under the various headings to which it applies and the record filed with other accounts.\n(6) Revenue and expenditures will be entered in the Receipts and Expenditures Book, the cheque numbers being entered in the outer column on the right hand side. Care should be taken that expenditure is properly classified and entered under the correct heading.\n\n7. The Canadian Bank of Commerce should be requested to enter the number of each \"paid\" cheque in the Bank Pass Book.\n\n8. At the end of each month the Cash Receipts and Expenditure Book should be balanced and reconciled with the Bank Pass Book in the following manner.\n\nBalance as per Bank Pass Book $2000.00\nLess unpresented cheques as listed $175.25\n\nTotal (Dr) Cash Book $3500.00\nTotal (Cr) $1675.25\n\n$1824.75 $1824.75\n\nUnpresented cheques\n\n| No. | Amount |\n|-----|--------|\n| 42  | 60.00  |\n| 45  | 15.75  |\n| 46  | 100.00 |\n\n$3175.75\n\n9. Please continue to file your accounts as paid and your cheques in numerical order.\n\n10. At the end of each month carry forward only the balance in your Cash Receipts and Expenditure Book.\n\n(F. W.

You should however have requested 91 days' grant for those pupils who were in regular attendance during the whole quarter. This means that four (4) days of the holiday grant was taken during the June quarter and will leave the balance of 58 days' holidays. When preparing the September quarter return, grant for the full quarter should be requested for all pupils who were in residence at the time the holidays started and who returned to the school by August 27. For any pupil who does not return by August 27 grant should be requested on the September quarter return for the actual number of days in residence during September plus 58 days - the balance of the holiday leave. As requested in the first part of this letter, you should revise the June quarter return and send it back for payment of the grant.\n\nTo assist you in your financing, a cheque for $2,000, being part payment on the June quarter return, is being forwarded. The balance will be paid when the return is properly completed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

My salary and part of that of my assistant has not be paid due to the fact that I have used that money to defray expenses for food, etc., during approximately two months when I first came in charge and when I brought the school attendance from forty children to ninety, having only the amount of a previous small grant to meet expenses. This together with the unusual conditions in which the school happened to be which forced me to give my attention to a score of other matters than finance is the reason why I had to forgo payment of my salary. This however I may easily redeem with time.\n\nSorry that my report is a little late, I am\n\nYours truly\n\nRev John Cameron\nPrincipal\nProvince of BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\n| PRINCIPAL          | NAME OF SCHOOL     | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Rev.

Possibly, the reason for doing so was that the school closed two or three days before the end of June. Pupils who were in residence on the day on which the school closed for the summer holidays, grant should be requested for the full ninety-one days.\n\nPlease make the necessary changes and send the return back to us so that the grant may be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.

This I cannot understand and I would very much appreciate your comments on the matter.\n\nThis administration is not financially easy at present, equipment, supplies etc., show that this is a problem of long standing. So until such a time I manage to bring everything up to normal I would very much appreciate all the help you can possibly give.\n\nFrankly I was rather disappointed at the negative reply received through our Superintendent from the Department re: linen. The present condition which as I stated in my letter is contrary to the most elementary principles of hygiene is in my opinion to be attributed only to financial administrative difficulties.\n\nI feel that the children are doing very well in their class work and a very good spirit prevails.\n\nWith good wishes and personal regards I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nLeClair, S.M.M.\nPrincipal\nApril 30, 1952.\n\nRev. L.D. LeClair, S.M.M.,\nPrincipal,\nKuper Island Indian Res. School,\nKuper Island, B.C.,\n\nDear Father LeClair:\n\nI have your letter of April 23rd regarding discrepancies in the Per Capita Allowance for the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nTogether with the Treasury officials we have reviewed your Quarterly Return and find that your average of 101.90 agrees with our figures. It is felt that you calculated the earnings at a different rate than is allowed this school. For your information the former rate for the Kuper Island school was 273. Effective October 1, 1951 this was increased by 15% making a total of $313.95. I am sure that if you will multiply 101.90 x $313.95 and divide by four you will find that the Per Capita Grant for the March Quarter will amount to $7,997.88.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nP.O. Box 510, Chemainus, B.C.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMy sincere thanks for the information given to me in your letter File 885-3 (E6), of March 30th. As you have rightly stated, the mistake was due to the wrong figured given to me as per capita earnings by the previous administration. I had very good reasons to know that the figuring was correct as my report had been checked previous to my filing it with the local Indian Superintendent.\n\nWith good wishes and personal regards, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nL.

R.J. Roberts, the representative of the New England Company on Kuper Island, relative to the present Industrial Institution at that place, and stating on behalf of the Company that should the Catholic Church give up the management of the same it would, he believes, undertake it, as well as contribute towards its maintenance.\n\nYou will observe that Mr. Roberts also states that the New England Company is likely to make application shortly for a grant in aid of another Industrial School on their property at the South-West end of Kuper\nIsland.\n\nI think, if Mr. Roberts' supposition, that the New England Company would undertake the charge of the present Kuper Island School and contribute towards its maintenance, is well founded, it would certainly be only proper after the Roman Catholic authorities have been informed thereof and given a chance to similarly contribute towards the maintenance of the school, and if they refuse to do so, as they have up to the present, that the institution should be handed over to the New England Company.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nHon. E. Dewdney,\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, 11th January, 1892.\n\nDear Vankoughnat,\n\nI return the Rev.

Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note, marked private, of the 25th ultimo, respecting the Rupert Island Industrial School, in regard to which you say you have heard some difficulty has arisen between the present management and this Dept., and that you think it well to inform me that from a private communication had by you from a member of the new\nEngland Company, it would appear that the Company are likely shortly to make an application at Ottawa for a grant in aid of another school of similar character to be established on their property at the south-west end of the Island, but that if the Roman Catholic Church should give us the management of the present school you think that very probably the New England Company would undertake the same, as well as contribute towards its maintenance.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that no difficulty, such as you seem to suppose, that would necessitate a change.\nchange of management of the school in existence has occurred. Should however, the New England Company be prepared to submit a proposition for taking over the existing school and allowed to do so, will contribute towards its maintenance, or to establish another which latter, while you understand they intend writing to the Department about their communication will receive due consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 835-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n9 Feb 1872\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe New England Company being convinced by more than sixty years experience of the benefits which their Institution at Brantford, Ontario has conferred upon the Indian races of British North America that there is no more effectual mode of Christianizing and civilizing the natives than by training their children in Industrial Schools of all similar kind, and believing that the Comp...\nany Mission Station at Rupert Island, British Columbia, which has been established for more than ten years, affords exceptional advantages for the successful management of an industrial boarding school for the children of the comparatively neglected Indians of that Province. I have been instructed to enquire whether, in the event of the Company being willing to undertake the entire management of such an institution, and to provide such additional funds as may be required for its maintenance, the Dominion Government would be prepared to erect a suitable building on the Company's land for the accommodation of not less than thirty children and the necessary staff of teachers, and would also make a yearly capitation grant towards its support, proportionate to the peculiar circumstances of the case, as provided.\nsimilar institutions in the Province of Athabasca and elsewhere.\n\nI may mention that the proposal has the cordial support of the Anglican Bishop of Columbia, the local Superintendent of Indians, and many other persons well acquainted with the needs of the Red-men, and that but for an unfortunate misunderstanding as to the amount of financial support which the Company would receive from the Government, the scheme would probably have been carried out several years ago, when first recommended by their missionary, the Rev. Mr. Roberts.\n\nI am also instructed to say that the Company have received private information that the Roman Catholic community are likely to relinquish their charge of the Industrial school at Telegraph Bay, Rupert Island, and that, in any such event, they would be prepared to undertake the management of this School, subject to an adequate capitation.\ngrant being provided, thus avoiding the necessity for a new building.\n\nAs the Company will be holding their annual general meeting on the 11th May, when full consideration could most advantageously be given to any proposals which the Dominion Government may be pleased to make on the subject, the favour of your reply within the next three months will greatly oblige.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWalter C. Murray\n\nClerk of the Company.\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nReferring to my letter to you of the 4th and your reply of the 11th ultimo, in reference to the application of the New England Company for aid towards the erection of an Industrial School building on Rupert Island, I beg to inform you that the promised communication from the New England Company upon this subject was received by me on the 22nd instant. I therefore\nPlace it on the file No. 67920 of this Department and enclose the latter to you. And I would draw your attention to the statement made in the Clerk of the Company's letter, that private information had been received that the Roman Catholic Church authorities are likely to relinquish their charge of the Industrial School on Kuper Island, and that, in such event, the Company would be prepared to undertake the management of that school, which would preclude a\nnecessity for a new building being erected, showed their application to establish an Industrial Institution be favorably entertained by the Department. I do not think, however, that there is anything in this rumor. It probably arose from the Department having written to the authorities of the present institution, to the effect that from the 1st ultimo the per capita principle would be applied to the institution. Against this they protested, as you are aware, and it was\nmodified by the Department to the extent of the time for the continuance of the present system being extended until the 30th June, by which time Mr. S. Dowell is to make inquiries and report. You will remember that the Kuper Island School authorities stated that if limited to a per capita allowance for 25 pupils they could not conduct the institution, but that if the building were enlarged so that the number of pupils could be increased\nto 50, they thought that they might manage it. In a letter addressed to you on the 23rd instant, respecting the grants applied for by different Industrial Institutes, these representations regarding the Nipper Island School are referred to.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon.

I have the honor to inform you that on the 7th. instant I visited that institution and with the Principal and Indian Agent went carefully over the premises and inquired into the present capabilities etc. of the buildings. At that time there were 12 girls and 25 boys being attended to which is the very utmost that can with present accommodation be provided for. Considerable work has been done towards clearing and fencing a portion of the ground and taking all things into consideration I am pleased to be able to report that the general advancement made as regards the pupils, and the getting into shape of the establishment\n\nand\n\nL. Vankoughnet Esq.\nDeputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nand grounds, has been most creditable. The Reverend Father Donckeke seems particularly well fitted for the work he has taken in hand as Principal and is well supported by the Sisters and limited staff of assistants at his disposal.\n\nHaving in view the contemplated action of the Department in the handing over of the School on the \"per capita\" principle I have examined the buildings so as to ascertain what additions will be required to admit of 50 pupils being taken in, the number stipulated for by His Lordship Bishop Burius, and beg now to enclose herewith plans of the proposed additions together with copy of the Reverend Father Donckeke's covering letter.\n\nWith the additions suggested the institution will be made most commodious and will comfortably admit of 50 pupils being cared for and ensure the observance of all necessary sanitary precautions as well as provide for the arrangement of the pupils having the apartments of the boys and girls separate and distinct the one from the other. To place the land in a condition suitable for cultivation or pasture an outlay for\nfor the construction of drains is required particulars of which were forwarded under cover of my letter of July 21st, 1891, No. II2. Z. the estimated cost is moderate and would, I think, afford a profitable return.\n\nIn reference to the correspondence that has taken place in connection with the Kuper Island School I would refer you to my letters (and enclosures) dated respectively viz:- 17th November, 1891, 16. A.2., 18th November 1891, 21. A.2. and those above quoted.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nV.

The principal writes that Mr. McLaughlin who is a competent mechanic says that the above buildings can be made for $2500 this will be reasonable making only 3\u00bd cents per foot. The Girls Home out of this would cost about $700.00\n\nMr. Vowell's letter of 25 March says that he visited the Institution and there were 12 girls 12 boys, that he was pleased with the general advancement of the pupils, that the Establishment was getting into good shape and with the additions expected the building would be able to accommodate 50 pupils comfortably.\n\nLetter from Mr. Vowell of the 21st July 1891 enclosing letter of 10th July from the Principal of the Institute with rough sketch of plans showing lines of ditches required, i.e. 3 ditches each 40 rods.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 189\n\nrequiring according to the Principal's opinion about $110 to dig them. The low land requiring this drainage is being the best of the land belonging to the Institute.\n\nLetter of 17th Nov. '91 in this letter Mr. Vowell states that in his previous visits to the Institute he considered that there was much to be done before the grounds and buildings could be considered complete.\n\nMr. Vowell says (Nov. '91) With reference to the school now being capable of accommodating but 35 pupils, I may state that with no great cost I consider that 50 pupils might be conveniently taken in, & as regards the land considerable money would have been expended before it could be made fairly productive.\n\nMr. Vowell adds some additional out houses are I think necessary to make requirements of the nature complete.\n\nMr. Vowell's letter of 17 Dec. '91 he states that up to the present he thinks that he could not give any further information than was contained in his letter of the Nov.

These specifications were prepared by Mr. A. McCormack our present instructor in carpentering.\n\nYou will please observe that Mr. McCormack did not state the probable cost of building the stone foundations and blasting out of a rock, for the reason that whilst here he was not in a position to consult a stone-mason. In copying his specifications I noticed that he had overlooked the painting of the buildings and I have today written to him to request him to inform you, by the next mail, of the probable cost of painting and masonry work.\n\nShould the foundations be made of stone pillars instead of an 18 inch wall the expense would\n\nA. W. Vowell Esq.\nVis. Indian Superintendent,\nVictoria.\nwould be greatly reduced.\n\nWith regard to the carpenters wages I may say that he did not take into consideration the help of the children. Should the building's be erected by day's labor I am of opinion that the assistance of the children would considerable cut down the amount of wages at present estimated $720.00.\n\nMr. McCormack has during his two weeks instruction at the school given great satisfaction and I think that I feel justified in recommending him to the Department. He is a conscientious and competent mechanic and has of late, with the assistance of some of the boys finished, in the course of ten days, the outside of our present workshop a building of 40 feet long 20 feet wide and 10 ft. wall.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

At this time I was with Mr. Foreman and the two boys in the furthest end of the hall. As soon as the alarm bell sounded the alarm, everyone ran for the buildings as quick as possible, and in a few minutes the fire brigade was in full activity. When we arrived at the chimney building, the play hall and school rooms were full of smoke, and in order to locate the seat of the fire, the Foreman had to tear off the frame of the door leading to the school room and part of the frame on which the chimney is built; as far as the eye could see, quite apparent that the fire was caused through a defective chimney. One of the four bricks in which the chimney flue is built, and the chimney inside the main frame was totally charred, there had been no fire in the stove since Saturday evening, thus the fire must have originated last night.\n\nAs the fire was burning close to the ceiling and on inside of the wall, it was rather a difficult matter to subdue it, however after half an hour, liberty was had the fire under control.\n\nThe damage to the building is very slight, but the chimney will have to be secured against future danger before any fire can be made in the school rooms.\n\nA.W. Lovell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria.\nAs the cold weather is likely to set in very soon,\nas on the \"Steamer Train\" will make her first nightly\ncall at our school next Tuesday, I would respectfully\nsuggest that you send up a competent bricklayer and\n250 bricks by next Tuesday's boat (14th inst.) so as to have\nthe defective chimney lengthened from the bottom about\nfive feet (a similar alteration was made last summer\nto the old chimney of the play hall stove.) We have\na barrel of lime here, thus only 50 bricks and almost half\na barrel of lime plaster to cover the chimney and a part\nof the wall where the plaster has to be torn off.\n\nThe defective chimney had never been used before\nthis fall and I cannot say whether the defect was caused\nby the man who last summer cut a hole in this chimney\nto let the stove pipe in, or whether it was caused\ndefective at the time the first buildings were erected.\nSome sparks must have fallen through the bottom of\nthe chimney and ignited the timbers.\n\nI can assure you to state that great credit\nis due to Mr. Tommy Gallant, to the boys of the fire\nbrigade, and to Chief Tom of Poveshull, who as\nsoon as he heard the fire bell came running at full\nspeed with some other Indians came at once, offering\nall possible assistance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.

In reply I beg to say that while regretting this accident very much the Department is glad to learn that it was not more serious. Your action in authorizing the employment of a bricklayer and the purchase of bricks and plaster is approved of and this need not be charged against management.\n\nIn view of this accident, which was apparently caused by a defective chimney, the Department wishes you to make enquiries as to what protection Industrial and Boarding Schools have for protection in case of fire. Buckets should be supplied to such schools, which should at all times be kept full of water and placed ready for use where they can be easily be got at. Both teachers and pupils should be drilled in the use of such appliances as are on hand and should know where to find them, even in the dark and what to do in the case of an alarm of fire. Pumps must\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\n\nIndian Supt:\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nmust be kept in good working order and cisterns and wells carefully looked after. Flues chimneys, registers and stoves should be frequently inspected and reported upon and attention called to any defects.\n\nIn all reports of inspection of such schools, particular attention is in future to be given to the fire protection provided in the schools where such is placed and how cared for. Periodical reports should be received by you in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nIn further reference to my letter of the 16th instant covering a letter from the Rev'd Principal of the Kuper Island Industrial School dated 15th instant reporting that one of the school buildings had been on fire, I have the honour now to submit for your information \"Copy\" of a letter just received from the Rev'd Principal dated 17th instant in which he reports that the fire which occurred on the 15th may have been the work of an incendiary as an attempt had evidently been made to set fire to one of the buildings yesterday.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that Mr Agent Lomas has been instructed to proceed to Kuper Island and to report in full on all the circumstances connected with the fire, and to make a special examination of the chimney which was reported to be defective.\n\nThe bricklayer who was hired to leave tomorrow morning by steamer for the school has been notified that his services are not immediately required. The bricks and plaster of Paris have however been shipped and will be forwarded.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 895-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that since I wrote to you concerning the fire at the School, new developments have come to light which seem to point out that the fire of yesterday last Friday was the result of an incendiary and not caused through a defective chimney.\n\nYesterday at 2 p.m., the dining hall at 12:45 p.m., P.M. with the chimney, smoke was issuing from under the boys' building. Mr. Farmer and some of the boys went into the building and to their dismay, found a small quantity of chips and shavings piled in two different places on top of the floor wall alongside the wall and just underneath the floor. Both piles were burning, but fortunately the fire was soon extinguished.\n\nThe whole affair seems to be surrounded by mystery. We don't know whom to suspect, for I am not aware that any one has a grudge against me or the School. Up to 12 o'clock I had been supervising the boys' building their school and play work and had not noticed anything unusual. When the bell rang for dinner all the boys were with me in the dining hall, and when I left the place I discovered that the same boys' building was on fire. It appears to me that the fire was set to the building whilst I was at dinner, for some of the small pieces of wood were hardly consumed. Since it appears that the fire was caused by the same party, it might not be necessary to alter the chimney.\n\nWould be much pleased if you or the Indian Agent (whom I have also written) could find time to come and investigate this further.\n\nHave the honour to be, Sir,\n\nA.W. Dewell, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nVictoria.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nC. Rossell,\nPrincipal.\nOTTAWA 25th November 1895\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with my letter of the 25th instant relative to the fire at the Rupert Island Industrial School and dealing with the question of fire protection at Industrial Schools generally, I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be well that all such schools in British Columbia should be furnished with a supply of hand grenades. As these articles are liable to damage in transport at this season of the year, I shall be glad to know if they can be purchased in Victoria and at what price. When replying to this letter you might state the number that might be furnished each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq:\nIndian Supt:\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nMy hurried letter of this morning covered all the questions you request a report on, except as to defective chimney. It was impossible for either of the fires to have been the result of a chimney as they are all sound, and the several boys told me exactly how and by whom each fire was started.\n\nYour letter only reached me today after I had reported.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W. H. Thomas,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. W. Howell Esq.,\nIndian Dept.,\nVictoria.\nCowichan Agency\nIndian Office,\nQuamichan, B.C. Nov. 20th, 1895\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that having received a report from the Rev Principal of the Kuper Island Schools of two attempts having been made to burn the Boy department of the Schools. I considered it my duty to proceed there immediately and investigate, I took Provincial Constable Maitland-Dougall with me.\n\nOn viewing the places where attempts had been made to burn the building I became convinced that the attempts had been made by some of the boys. The Principal and Officers could think of no motive which could lead to the act, and the boys looked happy and comfortable outwardly there seemed no discontent.\n\nI interviewed a number of the boys separately and alone, and after some hours found that some of the older boys had heard from the Rev Principal that new rules were in force by which the Christmas and July holidays would be reduced or done away, they decided to burn the building, this being hurried\nhurried by one boy who wanted to get away at once, who urged on the others with the result that four (not two) attempts have been made. Under these circumstances I considered it best to break up the combination and advised the constable to arrest two of the boys and summons others as witnesses this was done and I brought back the boys with me to the Provincial Lockup, Duncans where I can look after them until the case is heard on Saturday; they are Andrew Wearth aged 11 of Victoria, David Jack aged 10 of Cowichan Gap should they be committed for the assizes I will go there on Tuesday. Before I left the Schools considerable excitement prevailed some of the parents having arrived claimed the right to take their boys away at once, one actually doing so but the Police will bring him tomorrow being wanted as a witness. You will see that should these boys be allowed to leave School, any one wishing to leave has only to attempt or succeed in doing so by burning the building.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n(sgd) W.H.

After a consultation with the Officers of the School, and a general examination of the places where the fires had broken out, serious suspicion arose that the buildings had been set on fire by some of the boys. In order to find out the real culprits, it was thought advisable that Mr. Indian Agent Lomas would separately question the boys. Before much time had elapsed, it became evident that there had been a conspiracy amongst some of the boys to commit arson, and upon further inquiry it was ascertained that Andrew Tom, a Victoria orphan of about 12 years old, who had been sent to the School on the 2nd of September last, had instigated the plan of destroying the School by fire and had succeeded in getting David Jack and perhaps some other boys to help him in his nefarious undertaking. Andrew Tom and David Jack have been arrested and taken to Duncan, by order of Mr. Lomas.\n\nAs to the intention which prompted them to the perpetration of such a crime, I can only surmise that they thought by setting the building on fire they would be sent home on a long holiday. When questioned by Mr. Lomas whether they had any complaints against the management of the School, they answered no.\n\nA.W. Vorwell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria.\nThe conduct of the boys had apparently been satisfactory, and judging from their happy mood and pleasant conversation one would never have suspected that such a scheme was entertained; all were satisfied, and none had expressed any desire of leaving the Institution.\n\nI also wish to state that Indian Thom, father of our late boy Simon, has withdrawn from the School his two sons (Andrew and Solomon), and that in my opinion it will be for the good of the school, that Thom's children be kept out of this institution.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the fires which took place at the Kuper Island Industrial School as reported in my letter of the 16th instant and in subsequent letters on the same subject, I have the honour to submit herewith for your information and consideration, a letter from the Rev.

This may be true enough, but the fact that they have never had a fire is not evidence that they never will have, neither is the fact that they are insured a complete safeguard. Insurance is good and highly desirable, but stock changes, or is added to, and often times the policy has lapsed just at the time that a fire occurs. It is essential, therefore, that some more efficacious insurance shall always be on hand. \"Prevention is at all times better than cure,\" and there can be no cure or remedy for loss of life in the flames which often come from the carelessness of man. What then be done? Fire is a chemical phenomenon, as such must be treated. What shall we use, water? In some cases water is needed and used while in other situations only to intensify the heat. Does a blacksmith use water to put out his fire? No, simply to make it fiercer. Again, water damages oftentimes more than the fire burns. Then the problem to be solved is, what must we use to combat Fire? Evidently we must find some chemical phenomenon having an action opposite to the other one of Fire, and in presenting the DURAND FIRE EXTINGUISHER to you, we claim that we have solved the problem and given you something that will completely extinguish the fire and yet not cause damage, as is the case when water is used.\n\nPrice: $24.00 THE DOZEN.\n\nAGENTS WANTED.\nCERTIFICATES.\n\nGRAVEL & BOULARD\nDealers and importers of house builders' hardware, Carpenters (tools stoves, paints &c. &c.)\nMontreal, July 24th 1893.\n\nMr. A.

The extinguisher puts a stream of from 30 to 35 feet, which should be directed to the base of the fire, so the fire will die out from its highest point. One in every room as much as possible, or of a distance of about 60 ft. from one another, when placed in long passage. Enclosed Patent Drawings showing the machine operation also circular bearing the certificate of the competent authorities & testimonials of past users of order burning of fires.

December 17th 1895.\n\nNo. 119-035 November 25th 1895.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that the following provision for protection against fire is made at this Institution. The teachers and boys are drilled in the proper use of fire-tubes and buckets. At the call of the fire bell two boys have charge of connecting hose to hydrant, one boy is ordered to produce an axe or crowbar, four big boys are required to get the ladder in position and the smaller boys are drilled in passing the water buckets from one to another.\n\nThere are four hydrants outside, three hose can be attached to, one in the rear of the boys' building, one at the kitchen, one in front of the main building and one at the corner of the girls' home. The buckets stand outside in a row underneath the staircase leading to the girls' dormitory and in close proximity to the water so that there is no necessity of keeping them full of water. The stream of water running between the buildings is kept full to the top so that in case of emergency any boy can fill a bucket with ease and dispatch. There are four sets of ladders and three movable ladders which hang alongside the buildings within easy reach.\n\nThe flues and chimneys are regularly cleaned and the registers and stoves are frequently examined.\n\nWith regard to the fire-proof lights that there is only about half of it left and what is left is nearly worn out. In my last report (July 2nd 1895) I made application for 100 ft. 2 inch fire hose, price about $15.00.\n\nOne day's new buckets and one set of ladder hooks for the roof of the new girls' home would also be required for protection against fire; at the present time we have only twelve buckets available.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nA.W. Sorrell, Esq.\nIndian Superintendent\nVictoria\n\nYours obediently,\n\nG. Demers,\nSecretary\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 25th Oct., and more especially in respect to your instructions regarding protection against fire at the several Industrial and Boarding Schools in my superintendency I have the honour to forward herewith a Report from the Rev'd Principal of the Rupert Island Industrial School detailing the condition of that Institution in this connection and requesting certain additional supplies; the furnishing of which I would recommend to your favourable consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your circular of the 11th inst., I beg to report that I have just visited the Kuper Industrial Schools, and find that with the exception of the want of more fire buckets and hose every precaution is taken to avoid fire.\n\nThe floors and chimneys are regularly cleaned and the tanks kept full. There is however a want of buckets as those in use are not being used for other purposes, such as when scrubbing the floors is going on.\n\nOn the upper floors there are hydrants to which the hose can be attached, but the buckets should be kept full for fear of a failure in the supply of water.\n\nOn the ground floor this does not appear so necessary as the river failing stream which runs between the Boys' and Central Buildings gives a constant supply close at hand, at this place at least twelve fire buckets should be constantly kept, and never used for any other purpose.\n\nI would recommend that twenty four small sized zinc be supplied, and that they be painted and known as fire buckets.\n\nThere should be 12 near the stream\n\n3 Girls dormitory\n2 School rooms\n2 Playroom\n3 Boys dormitory\n2 in Carpenter shop\n\nA.W. Norvell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria\nI would also recommend the supply of about 100 feet of wired hose.\n\nI have advised the Principal to have two or three ladders made to be lighter and stronger than the present one, which are unsuitable.\n\nI tested the fire drilling which the boys had received, by having the fire bell rung while the boys were at their desks in school, and in less than two minutes they had raised a ladder and a boy was on the roof with the hose properly attached, while others were passing filled empty buckets in another direction. I considered this very creditable work\u2014especially as no one seemed to get in the other's way.\n\nI have the honor to report,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

However, this balance will be paid\nto you at no distant date, but we are explaining the\nconditions so that you will understand the reason for some\nlittle delay.\n\nBritish Columbia has been hit much harder by the war\nthen any other part of Canada; there has been a large exodus\nof population, and the building trade is in a state of suspended\nanimation.

With reference to this I have to inform you that no certificate should be issued for work not authorized without first submitting these items to the Department for approval. The work authorized and completed, including the flat work ironer, if satisfactory, should be certified at once and forwarded to the Department so that payment can be made from current year's appropriation.\n\nThis certificate to include the percentage omitted from the duplicated water system.

For a matter of thirty days we are only too glad to help a customer.

Later this balance was increased by the cost of the flatwork ironer, and now stands at $676.20. When this extra machine was installed we performed additional work for the Dept., and there is still a balance due us of about $1800 from the Dept. We rendered our a/c for this about a month ago, and do not understand why a cheque has not come through before this. However, this final certificate can not be much longer delayed, and when received, it will give the writer much pleasure to make remittance in full of a/c. In the meantime we trust you will not worry unduly.\n\nTrusting this explanation is satisfactory,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdwin G. Smith,\nFor Island Building Co., Ltd.\nOttawa, March 12, 1917.\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 26th ultimo in reference to balance due on account of extra work done on the Kuper Island Industrial School, and in reply to inform you that the Principal of the school was written to on the 7th instant and requested to forward statement of your claims for work done that these might be scrutinized before being certified by him.\n\nWith reference to the amount stated to be owing you, it appears that several contracts have been paid in full, and that any extra work authorized has also been paid for in full, except that there is a percentage due on account of labour and material in connection with the duplication of water service, etc.\n\nThere does not appear to be any additional work authorized unless it is a power flat-ironer, and the Principal has been asked to certify this, if satisfactory.\n\nOn the receipt of your account from the Principal as rendered, this will be scrutinized and returned to the Rev.

Our Manager delivered the accounts and vouchers to the Reverend Principal last January, but owing to stress of work, sickness in the school, etc., he had not found time to go over the accounts carefully until recently. This has now been done, and all the accounts, duly certified, have now been forwarded to Ottawa for your inspection, and we believe you will find everything in order and the work economically and satisfactorily executed. That we have done our very best goes without saying, and the result is in keeping with the high standard of work we have done throughout.\n\nIn consequence of our long wait for this payment we would respectfully ask you to kindly remit us a cheque in settlement at as early a date as possible, as we have one or two pressing accounts which we are anxious to pay off.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdwin G.

Deputy of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor of sending you today under same cover a Final Certificate to the Island Building Co. for the work Mr. Scott kindly allowed me to have done during his visit to our school last summer. A fully itemized statement and vouchers accompany. The work was to be done by the original contractors on a 10 per cent profit basis. The whole work was well and economically done. And as I had already occasion to write to Mr. Scott, the improvements made are real benefits. The supplementary water system works to perfection, and being completely costless to run, we are using it all the time. The pneumatic tanks we just keep filled and under pressure in case of emergency. The septic tank or rather the drain field, which was a nuisance, has been done away with by connecting the septic tank outlet with pipe leading it below low water mark. The chimneys by being lengthened give a better draft, and there is no more smoke or soot nuisance. The Mangle or flat ironer works to perfection, and is a great labor saver. All the other smaller improvements are very much appreciated by the staff.\n\nI beg to thank the Indian Department for their kindness in allowing us these improvements. Our work in our new quarters is greatly facilitated, and therefore more efficient.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 21, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe certificate and accounts for extra work in connection with the Kuper Island Industrial School sent here under date of the 9th instant are being returned to you for correction, as several of the items are not sufficiently clear and others not carried out correctly, and in others the amounts charged are not in accordance with the vouchers.\n\nItem number 4 requires explanation and correction, also numbers 9, 12, 10, 15, 17 and others.\n\nThe time-sheets are not definite enough and must show clearly the time, rate of pay per hour, and the work performed, as a comprehensive statement is necessary, showing exactly how you arrived at your total of $781.75 for the labour.\n\nWhere the vouchers cover additional materials or labour, a separate slip must be attached to the voucher showing clearly the amounts for which payment is asked.\n\nEach item in your statement must also be correctly carried out and accord with the certificate.\n\nAs soon as the vouchers have been amended and returned to the Department, if found correct, payment will be made.\n\nIt will not be necessary to prepare a new certificate, as the one here will be amended to show the correct amounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Principal that they might be rectified before payment can be made.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nAs there is a balance of $676.20 due the Canadian Laundry Machine Company on account of goods supplied, and which amount as shown by the correspondence is satisfactory to both parties, will be paid direct to them that they may be in earlier receipt of the money and the cost of exchange saved.\n\nA copy of the letter to the Principal is enclosed herein for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.D.

March 30th, 1917.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWe duly received your favour of the 21st inst. regarding the Statement of Account we rendered for the work we performed for the Department at Kuper Island under a percentage arrangement.\n\nWe note that under the microscopic analysis and scrutiny to which all the accounts have been subjected certain inaccuracies have come to light, and that all the accounts had been returned to the Reverend Principal for correction and amplification before payment can be made. We would express our sincere regret that these little errors had crept into the accounts, and while they do not materially affect the total of the account as rendered, yet we feel that in the interests of accuracy no other course was open to the Dep't. The fault was entirely ours, and although the Rev. Principal made a careful scrutiny of each item on the list, and satisfied himself that all the various services had been performed and the goods supplied, he had not, apparently, discovered the few clerical inaccuracies to which you have properly drawn our attention.\n\nYesterday the writer visited the School and went over all the accounts with the Principal, and made the necessary corrections, and supplied the additional data that was required. These will now go forward to Ottawa, and we trust that everything will be found in order, so that prompt payment may follow.\n\nWhile this account is under discussion we would draw your\nattention to item No. 19 on the list which reads \"Accident Insurance Mutter & Duncan. $13.40! This was arrived at by a charge of 1\u00bd% of the pay-roll. We have since been billed by our insurance agents with the minimum charge of $50.00 on our accident policy, and as this policy was taken out and kept in force for only two jobs, one of which was the percentage work at Kuper Island, it is only fair to charge the percentage work with its proportionate share of the cost of this policy, which makes a charge for insurance of $24.00 chargeable in this account instead of $13.40 shown in the Statement,- or a balance in our favour of $10.60. We would draw your attention to this, and ask that you kindly add this sum to the total of $1859.39 due under the amended statement, thus making the total amount due us of $1869.99.\n\nShould there be any additional information desired by the Dep't bearing on this work, or any further segregation wanted, we will be pleased to furnish same to the best of our ability, but would respectfully ask that payment to us of the final balance be not longer delayed, as this account has been outstanding for a long time, and we are in need of funds.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nISLAND BUILDING COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\nPer [signature]\nManager.\nKUPER ISLAND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL,\n\nPERCENTAGE WORK.\n\nVoucher\n\n1.

Among the many improvements you encouraged me to make, there was a gymnasium for the boys; it was to be built out of the material of the old school. You promised to pay for the new material required, such as shingles and flooring. After your return to Ottawa in a letter I received from Mr. McLean, dated July 28th, 1916, this item is mentioned among those you authorised.\n\nWe could not possibly build the gymnasium last winter on account of a lot of other work more urgent yet, but now it is almost completed. It is a building 76' x 33', with an 18' ceiling. The floor of the gymnasium proper is 60' x 33'. The other 16' are occupied by two rooms, a dressing room and a toilet room. Above these there is a gallery 16' x 33' for the pupils who would not be taking part in the game or drill going on in the hall. It is situated on the hill near the boys' playground at a distance of 150 from the school.\n\nOn account of the number of windows in the old school building a lot of the old boards were wasted, being too short to be of any use. We have enough rustic, but had to get some new ship-lap. The old school being plastered, for the inside finishing of the gymnasium I had to get some V joint. I took the cheapest No. 4 V joint will go up to the windows, above them and on the ceiling we will use ship-lap. I enclose herewith the bills in triplicate.\n\nIf you need any more information I will give it to you personally. I have been applying for a holiday during which I intend to visit my brother in Ottawa, and naturally I will profit by the occasion to pay you my respects. I expect to be in Ottawa by the end of the month.\n\nAu revoir.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Type \"E\" SPECIAL F-M Marine Engine,\n5 HP at 500 RPM; 7 HP at 800 RPM.\n\nWe have been fortunate in securing a small quantity of these Engines which are built by our Sheffield Gas Engine Factory for The American Wood Working Mch.

The pump is connected by rubber tubing to the intake in the water jacket in order that the main spindle in the pump may not become out of line thru any misalignment of pipe fittings. It also has a special feature of governor in the flywheel which controls the Engine at any speed desired as low as 250 RPM.\n\nWe will sell the above mentioned Engine complete with Long Timer, Water Pump, Carburetor, Shaft Coupling, Coils, Wire, Switch and Batteries fob our warehouse, Vancouver for the sum of $150.00.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn the beginning of this new year I have to come and beg you for quite a few favors. But first of all, allow me to thank you for the repairs done to our wharf. The work will be finished in a couple of days. It has been well and expeditiously done. All the inconveniences we had to put up with for a whole year are at an end now. And none too soon, because in a couple of weeks I will have to get in a supply of coal. The prices, right at the mine, have advanced more than a dollar per ton. If I had had a wharf, I would have saved that, because I would have got my supply before the prices advanced. Our heating plant and our steam laundry consume 100 tons of coal in the year, notwithstanding the nice mild weather. The violets have been blooming the whole winter.\n\nI said I came to beg a few favors, not for me, but for the school. Besides the medicines that Sister Superior would like to get, I need about $30.00 worth of trees and shrubs, and I need also paint, and shingle stain for our boys' gymnasium. This building is finished now. Everybody says it is a beautiful hall, I am sure, you will like it. But the old lumber we used needs painting very badly.\nI cannot tell you exactly how much it is going to cost, because it is hard to say how much paint this old lumber is going to take. But I will get the paint direct from the factory, Brit. N. America Paint Co., Victoria, and I will send you the bills, if you allow. Besides I absolutely need to put up 350 rods of wire fence, on both sides of the road (going to the Indian village) crossing our fields, around a new garden near the school, and one part of the boundary fence which is in very bad shape, through which the Indian cattle come and spoil our crops. This wire fence with necessary gates will cost $356.50 (three hundred and fifty six dollars, 50\u00a2), viz., 350 rods of No 9 wire fence 8 bars 43\" * 77\u00a2 per rod; 4 large gates 12 ft. x 48\" * $11.00, and two small gates 4 ft. x 48\" * 5.00. I enclose two letters quoting prices. We have the necessary cedar posts for the fences, and naturally we will do all the work ourselves.\n\nAt your visit to the school this summer, you will be surprised at all the work that has been done here since your last visit. Although there is a lot yet to be done, we are trying to join the agreeable to the useful \"Utile dulce\", so as to beautify the surroundings of our magnificent school.\n\nWith best wishes and kind regards,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nJanuary 29th, 1918.\n\nDear Father Lemmens -\n\nI have your letter of January 21st with enclosures. I have directed the Accountant to authorize the purchase of the drugs for the dispensary and $30.00 for trees and shrubs, the paint for the boys' gymnasium and the necessary wire and gates for the fencing.\n\nI am glad to hear that your winter is mild. All the good weather must centre in British Columbia, and there is nothing but low temperatures and storms in the east.\n\nWith good wishes to you all, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. W.

You may also purchase necessary paint and shingle stain for making repairs to the boys' gymnasium at the said School.\n\nI may add that the Department also approves of the purchase of about 350 rods of wire fencing and of the gates mentioned in your letter (four in number) for the construction of an eight bar fence 48 inches high at the School grounds. The estimate of cost mentioned for the material for the fence should not be exceeded.\n\nThe accounts for the expense incurred should be rendered in duplicate and in detail and should be attached to voucher form, a supply of which is being sent you, and forwarded to the Department in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

You called for Mr. Ogilvie, and we discussed what would be best to do. I suggested to either get a \"Restaurant grease trap\", or to make a separate sewer for those sinks leading the greasy water directly to the sea, instead of through the main sewer. Before leaving you allowed me to have the grease trap installed, in case I would think it would work satisfactorily, after investigation. As soon as I came back I spoke the matter over with the man who had done all the plumbing in the house. He told me then that he had just been installing one at the Resthaven Convalescent home for returned soldiers, I thought that was sufficient proof that it was all it was claimed to be, and I gave Mr. Holt order to get one for us. It took all this time to get the trap here from the East. When I heard I was going to leave I asked the plumber to come at once and install it, so I could send in the bill myself. We did away with quite a length of 2\" pipe and connected the trap directly with the 4\" sewer, this required quite a bit of labor, but it was the only way one could expect satisfactory results.

Please authorize expenditure and fill drug requisition if satisfactory.\n\nA.J.M.\nI beg to inform you that some time ago the Reverend Principal of the Epper Island School telephoned me stating that the boiler for the laundry at the school was leaking and asked me to send up a man to repair it. I therefore informed the firm of Messrs. Thacker & Holt, who did all the plumbing and made all the boiler connections at the school when it was built, and Mr. Holt went up the next day. He has reported that in his opinion the boiler will need re-tubing throughout with seventy-two tubes, four feet long and two inches in diameter. He reported that upon going to the school he found that one of the tubes was leaking and he sent to Victoria and had a new one sent up, which he replaced. Upon putting 80 pounds steam pressure on the boiler a second tube blew out. This he plugged at both ends and then turned on 75 pounds of steam pressure when a third tube burst. He then returned to Victoria realizing that nothing could be done at present. He estimates the cost of re-tubing will be $375.00. The expense already entailed in the repairs amount to approximately $70.00. Rev. Father Guertz, the Principal, thought as this is an extraordinary expenditure the Department should bear the same. The boiler, in the meantime, was out of use. I have laid this matter before Mr. Scott and he has authorized the work to be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 18, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to the repairs required for the boiler in the laundry at the Kuper Island Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of having the work of re-tubing the boiler done at a cost not exceeding the estimate furnished you by Messrs. Thacker & Holt, namely, $375.00. I have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to have this work carried out and the expenditure incurred for the purpose should be kept down to the lowest possible point. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements possible and at the lowest expenditure for having the work done. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded when the work is completed covering the expenditure incurred. It is noted that you have placed this matter before Mr. Scott and that he has authorized having the work done.\n\nA properly certified voucher covering the expenses already entailed in repairs should also be forwarded.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sir:\u2014\n\nReferring to your letter of the 1st instant, I re-enclose the account therewith transmitted in favour of Mr. Mark Dumond for a drum steel roller, and I have to request that you will be good enough to certify on each copy thereof that the article charged for was received and that the price was in accordance with the tender submitted.\n\nBe good enough to return the account and attach thereto the various tenders which you received from the different persons requested to quote prices in this matter.\n\nThe Principal,\nKuper Island Industrial School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nAt the time of my visit to this school this summer, the following matters were brought to my attention: Land is badly needed - there are 75 acres at present. Mr. Agent Lomas would like something done in an effort to quiet the older Indians of the band, who insist that they were to have been paid for this property. Fifty acres to the east of the school site is reserve land, not settled and might be acquired.\n\nGrapes, walnuts, fruits of all kinds, all vegetables and some of the potatoes are raised. They have 7 milch cows and 3 horses, but not enough land to raise beef. Water supply and acetylene lighting systems - in good condition. They have enough water to irrigate all of the 50 acres that are cultivated, from the reservoir.\n\nI found here the best gymnasium at any Indian school in Canada. There is a spectators' balcony, dressing rooms, lavatories and playrooms - all in the gymnasium building. There is a splendid Band here; they need a few more instruments at this time. They have splendid manual training equipment, but no instructor. Mr. Cairne suggests a Government manual training instructor to travel among the 5 or 6 residential schools on the mainland.\n\nThe barn is fairly adequate - the hennery and piggery are good - excellent laundry equipment - good bakery and dairy - heating O.K. The bake oven needs repairs and they will write about this. I noticed in the pig pen a splendid swing swivel wall over the trough.\nDear Sir:\n\nSo far we have already 200 bushels of oats in the barn and we expect about 150 more from this year's crop. Three hundred of these could be used as pigs' feed if only they were ground.\n\nBut isolated as we are, to have this done or to have them exchanged for crushed oats would cost us about $10.00 a ton for transportation.\n\nTherefore I hereby apply for a 6\u00bd\" grinder with bagger attachment to be bought from Mark Dumond who has given the lowest quotation: grinder $62.00, bagger attachment $18.00.\n\nTrusting the Department will favorably consider this request,\n\nI beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 7th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant requesting authority to purchase a grain grinder, with bagger attachment, for the use of the Kuper Island Industrial School, and enclosing quotations which you received for supplying the same.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of the grinder, and bagger attachment, for the use of the school, but it will be necessary before making the purchase for you to obtain prices from a number of dealers in agricultural implements in Victoria and Vancouver, as it is required by the Purchasing Commission of Canada that prices be obtained from as many dealers as possible. When you have obtained these prices you may purchase the grinder and attachment from the firm quoting you the lowest price.\n\nYou will be good enough to obtain accounts, in duplicate, which you should certify and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made. You should also enclose all quotations received by you for supplying the above implement.\n\nThe two quotations which you forwarded are returned herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Jos Geurts,\nPrincipal, Indian Industrial School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\nOttawa, Jan. 29, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department of Customs and Excise has ruled that Indian residential schools owned by the Government are exempt from the sales tax on their purchases, provided the materials purchased are for their own use and not for resale. The per capita grant for your current expenses is appropriated by Parliament, and it is not necessary for you to pay the sales tax on purchases made by you when the materials are to be used for school purposes solely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean\nActing Deputy Secretary of\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 29th #119083-5, re the sales tax and thank you sincerely for the information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Murphy\nPrincipal\nIndian Industrial School\nKuper Island, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that on the 9th instant I had a visit from the Rev. Father A. Murphy, Principal of the Kuper Island School, with regard to the drain pipes from the sinks to the sewer which continually become blocked up with grease, the traps at the sinks not retaining the grease as they should. Various methods have been tried to overcome this trouble, but are not effective. Different acids and lye have been poured down the sinks to cut the grease, but this has resulted in turning it into a solid soapy substance, and the grease-pan under the main sink in the boys' dining room is now almost totally blocked up, with a result that when the water is turned on in the shower-bath room this becomes flooded with greasy water etc., and the Rev. Father was afraid that an epidemic of Typhoid Fever might result unless something was done to keep these pipes permanently open.\n\nBeing something of a mechanic himself, he turned the garden hose into the pipe and this cleared the way to a limited extent, but he requested that he be supplied with 150 feet of 1 inch vulcanized hose with the proper attachments which could be connected with the boiler and this drain pipe cleared out regularly by steam pressure.\n\nBefore submitting this proposal to you, I interviewed Messrs. Thacker & Holt, Plumbing and Heating Contractors, of this city, who installed all the plumbing in this building, and they informed me that they are of the opinion that the scheme suggested by Father Murphy, if applied properly, will accomplish its purpose.\n\nThe price of vulcanized hose given me by the Rubber Companies is $1.25 per foot less 50% and 10%. Couplings are $2.25 each less 10%. I have not been able to obtain a price for the attachment to the boiler and clean-out, but estimate they would not be over $7.00. The total cost of the connection pipes and nozzles would approximate $104.00.\n\nI shall be pleased to know if you will authorise this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOTTAWA, March 1st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, regarding the difficulty experienced at the Kuper Island Industrial School owing to the drain pipes from the sinks to the sewer becoming blocked up with grease, etc.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your request for authority to purchase 150 feet of 1\u00bd\" vulcanized hose with the proper attachments, which could be connected to the boiler and the drain pipes cleared by steam pressure, is approved. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the above quantity of vulcanized hose, and the necessary attachments. The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $104.00. It will be necessary, if possible, to obtain competitive prices for the supplying of the above material, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price.

Scott visited the Kuper Island School during the month of August and upon his return to Victoria reported to me that the bake oven was in a very poor condition and possibly a new one would have to be purchased. I suggested, however, that it would be advisable to send an expert from the Albion Stove Works, of this city, to examine the oven and see if it would be possible to put the same in a state of repair sufficient to make it last for some time and Mr. Scott concurred in this action being taken. I would recommend that the account be paid.\n\nAttached hereto will be found a copy of the report from the Albion Stove Works which goes to show that the oven cannot be repaired and I will therefore purchase a new one for the School at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIndian Industrial School.\n\nThe general construction and our system of distributing the heat remain the same. It has given such general satisfaction that we could not improve upon it.\n\nThese improvements have been made since this catalogue was compiled. The weight will be more than is shown under each illustration, as the ovens are now made heavier, stronger and more durable. The size is just the same as your #5.\n\nThe quotations are F.O.B. Factory, and as the #5 will now weigh about 5300 lbs. The freight charges to Chemainus (the nearest point our rates were quoted) will be $195.00, and we therefore quote you as follows on a new model #5 -\n\n#5 Hubbard Portable Oven - $600.00\nGov. sales tax 3% 18.00\nFreight to Chemainus 195.00 $813.00\n\nWe could save you something on the freight charges by shipping to Vancouver, and getting the benefit of the car rate by sending the oven with other shippers from this City. Under this plan, the freight rates would be $139.00; then there would be the additional charge from Vancouver to Kuper Island Wharf. You can perhaps calculate the probable cost from Vancouver, and see if anything can be saved by shipping to Vancouver.\n\nThe improvements will add many years to the life of the oven, and while it has increased the cost, we think that it is well worth it, and we look forward to receiving your order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHUBBARD PORTABLE OVEN CO.

I suggested that before the question of purchase was considered it would be well to have an expert from the Albion Stove Works, of this city, visit the School and make a report on the oven to see if it could be put in a satisfactory state of repair. I have received a report from the Albion Stove Works in which it is stated that the stove expert sent up is of the opinion that a new oven is wanted, as per enclosed report.\n\nYou will remember that it was practically understood that in the event of the oven not being repairable I should purchase a new one from the Hubbard Portable Oven Company, of Toronto, as you seemed to be of the opinion that the Purchasing Commission was not functioning any longer. I learn, however, that the Purchasing Commission is still in existence and therefore beg to recommend that they be requested to obtain from the Hubbard Portable Oven Company, 782 King Street, West, Toronto, Ontario, a No. 5 Portable Oven with two lengths of pipe each one foot long and an elbow. The price quoted by the above Company to the Rev. Father Murphy in February last was $600.00 plus the freight, estimated at $195.00. This oven should be shipped per C.P.R. to Vancouver, thence by C.P.R. boat from Vancouver to Kuper Island.\n\nI am herewith returning the letter from the Hubbard Company to the Reverend Principal, which you handed me when we were dealing with this matter.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.

We instruct you in the use of all fuels; this is a part of the Hubbard service. The furnaces are oblong-shaped, and take a stick of wood 18\", 24\" or 30\" in length, depending on the size of the oven.\n\nFIREPROOF\u2014The oven may be placed in any ordinary building, no special foundation being needed. The heavy insulated housing makes it fireproof, and they may be placed on a wooden floor; it is only necessary to place a steel mat in front of the furnace to catch any hot coal that may fall when removing the ashes. There is a 3\" air space under the oven, and a thermometer placed directly under the oven furnace, registered 98\u00b0 F.\n\nWEIGHT OF OVEN\u2014The ovens are heavy and solidly built, but not too heavy to set up in any building of ordinary construction, weighing about 125 lbs. to the square foot.\n\nMount Allison College installed a Hubbard Model C Coal Oven 33 years ago.

Report has also been made to the effect that the oven was received at the school on the 12th instant in good condition except that the lower deck of the oven was damaged in transit to the extent of $10.00.\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find cheque No. 3841 for $655.00, in payment of your account, dated the 3rd October, less $10.00. The Department is informed that the Principal of the School is filing claim against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for $10.00, the amount of damage done, and I may say that when the claim has been paid, this Department will be prepared to pay the balance of your account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

The house was most comfortably heated, and the staff of Sisters provided with all that is necessary as regards food and general supplies.\n\n2. The Principal, Reverend Father Murphy, is a good provider, and is kind and genial to all.\n\n3. As was pointed out to you when visiting the School, no provision was made for lavatory convenience on the second story. If I have been rightly informed, you suggested that the staircase leading to the Girls' Recreation Room might easily be removed, and the space utilized for that purpose. I do not know if you authorized this to be done, or if you simply mentioned the possibility of its being done. However, I would request you to kindly take up this matter with the Agent, or with Reverend Father Murphy, and advise them that this should be no longer delayed. This flat contains the living room, the dining-room and the class-room, and not a drop of water is available. Much valuable time is lost, and energy wasted by going up and down stairs so frequently. A sink and a lavatory there would be, not only a great boon, but an absolute necessity. Knowing your intentions as regards the comfort and convenience of the Sisters, I feel that you will not hesitate to recommend that the work be done immediately.\n\nSister Mary Albert is still in Hospital, but is gradually improving. I doubt that she will ever be able to return to Kuper Island.\n\nThanking you for all past kindness,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial Superior\n\nTo Duncan C.

They state that, if the amount mentioned has been collected from the carrying Company, they hope it will be passed on to them.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I have to request that you will ascertain whether the claim, which it is understood the Principal of the School preferred against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in this matter, has been made good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., May 30th, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving reference to your letter of February 4th last, in which you requested me to obtain an estimate for the installation of some plumbing fixtures on the second floor of the Kuper Island School, I beg to say that upon receipt of your letter I communicated with Rev. Father Murphy, the Principal, to see just what was desired and he came to Victoria with the blue prints of the building and informed me that what he wanted was a wash-basin, bath and toilet at both ends of the corridor shown on the \"ground floor\" plan of the school, and this would necessitate the removal of the stairs in each instance. He did not, however, want the work to be undertaken until early in July when the children are away on vacation.\n\nMessrs. Thacker & Holt, who installed the plumbing in this building, and are therefore fully conversant with the system, were then consulted as to the cost; but it was impossible to give an estimate until an opportunity afforded a visit to the school. Mr. Holt has just returned from Kuper Island and given me a quotation on the work necessary, the estimates being $975.00.\n\nAttached hereto please find the letter of the above mentioned firm. Mr. Holt informs me that the ground floor is not just as it is shown on the blue print, the hall being somewhat wider and the door of the sewing-room not being in the position as shown. The work suggested by the Reverend Principal, if carried out, will then provide two bath-rooms, one being 8' x 11' at the south end of the building and the other about 7' x 10' at the north end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R.D./HKE\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nW.

C., May 30, 1924.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe writer was at Kuper Island Indian School estimating the proposed new Bath rooms and was asked by Father Murphy to suggest a scheme to improve the condition of the sink wastes.\n\nThese waste pipes from the kitchen sinks are continually choking up owing to the long distance they have to travel under cold concrete which causes the grease to congeal in the pipes, necessitating continually blowing them out with steam.\n\nWhen this job was originally installed it was equipped with a cast iron grease trap. This trap was replaced some years ago with a water-cooled grease trap which improved matters somewhat. Later the Department supplied a long steam hose to blow out the grease. This last arrangement has proved a great help, not only to the sink wastes but to all the other drains on the job.\n\nThe writer would suggest that the sinks be disconnected from the rest of the plumbing, carried through outside wall and connected to a specially constructed concrete grease trap, a sketch of which we submit. This trap is one we have used successfully in large hotels and schools, the cover is movable and the grease can be removed from time to time; the waste is then carried on to the bank about 60 feet from the building in 4\" Vitrified pipe and then distributed in 4\" field tile. We estimate the cost of this work will amount to $150.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) THACKER & HOLT,\nper Geo. Holt.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nP.O.

Holt of Thacker & Holt, plumbers, who have submitted an estimate of cost for the installation of new plumbing fixtures at the Kuper Island School, about which I wrote you yesterday.\n\nIf it is the intention to add the new bath rooms as proposed, I would advise that the additional work, to get away from the grease nuisance, be done at the same time, and, as I have already stated this firm is fully conversant with the plumbing system of the building, I think would be the most suitable firm to put in the new work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWED/NKE\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn February last you received a letter from Reverend Sister Mary Gabriel asking for the installation of additional plumbing fixtures on the ground floor of the Kuper Island School, and you advised her that you were taking this matter up with Mr. Ditchburn. Mr. Ditchburn was written to and asked to submit a report on the estimated cost of the fixtures asked for by the Reverend Sister.\n\nThis report has been received and the Principal is anxious to have installed two additional bath rooms on the ground floor, these to be located at the ends of the corridor where space can be made available by removing the present stairs which are not required. The cost of installing the plumbing fixtures and building the necessary partitions to enclose the bath room, would be approximately $975.00.\n\nThere is also required a new grease trap as the waste pipes from the kitchen sinks are continually choking up on account of the long distance they have to travel under the concrete which causes the grease to congeal. The cost of building a grease trap would be approximately $150.00.\n\nMr. Ditchburn recommends that the work be carried out by Messrs. Thacker & Holt of Victoria, as this was the firm that installed all of the plumbing fixtures in the building and they are fully conversant with the existing system.\n\nWill you please advise me if this work is to be authorized.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, June 13, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letters of the 28th and 31st ultimo, with reference to the additional plumbing fixtures required in the Ruper Island School, I beg to advise you that you may arrange with Messrs.

Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to apply to you on behalf of the Principal of the Kuper Island Industrial School for an expenditure of approximately $300 for the purchase of a new gasoline pump for use in that school. The same is a matter of immediate necessity; the original pump was discarded last year being worn beyond repair. Rev. Father Murphy, the Principal, purchasing a small gas pump on sale, the oil one from proceeds of his per capita grant, this new has been found to have insufficient power.\n\nFor your information I should like to point out that the school authorities have been put to a great expense during the past year with the plumbing at the school. It appears that the water pipes were set in the concrete foundations at time of construction, trouble arose last fall and after considerable trouble and expense it was found that one wing of the building had sunk several inches, with the result that the pipes in that section became severed.\n\nIn the same way I find that the acetylene lighting system has become faulty through the settling of the building and at times the fumes of the gas is found throughout the building. A leakage at different points is apparent, which is borne out by the fact that over a ton more carbide was used during the past winter than in previous ones. I would therefore ask that the Department give their very serious consideration as to a change of the lighting system of the school to electricity. I need not point out the obvious danger of a sudden great leakage of this gas, through the further sinking of the building, especially in view of the fact that practically a hundred children live in the building.\n\nIn conversation with the Reverend Father Murphy he rightly explains that with the many improvements and repairs that have been carried out during the past year, through the changing of the water pipes etc., that he cannot in any way consider the purchase of pumps, or change in lighting system. I would most respectfully request that these matters be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussel T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 3)\nMay 4, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Indian agent reports that the Kuper Island Indian Residential School is settling a little and causing leakages in several places in the acetylene pipes. I believe this is the only modern Indian residential school that is not equipped with electricity for lighting purposes and Mr. Orr and I wish to recommend, in view of the seriousness of the situation, that immediate steps be taken to put in an electric light plant. No funds have been specifically provided for this school; but, as we are postponing other than the most urgent improvements, I believe funds can be found in this year's appropriation.\n\nTo wire the building, provide fixtures and install a generating plant would cost nearly $5,000.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:\n\nI have your 544-X-2 of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the need for a new gasoline pump at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. In reply I regret to inform you that there are no funds available for the purchasing of this equipment and you should inform the Rev. Principal that he will have to use school funds for this purpose.\n\nI note with considerable dismay that the acetylene lighting system has become faulty, through the settling of the building, and that there are leakages at different points. The Department has given very serious consideration to this situation, and an effort will be made to provide funds for the purpose of installing electric light in the near future. You will be further advised in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nINDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nKuper Island, B. C. March 17th, 1926.\n\nA. H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Lomas:\n\nDuring the month of May last year, the Department decided to give our lighting system serious consideration.\n\nOf course the building has settled since, hence more leaks and more danger to life and property. The gas pipes are laid between the floors of each ceiling; the wood therefore is impregnated with acetylene gas, which is highly inflammable. We have used a ton and a half more carbide this season than formerly; this proves a very serious leakage and a great danger where open lights must be used.\n\nSomething should be done during the long days of summer to install electric lights.\n\nObediently Yours,\n\n(Signed) A. Murphy S. M. H.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nHaving reference to your letter of May 6th, 1925 in connection with the lighting system in the Kuper Island Industrial School, I now beg to enclose you copy of letter today received from the Reverend Father Murphy, Principal of the School again pointing out the ever increasing danger of leakage of gas.\n\nI wish also to most strongly support Father Murphy's request on this matter, when visiting the School last week fumes of gas were most evident throughout the building. I would most earnestly request that a competent man be asked to thoroughly investigate the trouble at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 26, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 895-Y-2 of the 18th instant enclosing copy of a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. I note that both Father Murphy and yourself strongly recommend the installation of an electric lighting system this year. There will be an appropriation for this purpose during the present session of Parliament, and I am pleased to state that the Department Architect will prepare a blueprint and specifications as to what is required. In due course, this will be forwarded to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn for the necessary action. Please inform the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

BOX 644,\nVICTORIA, B.C., March 9, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving reference to the construction of the Kuper Island Indian School, I beg to say that Rev. Father Murphy, the Principal, would like to obtain plans of the furnaces, but most particularly the draught system of the chimneys.\n\nHe has been having some trouble of late and, as he is a mechanic, feels that he can overcome the trouble without any expense, if he had the plans.\n\nI wrote recently to Messrs. Kydd Bros. of Vancouver, who installed this furnace a number of years ago, asking if they could supply the plans of the system, but they informed me that they can not do this for the reason that after a plant has been installed for a year they would not have any further use for them. They concluded their letter by saying that they would be pleased to send a man to the School to locate the trouble, if requested, and the work would be charged for on the usual basis.\n\nIf you have the plans of the system, would you please let Rev. Father Murphy have them, otherwise, it might be the proper thing to do to have a man sent over from Kydd Bros., of Vancouver.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

This plant was made before my time, and I do not remember what type of boiler was installed, although I believe it was a patented boiler setting, which is not used at the present time. The only way to find out whether the trouble is with the draft would be to have same thoroughly inspected by a competent heating engineer. It probably would be more satisfactory to have Kydd Bros. of Vancouver look the plant over, and give you a report as to the remedy required and the cost of same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Everyone knows the convenience, cleanliness, safety and comfort of this system of lighting, although only those who have used it fully appreciate its advantages.\n\nGood lighting is not the only convenience which a private installation will give you, for many daily tasks in the household and on the farm may be done, cheaply and cleanly, by means of the electric current, and with great saving of labour. Such as:\n\n- Cooking\n- Heating of Houses\n- Carpet Sweeping and Beating\n- Table Heaters\n- Ironing\n- Vacuum Cleaning\n- Pumping Water\n- Heating Water in any part of the house\n- Milking\n- Dairy Work\n\nThe best method of obtaining the electric current, when out of reach of the city mains, is the question on which many are seeking information. The chief considerations in any isolated electric plant are: that it shall not be too costly to install; that the light shall be always available without any trouble; that it shall be easy and cheap to maintain.\n\nTHE NECESSARY PLANT.\n\nIn all cases an engine is used to drive a dynamo which generates the electric current used in the lamps and elsewhere.\nIt is, however, not always convenient to run the engine when an odd light or two are wanted in a hurry, and therefore storage batteries are added to the plant to meet this requirement.\n\nThe storage batteries are charged by the engine and dynamo, and, as their name implies, they store the current until required. They may be used by themselves to supply any number of lights, but this convenience has to be paid for, as you do not get as much out of a battery as you have to put into it to keep it charged; it is, therefore, uneconomical to use the battery to supply a large number of lights.\n\nWhen the lights are on at night, and the engine and dynamo are running full power, the plant is working most economically, but when the engine is running to supply only a few lights it is not working nearly so efficiently; in fact, it is cheaper to use the storage battery only in this case.\n\nFrom the above we learn that the most economical method of operation is:\n\n- To use the battery to supply a few lights only (say, quarter of the total);\n- To run the engine when more lights are wanted;\n- To charge the battery from the engine and dynamo when convenient.\n\nIt will be obvious that, while it is simple enough to switch on a few lights from the battery, it becomes very inconvenient to be continually counting the number actually on throughout the house; and when they exceed so many, to go out to the engine room and start up the engine and dynamo, and, similarly, stop it again when the extra lights are put out. This would mean constant attendance in the engine room.\n\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON Patent Automatic Lighting and Power Plants have been specially designed to do exactly what has been stated above, BY THEMSELVES AND WITHOUT ATTENTION. Any number of lights may be switched on at any time of the day or night, the plant starting and stopping itself as occasion demands, only a very occasional special run being required.\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON Plant therefore gives the greatest possible economy in running costs, and light is available at any time\u2014by merely switching on.\n\nEconomy and simplicity of maintenance\u2014because, being automatic, the engine starts itself after a certain number of lights are switched on, gives you the light and at the same time puts current into the battery, so never allowing it to run down, and stops itself when you have finished. All you are asked to do in the way of maintenance is to keep it clean, and put fuel and oil in the engine when required.\n\n**NOTHING COULD BE MORE SIMPLE.**\n\nThe plant may be used during the daytime for doing other work, such as pumping water, operating dairy and domestic appliances.\n\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON system is eminently suitable, and has been very extensively adopted, for both large and small country house work at home and bungalows abroad, institutions, churches, hotels, factories and small towns.\n\nLISTER-BRUSTON were the originators of Automatic Lighting and Power Plants (the first automatic sets being made in 1907), since when the system has not only been applied to lighting and cooking in country houses, but also the lighting of towns, and for emergency lighting and wireless power on board ship.\n\nThe highly efficient LISTER engine provides the motive power in LISTER-BRUSTON plants. The soundness of design and the excellent quality of the workmanship put into these engines is well-known to all users throughout the world. They operate at a comparatively slow speed, with freedom from wear and tear, and in consequence the working parts have a greatly increased life over the high speed sets sometimes met with.\nThe System as applied to Town Lighting\n\nThe essential requirement of a public supply for a small town is that there shall be a twenty-four hour service. The difficulties which have hitherto been experienced in connection with supplies are: That the increased efficiency of the modern lamps in use results in a decreased revenue to the supply companies; labour costs are very high; and a considerable amount of capital is sunk in a larger plant in anticipation of a future demand.\n\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON Parallel Working System is specially adaptable for this class of work for the following reasons:\n\nThe initial cost is lower because it is only in proportion to the immediate requirements of the town or village. Additional sets may be added from time to time as the demand for current grows, the additional plants being interconnected in such a manner that they start and stop themselves automatically when the load is increased or diminished as the case may be\u2014thus maintaining the HIGHEST POSSIBLE EFFICIENCY AT ALL LOADS.\nThe System as applied to Town Lighting\u2014Continued.\n\nLabour costs are reduced because a power station equipped with these plants does not need constant attendance. One operator can visit a number of stations every day to see to fuel and oil requirements and do any cleaning necessary.\n\nThe saving in working costs due to less labour employed and less interest on capital more than balances the diminished revenue on account of consumers using the modern high efficiency lamps, and puts the financial side of any electricity undertaking on a sound basis.\n\nThe word \"automatic\" is frequently associated with a complicated mechanism. Such, however is not the case with the LISTER-BRUSTON system, which, if anything, is more simple than ordinary hand-operated plants.\n\nAutomatic working has been proved to be more reliable than manual attention. As an instance we would point out that the majority of electric lifts are worked automatically; also the safety of millions of people on the Underground Railways of London depends upon automatic signalling.\nSome Advantages of the Lister-Bruston Automatic System\n\nAUTOMATIC operation. The plant gives a continuous service of light, the engine starting and stopping itself when necessary without anyone going to the engine room. The only attention required is to keep it supplied with fuel, oil and water, and in a reasonably clean condition, and a very occasional special run.\n\nLower first cost, owing to the necessity of a battery of only a fourth or fifth the size of the battery required if all the load were taken from it, as in non-automatic plants.\n\nThe system is such that, although the capacity of the battery is comparatively small, it is kept in practically fully charged condition, and thus, in the event of a failure of the engine, the battery is capable of supplying a normal load for some time. The time limit reverse current circuit breaker which is fitted on the switchboard cuts the dynamo off from the battery should the engine fail to start within a given time, or fail through lack of fuel, etc.; thus protecting the battery from discharging itself by motoring the dynamo for long periods.\n\nWith an ordinary hand-operated accumulator system the usual practice is to run the engine only when the battery is discharged and requires charging up, with the result that\nSome Advantages of the LISTER-BRUSTON Automatic System\u2014Continued\n\nalthough a larger storage battery may be installed, only a small capacity is available in case of a breakdown.\n\nEconomical running by saving battery losses and running direct from the dynamo, unless only a few lights are in use.\n\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON Automatic Generating System is the simplest, most economical and efficient means of providing electric light and power.\n\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON Plant, being self-contained, and not fixed to the floor, can be easily moved from place to place; consequently it becomes a tenant's fixture, and may be moved from one house to another at the end of the tenancy.\n\nOrdinary Town Gas may be used instead of Petrol to drive engine if preferred.\n\nOwing to the efficient and automatic arrangement for oiling the engine, the cost of lubrication with the LISTER - BRUSTON system is far less than with the other systems.\n\nElectric light from the LISTER-BRUSTON Automatic Plant requires less attention than Acetylene or Petrol Gas Light. It does not vitiate the air or give off poisonous fumes, consequently it is much healthier. There is no smoke, and it does not, therefore, spoil decorations.\nThe Selection of the Best Type of Plant\n\nTHE satisfactory operation of the plant depends, to a great extent, upon the most suitable size of plant being installed.\n\nThe services of one of our engineers are always at the disposal of intending purchasers, to give any assistance that may be required in the general arrangement, and amount and disposition of lighting, and to recommend the most suitable plant to instal.\n\nFor small installations where lighting only is required, together with, say, small domestic appliances such as vacuum cleaner, 55 volts will be found the most suitable. If, however, it is desired to use any heating appliances, small motors, etc., 110 volts would be preferable.\n\nAs a result of experience it is usually found that not more than two-thirds of the lighting capacity requirements of a house are used at any one time, and a plant selected for this load will be found to give the best results.\nGeneral Specification\n\nARRANGEMENT. In the smaller sizes the drive is by belt from the engine flywheel to the dynamo. The engine, dynamo, controller and water cooling tank are all mounted on a substantial steel girder frame, suitable for standing on the floor and running without special foundation. It does not require bolting down. In the 3 k.w. size the dynamo is coupled direct to the LISTER single cylinder engine and both are mounted on a strong cast iron baseplate.\n\nIn sizes of 4 kw. and over, driven by LISTER twin or four cylinder engines, the dynamo is coupled direct to the engine and both are mounted on a cast iron baseplate, making a self-contained set and occupying very small floor space.\n\nENGINE. LISTER Slow Speed Vertical Engine of standard construction, and usual excellent finish, with extra heavy flywheels, crowned in belt driven sets, giving steady running at all loads and speeds. Designed for working long periods without\nGeneral Specification\u2014Continued.\n\nattention. Fitted with automatic lubrication, high tension magneto ignition, pump fed carburettor which cannot flood, fuel tank and pipes, water cooling tank, pipe connections and 3-way cock. Cast iron floor type silencer and 18 feet of pipes and bends complete. All necessary tools and spares. (For further details of engine see Lister Engine Section Catalogue).\n\nREGULATION. In addition to the centrifugal Mechanical Governor, a patent Magnetic Governor is fitted to the engine which regulates its speed according to the load, thereby giving a practically constant voltage and high efficiency at all loads.\n\nDYNAMO. Patent Shunt Wound, fitted with automatic lubrication. The belt driven types have a sliding bedplate for tightening the belt, and are driven from engine by means of a laminated leather belt.\n\nCONTROLLER. An Automatic Rheostat or Controller is fitted to enable engine to start up easily and smoothly, the compression of the engine being automatically released until sufficient speed has been attained to ensure easy starting.\nGeneral Specification\u2014Continued.\n\nSWITCHBOARD. Enamelled Slate Switchboard containing voltmeter, two ammeters, patent Bruston relay, safety circuit breaker, fuse and the necessary terminals, plainly labelled for connecting to plant.\n\nBATTERY. Suitable battery of Accumulators for working plant automatically and lighting a few lamps without the engine running.\n\nOPERATION OF PLANT. Lights can be switched on at any part of the installation. The first few lights are supplied from the battery. When a certain number has been exceeded the plant starts up and generates current, the lamps being supplied direct from the dynamo, which at the same time supplies current direct to the battery. When the number of lights in use is sufficiently reduced the plant stops, the remaining lights being supplied by the battery.\nGeneral Specification\u2014Continued.\n\nIn large installations, especially country mansions, where during a period of the year a light load only is required, the LISTER-BRUSTON parallel system of working is installed. In some instances two plants of equal size are employed, interconnected in such a manner that when the load is within the capacity of one set, one set only is running. Immediately the load is increased to beyond the capacity of No. 1 set, the second automatically steps into operation and runs in parallel. Likewise when the load is reduced the plants automatically cut themselves out. Further, should one of the sets fail through any cause, the second automatically steps into operation and takes over the load.\n\nIn instances where it is considered advisable the two sets may be unequal, for instance a 4 kw. and 8 kw. set. The operation of unequal sized plants is as follows:\n\nOn light load the 4 kw. set starts. When the load is increased to beyond the capacity of 4 kw., the 8 kw. plant automatically starts up and the 4 kw. stops. Upon the load being further increased to beyond the capacity of the 8 kw. set, the 4 kw. set again comes into operation.\n\nAs proof of the efficient service rendered by LISTER-BRUSTON Automatic Lighting and Power Plants, there are upwards of 3,000 already installed and working in all parts of the world, for houses and bungalows, hotels, churches, institutions, hospitals, factories, townships and at sea.\nBelt Driven Series up to 2 Kw.\n\nEquipment.

The resumption of main supply will stop the plant.\nThe Lister-Bruston Service at Sea\u2014Continued.\n\n(2) The plant is self-testing. Owing to the action of a time switch it will start up automatically at a given time every day and run for a given time. Tell-tale lamps are fitted where required, which will indicate if the plant is out of order. These lamps may be fitted in the engineer's cabin, or wireless operator's cabin, or elsewhere. This regular running will keep the plant in good condition, so that it is always ready for the emergency. The amount of attention required is reduced to a minimum.\n\n(3) The failure of the main supply starts the plant, therefore the starting is independent of any outside agency which might be affected by confusion due to accident or attack.\n\n(4) Testing switches can be placed where desired, so that by simply operating a small tumbler switch the plant will start at any time.\n\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON plant, therefore, meets all requirements that can possibly be desired to give a really efficient plant.\n\nAt an inquiry into the loss of a ship during the Great War, it was given in evidence that the operator tried to send a wireless call for help, but it could not be done owing to a second explosion which occurred in the engine-room having stopped the dynamo and left the ship without any current. An auxiliary set which takes fifteen or twenty minutes to start cannot be regarded as an efficient emergency set, as during that period the ship would...\nThe Lister-Bruston Service at Sea\u2014Continued.\n\nbe in darkness and no wireless signals could be sent out, and fifteen or twenty valuable minutes would be lost, so that the benefits conferred by such a system as the LISTER-BRUSTON are obvious.\n\nNot only is this system applicable to steamships, but if installed on sailing ships would add comfort by supplying electric light, and safety by adding wireless. It would also be a good investment, as it would enable a sailing ship to signal her arrival when, say, 100 miles from port, which would often facilitate arrangements for reception of cargo; or even if the owners wished to transfer the cargo to another port wireless would save delay and, consequently, money. Standard sets can now be supplied from 1 kw. to 15 kw., and larger sizes to order.\n\nDuring the War many instances occurred of loss of life due to vessels being plunged into darkness at the time of collision or accident, and it was mentioned at the official enquiries which were held afterwards \u201cthat loss of life and valuable time were wasted owing to the darkness.\u201d\n\nWe have installed S.O.S. Emergency Sets on naval vessels during the War and the following is an extract of letter received from the Chief Engineer of one vessel:\n\n\u201cUp to the time of writing we have had a good number of runs off the plant and all has, up to now, gone off splendidly and without falter.\u201d\n\nA subsequent letter from the Engineer states the following:\n\n\u201cThe H.M.S. (censored) is no more. On (censored) it was torpedoed and the engine room flooded in a few seconds. The LISTER-BRUSTON Automatic Emergency Set, however, came into operation and maintained the supply to the vessel and continued to supply until the plant was submerged.\u201d\nGeneral Specification\n\nARRANGEMENT. The Engine and Dynamo are coupled direct by a semi-flexible coupling and are mounted on a strong cast iron baseplate. The baseplate also carries a water cooling radiator, fan and water pump.\n\nThese Plants are suitable for placing on deck or on the roof of deckhouses, so that in the event of disaster and total loss of the ship, they will continue to give light and power for wireless until they are submerged.\n\nThe floor space occupied by these sets is very small indeed.\n\nThe tell-tale lamps which indicate that the set has started and stopped itself at the appointed hour daily may be placed in any part of the ship.\n\nENGINE. LISTER Slow Speed Vertical Engine of standard construction and usual excellent finish, with extra heavy flywheels that give steady running at all loads and speeds. Designed for working long periods without attention. Fitted with automatic lubrication, high tension magneto ignition, pump fed carburettor that cannot flood and is free from the risk of fire, water cooling radiator and fan, cast iron floor type silencer and 18 feet of pipes and bends complete. All necessary tools and spares. (For further details of engine see Lister Engine Section Catalogue).\n\nREGULATION. In addition to the centrifugal mechanical governor, a patent Magnetic Governor is fitted to the engine which regulates its speed according to the load, thereby giving a practically constant voltage and high efficiency at all loads.\nGeneral Specification\u2014Continued.\n\nDYNAMO. Patent Shunt Wound, fitted with automatic ring lubrication, coupled direct to engine by semi-flexible coupling.\n\nCONTROLLER. An Automatic Rheostat or Controller is fitted to enable engine to start up easily and smoothly, the compression of the engine being automatically released until sufficient speed has been attained to ensure easy starting.\n\nSWITCHBOARD. Enamelled Slate Switchboard containing voltmeter, two ammeters, patent Bruston relay, 48 day time switch, safety circuit breaker, automatic change-over switch, fuse and the necessary terminals, plainly labelled for connecting to plant.\n\nBATTERY. Suitable battery of Accumulators for working plant automatically, and lighting a few lamps without the engine running.\n\nOPERATION OF PLANT. The plant is so designed that immediately the voltage of the ship's main supply falls below a predetermined point, the plant automatically starts up. On the other hand the plant may be started by the operator or any other authorised person by pressing a switch, or by a similar means on any part of the ship which may be decided upon.\n\nTo ensure that the auxiliary plant is always kept in good working order it is arranged for the plant to automatically start up and stop at any predetermined time daily, giving indication by means of a lamp should the plant not operate correctly. This starting up and stopping is entirely independent of the operator. The plant automatically stops immediately the main supply is resumed.\n\nFurther particulars and prices of the S.O.S. Type Automatic Plants may be had on application.\nRecent Unsolicited Testimonials\n\nPeter Hall, Esq., Building Dept., Sir F. Willis, Bart., Meggernee Castle, Glenlyon, Perthshire:\n\n\"We have two of your small Automatic Lighting Plants, one fitted some years ago, and the other more or less recently on the above estate, both of which are giving the utmost satisfaction, but would be greatly obliged if you would forward to the above address any literature which you may have published giving advice in regard to the necessary adjustments to be made from time to time on the engines and the general upkeep and treatment of them. Thanking you in anticipation for the receipt of the above favour.\"\n\nW. G. Buchanan, Esq., Manor House Farm, Abergavenny, November 2nd, 1922.\n\n\"I have to say that the 'LISTER-BRUSTON' Electric Lighting and Pumping Plant supplied by and installed by you has so far proved in every way satisfactory. I have no objection to your making whatever use you like of this.\"\n\nDaniel Henderson, Esq., Dalmahoy House, Midlothian, 25th April, 1922.\n\n\"I thought you would like to hear from me as to how the ten horse-power 'LISTER-BRUSTON' Plant is behaving itself.\n\n\"It has now been running for nearly a year and has given us no trouble whatsoever. I find it extremely economical and the automatic cut-out apparatus has, I think, not a little to do with that. The engine works sweetly, and with proper attention need never give anybody any trouble.\n\n\"If at any time you would like to show the installation to any prospective clients please do not hesitate to take them out to Dalmahoy.\"\nThe Lister-Bruston Plant in the Country House\n\nWATER SERVICE.\n\nOne of the most important questions which has to be dealt with is the provision of a water supply, as only in very few instances is the public water supply available, and although hitherto the pumping has been undertaken either by manual labour or horse, when a LISTER-BRUSTON Plant is installed it can be adapted to do this work.\n\nIn instances where it is practicable to fix a pump in the engine room, we recommend that it is driven from there on the electric light engine itself, as shown on page 20.\n\nShould it not be possible to do the pumping it is only necessary to turn on a switch on the LISTER-BRUSTON switchboard, which will start up the engine, and, by means of suitable belt striking gear, a belt on the pump can be moved on to the fixed pulley, when the pump will immediately commence to do its work.\n\nDEEP WELL PUMPS.\n\nShould the distance from the ground level to the water exceed 15 feet it will be necessary to install a deep well pattern pump.\n\nTo enable us to quote for these, the following particulars are necessary:\n\n1. Type and diameter of well.\n2. Depth to bottom of well.\n3. Level of water below ground level.\n4. Can LISTER-BRUSTON plant be placed near well to enable pump to be driven by belt from engine.\n5. Distance of Plant from well.\n6. Height and distance to which water has to be pumped.\n7. Approximate quantity of water required, per hour or per day.\n8. Maximum variation of depth of water in well due to season of year.\nThe LISTER-BRUSTON Plant in the Country House\u2014Continued.\n\nELECTRICALLY DRIVEN PUMPS.\n\nIn instances where the well is too far from the electric light plant to permit of its being driven from the engine itself, it will be necessary to install electrically driven pumps.\n\nWhen the pump is driven by an electric motor, whether in the engine room or some distance away, its operation may be automatically controlled by means of a float in the water supply tank, thus:\n\nWhen the water level in the tank has dropped to about one-tenth of the full capacity, the float makes contact with the relay on the switchboard, so starting the engine at any time of the day or night.\n\nAfter an interval of time, when the engine has reached full speed, the electric motor driving the pump is automatically put in circuit. The engine continues to work, and the electric motor continues to drive the pump until the supply tank becomes full of water, when the float automatically breaks the circuit and so stops the motor and the engine.\n\nA LISTER-BRUSTON Plant with this attachment will give you a CONTINUOUS SERVICE OF LIGHT and also a CONTINUOUS SERVICE OF WATER without any of the usual bother of constantly watching float gauges or ampere meters as with the ordinary non-automatic plants.\n\nAll we ask you to do is to give the engine fuel, oil and water at any convenient time of the day and keep the plant in a reasonably clean condition.\nThe Heart of a Lighting Plant\n\nWHATEVER type of electric lighting plant you instal, the satisfactory service it will give depends on the ENGINE. No amount of storage battery will make up for a weakness in this essential part. A lighting part is only a machine for converting the mechanical power of the engine into the electrical power that lights your lamps, and if there is not a steady reliable flow of power from the engine the light is uncertain at its very source. The LISTER engine, which is the result of years of experience, coupled with the highest grade of British workmanship and material has made LISTER-BRUSTON plants synonymous with good lighting service and satisfaction.\nSchedule of outlets\n\nSketches of Lighting Fittings\n\nHAWKINS & HAYWARD\n## Schedule of Wiring & Fittings\n\n| LOCATION          | Wall Lights | Plugs | S.P.

In deference to the wishes of the staff, chain fixtures have not been considered and ceiling types used generally.\n\nIn all there are\n\n189 lights openings, with appropriate fittings\n18 wall plug openings with receptacles and 14 portable lamps\n104 switches with S.R. switches\n12 switches with 3 way switches\n6 dimmers are included for night lights in the Dormitories and Infirmarys.\n\nAll the wiring will be in conduit, mostly exposed, and all the main switches, cutouts, panel boxes, etc. for a complete job, in working order are included.\nW.E.D., Esq.,\nVictoria, B.C. September 27th 1926\n\n1-54 cell -25 ampere hour battery.\n1- switchboard.\n\nThe operation of this plant is entirely automatic as follows.\nFor a small load, such as the all night load, energy would be supplied from the battery. On the load increasing the 3 K.W. set would automatically start and handle the load up to its capacity; on a further increase in load the 6 K.W. machine cuts in automatically and the 3 K.W. machine stops. When the 6 K.W. machine is loaded to capacity the 3 K.W. machine starts and operates in multiple with the 6 K.W. machine. On decreasing loads the operations are reversed, all being automatic. The supervision on this plant will be a minimum, the replenishing of fuel & oil and occasionally water, and cleaning, being about all the attention required. The fuel used is gasoline.\n\nLOCATION OF PLANT\n\nWe find there is no available room in the main building for installing the plant. From an electrical standpoint, the next best place would be to house the plant in an addition at the back of the laundry. This addition with walls to match the laundry, about 15' x 20' in size with separate room for battery, cement floor etc would cost approximately Nine hundred and forty five dollars ($945.00)\nW.E. Ditchburn Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nof Canada\nP.O. Box 66, City.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn pursuance of your letter of August 25th, we have visited the Indian Residential School at Kuper Island and have consulted with Rev. Father Geurts and the staff at the school and have made a very careful survey of the situation and requirements.\n\nTYPE of PLANT.\n\nIn considering the type of plant to be installed, several factors have to be considered.\n\n1st There is a very small all night load\n\n2nd While for convenience of lighting the buildings, the number of outlets is large, the demand factor will not be large, probably not exceeding 40 or 50%\n\n3rd Owing to the more or less isolated position, a duplication of plants is desirable.\n\nWe therefore beg to recommend the following equipment:\n\n1- 3 K.W.- 110 volt Type G.S. Lister Brunton Automatic Electric plant.\n\n1- 6 K.W.- 110 volt Type K.S. Lister Brunton Automatic Electric plant.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with the instructions contained in your letter of 5th August, that I should arrange with a competent electrician at Victoria, to proceed to Kuper Island and estimate the cost of wiring the Indian Residential School for electric light and installing a proper size and generating outfit, I beg to say that Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward are the largest firm dealing with electric lighting plants in this city and I, therefore, asked this firm to give me a quotation on the required work. I am today in receipt of their tender which I am enclosing herewith. You will observe the total cost of the wiring and generating plant is $9,425.00 with $125.00 additional if the plant is to be housed in the building at present used for the acetylene gas tanks. This firm have also given an approximate cost of the construction of a new building outside the school in which the plant must be housed. Mr. Hayward has informed me that the Principal would prefer to have it installed in the gas plant house as it would not interfere in any way with the accommodation at the rear of the laundry.\n\nI understand that the required engine can be obtained in Winnipeg, but the switch board will have to come from England which will take about one month, but it would require about one month to complete the wiring.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nEnclosures: -\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOct. 6, 1926.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nReference Hawkins & Hayward's price lighting plant\nKuper Island School wire me their figures for generating\noutfit, wiring, wiring of building, and lighting fixtures\nseparately. Is price quoted by them their best figure\nfor the work.\n\nDuncan G. Scott.\n\nChg. D. I.

In the third following paragraph mention is made of a schedule of lights and switches required in the various rooms in the building. It is not quite clear whether lamps are to be considered as fixtures.\n\nThe tenders of the above mentioned firms are herewith enclosed and I would beg to recommend that the contract be given to Messrs.

Fox & Mainwaring.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nEnclosures:-\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Scott.\n\nSpecifications were prepared for a new electric lighting plant required for the Kuper Island Indian Residential School to replace the obsolete acetylene gas plant. Copies of these specifications were sent to Indian Commissioner Ditchburn and he was asked to obtain and submit prices from the following firms in Victoria:\n\n- Grant Electric Co.,\n- Fox & Mainwaring, 615 Fort St.,\n- Sun Electric Co.,\n- Hawkins & Hayward.\n\nOn November 19th Mr. Ditchburn submitted to the Department tenders from the above mentioned firms for the complete installation of the electric lighting system, which included in addition to all of the necessary wiring the generating plant.\n\nOn December 7th Mr. Ditchburn was asked to obtain from each of the firms above mentioned an amended tender on the basis of the Department supplying and installing the generating plant. This would leave their tender for the wiring of the building only. The following tenders have been received on this basis:\n\n- Hawkins & Hayward ........ $2,645.00\n- Grant Electric Co. .......... $3,950.00\n- Fox & Mainwaring Co. ....... $4,200.00\n\nMr. Ditchburn recommends that the contract be awarded to Messrs Hawkins & Hayward as they have submitted the lowest price, and I concur with Mr. Ditchburn in his recommendation.\nWith reference to the generating plant this can be purchased direct from the manufacturer at wholesale price, and I would recommend that a Lister Bruston automatic plant be installed as follows:\n\n1 - 3 K. W. 110 volt type G. S. Lister Bruston Automatic Electric plant.\n\n1 - 6 K. W. 110 volt type K. S. Lister Bruston Automatic Electric plant.\n\n1 - 54 cell, 85 ampere hour battery.\n\n1 - Switchboard.\n\nThis plant is automatic and therefore uses a low capacity type of storage battery, which makes the upkeep cost of the plant low as compared with the non-automatic types, also by using both the 3 and 6 K. W. generator the lighting of the school can be done with the minimum amount of power, which means a great saving in gasoline. The cost of the above mentioned plant completely installed will be approximately $5,500.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nI beg to give you the following information on the operating of an automatic and a non-automatic electric lighting plant with particular reference to the Kuper Island School. The Lister Bruston is an automatic type of electric lighting plant, and in the case of the Kuper Island School would consist of a 3 K. W. generator, a 6 K. W. generator and an 85 ampere hour storage battery. The operating of this plant is as follows:- Lights can be switched on in any part of the building and the first fifteen lights are supplied from the battery. As soon as more power is required above the fifteen lights the three K. W. generator automatically starts up and generates and supplies current up to its capacity. When more lights are turned on the six K. W. generator automatically starts up and the three K. W. shuts off and power can be used up to the maximum of the six K. W. generator. If more power is required than can be delivered by the six K. W. generator the three K. W. starts up and the entire plant will supply current up to nine K. W. or 9000 watts. In all cases the current above the fifteen lights is being supplied direct from the generators and not from the storage battery. The Lister engine can be operated by either gasoline or petrol.\n\nThe non-automatic plant, which uses any type of gasoline engine either directly connected or belt connected to the generator requires a large capacity storage battery of a minimum of 200 ampere hours. In all cases when lights are being used in the building the current is being drawn from the storage battery. The initial cost of the automatic plant is higher than the non-automatic, but the upkeep cost of the automatic is very much lower than the non-automatic, as in the automatic the storage battery costs approximately $500.00 and in the non-automatic $2,000.00. From experience in the past with electric lighting plants in our schools the average life of a storage battery is from three to four years, given good attention. The cost of replacing the storage battery necessitates an expenditure for new batteries every three or four years.\nThe automatic plant consisting of two generating outfits is also of advantage in isolated locations for if repairs are required to one of the generators current can always be supplied from the other, and the building will not be without lights. Both types of lighting plants of course are guaranteed for a period of years, and there is no difficulty in obtaining good service from the manufacturers of either types or repairing parts.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nDec. 28, 1926.\n\nSirs,\n\nPlease quote me your best wholesale price f.o.b.

With regard to the lighting fixtures you may purchase these when same are required. The total cost of the fixtures should not exceed $450.00.\n\nRegarding the necessary alterations to the gas house in order to provide the required accommodation for the lighting plant it is thought that the school authorities should be willing to do most of this work, providing the Department supplies them with the necessary materials.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Plant starts up automatically and carries the load to 90 per cent of its capacity, at which point the 6K.W. Plant starts up automatically and takes over the load and stops the 3K.W. Plant. The 6K.W. Plant carries the load up to its full load rating at which point the 3K.W. Plant is automatically started again and both Plants operate in parallel supplying an output of 9K.W. at 110 Volts.\n\nAs the load is decreased the above method of operation is reversed and the 3K.W. Plant is the last one operating, stopping when the load is decreased to the point where it is economical for the battery to carry it.\n\nFurther if the 3K.W. Plant fails in operation, the 6K.W.

The plant consists of a six Kc W. and a three Kc W. generator, operated automatically in parallel, together with storage battery, fuel tank, etc. The price is $6,375.00 f.o.b., Rupert Island, and the company have been instructed to ship this plant addressed to the Principal and to send the accounts to you in duplicate. These I would ask you to please certify to and forward to the Department on satisfactory installation.\n\nThe company have quoted a price of $350.00 to send a man from Winnipeg to install this plant. This price seems high, and I believe that arrangements could be made with Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward to install same at a much lower figure. I would, therefore, ask you to advise me what this firm would charge for installing the plant complete.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Pitchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.

A.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Lighting Plant-Kuper Island School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 28th ultimo authorizing me to accept the tender of Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward for the wiring of the Kuper Island Indian School, at a price of $2,645.00. Your letter of the 28th with further information has also been received.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the tender for the wiring of the School, as specified, the installation of an electric bell and fire gong system, as well as the installation of the lighting fixtures, was awarded to Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward as directed.\n\nYou also instructed me to purchase the lighting fixtures, the total cost of which should not exceed $450.00. I would, however, point out that in the original tender of Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward, a price of $706.00 was given for the fixtures and installation of the same. The installation cost, however, is now included in the wiring tender, but just how much this will be I do not know, though it would hardly amount to $250.00. However, you have the sketch of the above fixtures which was attached to Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward original tender on 27th September last and I wish you would send it out to me so that I may know just what to purchase.\n\nWith regard to the use of the acetylene gas house for housing the generating plant, some extension will be necessary as the inside dimensions are 11' 10\" square, and the Lister-Bruster Company, of Winnipeg, informed me that to conveniently house the plant a building 13' x 18' is necessary. In the centre of the gas house floor there is a circular pit for the gasometer, 5 feet in diameter, which when closed down is 3 inches above the floor level. Therefore this gasometer will have to be removed and the pit filled up with solid concrete if the full space of this building is to be utilized. The removal of the gasometer may be a difficult job. I would suggest, therefore, that an extension of about 13' x 10' be erected, the engines, dynamo and switchboard being installed in the new section with the water-cooling tanks and storage batteries being housed in the old building, a door connecting the two. A raised plank floor could be made to cover the whole of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthe interior of the present gas house. I have written to the Rev. Principal of the School to see how far he is prepared to go in providing the labor for the extension if the Department supplies the material, and will write you further on this subject as soon as I hear from him. In the meantime please forward the sketch with the lighting fixtures as above requested as it may be necessary to have some of the same brought from the outside.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nJan. 15, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant,\nI am enclosing herewith a sketch of electrical fixtures,\nsubmitted by Messrs.

We are arranging for shipment this week and sending accounts in duplicate to Mr. W. E. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner, Victoria.\n\nNow, with reference to installation. As this installation is in parallel, we believe it would be advisable for you to have one of our experienced men to look after this installation. We cannot hold ourselves responsible on this equipment if it is handled by inexperienced men. We have given you a price of $360.00 to superintend the installation which merely covers the actual expense of our representative in going to this point.\n\nWe should be glad to hear from you on this subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

M. Lister Company of Winnipeg, for the Generating Plant which is to be shipped to Kuper Island direct.\n\nIn connection with the price for installation of this plant it is noted that the Company offered to do this for $350.00, but you seem to think this price is high and have asked me to get a figure from Messrs. Hawkins and Hayward.\n\nMessrs. Hawkins & Hayward have given me a price of $400.00, but in this is included approximately $116.00 for extra wiring from the main transmission line where it enters the building to connect up with the engines, connections to the switch board, conduits, water connections for the cooling tanks, and feed pipes from the gasoline tank on the outside of the building to the engines, which it is thought the Lister people would charge extra for as this Company's catalogue does not show that any of these extra connections are supplied. See page 16 of catalogue. While Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward are the selling agents for the Lister-Bruston Company they have so far had no experience with one of these plants, and do not know, therefore, just how much extra work would have to be undertaken in connection with the installation.\n\nWhile I feel it would be more satisfactory to have one of the Company's men to set up this plant, I think I am safe in saying that extra material would have to be purchased and labor supplied for making the necessary connections between the Generating Plant and the transmission line where it enters the building.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nW.E.

There was a small extra charge of $35.00, which I authorized and this was in connection with the changing of wiring in the dormitories and toilets, including fixtures and lamps.\n\nAttached hereto please find Certificate of the Wiring Inspector of the City of Victoria.\n\nOn the 9th instant I went to Kuper Island to look over the work which has been done so far, and I am pleased to say that the wiring has been a very satisfactory job. The generating plant had just been started and lights were on in the building, though all final adjustments on the switchboard have not been completed but necessarily this will take a few days. It is expected, however, by Monday the Rev. Principal will be able to give a clearance to the representative of the Lister-Brunton people for the generating plant.\n\nThe staff are highly delighted with the change of the new lighting system and it is very much appreciated.\n\nW.I.D./K.D.\n\nEnclosures:-\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| ARTICLES | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------------|---------|\n| Wiring & Power Island Indian School | | |\n| Complete lighting system installation by electric bill of the gang system | | |\n| | | |\n| | | |\n| | | |\n| | | |\n| | | |\n| | | |\n\n**UNDERLINE TENDER ACCEPTED AND SHOW TOTAL VALUE OF ORDER GIVEN EACH FIRM**\n\nDO NOT USE THIS SPACE\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDept. of: [Department]\n\nCity or town: [City]\n\nDate: [Date]\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n| ARTICLES | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------------|---------|\n| Wiring   | Cypress Island       | Indian School |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory or reason given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDept. of: [Department]\n\nDate: [Date]\n\nCity or town: [City/Town]\n\nProvince: [Province]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP.

Father Guerts has called at the Department and strongly recommends that a new steam boiler be provided at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. The Provincial Inspector of Boilers writes in part as follows:-\n\n\"The boiler is too small for its various purposes, and, as it is a lap seam make, the working pressure will probably be further reduced at next inspection. I advise that, instead of repairing this boiler, a larger one about 48\" x 96\" with butt strap seam be installed.\"\n\nFather Guerts explains that steps have not yet been taken to repair the old boiler, and I wish to authorize you now to replace it with a new and larger one. You should make the best possible arrangements and see that there is an early installation.\n\nRev. Father Guerts is being authorized today to secure what materials are necessary to slightly enlarge the boiler room, as recommended by the firm that installs the boiler. The school management will supply the labour in connection with this small addition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E.

Box 666\nVictoria.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Kuper Island Boiler.\n\nRegarding your conversation with our Mr Brinkman yesterday in connection with additional piping etc required for the above over our contract.\n\nThe writer saw Father Gurtz last Sunday in Chemainus and he said that they distinctly understood that the boiler was to be installed complete, and as you know owing to the cramped space inside present boiler house, it was decided to put the new boiler outside and build a new house.\n\nThis naturally makes it necessary to have some extra piping and to connect the blow off valve to a point one foot outside new building. Mr Dackett of the Boiler Inspection Dept asked them when they were going to install a new lubricator to the engine, so it was decided we include that.\n\nThe 24 extra handhole gaskets we have included at their particular request, also the present trap draining coils in drying room is useless and needs to be replaced.\n\nTherefore our price for the extra steam piping, including one 2\" globe valve that is defective, necessary blow off piping to a point one ft outside building, one-1/3 pint Detroit lubricator for engine, 24-4-1/2x2\nHandhole Gaskets, and One 1/2\" Sarco steam trap for drying room coils is $151.00 (One hundred and fifty one dollars) including sending man to install same, exclusive of Govt Sales Tax.\n\nMr Gupta told the writer that he considered the Govt should pay for this, but that in the event of their declining to do so, he would pay for same.\n\nWe are going ahead and will ship this material with the boiler.\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that Mr Peck's Dept in New Westminster approved our design this morning and the boiler is now in hand in the shop.\n\nWe are, yours very truly\n\nVictoria Machinery Depot Co Ltd\n\nE.B.A. Wood\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th July in which you instructed me to purchase a new boiler and fittings for the laundry at the Kuper Island Indian School, I beg to inform you that the same has now been installed. It was necessary to have a boiler manufactured and the Victoria Machinery Depot, of Victoria, were awarded the work after a price had been obtained from this firm which is the only one in Victoria which manufactures boilers. On account of the need for haste it was not deemed in the public interest to apply to outside firms for quotations. The tenders for the work are attached hereto for your information. The total cost is $1,926.64, which includes prepaid freight and inspection charges. The charge for towage may seem high but this was due to the fact that the regular boat of the Coast Steamship Company was laid up and a special tug had to be used.\n\nI am attaching hereto Voucher No. 48-A for $1,926.64 in favor of the Victoria Machinery Depot, Victoria, B.C., and I beg to recommend that the same should be paid.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The repairs and improvements as mentioned by the Inspector are noted.\n\nYou may arrange to have the work mentioned by the Inspector as being required to these boilers carried out. With reference to the return tube boiler, it is noted he states that a Globe stop valve is required on return inlet to boiler, so that system can be closed off in case of pipe breaking.

Regarding the vertical boiler, it is noted that the tubes in head leak slightly and the Inspector recommends that these should be rolled gently.\n\nIf necessary, you may engage the services of an expert to carry out these repairs. All costs should be kept down as low as possible and you should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the repairs. These accounts, you should certify and forward to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos.

I would like to suggest that floor oil be supplied so that all their dormitories could be well oiled, which would not only be a saving in labor but would preserve the floors as well as keep down the dust.

GRAHAM,\nINDIAN AGENT, DUNCAN, B.C., FOR THE MONTH OF\nJANUARY, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KUPER\nISLAND RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe septic sewer system is not working at all satisfactorily. It necessitates the system having to be flushed out which does away with the principle of the system. The overflow pipes which run across the beach into the sea are worn out and full of holes. I would like to suggest that this matter be looked into by an engineer.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nIn my January monthly report on Kuper Island Residential School, I drew the department's attention to the unsatisfactory state of the Septic Tank, which was not working and recommended that an engineer be sent to investigate. But up to the present I have had no reply from the department about this.\n\nOn my last visit to Kuper Island I found that things were getting worse, and that the smell was backing up, with the result that the toilets are anything but sanitary. These toilets at the very best are far from satisfactory, due to poor ventilation, and I cannot see what can be done to improve them as they are now situated. These really should be built out on the wing so as to insure plenty of ventilation. The drainage pipe from the Septic Tank which takes the overflow out into the sea is all broken. The iron pipe having been eaten away by the salt water, should be renewed by vitrified pipe and cement. If something is not done to the Septic Tank system there is soon liable to be an outbreak of some description.\n\nI accompanied Inspector Mr. Barry, and investigated this jointly. I have no doubt that he has reported the matter fully to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nExtract from Report of Mr. Indian Agent Graham, for the month of March, 1931, regarding the KUPER ISLAND INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nSanitary conditions, due to toilets being over-crowded and the septic tank system not working, is far from satisfactory.\nWater Supply. The water is obtained from springs on the hill behind the school. It is forced by a ram into a tank on a hill near the school. There is also a pump which can be connected either to the tank or to the house direct. Although the quantity may be abundant for domestic purposes, I do not consider that the water in the tank would be of much use in fighting a big fire. As the pressure is only 60 lbs., there would not be the slightest use in trying to get it on to the roof. Should that catch fire, I do not believe that anything could possibly save the school. The above mentioned pump and engine are reported to me by the engineer to be WORN OUT.\n\nSanitary Conditions. The toilet accommodation is very limited on both sides. There are only 3 toilets for about 50 boys and only 3 toilets for the same number of girls. Moreover, these toilets are so placed that the ventilation is very bad. The boys' toilets are washed out (Floors) twice a day. Still there is quite a smell. I consider that whether or not the school be enlarged, something should be done as soon as possible to enlarge the space available for toilets, and also to arrange for better ventilation. This can be done fairly easily by breaking through the existing outside wall and building a new set of toilets outside the present building. There ought to be at least twice as many toilets on each side.\n\nWith the above exception, the whole school is in a splendid state of preservation. It is one of the cleanest schools that I have ever seen. It is hard to believe that it has been occupied since 1925. The diningrooms and kitchens are spotless, as is the rest of the interior.\n\nDomestic Science. This has been touched on under Vocational Training. The girls make all their own dresses and make them very well too. I am told that these children are proud of their ability to make their own clothes. Is not this the spirit we wish to cultivate in the girls? I think that the Sisters have done wonders when they have had such poor sewing machines to work with. There is great need for at least SIX NEW SEWING MACHINES. I wish to recommend that these be sanctioned. The Sister in charge of this work has patched up some old machines but they are wrecks.\n\nLaundry. This is in a very satisfactory condition with the exception of the Steam Coil Drying System. The pipes of this are corroded and need renewal as soon as possible. One section has to be cut out now. Each time that they are mended, they burst again. I should recommend that this work be done during the summer vacation.\n\nDrainage. This is to a septic tank. The overflow pipe from this tank goes to the sea. The logs on the beach have smashed the old pipes. Last year, the school repaired these pipes, but they have been again broken this winter.\n\nI think that there is something wrong with the septic tank. The overflow is not all liquid as it ought to be. I consider that the tank should be opened up and an examination made of the interior. With this tank more or less out of commission and the toilet accommodation so inadequate, there is every chance of serious illness breaking out at this school.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am herewith submitting report of School Inspector Barry in regard to his inspection of the Kuper Island Residential School and would draw your attention to his remarks with regard to the toilet accommodation, drying system in the laundry, as well as the apparent necessity for examination of the septic tank and repair to the drain pipes. Some sort of protective measure should be put into effect to prevent the outlet pipes from becoming damaged from floating logs. This latter matter could possibly be attended to by an Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch and I will arrange for this to be done if you wish me to do so. The change in the toilet arrangement at both ends of the building and repairs to the drying closet in the laundry would require the attention of a qualified contractor who possibly might also attend to the septic tank and the drainage system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Webb, District Chief Engineer, and no doubt by this time a copy of the report will have been received by the Bureau's Director, at Ottawa, Mr. Johnson, and is therefore available to the Department. The proposals set out in the report may be adopted for an outlay of approximately $1000.00 and are considered by the engineers to be necessary to alleviate existing unhealthy conditions reported on. It is suggested that the work be undertaken during present periods of extreme low tide, for instance about June 30th or July 13th, in order to keep the cost down, the next recurring low tide period being in December. It is recommended that the Department approve the report and authorize Mr. Webb to proceed with the work suggested by Mr. Warren without delay, if convenient to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

C. WARREN\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJune 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nSewage Disposal System,\nKuper Island School.\n\nIn compliance with your request, I made an inspection of the sewage disposal works of the above mentioned school on June 2nd. The following is the result of my observations in this connection.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nKuper Island School was built about fifteen years ago, is a brick structure and has a population of about 115. It is situated about fifty feet above sea level and at a distance of approximately 200 feet from the beach.\n\nAll drainage water with the exception of that from the roof of the building is intended to pass through a septic tank which has its outlet into the sea.\n\nSEPTIC TANK\n\nI found the septic tank completely filled up with solids, the effluent passing out through an overflow pipe, the outlet pipe solidly obstructed and broken, that portion subject to immersion in sea water, consisting of 4\" steel pipe, being irreparably damaged.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\n759 Hastings St. West,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nThe septic tank presumably has a capacity of 1,300 gallons daily or about 30% of that necessary for the school population under normal conditions.\n\nThere is no ventilating system and the facilities for cleaning are very limited and under present conditions it is impossible for this installation to function as a septic tank.\n\nThe conditions at institutions of this type are abnormal, at certain periods, that is, days when the laundry is in operation the drainage flow is very much in excess of the tank capacity and such flow passes directly through the tank without septicising action. Where such conditions prevail separate drainage systems for laundry water and house waste are preferable.\n\nFor possibly eight months of the year a septic tank is unnecessary at this institution as the drainage may be conveyed directly to the sea. For a period during midsummer, however, when the children bathe in the vicinity of the wharf it is advisable that sewage pass through the septic tank.\n\n**SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS**\n\nThe attached plan shows suggestion for overcoming the defects of the present system, the cost of which is estimated at $988.00.\n\nIt is proposed that a bypass arrangement be provided to carry the sewage directly to the sea during the period September to May, and on laundry days during the intervening period when the hours of bathing may be restricted, thus obviating\nthe necessity for a separate outlet for laundry drainage. A new outlet from the septic tank is necessary as the present one is insufficient in size and is beyond repair. In the construction of the outlet it is proposed to bury the pipe in solid rock as the existing pipe line lying on the surface has been frequently damaged by wave action and broken by heavy bodies coming in contact with it.\n\nA satisfactory cleanout arrangement consisting of inspection chamber and outlets from the several tank chambers has been provided. The present facilities are extremely limited and do not encourage the proper clearing of solids as often as is necessary.\n\nVentilating arrangements which are to be provided are quite essential to ensure proper oxidation of sewage on its passage through the tank and to prevent accumulation of noxious gasses. A vent is also necessary in the main line from the school.\n\nAll of the foregoing suggestions have been incorporated in a general scheme for the improvement of the existing system as shown on the accompanying plan and are recommended as best meeting the needs of the school for the disposal of sewage.\n\nThe installation of the proposed outlet pipe may be most conveniently undertaken during the latter days of June or the middle of July as tides are lowest then. Otherwise some additional expenditure will be incurred in placing the pipe below water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C. Warren\nAsst.

Mr. Webb replies that no funds are on hand for this work and requests the Indian Department to wire $1,000. to his credit at the Bank of Montreal, Hastings Street, Vancouver.\n\nMr. Webb reports that the work will begin immediately.\n\nMr. Warren in his report estimates the cost of the repairs at $988. and states that from the end of June to the middle of July would be the most convenient time to do this work as the tides are then at their lowest.\n\nI shall be obliged if you can arrange to have the advance of $1,000. sent to Mr. Webb as soon as possible.\n\nEncls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Paget]\nChief Accountant.\n\nThe Manager,\nBank of Montreal,\nOttawa.\nKamloops, B.C., June 17th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCowichan Agency Inspection Report No. 1.\n\nKUPER ISLAND RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Agent Graham, I visited and inspected this school. I met the Rev. Father Gurtz, the Principal, who seems most efficient, and I found the school well kept, clean, and the children apparently happy and well cared for. I must, however, say that immediately upon my landing, it was forcibly brought to my attention, the unsanitary and unsatisfactory state of the sewerage disposal. This, apparently, is a septic tank and tile drainage system, which has seemingly gone wrong, possibly through clogging of the tile drains, and consequently leaking on the ground. Anyhow, the sewage is pouring out of the ground and running down into the sea. It smells very badly, and I should think is a serious menace to health. Why this particular form of drainage was installed in the first place, instead of running a pipe directly into the sea, no distance at all, I cannot quite understand, as I should have thought it cheaper in the end, and much more reliable. Possibly, there is some regulation against this, though the Island is some miles from the mainland, and I don't see why. I should therefore recommend that this matter receive immediate attention, and if feasible, the main drainage be piped directly into the sea.\n\nThere were 95 children in residence at the time of my visit. There are only three toilets for the use of the boys, with very poor ventilation. I should suggest, in agreement with the Principal, that toilets for the boys be erected in the form of a lean-to addition to the building, and that where the toilets are now, three showers be installed. The pressure tank cannot be used as the pump is out of order, and is apparently worn out. There is supposed to be 60 pounds pressure for fire fighting purposes, but with this machinery out of order, there is, of course, no use for the hydrants and hose. Everything else in the building seemed in good order. The kitchen, though small was clean. Good work is being done in the Manual training class, though this building is small, having only room for six benches. This school, too could do with a second hand marine engine and quarters for it for instructional purposes. At the time of my visit the children were having fish, potatoes, bread etc., for their midday meal. Cultivation was good and the children getting instruction in farm work and vegetable growing. The local doctor was paying a visit to the school when I was there.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\nVictoria, B.C., June 22nd, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the report of Col. G. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies for British Columbia, dated June 17th.\n\nIn regard to the sewage disposal and other sanitary matters at Kuper Island Indian School, these recommendations have already been covered in the report of Inspector Barry (Schools), dated March 5 and 4, covered by my letter to the Department of June 11th. Inspector Barry also reported upon the low pressure of the water system which has been referred to by Inspector Pragnell. My letter of June 15th also covered a report of the Dominion Water Power Branch which showed the cost of remedial work to be approximately $1000.00.\n\nAs regards the Inspector's proposal that a marine gas engine be supplied for the instruction of pupils of the Kuper Island School, I beg to say that while no report has been received from the Principal in this matter, nevertheless, if the Department is favorable to the suggestion, the matter should be taken up with the Principal when it could be ascertained if the manual training teacher will be competent to give instruction along mechanical lines. No doubt it would be a good thing if such instruction could be given, as the Indians of Cowichan Agency depend largely upon fishing as their means of livelihood and necessarily make use of motor boats, and the idea of instructing the pupils along these lines might prove of great value to them. The kind of engine desired could also be ascertained at the same time and I might say it is quite probable that suitable engine could be purchased in Victoria and sent to the school.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, July 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Pragnell on his inspection of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say, with regard to the sewage disposal and other sanitary matters, that the Dominion Water Power Branch was requested to undertake the work required in carrying out the necessary repairs to the septic tank, and a cheque to the amount of $1,000 has been forwarded to their District Chief Engineer towards the cost. In the report received from the Engineer he estimated the cost of the repairs at $985 and stated that from the end of June to the middle of July would be the most convenient time to do this work, as the tides are then at their lowest.\n\nRegarding the Inspector's report that a marine gas engine is required for the instruction of the pupils, I have to say that we have no funds to provide the cost of supplying this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666, Victoria, B.C.\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nSeptember 24th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nOn visiting Kuper Island Residential School this week with Mr. School Inspector Barry, the Reverend Principal pointed out to me the state of the engine and pump for water purposes in the School. These have got into such a bad state that it is quite impossible to get any pressure at all, and in case of fire, there is no protection at all; and the only water that would be available would be from the gravity tank that is filled by the rain, and this supply is so limited that it would give little or no protection.\n\nThe R. A. Lister Co., have looked into this and stated that they could install a first class automatic system for about $300.\n\nI would certainly like to recommend that something be done in order to give some fire protection for the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

The authorization for an increase of five pupils, from 95 to 100, from October 1st, was given by the Department some short time ago. I am very anxious that this school should be enlarged. It would not be difficult to enlarge each wing of the building. I am also informed by Mr. Indian Agent Graham that there would be little difficulty in finding another 60 children in his Agency. I should like to see accommodation provided for 30 boys and 30 girls in addition to the present 100 authorized.\n\nThis school is a very well administered institution. The building is in excellent condition, and the suggested extension of each wing would make it possible to arrange for proper toilets on the ground level, an increase to the rather small kitchen space, besides providing excellent educational advantages for the children in the Agency who at present are not going to school.\nOttawa, January 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith an account, in duplicate, for $17.35, received from the office of the Chief Inspector of Boilers, Vancouver, B.C., for the cost of inspecting the boiler at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.

Everybody admires it very much. Its colouring harmonises very well with our chapel, and it is very devotional. The frame you put it in is very rich, and quite in keeping with the picture. The only thing that is missing is a little inscription to remind those who will come after us of your kindness. But I will see that is done.\n\nAmong the many favors shown us during your visit here, there is none I appreciate more than the donation of this artistic picture. I cannot find words to adequately express my gratitude for all you have done for our school. Many are the visitors who have come to our school during the summer months. People from all over Canada and even the United States, and they are unanimous in saying that our school is as nice a building as they have seen anywhere.\n\nWith kind regards and sincere wishes,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 6, 1926.\n\nDear Commissioner Ditchburn,\n\nI am inclosing an official letter authorizing the installation of an electric lighting system at the Kuper Island School. Will you kindly take advice on the electrician to be engaged under these instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.R. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nI am returning herewith the personal papers you left with me the other day, regarding the wiring and lighting plant for the Kuper Island Indian School.\n\nIn regard to this matter I might say that the following firms of Victoria, B.C., have been very strongly recommended for any work of this nature:\n\nGrant Electric Company.\nFox & Mainwaring, 615 Fort Street.\nSun Electric Company.\n\n[Signature]\nPrivate Secretary.\nDear Doctor:\n\nI forwarded to you on Monday the tender of Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward, for the wiring and lighting plant for the Kuper Island Indian School. When you wrote to me on this subject the Conservatives held the rein of power, and as Mr. Hayward, of the above mentioned firm is a brother of one of the representatives for Victoria in the local house and a Conservative, I did not think I could go far wrong in asking this firm to tender. On the other hand, Mr. Hawkins has, I believe, identified himself with the Liberals here and so I do not think there will be any objections raised by the politicians to this firm obtaining the work providing you consider the prices right. As stated in my official letter, however, this firm is the biggest electrical one in Victoria and would, I consider, be best qualified to handle a contract such as that under consideration.\n\nI missed your signature on correspondence coming from your office for some time and naturally concluded you were on vacation, which I trust you thoroughly enjoyed and feel improved in health for your rest.\n\nThere has been quite a tangle at Ottawa for some time which undoubtedly tied up departmental business, but now that we shall have a stable government, matters will, no doubt, be carried on in a much more satisfactory manner.\n\nI returned to office at the end of August after my month's rest at Shawnigan Lake and I am pleased to say that I feel much improved as I did nothing else but rest up while there.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, September 29, 1926.\n\nW.R. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nI propose to deal favourably with the tender for lighting Kuper Island School if it is found satisfactory. Stop can this firm be recommended to the Government.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\n(Chge. Dept. of Indian Affairs)\nOttawa, October 16, 1926.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nKindly request the following firms to submit tenders in connection with the wiring and lighting plant for the Kuper Island Indian school:\n\nGrant Electric Company,.............Victoria,\nFox & Mainwaring, 615 Fort Street,..\nSun Electric Company,.................\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n15th November, 1926.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nI am enclosing a letter addressed to Mr. Stewart by Mr. G.H. O'Halloran, regarding the electrical work which is being done at the Kuper Island Indian School.\n\nKindly let me have a report so we may communicate with Mr. O'Halloran. I am, of course, aware of the manner in which the electrical firms were recommended, but would like to have an additional report from you.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nNovember 16, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Pratt.\n\nWith reference to your note of the 15th instant and our telephone conversation on Mr. G.H.O'Halloran's letter, herewith follows a telegram which I would propose to send to Mr. O'Halloran:\u2014\n\nKindly request Grant submit to me earliest possible date prices for electric lighting installation Kuper Island School in accordance with specification prepared by Department here and obtainable from Ditchburn. Prices should be submitted separately for generating outfit and wiring of building.\n\nIf the Grant Electric Company quote a reasonable price for the wiring, they could be allowed to do the work. The reason that we asked for tenders in this matter is that there were three firms that were quoted for patronage. If the Minister o.k.'s this telegram, I will send it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nGrant Electric Co.,  \n1319 Broad St.,  \nCity.\n\nOct. 30th, 1926\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn response to your request we are pleased to quote you on Lister - Bruston Automatic plants for the Kuper Island School, as follows:\n\n1- 3 K.W. 110 Volt Type G. S. Lister-Bruston Automatic Electric Plant.\n\n1- 6 K.W. 110 Volt Type K.S. Lister-Bruston Automatic Electric Plant.\n\n54- cells storage battery 85 ampere hour\n\n1- Switchboard to provide automatic and parallel operation of the above units.\n\nPrice, F.O.B. Winnipeg, Five thousand three hundred and seventy five dollars ($5375.00)\n\nThe above price includes circulating water tanks and gasoline tank. Approximate weight of outfit is 600 lbs.\n\nTerms: 10% cash with order, half cash on delivery balance 60 days from date of shipment, or 10% cash with order, balance sight draft against bill of lading, less 5%.\n\nThe above price does not include any installation charges.\n\nYours truly\n\nHawkins & Hayward\n\nper\n\nAgents for R.A. Lister & Co (Canada) Ltd.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to the matter of obtaining tenders for the lighting plant at the Kuper Island Indian School, I beg to say there seems to be a feeling among the firms who have been asked to quote that Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward have an unfair advantage over them by reason of the fact that as they have been lately appointed the B. C. Agents for the sale of the Lister-Bruston Generating Plants, they have quoted a price and terms on the same to the other tenderers by which the plant will cost them considerably more than Hawkins & Hayward could obtain it for themselves. The price of the plant is $5,375.00, f.o.b. Winnipeg and allowing a discount of only 5%. Mr. Grant, of the Grant Electric Company, one of the proposed tenderers, informed me the other day that he got a figure from the Winnipeg house (at that time there being a B. C. Agent) at the same price, ($5,375.00) less 10% and 5% which would allow of a discount of $776.00 as against $268.75.\n\nJust when Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward were appointed Agents for B. C. I am not certain, but I am very much inclined to the opinion it was after they had put in their first bid. Mr. A.E. Wilson, of 367-19th Avenue West, Vancouver, who is a representative of the R.A. Lister Company of Winnipeg, came to see me last week about the plant and I informed him that I did not like the idea of his appointing as Agent a firm which was in competition with other tenderers, but he stated that any firm could purchase the generating plant from Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward at the same price as Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward, could themselves, and they should have no unfair advantage of the others. Mr. Grant's latter statement, however, would not appear to bear this out. I understood from Mr. Wilson that our Department could purchase the generating plant specified at a much lower price than it could be by any private individual or electrical dealer.\n\nI would therefore suggest, in order that this proposed contract be removed from the realm of complaint, that the Department purchase the generating plant from the Winnipeg house direct, and have it installed by the company's man, the cost of which, I understand, is $2,255.00 and expenses. The specifications covering the same will be added and the local firms asked to tender on the wiring and electric bell system only, the successful one being given the contract for the fixtures and installation of the same.\n\nI am attaching hereto a copy of the letter written by Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward to the Grant Electric Company setting forth the price and terms of payment on the Lister-Bruston Generating Plant which is specified for.\n\nI expect to have all the tenders in the office by Monday, the 15th instant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian Commissioner\nfor B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 19, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nReferring to our previous conversation on the subject of the installation of a lighting plant at Kuper Island, I beg to send herewith a copy of a letter from Indian Commissioner Ditchburn which came to hand yesterday. When the prices come in we can, I think, carry out Mr. Ditchburn's suggestion, that is purchase the generating plant direct. As I pointed out before, the real competition is in the wiring.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOffice of\nThe Minister of the Interior\n\nPERSONAL\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nNovember 19th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. O'Halloran,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant and your telegram of the 17th, with regard to electric lighting installation for the Kuper Island School.\n\nI have carefully noted your remarks. In the past, we have been in the habit of accepting the recommendation of Dr. King for matters of this kind in British Columbia. I have no objection to securing your recommendation of firms to be asked to tender when contracts are to be let, but I would very much object to your proposal in this case\u2014that Mr. Grant prepare his own specifications, then have them approved and thereafter take the matter up with you. Please bear in mind that the Minister is responsible for the running of his Department and while he is generally willing to accept the advice of friends nevertheless it would be an unheard of procedure to allow others to dictate methods of conducting departmental business. This Department has always endeavoured to secure the advice of local friends and then taken such action as was deemed in the best interests of the Department itself.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nC. H.

The specifications for this work were prepared in the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, and the contract for the wiring, etc., was awarded to the lowest tenderer, namely, Hawkins & Hayward.\n\nWith kind regards and best wishes for the coming year, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H.

It has been recommended that the R. A. Lister Company, a responsible concern of Vancouver, be given this business.

It looked to me as if these would not last very long, and will all have to be gone over in the very near future.\n\nI would like to recommend that this work be done as soon as school closes, for the summer vacation, which will be the beginning of June.\n\nIt is quite impossible for me to give any estimate as to what this will cost, to renew or repair, as it is possible that these sections might be taken down and re-threaded, and put together again, or it may mean a complete new set, and this can only be determined by a mechanic when they are taken all apart. I would be glad if the Department would advise me of their desire in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the repairs required to the dryer at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, before the Department can authorize having these repairs carried out, it will be necessary to be advised as to the cost involved. You should arrange to have a competent plumber examine the dryer and furnish an estimate of the cost of any materials and labour required in having the repairs necessary carried out. The plumber engaged to make the estimate should be on the list to receive consideration. The Peterson Hardware Company, Duncan, B.C., installed the automatic pump for fire protection, and it is thought they might be able to report regarding the cost of the repairs required to the dryer. Our funds this year are limited, and only the repairs absolutely necessary at the present time should be considered. When we have the report as to the cost, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH.

He also informed me that he found the last set leaking badly. The cost of installing these would be $200.00 complete.\n\nI would like to recommend that this be done as a patchwork job would only mean further expense. I might add that the Peterson Hardware of this town have no plumber so could not undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\n\n(H.Graham)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the repairs required to the dryer at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, and enclosing a quotation which you received for the installing of the new pipe required.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have the new pipe, etc., required installed in the dryer, at a cost not to exceed the quotation received by you, viz., $200, which includes material and labour.

C.\n\nNovember 24th 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the beginning of 1930 the Department kindly renewed the batteries for our Lighting Plant. The new ones were supplied by the Globelite Co from Winnipeg, and were guaranteed to give at least three years satisfactory service.\n\nFor some reason or other they have not shown up to the mark. Some time ago we had to discard two cells and I am afraid that sooner or later more of the cells will have to follow, which would make it impossible to run the plant under normal conditions.\n\nIn view of this I have put in a claim with the Co. The enclosed answer explains the reason of the short life of these batteries. Besides it contains a most fair proposition for the renewal of the present defective set.\n\nTrusting the Department will give this a favorable consideration and renew the set before it causes any further trouble I beg to remain,\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nOn my last two visits to the Kuper Island Residential School, the Rev. Principal pointed out to me the trouble that he was having with the batteries connected with his lighting plant, which necessitated the running of the engines practically all the time.\n\nI advised him to take the matter up with the people who supply these batteries, which he did, and I am now enclosing their reply, as well as a letter from the Rev. Principal.\n\nI would like to recommend that something be done towards replacing these batteries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Reverend Principal of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, with reference to the batteries in use in connection with the lighting plant, also enclosing a letter which he received from Globelite Batteries, Limited, Winnipeg, regarding the condition of the batteries and quoting their price for installing new ones of a larger capacity.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department has expended a large amount for repairs, etc., at the Kuper Island School during the present fiscal year and there are no funds available to provide new batteries. It is considered that, if the batteries were not overloaded and if they were used for no other purpose than for lighting, they should have lasted longer than three years. Has the Principal been using the lighting equipment in connection with pumping water, for laundry purposes or for the use of any electrical attachments, such as irons, washing machines, etc.? Please state if there is, on the staff of this school, an employee who is competent to manage the lighting plant.\n\nIt is hoped that the present set of batteries can be continued in use for a further period. A note will be made in the Estimates for the next fiscal year to include the amount required to purchase a new set. In the meantime, I regret that, unless absolutely urgent, the Department will be unable to provide new batteries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nINDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\nKUPER ISLAND, B. C. Dec. 19th 1932.\n\nH. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to letter of Department No152-0-5 re new batteries would say that I have a mechanic in charge who previously had experience with electrical sets on boats, and is now making a special study of electricity. 2o- There is no electrical attachments for washing machines. 3o- re pumping water: as we have a ram the electrical pump is very seldom used; and when used, always at such times when there are hardly any lights on and the small engine alone is able to carry the load. As to the pumping for laundry purposes, once every two weeks, most of it is done between 8 and 12 o'clock when practically no lights are used.\n\nFinally I would say that although 2 engines have been installed for the lighting system it almost never occurs that the two are in operation at the same time.\n\nNow as to say that it is absolutely urgent to replace the old set at once this is hard to say. But the fact is that two cells have already been discarded; that a third one, now frequently tested may have to go any time; and how long will the others hold out even an electrician could not give an exact date. But in my humble opinion I think it would be a wise thing to have a new set ready so that in case the old one gives out, we are not left without lights until the new ones arrive.\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nYour No.152-0-5\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to the Department letter of the 9th instant, in connection with the batteries for the lighting plant at Kuper Island Residential School, I forwarded a copy of your letter to the Reverend Principal, and am now enclosing his reply, which answers all questions asked.\n\nFrom what I could see when I was last there the batteries were going down very fast, and it looked to me if something was not done they would soon be without batteries at all. From what I have seen of the man in charge, he is very capable and gives this lighting plant careful attention. I feel sure that it is not his fault the batteries are running down.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 29, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, regarding the supplying of new batteries for the lighting plant at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School and enclosing copy of communication which you received from the Reverend Principal, concerning the replacing of the batteries now in use.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will provide the funds required to supply this new equipment. It is considered that the offer made by the Globelite Batteries, Limited, Winnipeg, to supply a battery of 160 ampere hour capacity, corresponding with their type 56 cell G. D. 13 battery, would be satisfactory. It is noted that, in their communication to the Rev. Principal, dated November 16th, last, which was forwarded under cover of your letter of the 25th of the same month, they quote a net price, less discounts, of $373.80, f. o. b. Winnipeg. Sales Tax of 6% extra, for supplying this battery. You or the Rev. Principal may place an order with the above firm to supply the battery of the type mentioned and at the price quoted by them. This would make the price of the above equipment $373.80 net, plus $22.43 sales tax - a total of $396.23, f. o. b. Winnipeg. The Company should prepay the freight charges from Winnipeg to the School and obtain a receipt for the amount paid. They should be furnished with the necessary shipping directions. Their account, in triplicate, should be forwarded to you, with the receipt for freight charges attached. You will then attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nFor your information, I am returning herewith the communication which the Principal received from the Globelite Batteries, Limited, Winnipeg. When forwarding the account in payment for the new batteries, please attach the letter to it.\n\nIt would appear that the offer made by the above firm would be the best solution in having new batteries supplied. It is presumed the school authorities will be able to install the batteries when they arrive. The purchase and delivery of this equipment should receive early attention, in order that the account can be received in time to be paid before the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nre: Inspection of Boilers, Engine & Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Kuper Is., B.C.\n\nOn August 22nd, 1933, I made an inspection of the mechanical plant of this school, which consists of:\n\nOne Horizontal return tubular Boiler, 66\" in diameter and 12' long, containing fifty 4\" x 12' tubes, No. 22020 B.C., Longitudinal joint treble rivetted lap, rated at 84 H.P., built in 1915 making it now 18 years old.\n\nOne Vertical tubular boiler, 48\" in diameter and 96\" high, containing 127 - 2\" x 72\" tubes, No. 22563 B.C., Longitudinal joint double rivetted butt, rated at 26 H.P., built in 1927, making it now 6 years old.\n\nOne vertical steam engine, 7\" diameter by 8\" stroke, used to operate the Laundry Machinery.\n\nOne double set of Lister Gasoline Engines D.C. to Generators. Engines are of 3 and 6 H.P., Generators are 6 and 12 K.W.\n\nFresh water is supplied to the school from a natural rock spring pumped to a high distributing tank by a Hydraulic Ram. Also there is an auxiliary electric pumping unit to be used in case the ram fails, which I was informed has not yet occurred.\n\nBoiler No. 22563 B.C.\n\nThis is a vertical tubular boiler used for the laundry engine and machines.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found that all the stays, rivets, and plates were in good condition. I then gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 240 lbs. per square inch and found all seams quite tight. Several tubes were leaking on the top plate. These will need re-expanding, which can be done by the staff.\n\nI then checked the safety valve which works freely and blows off at 125 lbs.\n\nInternally this boiler is not in the best of condition owing to the hardness of the feed water. The tubes are very badly scaled and there is quite a lot of loose scale on the top of the lower tube sheet and wet-lags. This must all be removed. Apparently most of this scale came from the tubes around the water line and in the near future many of these tubes will commence to leak as they will be eaten through.\n\nI would recommend that when this boiler is not in operation it be kept empty and when refilled that a strong solution of Sal. Soda be added to the feed water in the proportion of 1/2 lb. Sal. Soda to 1 gallon of clear lime water, each time it is operated. If this should cause a slight foaming of the boiler decrease the amount of soda 25%.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBoiler No. 22563 B.C., Continued.\n\nThe fusible plug must be renewed. The test gauges and water glass are in good condition as well as the main stop valves and blowdown cock and pipes.\n\nThe Steam Gauge is 3 lb. light.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 125 lbs but on account of the tubes, the condition fair.\n\nBoiler No. 22020 B.C.\n\nThis is a horizontal return tubular boiler and is used for heating the School.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found all the rivets and plates in good condition. One of the through stays sounded a little slack and I tightened it. They are all now in good condition.\n\nI then gave it a Hydrostatic Test. Upon reaching 10 lb. the joint between the main stop valve and the boiler blew out. Apparently this has been giving trouble as from appearances the nuts have been tightened before. This will need a new gasket which can be installed by the staff.\n\nThe internal condition of this boiler is very fair. Many of the tubes have scale blisters, but upon removing them there were not any pits showing. From present appearances I do not think that there will be any tube trouble for some time, but on account of the isolated position of this School I would recommend that three bolt tube-stoppers be procured so that if a tube leaks it can be stopped in a few minutes and permanent repairs made during the off season. I would also recommend that a solution of Sal Soda and lime water be added to the feed water in the proportion of 1 lb. sal soda to 5 gallons clear lime water at least twice each firing season.\n\nThe blowdown pipe is getting quite thin and must be renewed next summer.\n\nThe fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nThe safety valves work freely and blow off at 5 lb. pressure. The discharge of these valves is connected to the smoke uptake. This is not a good practice as it corrodes the uptake and also makes it very awkward for the attendant to know when they are blowing off or leaking.\n\nThe test gauge, water gauge, blowdown cock and steam gauge are in good condition.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 5 lbs and condition good. No repairs required to the brickwork or firebars.\nLaundry.\n\nThe steam engine is kept in very good condition. All the bearings are quite tight and in good condition.\n\nThe laundry has two washing machines, one 28\" Hydro extractor, one open-slat wringer. All the machines appear well kept but there should be a pipe guard placed around the belt pulleys and gear of both washing machines and the slat wringer. I pointed this out to the attendant. The materials are at the School so that no expenditure is required and I was promised that it would be done.\n\nThe Lister plant is well kept and is in good condition.\n\nCost Materials Recommended.\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Bolt Tube Stoppers           | 3        | $3.00      | $9.00 |\n| Fusible Plugs                 | 2        | $1.50      | $3.00 |\n| Rubber for Gasket, approximately |        |            | $5.00 |\n\n$17.00\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J.

Please wire instructions.\"\n\nReverend Father Geurts, Principal of the School at Kuper Island succeeded in getting through and has just reported that they had experienced the worst storm in history, and outstanding was the loss of the water tower and tank, which cut off their water supply. There was considerable other damage done, which as yet he is unable to estimate. But as mentioned in my telegram the immediate reconstruction of a tower and tank was necessary to have done without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

It is noted that the water tower and tank were destroyed and considerable other damage incurred.\n\nIn this connection I have to confirm telegram to you dated the 23rd instant, as follows:\n\n\"Proceed with repairs water supply Kuper Island School as per your wire. Materials to be purchased from firms on your approved list. Expenditure to be kept within your estimate.\"\n\nYou should proceed with the reconstruction of the tower and tank, keeping all costs as low as possible, and the total expenditure should not exceed your estimate of approximately $400. This work should be completed and accounts covering the cost of materials and for any outside labour that it is necessary to employ forwarded for payment before the end of the present fiscal year, viz., March 31st next, in order that the cost can be paid from this year's Appropriation. All accounts should be in triplicate and attached to properly certified voucher forms.\n\nThe above is the full amount we can provide towards the cost of repairing any damage to this school during the present fiscal year. If any other work is imperative, it should be carried out by the school authorities at their own expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH.

On the ground floor there are only 3 toilets for about 50 boys, and the same number for the 50 girls. As previously recommended the provision of increased toilet accommodation is to be desired; but I do not believe that any temporary building should be undertaken with a view to the provision of more accommodation. The matter is linked up with the building of additions to each wing of the present school. It is however necessary that the very limited number of toilets now provided are in working order. I am sorry to state that the toilets throughout the building are nearly worn out. Those on the ground floor require renewal AT ONCE. I have to most strongly recommend the provision of SIX NEW TOILET BOWLS, SEATS AND SMALL TANKS - three to be placed on the boys' side and three on the girls' side to take the place of toilet fixtures quite worn out. This is a very urgent matter, and the Indian Agent may have reported on it as he and the Principal were with me when we inspected the present toilet accommodation.\n\nDRAINAGE:\nThe work done in 1931 with respect to the pipe to the sea is giving good service. The drainage, I am informed, is being run directly into the sea below low water mark. It is not being run through the septic tank. If the septic tank is to be used in future it will require to be cleaned out by other than the boys at the school; but I do not believe that the tank need be used as long as the pipe to the sea remains unbroken. The Principal spoke of filling in the present septic tank. This would be a very foolish thing to do, as it may be required in the future. I recommend that this point be taken up in writing to the Principal.\n\nPAINTING:\nThe woodwork of the outside of the school requires to be repainted. This has not been done for 17 or 18 years. The gutters around the roof, particularly in the front of the school require renewal. The present shingles have been on the roof for 18 years. The roof needs to be reshingled at an early date. I would recommend that this work of painting, reshingling the roof, and supplying new gutters be allowed for in the estimates for the year 1935-36.\nOttawa, March 7th, 1934.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Kuper Island Indian Residential School on the 6th and 7th ultimo.\n\nHe states that the toilets throughout the building are nearly worn out and recommends the provision of six new toilet bowls and seats - three to be placed on the boys' side and three on the girls' side. Provided that these can be secured at a cost not exceeding $120.00, you may arrange for their immediate purchase. In the event of your securing them, you should forward the account as soon as possible in order that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nWith reference to the drainage at the school, the Principal informed Mr. Barry that he was considering filling in the present septic tank. Mr. Barry considers this action inadvisable, as it might be required in the future. If you agree in this regard, you should inform the Principal that the septic tank should not be filled in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH.

Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inspection of Boilers & Machinery,\nIndian Residential School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nBoiler No. 22563.\n\nOn August 22nd, 1934, I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found the stays, plates and rivets in a very good condition. The tubes are much better than last year, but the pitting mentioned in my last report, although now stopped, had gone too far and I am afraid that some of the tubes will start leaking soon.\n\nI gave it a Hydrostatic test of 185 lbs. and found some slight leaks on the top tube plate, also one rivet in the bottom seam was showing a slight leak.\n\nI set the safety valves to blow off at 125 lbs., the steam gauge is correct.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 125 lbs. and condition, on account of the tubes, fair.\n\nBoiler No. 22020.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found all tubes, rivets and stays in very fair condition.\n\nThere is a considerable improvement in the condition of this boiler since last year.\n\nI gave it a Hydrostatic test of 25 lbs. and found it perfectly tight. All repairs mentioned in my previous report have been done.\n\nAll blow down pipes must not be allowed to be buried in concrete. The concrete must be cut away and the trench filled with sand, as concrete holds the pipes too solid and the contraction and expansion strains are thrown on the boiler shell.\n\nThe blow down cock must be renewed and removed from its present position and placed as close to the boiler as possible, as in its present position, if the blow down pipe should leak, the boiler would be emptied before any measures could be taken to stop it.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of the engineer, Department of Public Works, Victoria, B. C., on his inspection, in August, last, of the boilers and machinery at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. He reports as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 22563 - The tubes are much better than last year, but the pitting, although now stopped, has gone too far, and the Engineer states he is afraid some of the tubes will start leaking soon. He reports this boiler, on account of the tubes, to be in fair condition only.\n\nBoiler No. 22020 - The Engineer found considerable improvement in the condition of this boiler since last year. He states that all blow-down pipes must not be allowed to be buried in concrete. The concrete should be cut away and the trench filled with sand, as concrete holds the pipe too solid and the contraction and expansion strains are thrown on the boiler shell. The Engineer further recommends that the blow-down cock be renewed, removed from its present position and placed as close to the boiler as possible, as, in its present position, if the blow-down pipe should leak, the boiler would be emptied before any measures could be taken to stop it.\n\nI would request that you bring the recommendations of the Engineer to the attention of the Principal, and he should arrange to have the repairs and alterations mentioned attended to. Any cost should be provided by the school, from per capita grants or other receipts.\n\nRegarding the laundry engine, the Engineer states it is well kept, all bearings are in good condition and the slide valve appears quite tight. The machinery in the laundry is well protected by guards.\n\nThe Department understands that the certificates of inspection of the boilers have been forwarded to the Principal. He should arrange to have them posted in a conspicuous place in the boiler-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH.

The floors of the boys and girls play rooms is completely gone. These floors have apparently been built so close to the ground that there was no ventilation with the result that the sills have all rotted away, and both floors will have to come up and be completely renewed.\n\n2. The Sister in charge of the kitchen complained that the range was far too small, it being only a two oven, and that one oven was almost gone. On examining the same I found that it was so badly bulged that it will not last very much longer, which means that the stove would have to be replaced, and I would like to recommend that a new one be installed, the same to cost about $300.00.\n\n3. On the whole of the second floor, the walls require refacing with kalsomine and the wood-work painted; this work could be done by the school staff, and the material for the same would cost about $100.00.\n\n4. They are very badly off for a large sewing machine. The only one that they have at present, that is of any real value, is a single taylor machine, which is two years old, and then three ordinary machines. As the majority of the work to be done, is all more or less heavy material for boy's overalls, etc., it is too much for the ordinary machines, and the one tayloring machine has to do it all.\n\nI would like to recommend the above improvements be carried out at this school, as they are badly needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

I would request that you give full information regarding the repairs required to the floors of the playrooms. You should state the quantity of materials required, how you would propose having the work carried out, and the approximate cost of material and any outside labour.\n\nWith reference to the kitchen range, you should state the type and size of range required and, if possible, an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe information requested, regarding the floor of the playrooms and the supplying of the kitchen range, should be forwarded after the beginning of the next fiscal year, when certain funds will be available for this school.\n\nAn order is being placed with the Singer Sewing Machine Company, here, to supply, from the nearest branch office to the school, one Tailor's sewing machine, to be shipped to the Principal, Chemainus, B.C., the nearest express office to the school. The account, in triplicate, will be sent you; and, when the machine is received at the school, in good order, you should certify and forward the account to the Department for payment. If possible, the account should reach the Department before March 31st, the end of the present fiscal year, in order that payment can be made from this year's appropriation.\n\nRegarding the kalsomining and painting of the walls and woodwork of the second floor of the building, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, of the paint, kalsomine, etc., required, to an amount not exceeding $100. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

This has not been done for 16 or 19 years. The gutters around the roof require renewal. These should be renewed at the same time that the roof is reshingled. Last year I recommended that the funds necessary for reshingling the roof of the main school be asked for in the 1935-36 estimates. I certainly hope that this has been done, as the matter of reshingling has now become urgent. I would recommend that this very necessary work be done during the summer of 1935, this year. It will be understood that the roof here by the sea has been doing duty for twenty-one years. There is moss on it in a number of places now. I am anxious that damage to the interior of the school be avoided and I am thus recommending this work. The Indian Agent, Mr. Graham, agrees with me I know in this, and I understand he will also report with regard to this matter.\n\nA certain amount of interior painting has been done since my last inspection. Some of the smaller rooms and some of the passage ways have been painted, after the cracks in plaster work have been filled. The work done is excellent. The Principal asks for $100.00 to buy paint so that he can have the remaining passage ways and several of the rooms painted. This does not refer to the dormitories, which should not be so painted. It is necessary to keep the school in good repair and if we can have the cracks in the plaster and a few small holes repaired and the painting of the remainder of the passages and small rooms done at the school at only the cost of the material, I think it would be justifiable to supply the necessary paint on the understanding that the sum of $100.00 was not exceeded.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nKuper Island Residential School\n\n**To:** Reverend J.

Whatever work is done will require the removing of the lockers, etc.\n\nIn regard to the new range required a three oven steam boat French range will cost $285.00, with $20.00 for the coil, and $53.50 for the 100 gallon boiler, plus freight and tax $12.40. In order to get this range in, and make the kitchen serviceable means certain alterations, a partition between the kitchen and the pantry would have to come out, and a few other alterations made, as the present kitchen is far too small and inconvenient, and these alterations would make a tremendous difference to those who have to work there, and I would like to strongly recommend that this be done, at a cost of approximately $125.00.\n\nThis work if done must be started July 1st, so it can be done while the pupils are away on their vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 17, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of renewing the floors in the boys' and girls' playrooms at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School and also the cost of supplying a range and the alterations required to make the kitchen serviceable and to provide space for the new range.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to provide the cost of renewing the floors in the boys' and girls' playrooms. This will be noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nWith regard to the new range, it is noted the type required is a 3-oven steamboat French range, with hot water boiler and coil, and that the cost, including freight, will be approximately $371. The Department would like to have further particulars as to the exact type of range and if you are aware if any firms on the approved list in Victoria or Vancouver handle this equipment. It would be necessary to place the matter before the Honourable the Minister for his approval, and full particulars will be required.\n\nThe Department will approve of the work required, as mentioned by you, to make the kitchen serviceable. It is noted, the partition between the kitchen and the pantry would have to be removed and a few other alterations made and that the cost of the work would be, approximately, $125. You may therefore arrange with the Principal to have the alterations in the kitchen carried out. Any material required should be obtained from firms on the approved list. Accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nKuper Island, B.C., June 20th, 1935\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nIn company with Mr. Agent Graham I inspected the Kuper Island Res. School today.\n\nMr. Graham wrote you on the 10th instant with regard to certain improvements required at this school but the total amount mentioned by him was considerably in excess of the amount provided in this year's appropriation.\n\nI would recommend that Agent Graham be authorized to purchase the new kitchen stove mentioned in his letter, also to authorize him to purchase the material required for the addition to the kitchen. The cost of both these improvements would be less than $400.00. Tell Mr. Graham that Department expects school management to supply the work, which I know they are prepared to do.\n\nIn addition to the above, the floor in the boys' playroom will have to be renewed. If the Department would supply lumber etc. to the value of $286.00, I feel certain that the school staff would do the work. This means a larger expenditure than included in estimates but these improvements are absolutely necessary this year and the above suggestions are the cheapest way to have them done, and if at all possible I would recommend immediate instructions being given Mr. Graham, in order that the school staff can go ahead as soon as the children leave for holidays at the end of this month.\n\nThis school is in good condition. It was erected in 1915 and is in good condition, although the roof will have to be reshingled next year. The interior of the building is also in good shape, the principal having supplied from school funds linoleum for all the halls and rooms. I enclose pictures showing the garden in front of the school towards the ocean. All the flowers are in bloom now and it is a very pleasing sight.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\nA French range of modern design with fuel-saving flue construction. The travel is continued the full length of the ovens at the back, giving from four to eight feet longer travel than the ordinary French range, thus conserving the heat. The top plates are heavy and polished. Ovens are well made and strongly braced to prevent buckling. No dampers in the range to burn out, break or get out of order. The fires are large; the oven door frames, hinges and braces are made of malleable iron.\n\nThis range is made for burning Coal, or Wood and can be supplied with a double iron or brass coil which will give oceans of hot water.\n\nThe Steamboat is made in three sizes.\n\n| Number | Top Surface | SCR 124 | SCR 224 | SCR 324 |\n|--------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|        | Smoke Pipe Collar | 5\"      | 9\"      | 10\"     |\n|        | Oven        | 24x16x22\" | 21x16x22\" | 21x16x22\" |\n|        | Height of legs | 12\"    | 13\"    | 13\"    |\n|        | Width of back shelf | 13\"   | 13\"    | 13\"    |\n|        | Height of back Shelf | 20\"   | 20\"    | 20\"    |\n|        | Shipping weight complete | 1000 Lbs. | 1365 Lbs. | 2000 Lbs. |\n\n(When ordering specify whether right or left hand firebox required, also whether for coal or wood.)\nThe Ruby steel range is a small modern range suited for use in flats where space is a consideration.

The Department will provide the cost of lumber for this purpose, to an amount not exceeding $200.00, and you may arrange for the purchase of same, from firms on the approved list. It might be advisable to consult the Principal concerning the type and quality of flooring required. It is to be distinctly understood, however, that the school staff will carry out all work in connection with the laying of the new floor.\n\nI enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure of $320.00 in the supplying of the lumber to renew the floor in the boys' playroom and to carry out the alterations to the kitchen. You should obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please state, on each copy of your voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3452.\n\nRegarding the range required, you may arrange for the purchase of one Steamboat French Range, with coil and 100 gallon boiler. It is noted, from your letter of May 31st, last, that the cost of the equipment, plus freight, will be $201.00. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure in the purchase of the range. This should be obtained from the firm in Victoria who manufacture the range. When delivery has been made, please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, with receipt attached for any freight charges.

Apparently it does not refer to the range purchased for the Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nThe account for the range reads as follows:\n\n\"3-Oven Steamboat French Range ... $305.00\nHeavy Boiler ... $53.50\nFreight ... $5.20\nLess 2% on $358.50 ... $7.17\nBal. due ... $359.53\"\n\nPayment of $359.53 was made by cheque No. 17310.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nSir:\n\nOn my last monthly visit to Kuper Island Residential School, my attention was drawn by the Reverend Principal, to the state of the shingles on the main building. These are beginning to go very fast; one can see daylight through in many places. On the north side they have become so moss grown that they will be a menace from fire during the dry weather. The gutters around the edge have completely gone, which allows all the water to come down the sides of the building and is beginning to have an effect on the bricks and the cement foundation.\n\nI made provision for these and other improvements in my yearly estimates, and I sincerely trust that the Department is giving this very favourable consideration, for if not eventually the cost will be much greater for repairs, for it will not be long before the roof is leaking so badly it will affect the plaster inside the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 20, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, our appropriation for the next fiscal year has been reduced, and, consequently, it is not possible to provide the total amount requested in your estimates for the roof of the Kuper Island School.\n\nPlease consult the Principal again and report to the Department about the first of April stating what work is absolutely necessary and its approximate cost. On receipt of this information, the Department will be in a position to decide what amount can be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReplying to Departmental letter of February 20th, in connection with mine of the 14th, ultimo, re. certain repairs needed for the roof of Kuper Island Indian Residential School, and in which you state that it is not possible to provide the total amount requested in my estimate.\n\nI might say I visited the school with Mr. School inspector Barry this week and I went into this question very fully with the Principal, and in order to do this work economically it must all be done at one time, as scaffolding for a high building like this must be erected in order to do the work, as it is too high to use ladders and the gutter all around the building must be repaired, as metal gutters were put in originally, and that is rusted through and is leaking very badly all around the building, which is having the effect of cracking the concrete and bricks where it is constantly running down the walls, and if this is not done immediately it will cause a great deal of expense later on, so whatever work is done this Summer, this is most essential. The scaffolding would have to be erected all around the building in order to put in the new gutters and also to do the painting.\n\nOn the west side of the building the shingles are not quite so bad, as on the east side which is very moss grown and is beginning the rot the sheeting to which the shingles are attached, and if this side is not done very soon, it will mean replacing the sheeting, which will add to the cost.\n\nIf it is impossible to provide the full amount applied for to have this work done, I would suggest that the Department give us all that is possible, and we will have the gutter, painting and as much shingling done as possible, the balance then will have to be left until next year, which will mean the heavy extra expense of erecting the scaffolding again to complete the shingling.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, March 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to repairs needed to the roof of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nThe amount of $2,500 will be available for repairs to this roof, and this is the total amount that can be provided during the next fiscal year.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate amount that will be required for material and the kind of material that you consider should be used. You should also give an estimate of the cost of the labour, and state whether or not the school management is in a position to supply any labour without cost to the Department.\n\nOn receipt of your reply, the Department will be in a position to decide where the materials are to be purchased and what labour is to be employed. The work should not be proceeded with until you receive definite authority from us.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\nT. R.

C.\nApril 8th, 1936.\n\nYour No.152-0-5\n\nSir:\n\nHaving further reference to mine of the 20th, of March and your reply of the 27th, re. repairs needed to the roof of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, and in which you advise me that there is $2,500.00 available for repairs to this roof.\n\nI took the matter up with a contractor, but could get nothing definite from him, so went to the school and went into the matter very carefully with the Reverend Principal. He suggested that the Church Authorities had carpenters available that by boarding at the school, we could get the work done very much cheaper, and in this way a lot of the simpler work could be done by the school staff, and in that way save money.\n\nWe would suggest that instead of artificial shingles asked for that No.1, cedar shingles be used, and so by working it in this manner we would both save money, and it would go much further towards finishing the work from the money available than by letting a contract.\n\nIf this meets with the Department's approval, I would suggest that a cheque for $2,500.00 be sent, and I will see that the Department gets satisfactory work done for the money.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n(H.

This school is a government-owned institution and was erected in the year 1916. The roof is badly in need of re-shingling and the gutters require renewal. It has now become urgent that the work be carried out, in order to prevent damage through further leakage.\n\nThe local Indian Agent, Mr. H. Graham, Duncan, B.C., reported that he interviewed the Principal regarding the work required. The Principal suggested to the Agent that the church authorities have carpenters available and that, by boarding them at the school while they are doing the work, it could be carried out very much cheaper, and, in this way, the school staff could assist and perform considerable of the work. The Agent recommends that No. 1 cedar shingles be used. He requests that he be given permission to purchase the shingles and other materials required and arrange with the church authorities for the labour, utilizing the services of their carpenters.\n\nI should be pleased to have your authority to incur an expenditure to the amount of $2,500 for material and labour in repairing the roof and to be advised if it will be satisfactory to utilize the services of the carpenters which the church authorities have available in carrying out the labour.

In regard to tenders for the shingles and other material required for the roof, the following firms may be asked to submit prices:\n\nEnc.\n\nMessrs. Inkster & Thompson, 1 Prideaux Street, Nanaimo, B.C.\n\nMessrs. Central Lumber Co., Milton Street, Nanaimo, B.C.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, May 8th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th ultimo, the Department approves your recommendation regarding the repairs required to the roof of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. You should keep in mind that the amount of $2,500 is all that can be expended this year, and it is hoped that the Principal and yourself will give the work your careful supervision, in order to obtain the best possible value for the amount expended.\n\nIt is noted that the Church authorities will be able to secure carpenters and that the school staff will assist in the work without expense to the Department.\n\nThe usual labour returns, in triplicate, should be kept for the carpenters employed, and, if you require an advance to pay their wages, you should make application, stating the amount you consider necessary. A supply of labour return forms is enclosed.\n\nIn purchasing the shingles and other materials required for the roof, prices should be obtained from the following firms:\n\nMessrs. Inkster & Thompson,\n1 Prideaux St., Nanaimo, B.C.\n\nMessrs. Central Lumber Co.,\nMilton St., Nanaimo, B.C.\n\nPurchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price, but in the event of both firms quoting the same price, the purchase should be divided as evenly as possible.\n\nA certified account, in triplicate, should be forwarded to the Department for payment of the material that you purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of May 8th, in connection with repairs to the Kuper Island Indian Residential School and notifying me that $2500.00 was available for this work, I have had several consultations with the Reverend Principal of the school and staff in regard to getting this work done, and after going into it very closely, they decided that owing to the fact that it is such a high building and the staging had to be built up all the way around, they were afraid that it was really more than they could tackle, as the risk was too great. We then decided to call in Messrs Inkster & Thompson, who are on the approved list, and who are cheaper than the other firm whose name was given me by you, so we have decided to go ahead with the work under Messrs Inkster & Thompson's supervision, that is the most dangerous, and the school representatives will do the remainder.\n\nAs Messrs Inkster & Thompson are doing the most dangerous work on the 5% supervision basis, we figured that this would be cheaper than we could do it ourselves, but the remainder will be carried out under the Reverend Principal's and my own supervision, and I think I can say that we will guarantee to get good value for the money expended, and I hope put the school in very good shape for some years to come.\n\nWe have ordered our material as we are anxious to get it hauled before the school children go home for their vacation on the 26th of June.\n\nTrusting that the Department approve of our action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

They have two large taylor machines and two ordinary machines in good repair, then there are three other machines which Sister assures me are of little or no use. As all the mending and the making of all clothes for the 100 children has to be done on these machines, they find it very difficult to get through the work.\n\nUnder these circumstances I would like to apply for permission to purchase two more machines for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Geurts, covering money he has paid out, as per the receipted accounts attached to the voucher, and I am also enclosing copy of letter from Rev. Geurts.\n\nI may say that when the Auditor was at the school the work was proceeding, and we had no means of paying this except by vouchers to the Department, and Mr. Holmes suggested that Reverend Father Geurts pay them, and take regular receipts, and send them in as I am now doing.\n\nYou will notice that there is a balance according to my figures of $83.59 which I intend to spend on repairs to Fire escapes, also for new screens for the windows around the base of the building, as the windows are for ever getting broken by small stones flying against them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.
