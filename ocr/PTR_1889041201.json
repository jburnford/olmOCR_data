While all would rejoice to know that the former would be our lot, yet we see the hand of warning pointing towards the latter. The pioneers who came here in the early history of this district believed that they would be on or near the site of railway that was then proposed by the Government to be built, stretching from ocean to ocean, and which was believed would bind together in a happy family circle our great Dominion. These noble and worthy settlers, who have proved themselves true and loyal, have braved difficulties and hardships for years, far from the scenes of their birth and the dear near and dear friends, and hope that at no distant day they would reap the reward of their labors. These early years in the settlement of this district were bright and full of hope. The climate was highly invigorating, and the magnificent crops raised each year after proved not only the great fertility of the soil, but also its lasting endurance. This great and fertile belt has been spoken of in nearly every case as the \"Garden of the North.\" The future of this great country could then only be anticipated. Such glorious tidings soon spread abroad, and so year after year saw the settlement advancing, immigrants steadily coming in and pushing up for them the good and comfortable homes, believing that in the near future they would have railway connection with the outer world, thus binding and identifying themselves more closely with the rest of the Dominion. But in the midst of hope comes the news, \"all negotiations for a railway to Prince Albert broken off.\" Many fail to believe that such is the case. They cannot and will not believe that sympathy for those who have been true and loyal to that dear old flag.\n\nThat for a thousand years Has braved the battle and the brass, has already departed, and that a once happy and prosperous settlement is doomed to become depleted and extinct. The few who may now be calling for succor, will be echoed and re-echoed by many of our people for help. Already the cry for food has filled the air, and until business revives and something be done to give employment to many who now have nothing to do, destitution\u2014yes, starvation\u2014must necessarily follow. Those who have saved money must be prepared to meet labor. There are others who have no seed therewith to sow, and those who are in a position to farm on a large and profitable scale must do so, lest their labor will prove in vain, not finding any market to dispose of their produce. There must be a market for all surplus, and that boon can only be conferred on this place by means of railway communication. Being 250 miles or over from any railway station, it would be impossible to export any of the surplus products of the district except at great loss. Many of our people, by their ambition, energy and indomitable perseverance, have made for themselves comfortable homes, and in these homes they have their all, and now must sacrifice their homes and their lands and turn their backs upon what was once one of the most prosperous settlements in the nation. Must perish. The finger of God's ear is raised, and is about to bring good tidings of joy, or will it be\u2014we care not for you, depart from our land? Our situation is a deplorable one, and demands the immediate and urgent consideration of the Government. We trust that some steps will be taken by the Government that will assure us a railroad at no distant date. This community do not desire to be fed year after year on Government (apparently) charity. We believe that the time will come when it will be said that b.o.m will never come until it erect facilities for importing the surplus products of the country to advantage.\n\nDARWIN'S IDEAL.\n\nDarwin's theory of the \"survival of the fittest\" is simply that the weakly die, while the robust and hardy thrive and multiply.
