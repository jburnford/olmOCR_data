Surrounded by a vast agricultural country, the North-West's vast mineral and timber resources is still practically undeveloped. Furthermore, it is sufficiently distant from Winnipeg as to not interfere with the vast grain trade that of embryo Chicago. Its population consists largely of Canada's best sons who, attracted by its many natural advantages and not by the grasping and pampered, interested parties, perpetuated for in advance of civilization into this distant region and never had any reason to regret their choice. The development of the North-West, carried on by our steady and brave pioneers, has led to the establishment of many industrial enterprises, of which probably the most commendable is the Prince Albert Oil Company now placed under the presidency of one of our most prominent business men.\n\nWe have only one mile at present and the satisfaction in the public mind, that with our own hands we destroyed by fire in 1884, the leaving an agricultural community of 3,000 people in a most deplorable condition shows the necessity of the perpetuation of investment of private capital, apart from the indirect benefit which will be derived by every person in the settlement, we have no intention to give up pursuing this scheme, to go back to our farming community and we trust it will meet with their most hearty support, especially as we are informed that many insurance companies can now be obtained advantageously to investors against the fire hazard. A glance at the prospectus prepared by qualified experts should attract the attention of every one of our own but even of outside vigilance.\n\nThe future commercial greatness of this point cannot be disputed. We are in the very heart of Canada's vast domain. Without rekening on our magnificent stretch of water courses,\" we have every reason to hope for almost immediate railway facilities. Besides that main artery from ocean to ocean\u2014the Great Pacific railway, we are also the opposite points at present of the great new projected transcontinental line in which the Grand Trunk, Northern Pacific, the Great Northern, Canadian Pacific, etc., are interested, and Prince Albert may become a capital of magnitude and importance on the line of this great transportation scheme. The realization of these long deferred hopes, and the crown complications will be a just and fitting compensation for the chattering our pioneers have undergone during past years, and at least a continuous and well-deserved prosperity.\n\nWe understand Mr. J. Knowles, banker, is the secretary of the proposed Prince Albert Milling Co., to whom application for shares should be made, and from whom the prospectus can be obtained.\n\nDR. MILLER.\n\nAt the report of the sudden death of Dr. Miller of Prince Albert, W.S., which occurred at Rathtford on Thursday last, as will be seen by our telegraphic news, has caused a most painful feeling here, where the doctor was well known and appreciated. Probably the most intelligent, modest, effective few were more respected than the doctor. He joined the Police in 1874, has been in the service ever since and there is hardly a place in the Northwest where he has not been stationed in the course of his long career. Perfectly unostentatious, in fact rather retiring, though never seldom attracted, but when his services demanded it, and then he rose equal to any emergency. In Prince Albert he will be remembered as one of the bravest, not only of the forces of the Duck Lake fight. Perfectly cool and impassive, he not only stayed in the firing line, but attended to the wounded as they fell, and did it before the enemy then, the circumstance would permit. He escaped without a wound, although a spent bullet was found in his instrument case. In the absence of circumstances, he was always ready to employ his military professional abilities, rarely taking a fee. In many a scattered settlement, many a distant police post, many a lonely station, his name was heard and his advice sought. But Indian before the north will cause undesigned regret, for few men were better known and none will be more missed in the Northwest than Robert Miller.\n\nFOR THE Best Assorted Stock of CONFECTIONERY\n\nGO TO H.

It was up on the 7th of May, on the 13th of May, and again on the 21st of May and checked on the 28th of May.\n\nOn the 24th of June it was shipped to Europe, and on the 29th of June it was landed at Liverpool. It was put in a press of grain containing 84 square yards, and on three days was packed in sacks each containing 100 pounds, and was stored in the yard. The straw was about three feet high, and was well saturated with water. I may mention that the wheat was grown on sandy loam.\n\nRed Fife, grown here on the same soil and was not barrowed, was also tested at the same time. This infer that the Russian wheat is the very wheat required in this country, as the latter is only now just being introduced by its use.\n\nMr. H. H. Hays of Brandon, expects that the Russian wheat supplied to him will be fairly tested, and in his opinion it is superior to any other variety of Red Fife. He wants a large quantity for seeding next year, and says he is willing to pay a premium.\n\nAN INCREDIBLE RARE.\n\nFrom the foregoing testimony it will appear that the Russian wheat has been eminently successful. Summer fruits have been the bane of the North-west farmers for years past, but this has demonstrated that this Russian wheat can stand all that the two governments referred to say about the climate, and that the soil of Manitoba and the Territories will be mouldable, and the expenditure in the establishing of the experimental farm well warranted.\n\nTHE BEST AT THE CENTRAL FARM.\n\nProfessor Sanders has received samples of Mr. Johnson's wheat. The wheat is nice and bright, thoroughly hard and remarkably so plump in the original, but without straw.\n\nAll the seed at the Central farm has been most hardy, and here the Rus- sian wheat, imported from England, stands Red Fife very alongside of it. As it has not been tested through the summer, the yield cannot be included, but it is thought it will be very high. The Russian grain experiment upon come from the Central farm is now at a latitude of 69\u00b0 north of Ottawa.\n\nThere is no need to doubt that Mr. Betts has secured at the great trade sale in Montreal last July the finest stock of Mr. Johnson's wheat ever offered in Prince Albert.\n\nMr. E. J. Cass has purchased and brought here a beautiful double sow pig, bought at the same sale, and has brought into the country. Mr. H. Nelson is also bringing in a fine class sow. Mr. H. Nelson has a fine lot of swine and expects to get some. We shoule well have a hogging this fall.\n\nLOCAL NEWS.\n\nBetts & Gwynne are showing some things quite new in Navy Line Gardiner Street.\n\nWe hear that Mr. Poveshell, former citizen of Regina, has been getting up strong petitions against the enforcement of the game ordinance in the city. We do not want any abolitionists amongst us. We have no local sports to say in the matter.\n\nIt is with deep regret that we have to announce the death of Mr. James Campbell, of the east end, and which will take place on Wednesday last. She leaves behind her a wife and children to mourn her loss. Mr. Campbell has the sympathy of the entire community in his bereavement.\n\nWe see in the Regina news, in another column, that the band boys and citizens of Regina care to have a good band. We think they should have their old bandmaster H. Walker. They offer him a position, but in addition to that, it is only right that the band master should get a situation that affords him time to look after this music.\n\nThe Queen's Jubilee Council of Con- ciliation has been postponed until the 14th of September. This will enable our member Mr. Hughes to attend the meeting as soon as possible after having obtained permission.\n\nMr. Hughes absence at the meeting will be felt by his constituents, as he has been of im- portance since before the Council met.
