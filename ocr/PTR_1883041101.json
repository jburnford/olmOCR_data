MILLER, PROPRIETOR.\nThe Prince Albert Times\n\nWednesday, April 11, 1883\n\nDOMINION LANDS\n\nNo more important measure was ever taken on the part of the government than the passage of the Dominion Lands Act; and there can be no doubt whatever in the statement and consolidation of the Dominion Lands Act. We cannot see why such a bill should have been passed at this juncture. It seems to be somewhat late in the day, but it will do no harm to give an expression of our views on the subject. We believe there are many defects in the law, as it stands at present cannot be gainsaid. Much more consideration should have been given to the question of the Act before its passage into law. We want to say that the Dominion Lands Act is a good law, and we believe the Government is doing its best to see that it is properly carried out. But it seems that the Act has been rushed through without proper consideration.\n\nTO THE ELECTORS\n\nOF THE Electoral District OF LORNE\n\nHaving been requested by a number of friends to offer myself as a candidate for the coming election, I beg respectfully to announce that it is my intention to come forward, and if returned, I pledge myself to do all in my power to further the interests of Prince Albert and vicinity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.
