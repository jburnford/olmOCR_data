Their bill for this item alone will come close to $50,000.00. The initial estimate was about $15,000.00.\n\nEvery attempt has been made to pare expenses and Brothers are being employed wherever possible instead of hiring outside labour. For example, when it was found that the installation of the plumbing by Edmonton contractors would cost about $35,000.00, a Brother was brought from Eastern Canada to do this work instead. Naturally, there will be a great saving on this item.\n\nI have recommended to the Deputy Minister that your Branch be requested to despatch an engineer to this school immediately and to submit a complete report on this project to date.\n\nI have also recommended that when this engineer's report is received, further consideration might be given to providing the extra funds required to complete the school.\n\nMr. Jackson has concurred in these recommendations and I believe he has telephoned you concerning this request.\n\nWould you please, therefore, make the necessary arrangements with regard to this engineer's visit and when he is ready to leave, advise Reverend Father Boulet at the Bishop's Residence, Muleman, Alberta. Father Boulet is the business administrator for the Episcopal Corporation and no doubt can arrange for the transportation of the engineer in to the project.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE       | INVOICE | DEBITS | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Dec. 7th, 1949 | A I2437 |        |         |         |\n|            | Playground Bats, | $1.60 Each.... | $12.80 |         |\n|            | Playground Balls, | $2.20 Each.... | $17.60 |         |\n|            | Football Bladders, | $1.25 Each.... | $10.00 |         |\n|            | Volley Balls, | $7.50 Each.... | $15.00 |         |\n|            | Volleyball Bladders | $1.25 Each.... | $5.00 |         |\n|            | Volley Ball Nets, | $11.20 Each.... | $22.40 |         |\n|            | C.N.X.Ppd.Voucher Attached........... | $3.20 |         |\n|            |          |        |         | $86.00 |\n\nTo: The Principal,\nHay Lakes Ind.Res.School,\nGRIMSHAW, Alberta.........\n**The Sport Shop**\nFrank I.

(RG 10, Volume 6381, file 770-5, part 2)\nCALGARY, Alberta.\nOctober 16, 1950.\n\nO.H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n220 Public Building,\nCALGARY.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Residential School,\nElectoral District of Peace River,\nProvince of Alberta.\n\nThe following report is the result of an inspection made by myself of the above-noted project.\n\nOn arriving at this project I was able to acquire a set of blue prints for the school. Specifications and detail sheets were not available.\n\nConstruction of school throughout was found very satisfactory, and can be classed as better than general construction found today.\n\nThere have been some changes made according to the plan. These changes were made to create more room in some sectors, and less in others. The general outline of the plan however, has not been changed except for the tunnel connecting the boiler room to the chapel. The tunnel has been omitted and the boiler room built adjoining the chapel. Other alterations are as follows:\n\nExtra wall erected in dormitories. This to create a space to serve as cloak rooms. Two rooms added for staff, these are not shown in plan. Some window changes made. Plans call for interior finish of Gyproc or Gypsum Board. This has been changed to 3/8 Plywood.\n\nNot being in possession of specifications I could not say if other materials in the building were in accordance with plan or not. The construction of the building is completed with the exception of some cupboards, and inside trim. I was informed by Father Rainville, who is in charge of construction, that he expected to have the school ready for occupation by the 15th of November.\n\nI inquired as to the amount of materials ordered for this project. I could get no satisfaction concerning this. I was told that all the invoices were kept in McLennan's hands. Apparently plenty of materials were ordered as there is surplus left over. This surplus inventory is attached to this report. I took inventory of all tools and equipment found on the site. This also is attached.\n\nI might add there is still some plumbing and heating installation yet to be completed. This work is awaiting the arrival of plumbers from Edmonton.\n\nFurniture and school supplies are on the site ready for the opening.\n\nI did not make up a material list for the school. This can be done any time if I have the plans and details. As things stand now I cannot discern between materials used in the school and in the Father's residence. The same kind of materials have been used in both. I was informed by Father Rainville that materials for the Rectory were ordered separately. There are no invoices on the site to rectify this. These are also kept in McLennan's hands.\n\nThere are other added units not mentioned on the plans. These consist of a pump house, lighting plant house, and a dam across the river. Details of these units are attached to this report. There are temporary buildings on the site. These will be used for storage purposes during this winter. Details and dimensions of these attached.\n\ncontinued.\nWhile at Hay Lakes, I was shown a progress claim just submitted for payment. One item on this claim was headed, Landscaping. The claim stated Landscaping completed. As I could see no evidence of any Landscaping on the site I asked Father Rainville about this matter. I was informed that Landscaping meant the removing of surplus earth off the site and levelling same. This in my experience does not come under the heading of Landscaping.\n\nI made a survey of the site while there, for drainage purposes. This proved favorable. The instrument showing a good fall from the centre to lower ground level and to the river. I will be drawing a plan of the site and plotting all buildings for future reference.\n\nOn observing the contract price for this school, I see that this price has been exceeded. This I was told by Father Rainville was partially due to the high freight rate to this point. As I stated previously, I did not have detail sheets and specifications or invoices covering materials, without these I cannot state anything in regards to whether uncalled for materials has been used, or quality or price. I am satisfied however, that all materials purchased have been used.\n\nThe barn to be erected has not been started and will not be until spring. As far as I know materials have not been ordered as yet.\n\nMay I suggest that some surplus materials which will not be used or be needed at this project any more, could be used for future construction at other points for example:\n\nFox Lake School. This would mean a saving of freight rates to the amount of $1400 per cwt. from this point compared to $250 from Edmonton.\n\nA full report of staff residence including material list is attached to this report.\nRe: Staff Residence,\nHay Lakes Indian Residential School.\n\nI am given to understand that this building was to be built for a cost of $10,000.00. Attached to this report you will find a complete list of materials used in this building. This list was not prepared by the contractor.\n\nThere was no list available so checking the plans I prepared myself. The amounts were verified by Father Rainville who constructed the building. The prices I quote are taken from standard supply houses in Edmonton at that date. These figures are not meant to be taken as actual prices paid for materials for this building, but to be used as an approximate estimate for same.\n\nThese figures show that materials alone run over contract price. Labor costs of $7,500.00 are additional.\n\nDimensions of this building are 40' x 51' consisting of 13 rooms. This building is heated from the school boiler room. Materials used are same as in school. This includes interior and exterior finish. I might add that the construction of this building is as substantial as in the school. I feel quite justified in saying that all buildings will be warm in winter and cool in summer, as result of construction and insulation methods used. This should result in having minimum fuel costs.\n\nI hope this report is satisfactory to you, and fills your expectations of an inspection. I would have liked to have made a more thorough report on the school itself but I was handicapped by not having all details and specifications at my disposal.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA. H. Albinson\nConstruction Supervisor.\n\nEncls.\n| Item Description                  | Quantity |\n|----------------------------------|----------|\n| 5 gal. cans Tile Cement          | 8        |\n| 5 \" Lino Grip                    | 10       |\n| Ft.

For example there are about 20,000 bricks. Father Rainville tells me there is still a lot to be used in the construction of a boiler, but that there will be a considerable amount left.\n\nThere is also in the neighborhood of 3000 ft of three quarter inch plywood left. I have been told that this is to be used to make cupboards.\n\nA large amount of misc. electrical and plumbing supplies are on hand. Plumbing material consists of unions, elbows, T's, couplings, etc., about 500 pieces. Some of this I am told will be used to complete the project but there will still be a large surplus.\n\nA large amount of stock has been ordered for electrical installation as there is surplus stock of various fixtures left over.\n\nThere is also a surplus of paint, and varnish, approx. 150 gals. The Father tells me that this will be used up to complete Rectory and school, but I cannot see where all this paint will be used, as there is very little left to do, unless another coat is applied to the Rectory.\n\nThere is an amount of fibre water main left over but a lot of it is damaged. There is also pipe of various sizes which I have not stated in the list. This material has been damaged, but can be used for future repairs.\n\nIt appears that enough materials have been brought to the project to complete construction, and also furnish the repairs needed to same for quite some time in the future. I have not taken stock of this, as the materials are too varied and would entail quite some time to complete, but have noticed that the majority of the construction will have spare parts for future use.\n\nThe material list attached to this is other than what I have just stated on this page. The material list itself is surplus apart from these extras.\n| Item Description | Quantity |\n|------------------|----------|\n| Handsaws         | 10       |\n| Hammers          | 16       |\n| Claw Bars        | 4        |\n| Squares          | 3        |\n| Tri-Squares      | 2        |\n| Plane            | 8\"       |\n| Plane            | 45       |\n| Axes             | 3        |\n| Saw Vise         | 1        |\n| Emery (hand Turning) | 1    |\n| Saw Set          | 1        |\n| Adjustable Clamps| 6        |\n| Stillson Pipe Wrench 48\" | 1   |\n| \"                 | 36\"      |\n| \"                 | 24\"      |\n| \"                 | 18\"      |\n| \"                 | 12\"      |\n| \"                 | 10\"      |\n| Chain Pipe Wrench| 1        |\n| Pipe Cutter      | 2        |\n| Bolt Cutter \u00bd inch | 1     |\n| Set Pipe Dies 1 to 11 \u00bc\" | 1   |\n| Sets \" \" 2\"      | 2        |\n| Crescent Wrench 18\" | 1     |\n| Skilsaw 7\" blade | 1        |\n| A.C.

Gasoline\n1 Kitchen Stove\n30 Hammer Handles\n1 Water Pump\n\nEating Equipment\n\nCutlery, Dishes, Cooking Utensils for 40 people.\nDetails of Dam\n\nA dam has been built across the small river flowing by the project. The water from this river is used for all purposes by the school.\n\nAs the depth of the river is very shallow, a dam was constructed to increase this so as to make water pumping easier.\n\nThis dam extends from bank to bank. A distance of 43 feet. Height of dam is 8 feet at each bank diminishing to 7 feet in the centre of the river.\n\nWidth of dam as follows:\n\n4' at the base diminishing to 16\" at the top.\n\nFootings: Width 10 feet. Thickness 2 feet.\n\nMaterials: 400 bags of cement 1 Ton of reinforcing steel.\n\nAt the present moment the water has backed up for three miles. This means a large reservoir of water at a depth of six feet and the width of the river. This river is fed by springs and runs continuously.\n\nOn the water side of the dam dirt has been pushed in by caterpillar to the height of the dam and fifty feet in front.\nTEMPORARY BUILDINGS\n\nTemporary buildings built on the site consist of:\n\n1 Shed 20' x 48' constructed of shiplap and dimension\n1 Shed 28' x 60' \" \" \"\n1 Cookhouse 16' x 36'\n4 Frames for 16 x 16 wall tents.\nThere are two buildings that have been erected on this site to accommodate the project. These buildings to my knowledge are not included in the plan. The original intention being I think to incorporate these units in the main structure.\n\nBuilding No. 1. House for lighting plant erected at a cost of $1800.00 for materials only; plus labour, approx. $600.00. I might point out that this building is constructed in the same manner as the main buildings which in my estimation was not necessary. The following is the detail of construction:\n\nOutside finish: Asbestos siding, paper, shiplap, insulation, shiplap, paper, plywood. This constitutes the walls.\n\nRoof: Asphalt shingles, paper, shiplap.\n\nCeiling: Shiplap paper plywood\n\nFloor: 210 bags of cement used for floor and footings.\n\nDimension of building: 18' x 20'\n\n4 windows, 1 glazed door\n\nBuilding No. 2. This building is covering for a water pump. The water is pumped out of the river and piped to the main building. The pump is installed 18' below ground at water level. The river bottom level is eight feet below this level. Pump is housed by a concrete wall 8\" thick 8' square. This wall extends from ground level to 24' below, with two floors or landings. Top concrete floor is at ground level. The generator is installed on this. The second floor contains nothing, but was created for an air space. The first or bottom floor is where the pump is installed. Below this floor is the well which is fed by the river. The house covering this three storey underground structure is 8' x 8' built from same kind of materials as main buildings, and finished to match. Material used for this building below grounds: 175 bags of cement.\n### MATERIAL LIST FOR RECTORY\n\n| Item                                      | Quantity | Unit   | Description          | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|--------|----------------------|----------|\n| Asphalt Shingles                          | 56 sq.   | $11.00 | per sq.              | $396.00  |\n| Shiplap for roof                          | 3000     | P.B.M.| 65.00 \" M           | 198.00   |\n| Paper for roof                            | 8 Rolls  | 3.00   | \" Roll               | 24.00    |\n| Roof sheathing                            | 1500     | P.B.M.| 65.00 \" M           | 75.00    |\n| Dwarf partition                           | 45       | P.B.M.| 65.00 \" M           | 30.00    |\n| Sub floor in attic                        | 2000     | P.B.M.| 65.00 \" M           | 150.00   |\n| Ceiling joist 2x8                         | 1960     | P.B.M.| 65.00 \" M           | 130.00   |\n| Shiplap on ceiling                        | 2000     | P.B.M.| 65.00 \" M           | 150.00   |\n| Plywood on ceiling                        | 2000     | sq. ft.| .12\" \" Sq.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Surplus Equipment - Hay Lake Residential School\n\nA three kilowatt generating 'Hubert' plant - second hand - was bought from Bruce Robinson, Edmonton, at a cost of $435.00. This was for the work on the Hay Lake school. This has been paid for under one of our previous progress claims.\n\nBruce Robinson will take back this plant on the basis of $1.00 per day rental from the time the plant was purchased. This would make the total fee approximately $300.00, leaving a balance of $135.00 which would be refunded by Bruce Robinson.\n\nMr. J. R. Claveau of Joussard, Alberta, wishes to buy this plant and will pay $200.00 for it. Mr. Claveau had been one of the workmen at the school. As we would profit by approximately $65.00 by selling the plant in this manner, would authority be given for the sale of this plant?\n\nAs Mr. Claveau is anxious to get the plant immediately an answer by return mail would be appreciated very much.\n\nS.

I feel assured that this Official has been amazed at the very conscientious work which has been done there and will corroborate Mr. Knapp's short note which I received from him some time ago. I wish to congratulate you on the very fine work you are doing at Hay Lakes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.\nMajor D.M.

Field Officers were given no responsibility in the erection of this school and I trust you will agree that they should not be involved at this late date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG/lo\nAtt.\n\nc.c. Mr. Knapp\nFort Vermilion, Alberta,\nOctober 26, 1950.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Indian Residential School\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of your letter of October 18th to the Director.\n\nFather Rainville was in to see me a few days ago and showed me a wire he received instructing him to discharge all workmen except one carpenter and wait until Colonel Neary and Bishop Rother have a meeting with the Minister.\n\nThe last progress claim was $25,000.00 over the funds voted. There was an original allotment of $175,000.00. We then got an additional $50,000.00 - making a total of $225,000.00. Since that time, there has been another progress claim for approx. $25,000.00. This claim has now been sent on. Father Rainville informs me he will need a further $12,000.00, as a minimum, to complete the project. He also said that it was absolutely imperative that I put in a favorable report.\n\nI have nothing further to add to my report except that on my last visit to Hay Lakes the Chief served notice to me that within two years he intends to put up a big fight for day schools. In other words, we are going to walk right into a problem.\n\nThe breakdown of the $12,000.00 needed by Father Rainville is as follows:\n\nAll plumbing fixtures have to be connected & the boilers and pipes have to be covered. Lockerbie and Hole have quoted the price of $3,500.00 to complete this work....$3,500.00\nSince the last progress claim, $2,000.00 has been spent in wages. Father Rainville estimates that further wages will have to be paid in the amount of $567.00 per mo. for 2 or 3 mos. in order to build and complete all cupboards & tables throughout the building. There are very few cupboards built to date and no tables.\n\nHe estimates that he needs $3,000.00 for pews in the chapel. If funds for this are not available, wood benches would serve the purpose until such time as funds can be obtained to replace them. These could probably be built for $500.00.\n\nHe further estimates there will be another $2,000.00 needed for incidentals. In other words, he says they will need $12,000.00, in his opinion, to complete the building so that it could be put into operation.\n\nS.C. Knapp\nSuperintendent\n\nSCK/pk\nOffice of the Controller of the Treasury\nPrairie Region\n\n709 McCallum Hill Bldg.,\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nOctober 31, 1950.\n\nFile: 436-25\n\nMr. W. Lauchlan,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Residential School\nHay Lakes, Alberta - La Corporation Episcopale\nCatholique Romaine de Grouard - Contractors\n\nEnclosed is Progress Claim No.7 for $22,840.43 for the above contractor, with the following attachments:\n\nProgress Certificate 3 copies\nStatutory Declaration 3 \"\nTrail Balance 3 \"\nSummary of Payrolls 3 \"\nSummary of Contracts 3 \"\nSummary of Plant Rentals 3 \"\nSummary of Invoices 3 \"\nInvoices & Payrolls 2 \"\nAuditor's Report 3 \"\n\nYou will note that no approval has been received for salaries paid to cook, cook's helper and chore boy, nor is there an Ottawa approval for rental of D4 tractor and dozer at $10.00 per hour.\n\nIt is noted that the Auditor has not yet explained a difference of $29.25 in one of the payrolls included in Claim No.5. He is being asked to explain this difference.\n\nIt is considered that the very small errors in computation of holiday pay on Claim No.5 will not require adjustment.\n\nYou will note that expenditure included in this claim exceeds the amount authorized by $26,442.15.\n\nMr. Butchart has advised me that Mr. A.H. Albinson has recently been appointed Construction Supervisor for the Indian Affairs Branch in the Alberta region. Mr. Albinson recently made a trip to the project site and I have received a copy of his report to Mr. G.H. Goderham, Regional Supervisor at Calgary. It is rather unfortunate that Mr. Albinson did not contact Auditor Butchart at No. 1 Credit Foncier Building, Edmonton, before making the trip as there are matters in connection with surplus material which might have been discussed to good advantage. Mr. Butchart will try to get in touch with Mr. Albinson now so that they may arrive at a solution to the problem of segregating materials used on the construction of the school and on the staff residence.\n\nSubject to the above remarks and those in the Auditor's report, payment of this claim is approved in the amount of $22,840.43.\n\nH.G. Charlton\nRegional Administrator.\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Hay Lake Indian Residential School\n\nI regret the delay in replying to your letter of August 9th regarding our Voucher No. 230 covering air transportation of equipment to the Hay Lake school. It took me some time to look into the matter.\n\nThe charge of $192.00 was a legitimate charge, and the cost involved the transportation of equipment only.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of Associated Airways' bill sent to La Corporation Episcopale D.R. de Grouard which shows the transportation of the passengers. This bill is in the amount of $343.50. Associated Airways account erroneously listed 'passengers and cargo' whereas the bill should have shown only cargo (that is, the bill covered by our Voucher No. 230). You will note from the amount on the bill charged to the Corporation for the passengers that they absorbed the ferry charges.\n\nUnder these circumstances I request that the Voucher be passed for payment.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6381, file 770-5, part 2)\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF\n\nHAY LAKES INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe following is a report of my inspection trip to the above building at Hay Lakes, Alta., on the 30th of September and the 1st of October, 1950.\n\n2. The main building has been completed with the exception of a very few minor details. The construction, workmanship and finish of the building in every way is very good and the general appearance both inside and outside would not be out of place in any community.\n\n3. At one time it was proposed that the Boiler Room and electrical equipment be housed in a separate building 60 feet away from the main building. It was later decided to erect the Boiler Room adjacent to the rear wall of the Chapel portion of the main building. The construction of this was started early this summer and has been completed with the exception of a few minor details.\n\n4. The exceptions to a completed building consist of the placing of several water closets and lavatory basins, the connecting up of a few radiators, the domestic hot water heater and tank to be connected together and the insulating covering to be applied to the two floor, domestic hot water heater and tank and piping in Boiler room. Arrangements have been made with the firm of Lockerbie and Hole, heating contractors, Edmonton, to fly two men to Hay Lakes to complete the remaining plumbing and heating work.\n\n5. A small amount of wood base, and a few doors are yet to be installed and small odds of painting which could not be done properly with the gun method has yet to be attended to. Exterior concrete steps are under construction from Boiler Room to grade level. Large double doors are yet to be installed. Also doors between Boiler Room and Laundry.\n\n6. All concrete walls of basement have been furred, insulated and plywood covered with exception of laundry and future steam room. All concrete floors in basement with the exception of the above mentioned two rooms have been covered with mastic tile flooring. The first and second floors are entirely covered with linoleum. The addition of a canopy with stairs to same has been added in the Chapel. The erection of a fair sized covered veranda has been added at front entrance to the building. Fire protection system of water supply and hose racks installed at strategic position has been installed. Also an electrical fire alarm system throughout the building. Galvanized iron gutters and rain water leaders have been installed. All the above mentioned work was not indicated on the plans furnished by this office.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6381, file 770-5, part 2)\n7. In report of inspection trip during January 1950 it was noted that the two classroom ends of the main building had been increased in width to line with main walls of building. It was also noted that a few iron pipe posts had been substituted for wood posts as plan originally called for. It should be noted that during the period of inspection trips approximately thirty free standing wood posts had been removed and replaced by iron pipe posts.\n\n8. The electrical generating equipment has been housed in a separate building one hundred feet to the rear of the main building. The building is 18 feet x 21 feet of frame construction corresponding to the main building. This was erected during the summer.\n\n9. A small building 10 feet square has been built over the well and motorized pump for water supply to the buildings.\n\n10. A small concrete dam has been erected across the stream of water so as to raise the water level a few feet to assure adequate water supply during the winter months.\n\n11. A residence building for the Fathers and male help is now under construction and should be finished shortly. Most of the interior partition work is in, some of the plumbing and electrical work installed and all exterior painting and some of the interior painting is completed.\n\n12. Photographs of the various buildings were taken and as soon as prints are available will be forwarded.\n\nRobert Thornton.\nMEMORANDUM TO B.F. NEARY, ESQ.\n\nRe: Construction Equipment Bay Lakes Indian Residential School.\n\nThe proposition advanced by Superintendent Knapp regarding disposal of a 3KW generating set used during construction at the above, and forwarded to this office with your memorandum of October 25th has been studied.\n\nIt is not clear just what Mr. Knapp has in mind, but he should be informed that no officer of the Department has any authority to dispose of materials or equipment purchased from funds advanced to the Oblate Fathers for construction purposes.\n\nThe opinion is advanced, however, that since J.M. Claveau of Jourard has made an offer of $200.00 for the plant, Father Beaudet who is the responsible officer for the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Grouard, might sell the unit to Mr. Claveau at a price not less than the offer, and furnish the Audit Supervisor with a credit note in that amount, and a letter of explanation.\n\nOur Chief Treasury Officer made the same suggestion when contacted.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nChief, Engineering and Construction Service.\nOctober 6th, 1950.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.,\nBishop's Residence,\nMcLennan, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Beuglet:\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Residential School\n\nI desire to refer to my letters of September 11th and September 23rd in connection with the expenditures incurred in the erection of the above school.\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer has now received a letter from Mr. H.G. Charlton, Regional Administrator, in which he points out that the payments already authorized are as follows:\n\nFiscal year 1948-49 - $59,918.78\nFiscal year 1949-50 - $36,983.32\nFiscal year 1950-51 - $11,302.77\n- $37,167.67\n- $68,504.88\n- $12,767.31\n\nTOTAL - $226,744.73\n\nYou will, therefore, note that the figures which are given in our two preceding letters mentioned above are incorrect. As you have previously been informed, the amount authorized for this building was $225,000.00. I have been informed by the Director that this sum cannot be exceeded.\nPlease advise Bishop Routhier immediately, as when he visited the Department recently he was under the impression that the cost of the building would not exceed $225,000.00. From these revised figures from the Chief Treasury Officer, it seems evident that the expenditure of $59,000.00 for the fiscal year 1948-49 has been previously overlooked, but it is definitely a part of the total cost of the building, which as I advised you previously, is not to exceed $225,000.00.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMr. H.G. Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nLa Corporation Episcopale\nCatholique Romaine de Grouard\nHay Lakes Project\n\nI have just returned from a trip to the site of the project. The bursar of the Corporation had arranged for a trip of inspection and to arrange for final details, and I took advantage of the plane charter.\n\nThe trip was disappointing in one respect, in that the project is not as near completion as I had been led to believe. As you are, I think, aware, communication between the site and outside points is almost non-existent, particularly in the summer. What little news had trickled out gave the impression that the building was nearly completed some weeks ago, and should have been completed by this time.\n\nI found that, although the main structure is up, there is a very considerable amount of finishing work to be done, the following being the main points yet to be carried out:\n\n1. Practically all cupboard and shelf work, including the kitchen and pantries.\n\n2. A good number of plumbing fixtures yet to be installed.\n\n3. Ceiling and walls of boiler-room to be lined with Gyproc board.\n\n4. Install a high pressure boiler for laundry \u2014 this includes \"brick-laying\" of boiler and is quite an extensive job.\n\n5. Put finishing coat on outer walls of basement and fireproof stair wells.\n\n6. Considerable levelling and moving of dirt on grounds.\n\n7. Building a dam for water supply.\n\n8. Install some doors.\n\nFather Rainville, Superintendent on the project, expects to employ a full crew for two weeks or more and the services of three or four carpenters for about three months. It looks as though this work may drag out into 1951.\n\nI was not, of course, able to take inventory of materials left over as much of the remaining part will be used. Also, small tools were scattered all over the project.\nHowever, on the whole I believe the trip worthwhile, as I was able to check the payrolls for the separate contract for building a Rectory, examine the School payroll, and also able to examine the Rectory quite thoroughly, so that it may be possible to come at least very close to verifying what materials went into its construction and what, if any, came from the supplies purchased for the School.\n\nI made quite a thorough examination of the School building, checked on major items of equipment, and discussed with officials of the Institution and the Indian Superintendent the final disposal of tools, materials and equipment. I have also now a very clear idea of what to expect regarding the building of the dam, boiler installation, etc.\n\nAs the claim had not been prepared as yet, and as the Bursar was visiting several church locations on his return journey and was not sure when he would arrive at McLennan, I returned directly to Edmonton. I expect to leave here tomorrow night for McLennan. Mr. Villeneuve will likely accompany me so that we can complete the liquidation audit as far as possible.\n\nI expect to re-visit the site, probably early in November, when the road should be frozen sufficiently to allow car travel. Mr. Knapp, Indian Superintendent expects to go about that time. I should then be able to complete the necessary inventories.\n\nW.R. Butchart,\nAudit Supervisor.\nOctober 25th, 1950\n\nDept.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School - Bay Lakes\n\nOn the fifteenth of September Bishop Rothier, Father Benglet, Mr. W. H. Butchart and I flew into Bay Lakes with the intentions of taking inventory and having the school turned over to the Department. However, there was about three weeks' work to complete the school.\n\nEverything inside was finished except for the cupboards and connecting the water supply system. A dam will have to be built across the river for the latter.\n\nThe Fathers' residence is 75% completed but I notice that a considerable amount of the materials left over from the school have been used on this building. As the Fathers' residence was a firm price contract, the school should be credited with these materials and the Corporation B\u00e9n\u00e9fique C.R. de Grouard should be debited with the materials they used.\n\nThe finishing of the concrete on the outside was discussed. This would cost a fair amount of money. As the contract has already gone over the allotted amount, do you approve of finishing the concrete wall on the outside with a cement plaster? I understand that Bishop Rothier will be visiting you in the near future and you may be able to discuss this point with him.\nBarn:\n\nApparently, it will be physically impossible to complete the barn by December 31st. In fact, it will be impossible to pour the cement this fall if they are to complete the school and the Fathers' residence. I have therefore asked Father Beuglet to order all the necessary materials and have them freighted in so that we can ask for a re-vote of the balance that will be necessary for the labor in erecting the barn. Please advise us if this arrangement is satisfactory.\n\nStaff:\n\nBishop Rothier hopes to get three or four Sisters in to get the school ready by the beginning of next month. I very much doubt whether the school will be operating before some time in November at the earliest.\n\nLighting Plant:\n\nThe Corporation has rented a small auxiliary lighting plant from Bruce Robinson Electric. This would be suitable for an emergency plant. At the present time there is only one plant in the school and as the heating system is completely dependent on electricity and if this plant became unserviceable, there would be no way of getting heat to the dormitories and classrooms. As Bay Lakes is such an isolated district, I believe the Department should purchase this plant (and change the generator at a cost of about $100.00) as a safety measure. Mr. Butchart, the auditor, took the details of the plant and we could contact him if you feel we should acquire this plant.\n\nI may add that all the children are very anxious to go to school and I do not anticipate any problem in getting them to attend.\n\nMr. Butchart and I intend to go into Bay Lakes when the first snow falls and we can drive over the winter road. We will be going to take inventory and take over the school.\n\nS. C. Knapp,\nSuperintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.,\nBishop's Residence,\nMcLennan, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Beuglet:\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Residential School\n\nWe have your telegrams of the 19th, 20th and 21st instant with reference to the above school. We are somewhat disturbed by the intimations contained in your messages to the effect that the amount of the expenditures which we quoted appear smaller than you anticipated.\n\nThe only explanation of the matter that we can visualize is that we have not received all the Progress Payments for work done, and consequently, expenditures that may have been incurred are not yet shown in our books because cheque has not been issued. The last request for payment which we have received is Progress Payment #6 in an amount of $12,767.31. This Progress Payment was received early in August.\n\nWith regard to the erection of the staff building at a cost of $10,000.00 and the barn at a cost of $15,000.00 or a total of $25,000.00, we have only received Progress Payment #1 in an amount of $10,801.59.\n\nOn receipt of this letter you should let us know by telegram if the above Progress Payments are the last that have been prepared. If so, we presume that a further Progress Payment is in the course of preparation for approximately $15,000.00, to pay all...\noutstanding wages and accounts to this date. You should also confirm our opinion in the latter regard when sending your wire.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

In addition, we provided an extra of $50,000.00 for the additional costs that it was understood would be incurred. This makes a total of $225,000.00. The expenditure to date has been as follows:\n\n1949-50 fiscal year - $161,124.53\n1950-51 fiscal year - $23,568.90\n\n$184,693.43\n\nI bring this matter to your attention at the present time in order to point out that the amount provided must not be exceeded.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have also provided in the current year's appropriation $25,000.00. This amount covers the erection of the staff building at a cost of $10,000.00 and the barn at a cost of $15,000.00. Authority for this expenditure was contained in P.C. 21/1188 dated March 8th, 1950.

B. Rainville, who has succeeded Mr. Verret in charge of the completion of the school. I may say that Mr. Verret was paid $550.00 a month. At the expiration of his contract, it was thought advisable not to renew same and have Father Rainville in charge of the completion of the school, as the services of a qualified engineer were no longer required. By so doing, an amount of $200.00 per month would be saved. When the question came up to decide on a salary for Father Rainville, the matter was discussed with the two auditors. They suggested that a salary of $350.00 a month with board would be the minimum rate of wages in line with labour conditions.\n\nItem No. 4 concerns the purchasing of a cement mixer at a cost of $739.26. Same was purchased and paid for by La Corporation Episcopale C.R. de Grouard. We wish to have this expense reimbursed by the Department as it will remain their property. No rental has been charged for this machine, it being considered as belonging to the Department.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing explanations are satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

In view of the information contained in your letter, we agree with you that there was no necessity for shipping the equipment by air. However, we are prepared to pay the transportation of equipment this time with the distinct understanding that the Principal will not transport other equipment by air without first receiving departmental authority. We do not pay transportation for passengers, and consequently, the account should be reduced by the amount charged for the passengers who evidently were on the trip.\n\nWe have also received your letter of July 19th enclosing application for approval of certain items in connection with the construction of the school. For your information I enclose a copy of a letter which has been forwarded to Rev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I., and when he replies we will decide what items on the application can be approved.\n\nBernard F.

Beuglet, O.M.I.,\nBishop's Residence,\nMcLennan, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Beuglet:\n\nHey Lakes Residential School\n\nIndian Superintendent Knapp has forwarded to us Application #4 for approval of certain expenditures in connection with the above school.\n\nItem #1 requests approval for the salary of $350.00 a month with board for Rev. B. Rainville, who has succeeded Mr. Verret in charge of the completion of the school. The information received by us when construction of the school commenced, indicated that Mr. Verret was a qualified engineer and for that reason we approved the salary which was allowed to him. However, the same reasons do not apply in the case of Father Rainville, and we feel that he should be satisfied with a much smaller salary.\n\nItem #4 requests us to purchase a cement mixer at a cost of $739.80.

The\nnotes on the individual items are as follows:\n\n1) Salary of Superintendent: The salary to Father\nRainville is a legitimate charge. He has had con-\nsiderable building experience, is a very energetic\nman, and gives generously of his time. In all, he\nis a very capable building superintendent.\n\n2) Painting Sub-Contract: I think Father Rainville\nobtained a very reasonable sub-contract for this.\nAt Treaty time when I inspected the school, the\npainting had just been finished. The painter seems\nto have done a very good job and when one considers\nthe cost of transporting his equipment and the paint,\nthe price appears very reasonable.\n\n3) Salary of Cook, Cook's Helper, and Chore Boy:\nThese appear to me to be legitimate camp expenses.\n\n4) Purchase of Cement Mixer: This Agency has been in\ngreat need of a cement mixer for some time. The cement\nfor the school at Upper Hay River had to be mixed by\nhand as we could not borrow a cement mixer. This, as\nyou know, is a costly process. I would strongly sug-\ngest that the cement mixer be turned over to this Agency\nat the completion of the contract. We would then be in\na position to send it out to any Government job in this\nAgency when required. At some future date we may be\nbuilding schools elsewhere. I would therefore recommend\nthe purchase of this piece of equipment on the under-\nstanding that at the completion of this work it would be-\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School -\nHay Lakes, Alberta.\n\nAttached hereto is an invoice from the Associated Airways for freight flown into Hay Lakes. This invoice is under date of June 8th.\n\nYou will note that the freight consisted of stoves, sewing machines, food grinder, file cabinet, parts and teachers desks. Father Rainville said that the teachers' desks would have fallen to pieces if they were carried over the roads. Experience has proved that the Hudson's Bay Company and Mr. George Clarke of Hay Lakes have taken many types of fragile equipment over this road in wagons.\n\nI do not believe there was any justification in freighting this equipment into Hay Lakes by plane. I believe that if the freighter had been given a slightly higher rate with the understanding he was to be very careful with the goods, the whole amount could have been shipped in by wagon for half the price.\n\nFather Rainville did not request authority to fly this equipment into Hay Lakes. There is nothing we can do now but pay the bill but a letter to Father Rainville pointing out that air transportation should be used only in an emergency may be appropriate at this point.\n\nS. C.

The time charged for the use of the truck would not appear to be excessive, although time records were not available.\n\nSUBCONTRACTS\n\nApproval has been applied for in the case of the subcontract to Mr. G. Dumas for interior painting. Advice from the Indian Superintendent indicated that the price was very reasonable for the work done.\n\nMATERIALS AND EXPENSES\n\nAll invoices have been checked in detail and with the exceptions following, have been passed for payment.\n\nInvoice 6/36 - Maple Leaf Petroleum Co. - $501.93 - has been passed conditional to further clarification as to the use of this fuel. If necessary, correction will be made on future claims.\n\nInvoice 6/38 - Doucet Bros. - $259.87 - has been passed under the same conditions as for 6/36.\n\nThe following corrections of invoices on previous claims have been made as below:\n\nInvoice 5/37 - Bruce Robinson Electric - corrected by Invoice 6/10.\n\nInvoice 5/27 - Hayward Builders' Supplies - corrected by Invoice 6/4.\n\nThe contractor was again requested to make attempts to obtain corrections on other vouchers attached to previous claims.\nINSURANCE ON BUILDINGS\n\nAdditional insurance was secured by the Corporation on the School building.

The total insurance now in force amounts to $275,000.00.\n\nGENERAL\n\nAccording to information received from employees recently returned from the site, the school building was near completion, but a considerable amount of work was required to complete the boiler house.\n\nThe total amount now claimed is in excess of the authorized $225,000.00, and this claim is passed for payment on condition that funds are authorized sufficient to cover it.\n\nSubject to the foregoing remarks, Claim No. 6 has been certified.\n\nW.

I advised Mr. Buck by wire that complications have arisen which will no doubt delay an appointment to this position. If you have not already done so, it is suggested that he be advised of the fact that there is a D.P.W. Engineer at Hay River, whose services might be loaned for this work.\n\nG.H.

Neary  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am very sorry to be so late in replying to this letter, the reason is that we have no mail service in Hay Lakes and then we have to depend on occasions to receive and send letters. Moreover at the time of the break-up in the Spring there is nobody to move in this country, the trails are too bad.\n\nThe reason why I bought the window shades from Blowey-Henry is because this Firm was able to give an immediate delivery on these items. On the other hand Marshall Wells could not give any definite date on delivery; and as you remember at the time I was purchasing those goods, I was organizing the last winter shipment going North. Otherwise I would have had to ship these by plane which is very expensive.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. B. Rainville, O.M.I.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe: Construction of Staff Residence and Barn at Hay Lakes, Alberta, Order-In-Council P.C. 21/1188 March 8th, 1950\n\nOn March 31, 1950, Progress Payment No. 1 in the amount of $12,001.17 was forwarded to you, but cheque has not reached us as yet. I would appreciate your letting me know the reason why this was not paid. If this Progress Payment is not in order, please let me know and I shall endeavour to straighten matters.\n\nSince then, I have purchased other building materials, and the firms are requesting payment. If the above amount was paid, this would enable me to remit to the suppliers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L. Beuglet O.M.I.\nJuly 4th, 1950.\n\nMr. S.C.

Your File 147-6-3\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th ultimo reporting on your recent inspection of the above school, and we have noted the progress that is being made.\n\nWe hope to be in a position to appoint a Work Supervisor at this school in the near future.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Indian Residential School,\nFort Vermilion Indian Agency.\n\nAt Treaty time I made an inspection of\nthe Residential School now under construction at Hay\nLakes.\n\nAll the partitions were up and the inside\nwalls painted. The carpenters were in the process of\nputting on the window facings and baseboards.\n\nThe plumbing is installed with the exception\nof the steel radiators which were taken outside to be\npainted. The electric wiring is finished except for\nthe connection of the fixtures. Much of the equipment\nis in place ready for use.\n\nThe house for the electric light plant has\nnot been built but the plant is on hand. The floor\nof the boiler house has been poured and they are ready\nto proceed with the erection of this building. The base-\nment of the house for the Fathers has been poured. As\nfar as I can ascertain, little work has been done on the\nbarn. However, I think we are safe in saying that the\nschool will be ready for the children on September 1st.\n\nWith regard to the final progress claim\npayment: The account now stands at $214,953.29. The\ntotal amount authorized is $225,000 for the school alone.\nI understand from the contract that final payment will\nnot be made until the building is completed, examined by\nan engineer and the contract closed. Therefore, I would recommend that a Government Engineer inspect the school to see that it meets the contract specifications before payment of the final progress claim is made. Mr. Walreth, an engineer of the Department of Public Works, is now stationed at Lower Hay River, N.W.T., and would be the engineer nearest to Hay Lakes.\n\nI do not anticipate much trouble in getting the children to school.\n\nS.

It is presumed that Marshall-wells Alberta Company did not have the quality of shades required, or possibly could not make delivery in time. In any event, the question has been asked why the purchase was made of the higher priced shades.\n\nI.........\nI should like this information, as soon as possible in order that the invoices may be placed in line for settlement.\n\nH. E. Reaume,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nHay Lakes Residential School\n\nI have noted your memorandum of May 6, and hope that there is not too much delay in the sending in of a Clerk of the Works for this project.\n\nThe Auditors would be most unlikely to authorize another Progress Payment on this project unless we have an official supervising the two contracts.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nColonel Neary\n\nFollowing a discussion with Mr. Buck, regarding the subject of the attached memorandum to the Deputy Minister, it was decided to explore the possibility of sending a member of the staff, if possible, the Supervisor of Construction, Grade 2, at Calgary, to undertake this work. Consequently, no action is being taken until Mr. Buck returns from the West.\n\nD.M.M.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Indian Residential School,\nElectoral District of Peace River,\nProvince of Alberta.\n\nWe have now two separate contracts with the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Grouard in connection with the erection of a residential school at Hay Lakes, Alberta. These are:\n\n(1) A Cost Contract for the erection of the Residential School.\n\n(2) A Flat Price Contract in the amount of $25,000.00 for the erection of a staff residence and a barn.\n\nI previously recommended to the Minister of Mines and Resources that a Clerk of Works be appointed to supervise the use of materials in the building referred to in Item No. 2, and to report to the Department on the progress being made in its erection. No action was taken at that time but I feel that this matter should be again reviewed.\n\nThe Regional Treasury Officer has strongly recommended the appointment of a Clerk of Works and the Chief Treasury Officer of this Branch has concurred in this recommendation. I also feel that it is unfair to request our Indian Superintendent at Fort Vermilion to certify the progress payments now that two separate contracts are involved.\nI would, therefore, again recommend that action be taken immediately to appoint a Clerk of Works for this project for the months of May, June, July, August and September, at least. We would require a man who has had considerable experience in frame building and who understands the uses of various building materials. Normally, the Department of Public Works secures the services of retired contractors or foremen-carpenters. It should be possible to hire such a man in the federal constituency involved. The suggested wage would be $150.00 per month, chargeable to the contract.\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: Citizenship and Immigration\nBRANCH: Indian Affairs\nDATE: 25 April 1950\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | La Corporation Episcopale R.C. de Grouard | $68,604 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMt.

It would appear that in typing the pay-rolls one name has been omitted.\n\nI have no approval in this office for wages paid to a chorister-boy. The auditor has advised that the contractor has applied for approval for salary paid to cook assistant, cook and helper.\n\nErrors have been noted in computing holiday pay on the following paylists, February 4, March 4 and March 18.\n\nIn respect to the payroll for week ending March 18th, it is noted that the charges on this payroll have been based on free board of $3.00 whereas this should be $7.00. The correct figure of $7.00 for free board has been shown on the payroll summary but the various payroll charges were not adjusted.\n\nThe following errors have been noted in the invoices in addition to those already commented on by the auditor.\n\nVoucher 5/27-5 pair #2001 6* Hinges extended as $42.00 this should be $52.00\nVoucher 5/67 Item #2 - 547 Board Feet should be 413 ft.\n\nThe summary of invoices for materials, expenses, etc., has been incorrectly totalled for the current claim. The total has been listed as $55,918.27 whereas this should be $55,933.55 making an undercharge on this claim of $25.28.\n\nThe auditor has been asked to investigate the above discrepancies and have any necessary adjustments made in the next claim.\n\nThe total for the trial balance does not agree with the total of the claim. It is noted that the claim was amended but the correction was not carried into the trial balance.\n\nWith respect to the points raised in my letter of January 18, 1950, enclosing Claim No.4, the error in computing Workmen's Compensation on Claim No.4 has been adjusted in Claim No.5.\n\nOn\nOn the payroll for period ending September 3, 1949, the discrepancy of $1.00 regarding employee Lucien Sasseville was a typographical error. The hours worked on August 31st should have read 6\u00bd and 5\u00bd.\n\nFlight charges appearing on 4/9 covered transportation of Bishop Roughier, Father Beuglet and Father Phourde on an inspection trip. Local flights were made to take out hired help no longer required. Flight charges appearing on invoice 4/17 cover transportation to bring in additional help.\n\nApproval has now been received for the plant rentals submitted on the claim.\n\nYou will note the auditor's comment that this claim has been approved subject to further funds being provided by the Department.\n\nSubject to the above remarks and those in the auditor's report, payment of this claim is approved in the amount of $68,604.33.\n\nR.J. Blake\nfor H.G. Charlton\nRegional Administrator\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School - Hay Lake\n\nThe original contract, dated April 1st, 1949, for the school at Hay Lake lists the total cost of the school as being $175,000.00 (Page 2, Section 3, sub-section (b)). The total for the attached Progress Claim is $214,953.29, which is $39,953.29 over the amount specified in the contract.\n\nFather Beuglet states that when he was in Ottawa the contractor was granted the additional $50,000. to complete the school. No word to this effect has been received at this office. I have therefore signed the Progress Claims subject to the condition that the additional $50,000. was granted.\n\nMy last visit to the school was on March 16th. At that time the wiring, except for the fixtures, was completed; the plumbing, with the exception of a few fixtures, was installed (all materials for the completion of wiring and plumbing were on hand); partitions were up. The cement for the floor of the basement has to be poured. Painting is to begin as soon as the weather is warmer. The boiler house is not built but materials are now on hand for it.\n\nS. C. Knapp,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEnclosures.\nFile: 436-25\n222 Tegler Bldg.,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n15th April 1950.\n\nMr. H. G. Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nPrairie Region,\n709 McCallum Hill Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nFrom: J.L. Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Residential School -\nHay Lakes, Alberta\nLa Corporation - Episcopale C.R. de Grouard\n\nProgress Claim No. 5 - $68,604.88\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim No. 5, submitted by the above contractors has been completed by the undersigned and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayroll and Payroll Charges\n\nAll payrolls submitted have been checked in detail and have been found correct and in agreement with original time records and rates of pay received by employees.\n\nVacation Pay charges have been adjusted in order to give effect to a straight 4% rate for all employees, as prescribed by the Alberta Board of Industrial Relations for the Construction Industry, the said rate being effective from September 15, 1949.\n\nAn overcharge on account of W.C.B. charges on behalf of C.E. Varret's earnings in excess of $2500.00, has been audited on the present claim.\n\nOn payroll No. 1 for the period ending November 5, 1949, retroactive pay to P.E. Plouffe from Oct. 3rd to October 29th has been claimed with no details shown. It was explained that this employee is a missionary member of the Oblate Order and that the charges for his services were deleted from previous claims. The Corporation now wishes to claim for these services. The writer has verified the original payrolls covering this employee and has found the number of hours claimed as well as the rate to be in accordance with the time-records.\n\nMaterials and Expenses\n\nAll invoices for materials and expenses have been examined in detail and have been passed for payment subject to possible adjustments that may be required in respect of the following invoices:\n\nInv. 5/37 - Bruce Robinson Electric\n200 locknuts @ 1.30 = $3.40 should be $2.60\nBruce Robinson Electric\n1500 ft. P. straps @ .39\u00a2 = $1.54 should be $1.35\nInvoice 5/61 - Marshall-Wells - 15 - 4 x 12 L & B Sheets $8.35 -\n$116.90 should be $100.02\n\n- 5/94 - 24 - 6 x 4 Blk. Nipples $3.19 -\n$33.50 should be $76.65\n\n- 5/108 - 1 - 6 Cl Tee $8.67 - 1/2 be $8.67\n\n- 5/116 - 209/12 - 4 Blk. pipe 150.04/c -\n\n- 5/126 - 20 lbs. Gold cheese $43 - $10.32\nshould be $8.50\n\n- 5/144 - Maple Leaf Petrol -\n\nItems 2 & 5 - $636.23 s/be $637.70\n\n- 5/144 - Ste. Henri's Mission - $611.63 should be $613.53\n\n- 5/174 - Flintkote Co. - Item 1 - $217.36 should be $212.18\n\n- Item 7 - $47.26 - $46.15\n\nThe above discrepancies will be investigated and the necessary adjustments will be effected on a future claim. Other minor discrepancies have also been noted but have not been listed as the accounts involved were for a few cents only.\n\nInvoice #167 from Maple Leaf Petroleum includes the purchase of one 2000 gallon storage tank for gasoline. It was necessary to purchase this bulk container to store gasoline as the Oil Companies would not sell the fuel required unless the containers or drums are replaced by empty drums. As it is essential to get supplies to the project during winter months when transportation is cheaper, the bulk storage tank was purchased with the view that it will also be required even after construction has been completed.\n\nTransportation charges submitted in the present claim represent a substantial amount. The pressure of the fiscal year end business has not permitted the writer to check all materials transported to the suppliers invoices. However, a spot check has been done into a few accounts and the charges that have been allowed appeared in order. The rate of $2.25 per c.w.t. from Palmer to Hay Lakes, a distance of 380 miles, is considered as a very fair rate.\n\nDiscrepancies noted on Claim 4 Inv. 25 and 40 have been adjusted on Invoice 5/185 in the present claim.\n\nInvoice 4/44 - Army & Navy Department Store for $1,600.79 represented equipment and supplies required for the employees on the project. These will be taken on inventory and will be retained by the Department at the conclusion of the project.\n\nGeneral\n\nAccording to reports presented by the Indian Agent, Mr. S.G. Knapp at Fort Vermilion, the Corporation has progressed very efficiently with this project and has been performing a satisfactory quality of work.\n\nThe Corporation has dispensed with the services of Mr. G.E. Verret since the beginning of December. Father Rainville, a member of the Order has been acting as superintendent of the work, although no claim has to date, been submitted in compensation for his services.\nOther members of the Order have also been employed on the project for whom no remuneration has been claimed.\n\nThe Corporation has informed the writer that steps have been taken with the Indian Affairs Branch to increase the appropriation for the project by $50,000.\n\nThe present claim brings the total expenditure submitted to the amount of $214,965.29 which is in excess of the original appropriation of $175,000.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School - Hay Lake\n\nThe original contract, dated April 1st, 1949, for the school at Hay Lake lists the total cost of the school as being $175,000.00 (Page 2, Section 3, sub-section (b)). The total for the attached Progress Claim is $214,953.29, which is $39,953.29 over the amount specified in the contract.\n\nFather Beuglet states that when he was in Ottawa the contractor was granted the additional $50,000. to complete the school. No word to this effect has been received at this office. I have therefore signed the Progress Claims subject to the condition that the additional $50,000. was granted.\n\nMy last visit to the school was on March 16th. At that time the wiring, except for the fixtures, was completed; the plumbing, with the exception of a few fixtures, was installed (all materials for the completion of wiring and plumbing were on hand); partitions were up. The cement for the floor of the basement has to be poured. Painting is to begin as soon as the weather is warmer. The boiler house is not built but materials are now on hand for it.\n\nS. C.

Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Residential School -\nHay Lakes, Alberta\nLa Corporation - Episcopale C.R. de Grouard\n\nProgress Claim No. 5 - $66,604.88\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim No. 5 submitted by the above contractors has been completed by the undersigned and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayroll and Payroll Charges\n\nAll payrolls submitted have been checked in detail and have been found correct and in agreement with original time records and rates of pay received by employees.\n\nVacation Pay charges have been adjusted in order to give effect to a straight 4% rate for all employees, as prescribed by the Alberta Board of Industrial Relations for the Construction Industry, the said rate being effective from September 15, 1949.\n\nAn overcharge on account of W.C.B. charges on behalf of G.E. Verratt's earnings in excess of $2500.00, has been included on the present claim.\n\nOn payroll No. 1 for the period ending November 5, 1949, retroactive pay to P.H. Plouffe from Oct. 2nd to October 26th has been claimed with no details shown. It was explained that this employee is a probationary member of the Oblate Order and that the charges for his services were deleted from previous claims. The Corporation now wishes to claim for these services. The writer has verified the original payrolls covering this employee and has found the number of hours claimed as well as the rate to be in accordance with the time-records.\n\nMaterials and Expenses\n\nAll invoices for materials and expenses have been examined in detail and have been passed for payment subject to possible adjustments that may be required in respect of the following invoices:\n\nInv. 5/37 - Bruce Robinson Electric\n200 Locknuts @ 1.50 = $3.40 should be $2.60\nBruce Robinson Electric\n1500 # F. straps @ .59\u00a2 = $1.34 should be $1.35\nInv. 5/31 - Marshall-Wells - 12 - 4 x 12 L & B Sheets $8.35 -\n$116.90 should be $100.08\n\n5/34 - 24 - 6 x 4 Elk. Nipples $3.19 -\n$33.50 should be $76.56\n\n5/108- 1 - 6 61 Tee - $8.67 - $8.67\n\n5/116- 209/12 - 4 Elk. pipe 150.00/c -\n$30.38 should be $31.13\n\n5/126- 20 lbs. Gold cheese .43 - $10.32\nshould be $8.60\n\n5/146- Maple Leaf Petrol -\n\nItems 2 & 5 - $636.25 s/he $637.70\n\n5/144- St. Henri's Mission - $611.55 should be $613.52\n\n5/174- Plintzke Co. - Item 1 - $827.35 should be $818.18\nItem 7 - $47.85 \" $46.13\n\nThe above discrepancies will be investigated and necessary adjustments will be effected on a future claim. Other minor discrepancies have also been noted but have not been listed as the accounts involved were for a few cents only.\n\nInvoice #167 from Maple Leaf Petroleum includes the purchase of one 2000 gallon storage tank for gasoline. It was necessary to purchase this bulk container to store gasoline as the Oil Companies would not sell the fuel required unless the containers or drums are replaced by empty drums. As it is essential to get supplies to the project during winter months when transportation is cheaper, the bulk storage tank was purchased with the view that it will also be required even after construction has been completed.\n\nTransportation charges submitted in the present claim represent a substantial amount. The pressure of the fiscal year end business has not permitted the writer to check all materials transported to the suppliers invoices. However, a spot check has been done into a few accounts and the charges that have been allowed appeared in order. The rate of $8.25 per c.w.t. from Father to Hay Lakes, a distance of 350 miles, is considered as a very fair rate.\n\nDiscrepancies noted on Claim 4 Inv. 25 and 40 have been adjusted on Invoice 5/185 in the present claim.\n\nInvoice 4/44 - Army & Navy Department Store for $1,600.79 represented equipment and supplies required for the employees on the project. These will be taken on inventory and will be retained by the Department at the conclusion of the project.\n\nGeneral\n\nAccording to reports presented by the Indian Agent, Mr. S.G. Knapp at Fort Vermilion, the Corporation has progressed very efficiently with the project and has been performing a satisfactory quality of work.\n\nThe Corporation has dispensed with the services of Mr. G.E. Verrett since the beginning of December. Father Rainville, a member of the Order has been acting as superintendent of the work, although no claim has to date, been submitted in compensation for his services.\nOther members of the Order have also been employed on the project for whom no remuneration has been claimed.\n\nThe Corporation has informed the writer that steps have been taken with the Indian Affairs Branch to increase the appropriation for the project by $50,000.\n\nThe present claim brings the total expenditure submitted to the amount of $814,985.89 which is in excess of the original appropriation of $750,000. The claim has been approved subject to further funds being provided by the Department.\n\nSubject to the foregoing remarks, Progress Claim No. 5 has been certified.\n\nApproved:\n\nJ. L.

NEARY,\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION,\n\nConstruction of Indian Residential School,\nHay Lakes, Alberta - La Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de Grouard - Contractors.\n\nHerewith, copy of a letter received from Mr. Charlton, Regional Administrator, Cost Inspection and Audit Division, with reference to the above. The gist of it is that, with the introduction of a firm price contract for the construction of the staff residence and barn at a cost of $25,000.00, as authorized by P.C. 21/1938, it will be difficult to determine the items which properly belong to the building of the residential school on a cost plus basis.\n\nIt has always been obvious to us here in Ottawa that, in the absence of a branch representative on the job, the \"Certificate of Engineer\" on applications for progress payments indicated the fact only that claims has been handled through the regular channel, i.e., the Indian Superintendent at Fort Vermilion.\n\nConsidering the distance and location of the residential school, a great deal more reliance must be placed on the \"Certificate of Contractor\" than would ordinarily be the case. Of course I am not overlooking the \"Certificate of the Treasury Auditor\", following his examination of the records of the Corporation maintained at McLennan, Alta.\n\nI should like very much to discuss this matter with you immediately on your return from Toronto. In the meantime I have written Mr. Charlton advising him that final payment will not be made by this office without the assurance that the costs for the residential school have been segregated from the costs of the other buildings to the satisfaction of the auditor, Mr. Villeneuve.\n\nWL/S\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nDepartment of Finance\nCanada\n\nPrairie Region\n\n709 McCallum Hill Bldg.,\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nApril 5th, 1950\nFile 436-25\n\nW. Lauchlan, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nCitizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building, Sparks Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Lauchlan:\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Indian School\nLa Corp. Episcopale C.R. deGrouard.\n\nPlease refer to your file 3-4-1 in connection with the above. The last progress claim No. 4 went forward on January 18th, 1950, and I am informed by the Auditor, Mr. Villeneuve, that claim No. 5 may be expected shortly and it should be forwarded in time for payment from old year funds.\n\nThere is one aspect of this contract which is not too satisfactory and that is the matter of proper inspection or a clerk of works at the site. It has not been possible to secure the usual breakdown of costs and your attention has been drawn to this in the previous audit reports.\n\nI now attach a copy of a report by Mr. Villeneuve in which he mentions that the Department has provided a grant of $10,000.00 for the construction of a staff residence and a further grant of $15,000.00 for the construction of a stable and that according to his information these grants will be payable on the basis of invoices being submitted directly to the Department without the auditor's approval.\n\nIt is definitely bad business to have a mixture of cost plus and firm price contracts together or even in the same area and only difficulties will result. If the Auditor's information is correct then it should be arranged that the cost of construction of the two additional items will be handled as an addition to the cost plus contract regardless of the grant that may be ultimately payable as it creates a very difficult situation for the auditor on a project like this where materials and labour are not accurately controlled by a Departmental Superintendent or Clerk of Works.\n\nAs you know claims are being certified by the Superintendent of Indian Agency at Fort Vermillion and he is signing without any real knowledge of what is taking place.\n\nWill you kindly give consideration to this report of the auditor and advise me in due course.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) H.G. Charlton,\nRegional Administrator.\n\ncc: J.L. Villeneuve, Esq.\nMr. H.G. Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nPrairie Region,\n709 McCallum Hill Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Indian School\nLa Corp., Episcopale C.R. deGrouard\n\nI have just returned from McLennan where I have audited the accounts of the above contractors to be submitted shortly under Claim No.5.\n\nAs the claim documents and accounts have to be sent to Fort Vermillion for the Indian Agent's certification, it may not be possible to have it reach your office before April 15th.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch are very anxious to have this claim paid out of the old appropriation. In view of the unavoidable delays that may take place, it is probably advisable to inform the Department at this time that the claim submitted covers expenditures in excess of $65,000, which I have verified. I am prepared to certify providing the Department has approved the additional funds. The Corporation informed me that the Department is to authorize an additional $50,000 for the completion of the residential school.\n\nThe Department has also provided for a grant of $10,000 for the construction of a staff residence and a further grant of $15,000 for the construction of a stable. According to the information received, the only requirements necessary to obtain payments under these two grants will be to submit invoices directly to the Department without the auditor's approval.\n\nIt is apparent that arrangements of this kind will lead to a good deal of confusion in establishing which expenditures have gone into the school and which have gone into the other two buildings. If the contract is to be carried out on this basis, I can only suggest that a resident clerk of works be appointed at the earliest possible date; otherwise, I feel, in the light of the difficulties that have come up on the Wabasca project, that it is unfair to expect an auditor situated on hundreds of miles away to be able to exercise the proper controls of the expenditures being incurred.\n\nThe other alternative would be to amalgamate the grants into the one contract and have the accounts submitted in the regular manner after audit, with a breakdown of expenditures among the three buildings proposed.\n\nIt is essential that a procedure be established without delay in order to avoid the confusion which will inevitably result if two systems of payments are to be followed.\n\nKindly give the matter your immediate consideration and inform the Indian Affairs Branch accordingly.\n\n(Sgd.) J.L. Villeneuve\nTreasury Auditor.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1950 March 31 | To freight charges on electric light plant and batteries for the plant - for Indian Residential School, Bay Lakes, Alberta, as per account attached. | $351.60 |\n\nNote: See attached letter from Doucet Brothers re increased freight rate.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThis is only to inform you that we are doing all that is humanly possible to hasten expedition of Progress Payment accounts. The auditor arrived only yesterday, but expects to have completed his work here by Friday. I had wired Mr. Knapp of Fort Vermilion to come down here by plane so as to speed things still more, but in his reply received this morning he states that he has too much to do to get away at this season. This may therefore delay the expedition of papers, as from Mr. Knapp they must again go back to the auditor in Edmonton before being forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nI received this morning from Mr. Knapp the contract to be signed for the staff residence and the barn at Hay Lakes. This will be sent to immediately. We shall forward account for all the lumber required. The companies cannot send iron material before some months, but could they draw up invoices for required iron, cement, etc as prepayment even though same could only be shipped later? Please wire answer to this required information.\n\nI believe, from what Father Rainville tells me, that practically all furniture, etc have arrived and are on their way to Hay Lakes except the electrical unit which was shipped from Winnipeg by freight last Friday. A ban on the Grimshaw road has been placed this morning and may delay expedition unless police grants special permit to travel at night. I hope this may be done, as we never know how the roads may break up and retard until summer transportation.\n\nI am grateful to you for the haste with which last expedition has been made. As soon as the auditor shall have made the total of this fifth Progress Payment claim, I shall forward same to you.\n\nYours Cordially,\n\nHenri Routhier O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor Bishop of Grouard.\nApril 5, 1950.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nHay Lakes Residential School\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the expenditures incurred in connection with the erection of the above school.\n\nWith special reference to the second paragraph of your letter, it will be necessary for us to obtain a supplementary appropriation for additional funds that will be required according to information previously received from His Excellency Bishop Routhier.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no funds in our Main Estimates for this project and as I have indicated above, a supplementary vote will be required. It is difficult to say when the Supplementary will be brought down before the House but this will very likely be some time in June. In the meantime it is doubtful whether any further funds can be made immediately available for the completion of this project, especially when it involves a sum of nearly $50,000.00.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| DESCRIPTION                                                                 | PRICE |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| **1** ONLY 16 KW LISTER DIESEL ENGINE DRIVEN                               |       |\n| **GENERATING UNIT COMPRISING:**                                           |       |\n| **1** ONLY LISTER MARK 27/3 DIESEL ENGINE COMPLETE                        |       |\n| WITH ELECTRIC STARTING EQUIPMENT AND                                      |       |\n| DEVELOPING 27 H.P.

He also wants me to tell you how much he appreciates your having permitted the immediate building of the school barn.\n\nHis Excellency has also asked me to thank you for what you have done in making possible the construction of the Hay Lakes School in such a prompt manner. He hopes that next September the Indian children of the district will be able to profit by the generous cooperation of your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI received this morning both your telegrams of yesterday and thank you sincerely for same.\n\nI am extremely pleased that the department has consented to grant $10,000 for staff residence and $15,000 for barn. We shall do our utmost to purchase immediately the required material. This will include lumber which we are now bringing in, and I hope that the rest will be obtainable at short notice.\n\nRe telegram announcing shipment of boiler and fittings, I am somewhat at a loss to understand if these are meant for the heating of the school building as all our heating supplies have been purchased for some time, and in fact I think mostly installed. The architect who came to inspect the building was informed of this. However if this boiler is intended for the heating of the school, I think we might use it for the College we intend building in Falher this year, and reimburse you the cost of it.\n\nIn conclusion, may I thank you sincerely for your kind interest in the construction of the Hay Lakes Residential School and assure you of my appreciation.\n\nCordially Yours,\n\nHenri Routhier O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor of Grouard.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nHay Lakes Indian Residential School.\n\nIn response to your memorandum of the 9th March and as forecast in our memorandum of the 14th January, hereunder is a summary of the report of the representative from this office, Mr. Thornton, who visited the above school in January.\n\nMr. Thornton found that there have been many deviations from our design for this building. Each end of the main portion of the building has been widened, and the roof has been raised, obviating the dormer windows. These alterations increase the volume of the building by approximately 51,630 cu.ft. This Service concurred in raising the roof to permit elimination of dormer windows at the request of the church authorities.\n\nSteel beams have been used over the central portion of the basement, eliminating wood construction with columns shown in our design. Concrete foundation walls have been lined with 1/4\" plywood over shiplap and building paper on studding, which was not indicated on our drawings. Electrical work is being done.\n\nSome partitions have been changed, no exterior stairs have been built, and the boiler room will be constructed adjacent to the end chapel wall.\n\nPiping and plumbing fixtures have arrived on site, most of the basement drainage is installed and some plumbing stacks run up through the first floor. Most of the heating equipment is on the site and steam mains are being installed. The two boilers, at that date, were en route to the site.\n\nAll of this plumbing and heating is being done in accordance with drawings prepared by Messrs Lockerbie and Hole, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nWith plumbing and heating services so far advanced no purpose can be served in having designs and layouts prepared by this Service.\n\nChief.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept 30 | Cash paid to Joseph Yellowknee for services rendered as watchman of premises on buildings on new Agency site and new Indian Residential School Dormitory.

Knapp,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nFort Vermilion, Alta.\n\nHay Lakes Residential School\n\nDirect tenders were received from Father Bouglet for the barn and staff residence required to complete the Hay Lakes Residential School. These were firm price tenders as follows:\n\n(a) Staff residence measuring 40' x 50', full basement, half story, steam-heated and electrically lighted, ........................................ $10,000.00\n\n(b) Barn, dual purpose, measuring 125' x 36', fully modern with steel equipment and electrically lighted................................. $15,000.00\n\nIn view of the fact that the Episcopal Corporation was already constructing the Residential School and because of the low prices tendered, it was decided to recommend the acceptance of both these tenders for the additional buildings needed.\n\nPlease find attached a contract covering the erection of both these buildings for signature by Bishop Routhier. I am also sending you a number of progress payment forms which are used when a firm price contract is accepted. You will note that this does not have to go through the auditor but in accordance with Article 3 of the contract, you can submit these progress payment forms at the end of each month.\nWe would particularly like to receive one after the end of March as Father Beurlet will be buying materials for this building and we have funds available in this year's Vote. The Order-in-Council authority to be quoted is P.C. 21/1155 of March 5, 1950. You can sign for the engineer. I am sending this letter to you in duplicate in the event you will wish to forward a copy to Bishop Bouthier.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nHAY LAKES RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nPlease find attached a Submission to Council covering the provision of a staff residence and barn at the Hay Lakes Residential School.\n\nThis school is now under construction by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Grouard (under authority of P.C. 97/388 of March 2nd, 1949). I also attach the tender received from Father Plourde covering the residence and barn.\n\nThe Bishop has submitted a sketch showing the type of staff residence which he requires and it is felt that the tender is very fair and acceptable. In fact it would not be possible to have an outside contractor erect such a building, size 40 x 50, with a full basement, for a sum of $10,000.00.\n\nThe barn will be of a type erected previously at the Sturgeon Lake Residential School. It will be 125 x 36 and fully modern with steel equipment and will be electrically lighted. The tendered amount of $15,000.00 is also very low.\n\nAs I have indicated above, I feel that the most economical way of having these two buildings provided is by accepting the tenders of the Episcopal Corporation. They have a qualified engineer as a building foreman and a good crew of carpenters already on the site at Hay Lakes.\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nRe: Hay Lake Indian Residential School\n\nA copy of a letter from Mr. Huestis, Director of Forestry, is attached. There was a great deal of discussion over these logs. The Mission went ahead and cut 3,000 logs, amounting to at least 100,000 feet of timber, without the sanction of either the Province or this Agency. The Indians were not consulted.\n\nI think it would be advisable at this time for someone with higher authority than mine to point out to the Mission at Hay Lake that as they are on an Indian Reserve, they should conform to the regulations governing an Indian Reserve and respect the Indian rights pertaining to that Reserve. (Ref. Para. 44 and Sec. 120 of the Indian Act.)\n\nLast year, on the same Reserve, Father Arbay grew potatoes and then waited until there was a shortage and the Indians were then compelled to buy them at $6.00 per sack. The price for local grown potatoes should be between $2.00 and $2.50 per sack and I might add that the Indians are very resentful about this matter.\n\nWe will need the cooperation of the Indians to get them into the School this summer and any acts of this nature will make the work more difficult. I quite understand that the Mission is doing excellent work and that the timber would be granted to the Mission, but I believe it should be done properly.

The oven has not yet arrived.\n\nThe snow has been thawing here for the last three or four days, and if this warm weather keeps up we may have no snow left at the end of next week. This does not worry me too much yet as we usually get a good deal of cold before the end of March. Later than March, the weather is unpredictable; in fact, last year transportation became impossible after the first week of April, although this was sooner than usual. The cost is already high enough as it is, and I would not like to have to make use of extraordinary means of locomotion for any large amount of freight. One has very little idea of the condition of the roads when one has not gone over them by wagon.\n\nI have wired Medland's to expedite the sending of Elect. Machinery. They still give March 27th as date of expedition, and sooner if possible. This would then have to be sent by express, as it will arrive too late otherwise, and it must arrive before heating can be put on, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also attach the tender received from Father Plourde covering the residence and barn.\n\nThe Bishop has submitted a sketch showing the type of staff residence which he requires and it is felt that the tender is very fair and acceptable. In fact it would not be possible to have an outside contractor erect such a building, size 40 x 50, with a full basement, for a sum of $10,000.00.\n\nThe barn will be of a type erected previously at the Sturgeon Lake Residential School. It will be 125 x 36 and fully modern with steel equipment and will be electrically lighted. The tendered amount of $15,000.00 is also very low.\n\nAs I have indicated above, I feel that the most economical way of having these two buildings provided is by accepting the tenders of the Episcopal Corporation. They have a qualified engineer as a building foreman and a good crew of carpenters already on the site at Hay La\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nRe: Hay Lake Residential School\n\nSuperintendent Knapp made a report on a trip to Hay Lakes. I am attaching hereto an excerpt from the report on the residential school building.\n\nI am pleased with the progress that is being made and thought you would be glad to have a copy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG/lo\nEncl. 1\nExcerpt from report of Superintendent S.C. Knapp on trip to Hay Lake - Report dated 12th Jan/50.\n\nI inspected the new Indian Residential School. Good progress is being made on this building. The outside is between 90% and 95% completed and the inside is insulated and shiplapped. Fifty per cent of the electric wiring is done. Two brothers, experienced plumbers - arrived at the same time to install the plumbing.\n\nTheir present plans are to get in as much freight as possible before the road becomes too drifted; then they plan to stop hauling freight and will open the road again by bulldozer in the Spring to enable them to bring in the remainder of the freight.\n\nI am of the opinion that they will need additional funds to finish the school. $50,000.00 of the grant will have gone towards freight before they get all their supplies in. The freighting of materials to Hay Lake for the construction of this school has been a difficult undertaking and if it had not been for the free labor given by the Brothers it would have cost the Department a great deal more to build this school than had to be given out by contract. I feel very satisfied with the progress of the work. They have a very competent man in charge in the person of Father Rainville who built the Fort Vermilion hospital.\n\nThere is no doubt that this school is one of the best things that has happened for the Hay Lake Indians. As they are still a Band of primitive bush Indians and essentially trappers I feel that the first generation will reap the benefits of this residential school.\nJanuary 23, 1950.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI received this morning your letter of January 19th addressed to Father Beuglet re: Purchase Order 52615 placed with Medland Machinery Limited for the electrical unit etc.\n\nI am including copy of letter that I have just written to the Medland Machinery and asking them to expedite delivery.\n\nI was pleased to receive the visit of Mr. Thornton last Friday on his return from his visit to Hay Lakes. He told me that he was really pleased with the work carried out at Hay Lakes and that a commendable job had been done. We talked together for over two hours and he seemed quite happy.\n\nMy sincere thanks for the close attention you are giving to our work and very particularly to the Indian School at Hay Lakes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenri Reithier, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor Bishop of Grouard\nBishop's Residence,\nMcLennan, Alberta,\nJanuary 23, 1950.\n\nMedland Machinery Ltd.,\n576 Wall St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI received this morning from Mr. Bernard F.

Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Residential School -\nHay Lakes, Alberta -\nLa Corporation Episcopale\nC.R. de Grouard - Contractors\n\nProgress Claim No. 4 - $37,167.67\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim No. 4 submitted on the above project has been completed at the contractors' office at McLennan, Alberta, and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayroll and Payroll charges:\n\nThe salary rate received by Superintendent A. Verret has been approved by the Department.\n\nWages rates are in compliance with minimum wage rates prescribed by the Board of Industrial Relations for Alberta. Carpenters have been paid at the rate of $1.25 per hour and helpers at $1.00 per hour. These employees have all been recruited in the district, and the wages paid are in line with labor rates in that area.\n\nIndian laborers have been paid at rates complying with the Provincial minimum wages and have been considered reasonable by the Supervising Indian Agent.\n\nProvision has been made for the payment of Holiday Pay at the conclusion of the project. In the meantime these charges have been set up as accrued and withheld from the claim.\n\nA detailed check of the Payroll calculations and extensions revealed the following discrepancies:\n\n1. Payroll - Aug. 13/49 - Leopold Sasseville Overpaid $1.40\n2. \" - Sept. 10/49 - Joachim Clareau \" $1.10\n3. \" - Sept. 17/49 - Indian laborers \" $.20\n   No adjustment considered necessary.\n4. \" - Sept. 24/49 - Henry Meroredi charges were omitted in transcription and have been verified and written in.\nPayroll Oct. 1/49 - Joachim Claveau - Overpaid $2.10\n- George Mercadi - $ .20 recovery doubtful.\n\nWith the exception of item 3 and 20 cents in item 5, the overpayments have been borne by the contractor and no overcharge has resulted in the claim.\n\nBoard:\n\nThe value of free board has been taken into account in the calculation of Holiday Pay, Workmen's Compensation and Public Liability Insurance.\n\nThe value of free board charged on payrolls together with board deductions have been credited to materials and supplies.\n\nMaterials:\n\nInvoices covering materials and expenses have been checked in detail and the following discrepancies have been noted:\n\nInv. 4/25 - Marshall Wells - $12.62 appears to be a duplication of Inv. 4/41. The contractor will have to secure the corresponding credit and apply same in future claim.\n\nInv. 4/40 - Marshall Wells - $8.37 Item for $4.98 has been omitted resulting in undercharge of $4.98.\n\nInv. 4/44 - Army & Navy Dept. Store - $1,600.79 - This appears to be equipment and supplies for the operation of the school and should not have been charged to the cost of construction. The account will be investigated.\n\nSmall Tools:\n\nAn inventory of small tools has been retained and kept up to date.\n\nA number of deductions have been made from Indian laborers for tools which they retained and have been credited on the Summary of invoices for materials.\n\nInsurance on Buildings:\n\nThe Corporation has secured additional Fire Insurance coverage on the building and materials. The following policies registered in the joint names of La Corporation Episcopale, C.R. de Grouard, and the Department of Mines and Resources. Copies have been forwarded to the Department at Ottawa.\nThe Bee Fire Ins. Co. #154167 expiring Oct. 17, 1950 $5000.00\nPatriotic Assurance Co. #1511004 Oct. 17, 1950 $10,000.00\nThe British Canadian Co. #F38172 Oct. 17, 1950 $10,000.00\nLondon Guarantee & Accident #584669 Oct. 17, 1950 $10,000.00\nNiagara Fire Ins. Co. #21356 Oct. 17, 1950 $15,000.00\n\nThe Corporation now carries coverage for a total value of $110,000.00.\n\nPlant Rentals:\n\nThe charges for plant rentals are in accordance with rates approved and represent equipment owned by members of the Corporations in charge of other missions. Although no time records have been maintained on the rental of the teams supplied by Father Arbet, the Superintendent did confirm that the time charged was reasonably accurate and not excessive.\n\nSub-Contracts:\n\nHauling of gravel and the Cutting and Hauling of firewood for heating the building while under construction, has been carried out by Indians on a unit price basis. These rates were arrived at after negotiations with the Indians. These rates appear reasonable and have not been questioned by the Indian Superintendent. Supporting schedules of quantities supplied have been appended to the claim. Deductions from payments for meals and supplies taken by the Indians have been credited to the summary of materials.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe present Progress Claim No. 4 has been certified by the Indian Superintendent, S.C. Knapp at Fort Vermilion who has visited the project during recent months. The Department has requested that all claims on the project should be approved by the Agent at Fort Vermilion rather than by the Agent at High Prairie as it had heretofore been done.\n\nAccording to reports received and photographs examined the work had progressed relatively well up to the end of November. At that time, the main shell had been erected and work was to begin on utilities and interior finishing.\n\nThe total expenditure to the end of November amounted to $146,372.64 which is still within the authorized estimate of $175,000.00. It is evident, in the light of the existing conditions, that the cost of the building will be considerably higher than the original estimate. The Corporation is negotiating with the Department in order to secure the necessary authority to exceed the original appropriation.\n| DESCRIPTION                  | CURRENT   | PREVIOUS CLAIMS | TOTAL TO DATE |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|\n| As per summaries attached    |           |                 |               |\n| Payrolls and payroll charges | 17,853.00 | 7,742.30        | 25,637.30     |\n| Less: Accrued Holiday Pay    | 290.60    | 42.97           | 333.57        |\n|                              | 17,562.40 | 7,741.33        | 25,303.73     |\n| Materials and expenses       | 16,271.62 | 101,463.54      | 117,735.16    |\n| Plant Rentals                | 522.00    | nil             | 522.00        |\n| Subcontracts                 | 2,811.65  | nil             | 2,811.65      |\n\nDEDUCT PREVIOUS CLAIMS\n\nAMOUNT DUE\n\nCERTIFICATE OF CONTRACTOR\n\n1.

ARNEIL\nApril 27, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nKyuquot Indian Day School\n\nThe Department is prepared to approve the transfer of Mrs. C. Green from the Kyuquot Indian Day School to the primary room at the Chehalis Indian Day School effective 1 September, 1950.\n\nThe Department has reviewed the application of Miss E.H. Langdale as a replacement for Mrs. Green and notes that she has had no elementary teaching experience in Canada. We have had considerable difficulty in the past with teachers holding English certificates in that they do not seem able to adapt themselves to teaching Indians. I would hesitate to recommend that Miss Langdale be classified as a Grade 3 teacher but would suggest that she only be classified as a Grade 2 teacher until she has met the following qualifications:\n\n(a) Attended the British Columbia Department of Education Summer School and taken at least two courses there preferably in primary and elementary teaching techniques\n\n(b) Had one satisfactory inspection report from Major Davey.\n\nOur experience has been that it is very difficult to down-grade a teacher from Grade 3 to Grade 2.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nExtract from Superintendent Garrard's Quarterly Report dated March 31, 1950.\n\nThe attendance at the Kyuquot School has been affected by the weather as one family live across a piece of open water and these have remained away when weather conditions were unfavourable. Mrs. Green, the teacher there appears very capable and is an asset to the place.\n\nShe desires that a dwelling be erected for her as she finds the food where she is boarding (an Indian home) lacking in variety and monotonous, from what I can gather Pork and Beans continuously. At any rate she appreciated a ham sandwich which she got on the Departmental Launch \"Duncan Scott\" immensely.\nSchool supplies have been ordered from PP&G on May 18th. I am writing Mr. Brixwell to reach this order.\n\nMr. Arnold has been authorized to purchase desks and janitor supplies.\n\n[Signature]\n\n22/7/49\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\nMonday the 2nd day of May, 1949\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nWHEREAS the Minister of Mines and Resources reports that there are twenty-(20) Indian children of school age living on the Kyuquot Indian Reserve No. 1, in the West Coast Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom educational facilities are required; and\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 230, 1949-50, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school for these children;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources and pursuant to the provisions of section 9 (a) of The Indian Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, chapter 98, is pleased to establish and doth hereby establish a day school in the West Coast Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, to be known as the \"Kyuquot Indian Day School\".\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Church authorities have indicated that they are prepared to allow the present Church building to be used for school purposes. It can be adopted readily for this purpose.\n\nMr. Indian Superintendent Garrard has previously sought unsuccessfully to have these Indian children admitted to the nearby provincial school. In view of the fact that his request was refused, we have no alternative other than to establish our own school.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/HM\nApril 23, 1949.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are twenty (20) Indian children of school age on the Kyuquot Indian Reserve No. 1 in the West Coast Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom educational facilities are required;\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 230, 1949-50, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school for these children.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established on the Kyuquot Indian Reserve No. 1 in the West Coast Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, 1927, to be known as the \"Kyuquot Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are twenty (20) Indian children of school age on the Kyuquot Indian Reserve in the Alberni Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom educational facilities are required;\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 230, 1949-50, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school for these children.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established on the Kyuquot Indian Reserve in the Alberni Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, 1927, to be known as the \"Kyuquot Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nApril 23, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nKyuquot Indian Day School.\n\nWe have prepared the necessary Submission to Council for the establishment of the above school.\n\nWould you please advise the amount of rental which the Department will be required to pay to the Church denomination concerned. I would also suggest that a requisition be prepared for the blackboards, desks, school supplies, and janitor supplies required to prepare this school for opening September 1, 1949.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Superintendent Garrard that there are approximately 20 children of school age who could attend a day school if one were established on the Kyuquot Reserve No. 1.\n\nThe church authorities have indicated that we could use temporarily the church building for school purposes. This could be adapted readily.\n\nMr. Garrard previously sought admission of the Indian children to the Provincial school nearby, however this request was refused and there would appear to be no alternative but to establish our own school.

There are approximately 240 Indians at Fort St. James.\"\n\nIn view of present conditions I do not see any prospect of establishing a day school at this point during the fiscal year 1940-41 but in order that our file may be complete and the matter may not be lost sight of it would be appreciated if you would let me have your comments regarding Dr. Moore's suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10. Volume 6381, file 776-1, part 1)\nFrom the above analysis of the lists of children submitted by the Acting Indian Agent it appears that there are at the moment 54 children of school age at Fort St. James, 26 with either good or at least fair homes and 28 who are either orphans and must go to a residential school numbering 8, who live in fair homes 4, or in poor homes 16.\n\nLeaving out of the picture the orphans there are some 46 children of school age who live in either good, fair, or poor homes in this village.\n\nThere are also some the following children of under school age, with good homes 10, with fair homes 22, and with poor homes 16, or in all 48.\n\nWith under school age children we divide by say 6 to find the average number available yearly as Beginners should a new Indian day school be established here. In this case there would be some 8 pupils for the Beginners class yearly.\n\nWith over forty children available for a day school now and an average of some 8 per annum for the next five or six years at least and a similar number yearly after that, I have no hesitation in recommending the establishment of a one room Indian day school at Fort St. James.\n\nThe school would be situated in a very cold part of the Province and must be of very good construction. It should have a teacher's residence attached as we should require a married man or woman as teacher here.\n\nThe type of school erected at Pemberton would be very suitable. Owing to the difficulty of transportation the total cost of such a school furnished at Fort St. James might be from 50% to 50% more than at Pemberton. I have no means of giving a more exact figure.\n\nI would recommend that provision be made for such a school as I have mentioned above in the 1940-41 estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDecember 29, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have given considerable thought to the letter N-1-255 dated December 22nd and list of Indian children at Fort St. James as forwarded to you by the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. J.H.F. Lacey.\n\nMr. Lacey does not show how many of these children are at the moment pupils of the Le Jac Indian Residential School.\n\nI must assume from the correspondence that all these children are members of an Indian Band. I consider that it would be well for you to satisfy yourself on this point, as I may say at once that I had no idea there were so many Indian children of school age at Fort St. James.\n\nThe Reverend M. Marie O.M.I. in his letter of the 18th instant speaks of a number of halfbreed children and his efforts to have a Provincial day school started for them. In my reply to the Reverend Father Marie I suggested that if and when the Province started a school at Fort St. James I had no doubt that the Department would give consideration to the possible attendance of any Ladysmith children at that place who for one reason or another could not go to Le Jac Residential School. It would be of course to the Department's interest to have the Indian children educated in any such Provincial school at the usual fee of only $2.00 per month depending on the attendance for each Indian child.\n\nThe report now received from Mr. Lacey, if correct, throws a different light on the matter. I have for your information made an analysis of the Fort St. James Survey. The figures are tabulated for convenience.\n\n| Children of school age 6 to 15 inclusive | 54 |\n|------------------------------------------|----|\n| Children under school age 1 to 5         | 48 |\n| Total number of children in Survey       | 102|\n\n| Children of school age for Day School    |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| as suggested by Acting Indian Agent      |\n| With GOOD homes                          | 16 |\n| With FAIR homes                          | 10 |\n|                                          | 26 |\n\n| Children under school age for Day School later |\n|------------------------------------------------|\n| With GOOD homes                               | 10 |\n| With FAIR homes                               | 15 |\n|                                              | 25 |\n\n| Children for Residential School             |\n|---------------------------------------------|\n| Of school age Orphans                       | 8  |\n| Fair Homes                                  | 4  |\n| Poor                                        | 16 |\n|                                             | 28 |\n\n| Children for Residential School             |\n|---------------------------------------------|\n| Under school age                            |\n| Fair Homes                                  | 7  |\n| Poor                                        | 16 |\n|                                             | 23 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Barry, following a review of the matter with him.\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of the Inspector's letter, Mr. Lacey has reported that all the names on the list submitted by him are Indians and appear on the census list of the Agency. Mr. Lacey further reports that 35 of the pupils on the list are at present attending LeJac Indian Residential School, and in addition to this there are ten children sixteen years of age at LeJac awaiting discharge and who for that reason have not been included in the list.\n\nI have recently discussed the establishment of the proposed day school with Mr. Moore, who was for many years Agent of the Stuart Lake Agency, and he expressed himself as being of the opinion that a day school is now necessary at Fort St. James.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Jordan, O.M.I., D.D., Bishop of Prince Rupert, visited the office and brought the following matters to our attention:\n\n1. That there is a need for an Indian Day School on a permanent basis at Fort McLeod.\n\n2. That if the British Columbia Government puts a road through to the Peace River, there will eventually be need of an Indian Residential School at Fort St. John.\n\n3. That next to the need for a school at Fort McLeod, there is a school required on a permanent basis at Fort St. James.\n\n4. That the school at Rocher Deboule (at present closed) is in bad condition and in urgent need of repair.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 2, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nProposed Indian Day School at Fort St. James.\n\nDuring a recent visit to this office the Most Reverend A. Jordan, O.M.I., D.D., discussed the need for a school for Indians at Fort St. James. This matter had been previously brought to the attention of the Department by you in your letter of March 29, 1940, on file 15-13-4824. A study of Captain Barry's report of December 29, 1939, which you attached, indicates the possibility of the Province starting a day school at Fort St. James. Could we please be advised if such a day school has been started and if you are aware of any Indian children who might be attending this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nJanuary 31st, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nRe: your file No. 15-13-3012\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of December 10th, 1946, with respect to the proposal of the Right Reverend A. Jordan, O.S.T., D.D., to establish a Day School for the Indians at Fort St. James.\n\nIn addition to the existing Provincial Day School at Fort St. James, the province established a School for half-breed children of non-Indian status in 1941, and on an average, about 8 Indian children attended the School. The School was closed in 1946, and the half-breed children are now attending the white School. The Secretary of the Board advises that the white School is overcrowded, and it is impossible to accommodate additional pupils; consequently, we cannot obtain educational facilities for the Indians from this source.\n\nThere are approximately 69 children of school age in this Band. 39 of this number are attending Lejac Indian Residential School, leaving 30 children at home not receiving an education.\n\nThere are no buildings suitable for School purposes available on this reserve, nor adjacent to the reserve. I would recommend that the Department call for Tenders for construction of a two-roomed School at Fort St. James, in the coming fiscal year.\n\nIn event that a Day School is established at Fort St. James, I would point out that with the exception of one or two orphans, the pupils now attending Lejac Indian Residential School, would not return to Lejac. The parents would insist on their attendance at the Day School, which would necessitate engaging two teachers.\n\nIt would not be necessary to build quarters for the teachers. Lodging can be obtained at Fort St. James, either in the Hotel or private homes.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/Jf\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nRe: your file No. 215-13-6432.\n\nI have your letter dated January 28th, 1947, requesting additional information with regard to the proposal to establish an Indian Day School at Fort St. James, B.C.\n\nThe building used for a Provincial School which was closed in 1945, is an old log building located on the Roman Catholic Church property at Fort St. James. The log walls are rotting, and the foundation is giving way; in fact the building is in a deplorable condition, and positively unsuitable for occupancy of any kind.\n\nThere are 40 pre-school age children in this Band with fair home conditions, expected to attend the School at a later date.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/jf\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Proposed Indian Day School at Fort St. James\n\nFurther to my letter of 28th, I am enclosing for your information a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Howe's letter of February 4th and School Inspector Davey's memorandum dated March 17th.\n\nYou will note that the Provincial school building referred to in previous correspondence is not suitable for school purposes. I concur in Inspector Davey's recommendation that the erection of a school at this point be delayed until a survey of school requirements for the whole province is made, but I am asking Mr. Howe to provide an item in his 1948-49 Estimates so that the matter might be proceeded with in the event that further investigation indicates priority should be given to the construction of a school at this point.\n\nD. W. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 17, 1947\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMemorandum\n\nTo: Indian Commissioner\nFrom: Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRe: Proposed School at Fort St. James.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Howe has indicated that the Provincial school building at this point is unsuited for school purposes.\n\nIn December 1939 Captain Barry made a school survey at this point and recommended the erection of a one room school. Since that time the school age population has increased by fifteen and the pre-school age by the same amount. This indicates that the present requirement is a two room school which would take care of the expected increase for the next six years. If the population continues to increase at the same rate a three room school would be needed in from six to ten years.\n\nIn view of the limited amount of money available for schools for the 1947-48 fiscal year it is recommended that the erection of this building be delayed until it is possible to make a survey of the whole Province with respect to school requirements.\n\nR.F.

(RG 10. Volume 6381, file 776-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nPERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL\n\nBox 778, Prince Rupert, B.C.,\nApril 29th., 1949\n\nMajor D. W. MacKay,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Major MacKay,\n\nYou will, no doubt, readily recall the visit I paid to your office last November. On that occasion, while talking about my own duties among the Indians, I had occasion to ask you if it were the policy of your Department to seek cooperation of the Church when formulating plans for the welfare of the natives. Your instant reply was to the effect that you were anxious at all times to have the views of the clergymen representing the various denominations.\n\nIt is this known attitude of yours that prompts me to write this letter on the subject of education among the Catholic Indians of the Vicariate of Prince Rupert with special reference to Fort St. James.\n\nRecently I learned that plans were afoot to erect this year a day school in Fort St. James. While I am myself very much in favour of day schools as long as proper teachers can be obtained and there is some prospect of carrying out a successful scholastic program, I am wondering if all the implications of this particular move, in so far as it may affect Lejac, have been studied. The enrolment at Lejac just now is 180. The number of pupils from Stuart Lake district of which Fort St. James is the central mission is over 80 and this number includes boys and girls from the Fort itself (52), from Tachi (10), Portage (15), Trembleur Lake (4), Pinchi (1). It is only natural to suppose that parents from the other places will expect to send their children to Fort St. James as they have to go through there on their way to the school at Lejac and would probably violently object to sending them the extra 80 miles when there is a day school at the south end of the lake on which they reside.\n\nLejac is just emerging from a long period of deficits which in some years reached several thousand dollars. Is it reasonable to suppose that the residential school can be successfully operated with a greatly reduced number of pupils? If it be answered that steps would be taken to make up for the withdrawal of the other children by bringing them in from places like Cheslatta, Akila, Fort Graham, etc., it seems pertinent to remark that the whole policy of the Department in recent years has been to avoid sending children hundreds of miles from home. It seems to me that if the problem of Indian education is adequately to be solved, a start might be made with outlying areas such as those mentioned where so many children are not getting schooling at all. To open a day school at Fort St. James is hardly fundamental to the problem; rather it seems to be the easiest of all possible steps that could have been taken - and that, on behalf of children who are getting adequate schooling as it is. Let me site especially the case of the Babine Indians. They are in and out of Burns Lake continually to the detriment of the education of their children. One hears talk of the \"wild Indians\" from Babine and the priest at Burns Lake.\nsaid to me the other day that he wondered why the department did not do something about them, either provide for them including a day school at Burns Lake or insist that their children attend school in Babine.\n\nIn what I have said, there is no lack of appreciation here of the difficulty of the problem of education among the Indians.\n\nNow, if plans go through to begin a day school at Fort St. James, may I take the liberty of mentioning that the church plans to build a new church and priests' residence there. It would seem opportune to suggest that we get together on the matter of a site and come to some agreement about the sharing of services such as light and water. Then too in the matter of teachers, since all these Indians are Catholics, it would be much easier to obtain a competent staff if we were notified well in advance as to the number of teachers required. If a hospital as well as a school is contemplated, it seems to me that for continuity of the work, you might give me an opportunity of securing the services of Sisters who could supply both teachers and nurses (when and as required).\n\nThere are one or two other points I should like to mention in connection with Indian education, but I shall write about them at a later date.\n\nI hope that you are enjoying good health after the mild winter in the East.\n\nAnd personal regards and best wishes.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6381, file 776-1, part 1)\nCol. Neary,\n\nPlease let me have your comments on the points raised by Bishop Jordan.\n\n[Signature]\n\n4-5-49\nMay 21, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nFort St. James Indian Day School,\n\nI have searched in vain through our files for any specific facts which I could provide you concerning the points raised in Bishop Jordan's letter. I do not know this area and feel that the school will primarily be for the Indian children at Fort St. James and that Inspector Davey has no plans for Burns Lake this year. I think we can advise the Bishop that we are prepared to have Catholic teachers but I am rather concerned over these \"joint building programmes\". Our experience to date is that the Education Division bears the major portion of the costs and I would much rather build my own building. We could of course consider the sharing of electrical and water supplies.\n\nI do not feel that we can provide any dormitory accommodation at Fort St. James for the Indian children at the far end of the lake and they will have to go to Lejac, as they do at present.\n\nI regret that I cannot provide you with any other information. The material on our files, as you can see hereunder, is only fairly complete. On November 18, 1946, Bishop Jordan advised me that a day school was required at Fort St. James. Inspector Barry also did not hesitate to recommend a day school at Fort St. James when he reviewed the situation in 1939.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 42163-9-1 (E)\nRe: Fort St. James Indian Day School\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter of April 29th concerning the establishment of the above mentioned school.\n\nIt would appear now that Inspector Davey was too optimistic regarding our building program for this year and it is doubtful if we will be able to make arrangements for the establishment of this school for the coming academic year.\n\nW.S.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nFort St. James Indian Day School.\n\nDear Mr. Arnell:\n\nA long discussion was held in my office this morning with regard to the construction of a two-room Indian day school at Fort St. James. Present for this meeting were Bishop Jordan of Prince Rupert, Father Birtch, O.M.I., and the Superintendent of Education.\n\nThe following points of agreement were reached:\n\n(1) That the Department be responsible for the erection of a two-room Indian day school at Fort St. James, to be ready for school opening by September, 1950. This school would be identical with that at Anaham and would provide for electricity and running water.\n\n(2) That Bishop Jordan would endeavour to locate two qualified and experienced teachers for this school by that time. I believe Bishop Jordan will be approaching various teaching Orders of Nuns and with the assurance of a modern school he believes he will be successful in securing properly certificated teachers.\n\n(3) That children of school age on the Fort St. James reserve would attend this new day school and only those children requiring institutional care would be sent to the Lejac Residential School.\n\nI believe that the appointment of qualified Sisters will ensure a continuity in our educational program on the Fort St. James reserve which could not be obtained in any other way. I feel certain that the Bishop will endeavour to obtain an\nEnglish speaking Order of Nuns. We mentioned to him the work being done on Christian Island and in the Maritimes and hope that he will obtain as high calibre of teachers.\n\nKnowing your views on the employment of Sisters in Indian day schools, and your experiences in Ontario and the Maritimes with such teachers, I feel confident that you will agree with the above proposals. I would appreciate your comments at an early date so that arrangements can be made to consolidate the plans and specifications for this new building. We intend to advertise for tenders in March 1950, if this meets with your approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nMajor D.M.

Arniel\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDear sir:\n\nI have just returned from what I consider a very satisfactory and informative trip to Fort St. James with Mr. Davey, Inspector of Indian Schools, as approved by your Department and beg to submit report on same...\n\nMr. Davey took us out to St. James from Vanderhoof and together with Mr. Davey, Chief Felix Antoine and the resident priest, the Rev. A.R. Simpson, C.M.I., we definitely decided upon a splendid location of about five acres on the Reserve,- the proposed new school facing the lake.\n\nI also obtained much information in regard to the site such as drainage, excavation, bearing qualities of the sub-soil, also the availability of material, gravel, sand, etc., and the most economical methods of transporting materials that will have to be taken in to Fort St. James from Vancouver or other points...\n\nAs the Department approved the cost of my trip up there I presume that it is their definite intention to go on with the building as soon as it is possible next year to do so.\n\nWith that in mind I intend to revise the Anahim School plans to suit local conditions at Fort St. James and to make up full quantity estimates and the specifications required for sub-contracts. These I will take to your office in Vancouver as soon as ready.\n\nI might say that there is a very good quality of common lumber suitable for framing and shiplap sawn and sized within a few yards of the Reserve. I have no doubt we can obtain this lumber at a considerable saving over the cost of that procured for Anahim. However,-on account of the distance,-other costs will probably be a little higher.\n\nAt the present time my foreman,-Iver Holtlien,-(now building a District school at Alexis Creek) is definitely banking upon building the school at Fort St. James next year.\n\nIn conclusion I would be pleased to have you convey to Mr. Davey my very sincere thanks for a pleasant trip to the north country.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEdmund J. Bougheu.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will note that Mr. Davey was accompanied by Mr. E.J. Boughen, who supervised the erection of the School at Anaham and that a suitable site has been selected.\n\nA copy of letter dated October 4th, from Mr. Boughen in this connection, is also enclosed for your information, together with a set of plans which he has prepared, based on the Department's standard two-room plan, with certain changes such as were made at Anaham. Mr. Boughen has also provided us with a Bill of Common Lumber required for the structure and further Bills for materials will be provided by him in due course.\n\nIt is thought that we should proceed about the end of February to secure quotations on the materials required for delivery early in May, which will permit construction being carried out largely during the summer months.\n\nVoucher No. 146, covering Mr. Boughen's travelling expenses, is enclosed herewith.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOctober 6, 1949.\n\nMemorandum to: Indian Commissioner\n\nFrom: Inspector of Indian Schools\n\nRe: Fort St. James Indian Day School\n\nOn September 29th I visited the Necoslie Reserve No. 1 at Fort St. James with Mr. Superintendent, Howe, and Mr. E. J. Boughen with the purpose of selecting a site for the proposed day school on the afore-mentioned reserve. We met the Rev. A. R. Simpson, C.M.I., and Chief Felix Antcine, who accompanied us while making our survey.\n\nThe Chief informed us that the band was prepared to surrender a lot of approximately four or five acres, located in the centre of the reserve. This lot is level with about three acres cleared. The remaining portion being very lightly overgrown with small poplars. The distances from this site to the farthest house at the south end of the reserve is .4 miles; and .8 miles to the northern most house on the reserve, as measured by car speedometer. This latter distance is greater than the distance the pupils will have to walk as they will be able to make use of a short-cut. The lot proposed by the Chief has a north-western exposure to the lake from a bench some 15 or 20 feet above the trail running along the lake shore. Drainage, therefore, should not present any problem. There will also be ample space for playing fields. I feel that this is the most suitable of the school sites as to distribution of the population, the proximity to a good road, the exposure for classroom light, and the availability to an area suitable for playground purposes. One factor must be determined before this location is definitely selected and that is the provision of a water supply. There is no running\nwater within reasonable distance and it will be necessary to provide a well. Unfortunately, the local residents, both white and Indian, have not had success in the digging of shallow wells. There are, however, several artesian wells in the area which have been brought in through drilling to depths of between 250 and 300 feet. If a school is to be built in the spring, it is imperative that the location of a well on this site be definitely established this winter.\n\nA second location was considered at the northern end of the reserve. This is not a very suitable site because of the distance which the population from the southern section would have to walk in the severe winter weather when temperatures frequently fall below 40 degrees below zero. The area available is also very small, and it would be necessary to secure a lot or lots, owned by individual Indians, upon which they have established buildings. The only factor in its favour is that we would undoubtedly be able to secure water by pumping from a small stream which runs close by. There is also some doubt as to the purity of this supply.\n\nIn considering possible sites, consideration was given to the fact that a small group of the band is presently resident on mission property less than a half mile to the north of the northern boundary of the reserve. In this group there are only four children of school age who might attend the day school. It was felt that if the school were located in the centre of the reserve, it would have the desirable effect of attracting these people to reserve land where assistance might be given to them in the matter of housing. Also, the Church is apparently considering the disposal of their mission property which would undoubtedly result in the eviction of the Indians. I feel that the school must be located without reference to these people due to the uncertainty of their continued residence on mission property, and because of the desirability of having them re-located on the reserve. In any case, the number of school age children living off the reserve is not large enough to warrant our placing the building in such a way as to increase the distance which the children living on the south portion of the reserve would have to walk.\nIt seemed obvious that the logical selection was on that portion of the reserve first mentioned which the band is apparently prepared to surrender. Accordingly, the exact location of this site and exposure was set out with Mr. Boughen, who, it is understood, will supervise the construction. The exposure of the classrooms would be in a south-easterly direction. This will provide the best available light.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.

Therefore, I would urge that the order be placed at an early date.\n\nIt is only by drilling what suitable water can be obtained in this district. There are several good artesian wells at Fort St. James, about one to two miles from the proposed school site, and the operator of the well drilling outfit is reasonably certain that he can obtain a good flow of water at 250' to 300', not only sufficient for the school and teachers, but enough for the requirements of 25 or 30 Indian families on this Reserve.\n\nThere is only one well drilling outfit in the entire district, owned and operated by Mr. Alec Nicholson, a well to do farmer, who, after a good deal of persuasion has consented to drill the well for the Department during the latter part of March next, which is the only time he is available.\n\nA tender will be submitted in the near future from Mr. Nicholson giving a price on the drilling by the foot with all material to be supplied by the Department.\n\nI am sure that Major Davey and Mr. Bowen will agree with me that this is the only solution to the water problem at Fort St. James.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHowe,\nSuperintendent\n\nRH/sj\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Howe, in his letter of November 15th, a copy of which was sent to you, intimates that the possibility of obtaining a good flow of water at from 250 to 300 feet is reasonably certain. This assumption is based on the fact that there are a number of artesian wells in the vicinity producing water in volume and at least one of these supplies the requirements of a number of householders. The possibility of Mr. Nicholson not striking water is remote but in such an event I have no doubt the casing could be recovered.\n\nWe have had considerable correspondence with Mr. Howe in connection with this well and it is quite apparent from the letters on file that Mr. Nicholson, who has the only well drilling outfit in the vicinity, is not at all anxious to drill for the Department and I feel that any suggestion to him with regard to a reduction in cost if he does not strike water would not be favourably received and might jeopardize his acceptance of the contract. We shall, however, pursue the matter further if you so desire.\n\nWith regard to our voucher No. 146 in favour of Mr. E.J. Boughen, I have spoken to him today and he informs me he has no receipts for hotel rooms or meals in connection with his journey to Fort St. James to inspect the school site and he doubts if such receipts can be secured at this late date. If receipts can in any way be dispensed with I would recommend that the Department endeavour to have Mr. Boughen's account paid as submitted.\n\nW.S.

St. James Sawmills, Fort St. James, B.C., or Vanderhoof Lumber Co., Fort St. James, B.C.\n\n(2) **Millwork** - It is suggested that this be purchased in Vancouver from either Sigurdson's Millwork Ltd., 1275 West 6th Ave., or the Mohawk Lumber Co. Ltd., New Westminster.\n\n(3) **Cement, brick, etc.** - This material is available from Bowman Lumber Yards, Vanderhoof; or may be purchased from McCleery and Weston Ltd., or Evans, Coleman and Evans, Vancouver, B.C. The sand and gravel listed on the same requisition will be purchased from the best available source at Fort St. James.\n\n(4) **Shingles, Shakes, Galv. Iron, etc.** - The asphalt shingles can be purchased from Sidney Roofing and Paper Company, Vancouver, and the shakes from Canadian Forest Products Limited., Vancouver (9110 Milton Street).\n\nThe galvanized iron can be purchased from Marshall Wells or McLennan, McFeely and Prior, Vancouver.\n(5) Finish Lumber - Plywood, etc.: Reliance Lumber Co., Valley Lumber Yards, Simpson's Millwork or Mohawk Lumber Company.\n\n(6) Building paper, hardware, etc.: McLennan, McFeely and Prior Ltd., Gordon Belyea Ltd., or Marshall-Wells Ltd.\n\n(7) Insulation, tile, wallboard, etc.: Reliance Lumber Company, Valley Lumber Yards, McLennan, McFeely and Prior Ltd., or Marshall Wells Ltd.\n\n(8) Paints, etc.: Douglas Paint Company, General Paint Corporation of Canada, Ltd., Vancouver.\n\nWe also have bills of materials and specifications on plumbing, heating and electrical installations but feel that it would be advisable to have these checked by our engineering staff and for us to call for tenders locally.\n\nUnder separate cover I am forwarding you four sets of revised plans of this building which will be required for the Purchasing Agent when calling for tenders on millwork as the locations of the various items are indicated on the plans by number.\n\nIn connection with transportation of materials purchased in Vancouver, Lee's Transport Ltd., 1140 Kingsway, Vancouver, operates a regular trucking service from Vancouver to Fort St. James and it would be far cheaper to ship by truck to the site rather than by rail to Vanderhoof and thence by truck.\n\nW.

We can, if you so desire, secure quotations from Vancouver firms but hesitated to do so for the reason that in many previous instances the quotations which were secured were ignored and the Purchasing Agent called for tenders.\n\nW.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nHG/AD\nOttawa, December 5, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 28th ultimo, in which you refer to the request of the band at Fountain Reserve for a day school. I have noted that the Indians are willing to erect log buildings for this purpose, provided the Department will furnish the same and supply a teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, in view of your favourable recommendation, the Department will be glad to provide desks, blackboards, texts and any other classroom equipment that is necessary, if the band of the Fountain Reserve will erect buildings suitable for school purposes. You may inform the Indians at this point that the Department will give them this assistance and will secure the services of a teacher.\n\nWhen you are prepared to assure the Department that the building, or buildings, that the Indians are erecting are satisfactory, you will kindly requisition for the supplies that you believe to be necessary, and you will make efforts to secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. The salary allowed will be $750.00 per annum and whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nWhen you have informed the Department of the willingness of the Indians of the Fountain reserve to go ahead with this project, the Department will do what we can to assist in the securing of the services of a qualified teacher and will write to Mr. Inspector Cairns with a view to enlisting his assistance in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have directed Inspector Cairns to write to you direct concerning the probable date of the opening of this school.\n\nMight I suggest that you keep your eyes open for a qualified teacher and, if you succeed in securing an applicant, the Department will consider your nomination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOTTAWA, December 27th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is considering the opening of a day school on the Fountain Reserve of the Lytton Agency. The band itself is erecting a building and the Department is to supply the classroom equipment and provide a teacher.\n\nWould you keep this in mind and communicate direct with Mr. Agent Graham regarding the opening of this Fountain Indian Day School, and also forward to the Department the application of any teacher that you believe properly qualified for the work. The salary allowed will be $750 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 42, Post Office Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\n\nHaving further reference to the Fountain Indians' application for a day school on their reserve, I beg to state that the Indians advised me that they would go ahead with the building, and practically assured me that they would be ready for occupation by the first of January; but for some unknown reason, these were never started, so I went up to see why they had not done as they promised. I held a meeting of the band on the reserve yesterday, and found that there was some hidden motive that I could not get at. It appeared to me that some of the principal men had no children of school age, whereas the chief, were opposed to this school. They had all sorts of excuses. First of all they said they could not understand why the Department did not build an industrial school, which was so badly needed for all the Lillooet speaking Indians. It ended up in them stating that they had not the money to erect the necessary buildings, and offering a new council house which is only half erected. The shell is up, but it needs shingling, lining and flooring. This is a nice big building, which would make an excellent school room. They also offered a piece of ground on which to have a teacher's residence erected.\n\nIt has now come down to a matter for the Department to practically erect two buildings, if we wish to start this school. The school is certainly very badly needed for the number of children that belong to this band. In fact an industrial school for the whole district is what we really need, as there are not enough schools in the Province within easy access to take these children. There must be at least one hundred and fifty children from Pemberton to Clinton that have no school to go to, nearer than Mission, which is now full.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nRG/MD\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6382, file 778-5, part 1)\nOttawa, January 27, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 19th instant, referring to the proposed opening of the day school on the Fountain reserve of the Lytton agency. I have noted that the Indian band has not undertaken the preparation of a school building, that they are urging an industrial school and that they are offering a new council house which is only half erected. Your remarks concerning the need for a residential school on the line between Pemberton and Clinton have been noted.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that it will not be possible, in the immediate future, to provide funds for the erection of a boarding school. This matter, however, will be placed on file and will receive due consideration. I have to inform you that the Vote for Indian Education will not permit of an expenditure necessary for a day school on the Fountain reserve and a teacher's residence. In view of the fact that the band has failed to erect a log building for school purposes, as promised in your communication of November 28th, and because of their present uncertainty as to their wishes, I have to intimate that the Department is prepared to wait for more definite information. You may assure the Indians of the Fountain reserve that, if they wish educational facilities for their children in the immediate future, they had better rely on the day school plan and had better offer again to the Department some definite assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, April 12, 1922.\n\nMr. Chene:\n\nThe matter of a residential school for the northern portion of the Lytton agency has been under discussion for some time. It will not be possible, however, in the immediate future, to provide funds for the erection of such institution. We are at present trying to start one day school (Fountain) in this area. Without going into this matter fully with the Deputy Superintendent General, I cannot recommend that this property be purchased with a view to providing a site for a school at some indefinite future date.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n165-57-1\n\nClosed\n\nfrom 28/11/21\n\nto 12/4/22.\n\n778\nPoveshell Indian Agency\nSchool Correspondence\nplaced on File 778.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 778-5 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT PROPOSED SCHOOL\nLYTTON AGENCY\nFOUNTAIN SCHOOL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM NOV. 1921\nTO APRIL 1922\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 165/6-1-778 VOLUME 1\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6382)\n\nFile 778-5, part 1\nLytton Agency - Fountain School -\nEstablishment. 1921 - 1922\n\nFile 779-1, part 1\nLytton Agency - Irish Creek Day School -\nGeneral Administration -\nEstablishment. 1950\n\nFile 789-1, part 1\nLytton Agency - Halfway River School -\nGeneral Administration. 1897 - 1920\n\nFile 789-5, part 1\nLytton Agency - Halfway River School -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1912 - 1931\n\nFile 790-1, part 1\nLytton Agency - Douglas Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1949 - 1950\n\nFile 790-5, part 1\nLytton Agency - Douglas Day School - Plan Incl. -\nBuildings Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1949 - 1950\n\nFile 791-1, part 1\nLytton Agency - Neskainleth Day School,\nGeneral Administration. 1948 - 1950\n\nFile 791-5, part 1\nLytton Agency - Neskainleth Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1948 - 1950\n\nFile 791-8, part 1\nLytton Agency - Neskainleth Day School -\nTeachers' Residence -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1949\n\nFile 792-1, part 1\nKamloops Agency - North Thompson Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1948\n\nFile 792-5, part 1\nKamloops Agency - North Thompson Day School -\nEstablishment - General Administration - 1948\n\nFile 793-1, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Gilford Day School -\nEstablishment -\nGeneral Administration. 1948 - 1949\n\nFile 794-3, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Turnour Island Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1947\n\nFile 794-5, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Turnour Island Day School -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1947 - 1950\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\n\nWEDNESDAY, the 2nd day of AUGUST, 1950.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nHis Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and pursuant to section 9(a) of the Indian Act, is pleased to establish and doth hereby establish a day school at Irish Creek on the Okanagan Indian Reserve, in the Okanagan Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, to be known as the \"Irish Creek Indian Day School\".\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Logan, M.P.,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will please find enclosed a resolution passed by the Board of School Commissioners for the District of Parrisboro at their last Annual Meeting regarding the Education of the Halfway River Reserve. The Commissioners believe that these children as wards of the Federal Government have claims upon it for their education. Nothing has been done for them up to this time save the purchase of a few elementary books.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6382, file 789-1, part 1)\nI believe that on the reserves in the other parts of the province school rooms are built and teachers engaged entirely at the expense of the government. This is not asked in this case. The commissioners believe that if the Indian Department would supplement the rate raised by the Nation on whose Reserve the Reserve is situated, the one school would suffice for both the white and Indian children. The school section where the Indians attend is financially weak and school rooms lack as comfortably as it should be. School is there for only half an hour a day.\n\nNow I have done my last official duty to this school. I am sure I found the Indian children present and to be encouraged to\nAnd the Indian Department\nif you deem it proper I would\nagree under another Coach &-\nample of their work I have\nbeen familiar to the Education\nOffice of the Province also &\nample of their work and\nhave received the approbation\n\"well done\" for their work.\nThere about 15 children on the\nReserve who should be at school.\nI have always urged the teachers\nengaged in this district to give\nthem special attention and gather\nthem up and I have reasons\nto believe that good measure of\nwork has been done. But as\nI have said before school can\nnot be maintained continuously,\nunless the Government is willing\nto come to the Indians aid.\nThe Fullerton's with whom you\nare well acquainted have no\nobjections to the Indian Children\nbeing taught both their\nbut think it unfair that they should entirely bear the expense of their education when the Indians in other Countries are\u2014Special aid.\n\nThe Commissioners have suggested that a claim be made on the Monies received from timber sold a few years ago, that is providing anything is left after the reasonable way in which it was disposed of.\n\nIf you feel that you can give this subject your attention you will receive the thanks of a large body at which has the interest at these children at heart, & may say that heretofore we have asked nothing of the Department through the agent in Petoskey but have been refused an answer.\n\nBy God I have already\nThank you for your thoughtfulness in sending me the geological report.

[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 5th August, 1897.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring again to your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to a grant to the Board of School Commissioners for the District of Parrsboro, I beg to say that the Minister has given this matter some attention and has decided to make a grant to the School District of $100 per annum for the work that is being done in teaching the Indian children. It is certainly a great advantage to have Indian children attend the schools where white children are being taught and I have no doubt good results will follow. I would strongly urge, therefore, that the teacher and others interested would do all in their power to secure the attendance of every child from the Reserve which adjoins this School District.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. J. Logan, Esq., M.P.,\nAmherst, N.S.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\nMemorandum. Mr. Mclean.\n\nPlease write the Indian Agent at Parrsboro asking him to facilitate in every way the work of the teacher and those interested in the School at that place, and endeavour to secure the attendance of all the Indian children possible at this public school.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA 11th August 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that application having been made to the Department for a grant to assist in the maintenance of the public school at Halifax River, which is attended by Indian children from the Reserve in that neighborhood, it has decided to allow a grant of $100 per annum for this purpose, as it considers that it would be to the advantage of the Indian children to attend a white school. The Department would be glad if you would try in every way to facilitate the work of the teacher and those interested in this school and endeavor to secure the attendance of all the Indian children of school age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I may say here that the attendance of Indian children at school has been very satisfactory so far as your offer is respect.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.B.

A supply of the form of quarterly Return is enclosed herewith, and in future the Department would like the teacher to make out quarterly returns showing the attendance of Indian pupils only, to be sent you for transmission to this office at the end of each school quarter, namely, 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, upon receipt of which a Cheque for $25 will be issued in favor of the Trustees of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.A.

N.S.\n\nThe school year closed in July, and the new teacher is using a new system. This system only the names of some children appear in this return, and I have not included pupils during this quarter so that they attended during some portion of first year's course in the last year's report. The attendance during this quarter has been very small as a result of the Indians moving away for a few weeks during the summer. They are returning to return now and I am in hope attendance for next quarter will improve.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. B. Ramsay\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 10, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nI wish to call your attention to the grant made to the Halfway River White school of $100 per annum for the education of Indian children there.\n\nIn 1897 the Board of School Commissioners for the district of Parrsboro, in which this school is situated, applied for this grant through Mr. Logan, member for that constituency. At that time there were said to be 15 children in attendance. The grant has been paid quarterly up to the present, while the attendance has steadily diminished until the average has decreased to one; in fact during the past four years it has never been higher than three, while the average for that time has been less than two. Many of the Indians have moved away from this locality, and as there appears to be no prospect of the attendance ever improving, the Department is, I consider, paying a great deal too much to this school, and I think the existing arrangement should be modified to suit the present conditions, but before doing so it might be well to write to Mr. Rand, the Agent, to report as to whether there is any prospect of an increased attendance being obtained. The fair way would be to pay a per capita grant on the average attendance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6382, file 789-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 12, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the last quarterly report from the Halfway River school it is noticed that there is only one Indian pupil in attendance at the school, and for the last four years the average has not exceeded two. The Department pays this school a grant of $100, and would like to be informed if there is any likelihood of an increase in the attendance of Indian children at this school, as, if not, the grant ought to be reduced.\n\nSo good enough to report to the Department with reference to the probable attendance in the future as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

I have to say I have not had any trouble with the school and have talked on the subject with most of the Indian parents. The teachers tell me that they have tried their very best to persuade the parents to send their children to school. They have offered prizes to all who send their children regularly, and have also furnished clothing for some of the children. The Indians promise to send the children and the children promise to go but do not. The attendance during recent weeks, I am afraid, shows no improvement.\n\nI do not see that trouble will have any just cause to complain if present is reduced.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gillett's letter of the same date with questionnaire relative to the proposed school on the Douglas Reserve, a sketch showing the location of the school site and a resolution of the Band setting aside the area for school use.\n\nMr. Gillett informed me that the Indians of the Band would be leaving the Reserve shortly for berry picking and it would be desirable to have the school site and access thereto cleared before they left, and further that they were badly in need of employment and that work in connection with this clearing would tide them over until berry picking started. Under the circumstances I have authorized him to incur an expenditure of $150 to pay the Indians on a ration basis and a further expenditure of $150 for the hire of a bulldozer which is available for removing stumps.\n\nW.

It will also be necessary to have a clearance from the shore to the site so that the buildings can be taken in. I would like to have permission to do this immediately before the men leave for berry picking.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nAgency Superintendent.\n\nJG:ic\nEncls.\n1. Name of School: Douglas\n2.

Acquisition of the land will obviate the necessity of moving the buildings and will also provide much needed additional lands for the Indians. In the event that our application for purchase of the townsite can not be favourably considered, or if there is to be any likely undue delay in our acquiring the land, I should like to be advised if we could secure a permit to occupy Blocks 1, 2, 9, and 10, so that the buildings that we contemplate purchasing may be left in their present location until final arrangements are made.\n\nW.S.

Ltd., additional units have been released and are available for sale. Among this latter group of buildings is one which would make much better classroom than the one mentioned in the original letter. It is larger, being 20 x 36 feet as compared to 14 x 32 feet.\n\nSchool Inspector Davey, Mr. Letcher, and myself completed a survey of the buildings on July 19th and we are of the opinion that provided funds are available, it would be to the advantage of the Department to purchase all of them, including the other equipment as mentioned.\n\nThe additional buildings and equipment available are as follows, descriptions of which are on a separate attached sheet:\n\n- Dining Room: 20 x 36\n- Kitchen: 16 x 20\n- Water Tank with piping\n- Wash house complete: 14 x 24\n- 3 Large cabins: 12\u00bd x 30\n- Lighting plant complete: 14 x 32\n- Lighting plant complete: 16 x 32\n\nThe aforementioned buildings and equipment, including those as listed in our original letter, together with costs of each unit, can be utilized in the following manner:\n\n1. **Education** (For Douglas and Skookum Chuck Bands)\n\n| Building Description | Original List | Last List |\n|----------------------|---------------|-----------|\n| Trethewey Residence  | $4500.00      |           |\n| for school teacher   |               |           |\n| Dining Room size 20 x 36 |               | $2300.00 |\n| for classroom        |               |           |\n| Lighting Plant complete |               | $500.00  |\n| Water Supply system  |               | $350.00  |\n\n2. **Welfare** (Housing for Skookum Chuck Band)\n\n| Building Description | Original List | Last List |\n|----------------------|---------------|-----------|\n| Office Building 14 x 32 |               | $1300.00 |\n| for Dwelling         |               |           |\n| Dwelling 14 x 32     |               | $1350.00 |\n| for Dwelling         |               |           |\n| Warehouse building 14 x 32 |             | $1350.00 |\n| for Dwelling         |               |           |\n| Kitchen Building 16 x 20 |             | $1200.00 |\n| for Dwelling         |               |           |\n| Cabin 12\u00bd x 30       |               | $800.00  |\n| for Dwelling         |               |           |\n\n(Cont'd on page 2)\nOriginal List | Last List\n---|---\nCabin 14 x 32 for Dwelling | $800.00\nCabin 16 x 32 for Dwelling | 400.00\n\n3. Welfare & Training (Douglas and Skookum Chuck Bands)\nWash house complete size 14 x 24 to be used as such | $1300.00\n(Could this be purchased from B.C. Special Vote?)\n\nWe are attaching copies of letters received from Simson-Trethewey Lumber Limited (owners of the buildings), directed to Trethewey Creek Timber Co. Ltd. (who operated the camp), wherein they are agreeable to sell the buildings, etc., at prices stated. The prices indicated are those which we as members of the Department, placed on the buildings.\n\nWe have allocated the amount of $4000.00 from the Agency building grant for the purpose of supplying new buildings for the Skookum Chuck Band, and a further sum of $300.00 towards building repairs for the same Band. None of these monies have been expended to date. The present home reserve of this Band is about 15 miles up country from Douglas, in country which is most inaccessible. Very little has been expended during the past few years towards relieving the housing problem of this band, due partly to its location. It is now proposed that the Department obtain the site upon which the aforementioned buildings are located, establish the school, and then move several of the Skookum Chuck families to the new location, where they will have much better facilities in every way. We feel that by using the funds as stated for procuring the buildings listed for this Band, we will receive much more and better buildings than if we tried to build new buildings at the present home reserve of the Band. The Department erected new houses for members of the Douglas Band at the Douglas Reserve which is adjacent. These units cost $1900.00 each in 1948, and are not much better than certain of the buildings which we propose purchasing.\n\nIn the event that action has already taken place on the recommendations as contained in our original letter, we summarize hereunder amounts involved:\n\nOriginal letter\n\nEducation:\nTeacher's Residence $4500.00\nClassroom $1300.00 $5800.00\n\nWelfare:\nTwo buildings $2700.00\n\nTotal $8500.00\nAdditional grants required\n\nEducation:\nLighting plant $500.00\nWater System 350.00\nExtra cost on better classroom 1000.00 $1850.00\n\nWelfare:\nPurchase 5 additional buildings 4500.00\n\nWelfare & Training:\nPurchase of Wash house 1300.00\n\nTotal $7650.00\n\nIn order that facilities will be available for opening the proposed new school in September of this year, may we ask that the matter be expedited as soon as possible.\n\nJ.

I do not wish to delay arrangements for opening the new Douglas School in September, but in the absence of information with regard to progress made by the Department in securing authority for acquisition of the buildings referred to in my first communication, I feel that the Department should be advised that these additional buildings are now available, and, if at all possible, we should endeavour to make funds available to the extent\nof $8,950.00 from the Education Vote for the purpose of school use, and $7,200.00 from the Welfare Vote for the purchase of buildings for Indian homes. You will note that the expenditure recommended from the Education Vote includes purchase of the lighting plant and a water system. I should add, at this time, that we are presently corresponding with the Provincial Department of Lands with a view to acquiring the land on which these buildings are situated, comprising 68 odd acres, known as the Douglas Town site. Acquisition will obviate the necessity of moving the buildings and will provide additional lands for the Skookum Chuk Band who, as a matter of fact, live at Douglas a good part of the year.\n\nI regret that our negotiations with the Province have not proceeded to the extent that we can go into any detail with regard to the purchase of this land. But the matter should be clarified within the next week or two. We feel confident that we will be able to acquire the land, but even if we do not, the removal of the buildings will not present any great obstacle.\n\nW.S.

The other building which goes with the house, 12 ft. by 16 ft., could be used for fuel storage and one of the other three camp buildings, 14 ft. by 32 ft., the property of the Logging Company, although somewhat narrow for classroom use, will, according to District School Inspector Devey with whom I discussed the matter, provide adequately for the available pupilage at Douglas, which apparently, at the moment, is seventeen.\n\nThe total price asked for the five buildings is $8500.00, this price to include their removal onto the Reserve to selected sites.\n\nThe two buildings 14 ft. by 32 ft., not required for school use, can be used for Indian homes which are sorely needed on the Douglas Reserve and having in mind that our appropriation for new school construction will be seriously depleted by expenditures necessary for the completion of school buildings, the erection of which was started last year, it appears to me that\nthe opportunity to purchase these buildings should not be overlooked, as it will enable us to provide adequate school facilities for considerably less than half the cost which would otherwise be incurred. A portion of the cost would of course be chargeable to the Housing Division of the Welfare Vote and the balance could be met from the appropriation for new school construction at Douglas.\n\nMay I please have the Department's views with regard to this proposal at an early date, as I do not anticipate that the buildings will be held for our disposal for very long.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nAttached are copies of two letters we received from the Trethewey Creek Timber Company Ltd., Vancouver, and from Mr. L. Trethewey, Vancouver, respectively.\n\nThe Trethewey Creek Timber Company Ltd. has three well constructed buildings, the description of which is in their letter. I believe that we can use two of them at least for school facilities, teacherage and classroom. It will be noted they are on the narrow side but as the average attendance will not exceed 20 one building might be sufficient for the classroom. Falling this, the stock room and the office building could be converted to a schoolroom and the other building for the teacher's residence.\n\nThe building offered by Mr. Trethewey is more elaborate and better equipped and would make an ideal teacher's residence. It will be noted that the prices include the moving of the five buildings. As it is not likely the five buildings would be used for the school set-up, one building might be purchased from the housing grant for Indians. There is excellent value in the five buildings.\n\nJ.

As a matter of fact, the Province will not sell the land and, although they are prepared to issue Land Use Permits, there are outstanding taxes against the property and the whole proposal is becoming so complicated that I think we should abandon the idea of securing any other buildings and proceed with our original proposal as outlined in Order-in-Council PC 8546 of August 3.\n\nSuperintendent Gillett, with whom I discussed the matter today, informs me that some expenditure funds will be necessary for clearing the school site, sinking a well, etc., and details of these expenditures will be provided at an early date.\n\nI presume that it will now be in order for us to arrange with the Trethewey Creek Timber Company for the removal of the buildings to the school site, but would appreciate confirmation of this.\n\nW.S.

It will take approximately seven days.\n\nWe have decided on a site closer to the village than the one mentioned previously. We can make about three-quarters of an acre available by taking down a side hill and spreading it out toward the beach.\n\nI recommend that we be authorized to do this immediately so that we can take advantage of the tractor before it is moved away.\n\nJ.

The creek comes down the mountain almost perpendicularly. We would recommend a 1000 gallon tank placed 100 feet up and 3\" stave pipe.\n\nThe tank can be purchased from Canadian Wood Pipe and Tanks Limited, Vancouver, for $85.00. The 3\" wood pipe would cost $61.50 per 100 feet. Labor for installation of the pipe, digging the ditch and erecting the tank should not exceed $100.00. Twenty dollars should be allowed for extra galvanized pipe and elbows, etc., making a total cost of approximately $700.00.\n\nI recommend that we be authorized to install the water system.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nAgency Superintendent.\n\nJG:ic\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Douglas Indian Day School\n\nFurther to my letter of August 22nd, Superintendent Gillett has estimated that the cost of making the School and Teachers' Residence at Douglas, B.C., suitable for use, will be $2,452.00 and, reference the attached letters dated August 31st and enclosures, has secured tenders from Messrs. Goodrich and Tarras covering part of the work required, totalling $1,304.00. In addition to the work quoted by Messrs. Goodrich and Tarras, an expenditure of $448.00 will be necessary for clearing the School site and a further expenditure of $700.00 is contemplated for the installation of the water system. These two latter expenditures are referred to in Mr. Gillett's letters of September 1st, attached.\n\nClearing of the School site is of course essential and it is felt that as there is a supply of water available by gravity from a creek approximately 800 ft. from the School site and as the Teacherage is fully equipped with plumbing fixtures, the expenditure for the water system is warranted, which will, of course, obviate the necessity for the construction of an outside toilet, thus reducing Messrs. Goodrich and Tarras' tender on the Teacherage to $304.00.\n\nI would recommend approval of expenditures as follows:\n\n| Expenditure                          | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Improvements to School building      | $950.00  |\n| Improvements to the Teachers' Residence | $304.00  |\n| Clearing land for the School site    | $448.00  |\n| Installation of a water system       | $700.00  |\nYou will by now have received my Army Signal message with reference to the inability of the National All-Steel Buildings to construct the School at Fort Babine at this late date and if the question of securing funds for the Douglas School presents any problem, I would recommend that the amount required be transferred from the Fort Babine appropriation.\n\nW.S.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6382, file 790-5, part 1)\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Water System\nDouglas Indian Day School #790\n\nAttached are requisitions covering the materials required to install a water system for the Douglas Indian Day School, Port Douglas.\n\nIt is our plan to install a 1000 gallon water tank at an elevation of about 75 feet and from that position run 3 inch pipe for a distance of 575 feet to the school, at which point we will have half inch galvanized pipe connecting with the school and the teachersage. The source of water is from a mountain water fall which is constant throughout the year.\n\nWe have discussed this installation with Mr. Robertson at the Water Power Bureau who advises us that these materials would be satisfactory.\n\nWe have contacted both Wood Pipes & Tanks Ltd. and Marshall-Wells (Westminster) Ltd. and obtained the necessary quotations, copies of which are attached to the requisitions. It is recommended that purchase be made as soon as possible as we would like to install the units before the severe weather sets in. It will be done by day labor - not contract.\n\nIt is estimated that it will take about $250.00 for labor costs in digging the ditches and installing the pipe and we, therefore, request an accountable advance for this amount be forwarded. The total cost of the water system will be approximately $791.43. It will be noted this is $91.43 higher than my original estimate of September 1st. This, of course, does not include freight to Douglas.\n\nThe total cost for the school facilities will be:\n\n| Item                          | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Purchase of building for school | $1300.00 |\n| Purchase of building for teacher's residence | $4500.00 |\n| Improvements to school        | $250.00  |\n| Improvements to teacher's residence | $354.00 |\n| Land clearing - (advance received) | $500.00 |\n| Water system                  | $791.43  |\n\n$8395.43\n\nIn the Department's radio message we notice they state the total amount would be $11,402.00. Twenty seven hundred of this was for the purchase of two buildings for houses for Indians. The total cost will not exceed the above mentioned figures.\n\nJ.

The materials can be purchased from Marshall-Wells (Westminster) Ltd., at the prices indicated which are wholesale.\n\nIn our original order for water line materials we were not aware that the house fixtures (bathroom and sink) were connected to drains by means of rubber hose pipes and since this is the case it is essential that sink traps and extra piping be supplied.\n\nIt is recommended that authority be provided to make these purchases as soon as possible, in order that installation can be completed within the next few weeks.\n\nAs it is impossible to get a plumber in at Douglas we have an arrangement with Mr. Ekman (foreman of a local logging camp) whereby he will contract to install the aforementioned and also put in the complete water system including storage tanks during the weekends in the next three months. He has agreed to do the job for $300.00 which was very reasonable. We had an accountable advance prior to March 31st in the amount of $250.00 which was to be used for installation of the storage tank and water lines. This had to be returned as the work could not be done due to weather conditions. It is, therefore, requested that the accountable advance be reissued and made in the amount of $300.00.\n\nJ. C.

Bruce, Esq.,\nIndian Dept.,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nRe: Neskainlith Indian Day School\nYour File 0-11-3 (154)\n\nThis Office was very surprised to note the contents of your letter dated October 12th, concerning the enrolment at the above-mentioned School.\n\nYou are undoubtedly aware that there are a number of children in your Agency at present not attending school and for whom the only possible solution for providing an education is enrolment in a Residential school. For example, I was informed last June that there were 32 children of school age in the Hat Creek area of whom only 12 were enrolled in any school. You are also aware that the Kamloops Residential School serves not only your own Agency but also parts of the Okanagan, Nicola, Lytton and Williams Lake agencies. In these areas there are a number of children who should be in attendance at the Kamloops Residential School, either because of home conditions or the lack of educational facilities close to their homes.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Superintendent to see that the best possible use is made of the school facilities in his Agency. He should not permit the enrolment of pupils in a Residential school when there are adequate Day school facilities provided for them, particularly when there are a number of children denied admission to a Residential school who have no other means of receiving an education. I therefore request that you secure the immediate discharge of pupils now enrolled at the Kamloops Residential School who should attend the Neskainlith Indian Day School and secure the admission of an equivalent number of pupils who should be enrolled at the Kamloops Residential School, either...\nbecause of the lack of Day school facilities on their reserves or whose home conditions make their admission desirable.\n\nKindly inform us as to what action you have taken, including the number of discharges from the Kamloops School and the number of pupils on the roll at the Neskonlith School when these discharges are effected.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nc.c. Father O'Grady\nc.c. Department\nKamloops, B. C.,\nOctober 12th, 1949.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 90, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Neskainlith Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 11th, regarding the number of pupils enrolled at this School. I had expected a far larger enrolment, but due to the fact, that many of the parents had found employment away from their homes, they found it more convenient to send their children to the Kamloops Residential School, and as I understand the matter the choice of Schools lies with the parents, all of whom were informed as to the approximate date that the Day School would be open.\n\nOne also has to bear in mind the fact that the Reverend Principal of the Kamloops Residential School is extremely popular with both the parents and children.\n\nWe keep a close check on all children of school age and see that they attend.\n\nS. K. Bruce,\nSuperintendent.\n\n/R\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nMr. S.K. Bruce, Supt.,\nKamloops Indian Agency,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nRe: Neskeinlith Indian Day School\n\nThe Department has expressed disappointment at the number of pupils enrolled at the above-mentioned school on the opening day, and has requested that this office secure information from you concerning the present enrolment, and ask you to ensure that all children of school age on the reserve attend school regularly.\n\nThis office believes that the low enrolment on the opening day was probably due to the fact that many of the families had not returned to the reserve from the hop fields.\n\n\"W.S.

It was our understanding that there would be at least 15 to 20 children attending this school.\n\nPlease get in touch with Superintendent Bruce immediately with a view to having all children of school age on the reserve attend school regularly. You should also have Mr. Bruce forward another report not later than October 15th, advising us of the enrolment and average attendance.\n\nBernard F.

The Department is now providing these day schools and the Indian children on these reserves are to attend them.\n\nThe Kamloops Residential School can then take in Indian children from homes which indicate the need of institutional care and from reserves where the population is either too scattered or too limited to permit the erection of day schools.\n\nBernard F.

I did not receive the school report until December 20th, 1949, and I spoke to Pierre Cyprian August in Kamloops shortly before Christmas, in regard to the matter, and today I went up to Shuswap and tested the ice and after doing so, I told him not to let the children try to cross the river, as it is not safe.\n\nI am now trying to make arrangements with Chief William Pierrish to let Pierre Cyprian August use a vacant house, which belongs to the Chief in Neskainlith Village. During the school months, I had hoped that Mrs. Harris, a relative of August's would look after the children but she will not do so.\n\nThe roads from Chase to the Neskainlith school are now impassible, drifts of five to six feet of snow in many places. I spoke to the Provincial Road Engineer from Salmon Arm and requested him to plow the road to the school. He informed me that he will do his best to get the road plowed this week. The snow conditions are the worst I have experienced in years in the Kamloops & Shuswap area.\n\nS. K.

She had been engaged in service, and it was only her circumstances that brought her to a milder climate where she could apply for work among the Indians. After three months at Vancouver, she spent two years at the school in Vernon. Then to Chase where she was engaged last year in the care of patients and their parents.\n\nYet her eyes shine with old memories at mention of Beers River, where she worked among the Sioux tribes near Lake Winnipegosis. Sister Patricia has taught seven years, laboring sometimes day and night as a nurse and doctor, among two hundred Indians.\n\nDue to their poverty and primitive houses, pneumonia was the Indian's most formidable and most worrying experience was to nurse and keep the disease from spreading. Once the patient was taken to the Indian Department would arrive and check. Sister Patricia would seek his advice and learn much from her experiences.\n\nIndian children usually left school when they were too young for them to continue.\n\nShe has made a unique contribution by translating religious texts to the form of a Santeux-English primer. It is divided one to six. She started teaching English to children arrived at school speaking only Sioux. She taught them for years to teach them the language and to enable English subjects.\n\nThe Indian children usually left school when they were too young for them to continue.\n\nBesides being an expert with traps and search for the scent or paddle, she was a tireless rider of a Canadian pony and an adequate handler of a dog team. One of her greatest adventures was to ride twenty-three miles on horseback with a pack of timber wolves. The raven was the wisest bird of all.\n\nWhen winter would come earlier than usual in northern Manitoba the supply boat from Selkirk would not be able to reach her and she would live all winter without meat, potatoes, cabbage, hard tack and flour. She had no firewood except the timber corporations was a part husky, part collie dog called \"Milo\" who was very faithful and confided her troubles.\n\nAt her school Sister Patricia is assisted by natives from her Indian neighbors but she can look across the river to the town of Kenora and the Trans-Canada Highway. However, she must reach her pupils by canoe.\n\nFew women could have survived the rigors of the climate she attributes her ability to cope with the difficulties of her training as a Girl Guide in England. She is a member of the Timber wolf and game country.\n\nAnd as each passed he whispered, \"You are of course the wisest bird of all, but you must not say so to anyone that I have said so...if you were to say so...\"\n\nWhen the birds talked together afterwards, the raven said, \"I was wrong and that the raven was the wisest bird of them all.\"\n\nTHE VANCOUVER SUN MAGAZINE SUPPLEMENT PAGE 7\nBig Sister to the Indians\n\nBy ALIXE CARTER\n\nTwenty-eight years alone among northern Manitoba Indians in a work of intense volunteer service. Sister Patricia, now at the Indian school opposite Chase, east of Kindersley.\n\nSister Patricia belongs to the third working secular order of the Sisters of St. Joseph. She entered the service, and it was only her rigorous outdoor life in the north which brought her to a milder climate when she became ill. After studying for work among the Indians of the Kindersley district, and spending two years at Vancouver, she went back to Kindersley. Then to Chase where she works entirely without pay, caring for the Indians and their parents.\n\nThe three wives shine with old memories at mention of Bevens River, the home of the Southern tribes near Lake Winnipegosis. Sister Patricia has been there seventeen years, laboring sometimes under very trying conditions. She has taught, nursed and doctor, among two hundred Indians, many of whom are now dead.\n\nDue to their poverty and primitive houses, pneumonia was the Indians' greatest enemy. Her worst and most worrying experience was seeing six diphtheria cases and keeping the disease from spreading. The Indian Department would arrive only after the sickness had run its course. Sister Patricia would seek his advice and help, and carry him through another year of unforeseen illness among her people.\n\nShe has made a unique contribution to Canadian educational texts to the form of a School Textbook Dictionary for grades one to six. She discovered that the children during her teaching days, for the children could not read or speak English. It took three years of hard work to make a dictionary sufficiently well for them to tackle easily.\n\nAt the end of grade eight the Indian children usually attend school, but the family being too poor for them to continue.\n\nThen came the hunters and trappers and search for the next spring's supply of meat in the winter months. Before the second World War, Sister Patricia bought a pony from China for this medical need, but during the war disappeared, this one and others.\n\nWhen winter would come, the Indians would travel by canoe from Manitoba the supply boat from Selkirk would not be able to reach her and she would have to find a way to get her frozen potatoes, cabbage, hard tack and flour. Her best friend and most faithful companion was a horse named Mike. She spoke to Mike whom she talked and confided her troubles.\n\nBesides being an expert with ears or paws she was also an expert of a strictly religious pony and an adequate guide and a good horse of her own. She rode Mike, followed by a pack of dogs, and her lover fathered, as though he understood the distance and the manner of travel through to their destination.\n\nPatricia could have survived the life she had led, and she attributes much of her training as a Girl Guide to her experiences. She is an excellent shot, so necessary in timber wolf and game hunting.\n\nA great reader, letter writer and conversationalist, she managed to combat loneliness through the years. Her only weakness is an inability to follow three-and-a-half-hour lectures.\n\nGarbed in a brown monk's habit and a blue veil. Her hair is unshorn. Ordinarily she would wear a longer veil many years ago she found a long one got in her way while she was working and got her Archbishop's permission to shorten it. She wears rubber boots which she has specially made for her.\n\nAt her school Sister Patricia is several miles from her Indian neighbors. She lives in a house overlooking the river and sees Chase, the CFR and the Trans-Canada Highway. She lives in a house with a full basement, modern furnace, beauty, comfort and friendliness.\n\nOne of her treasures is a scrap book containing pictures sent by the Sioux, many of the herbs being extremely efficacious and easy to grow. She says she keeps a warm pair of mitts from the cold nights.\n\nSister Patricia's strong conviction is that Indians are the most most courteous people in the world. She says the Indians are more patient and persevering than the whites ever were. Only twice in her ten years experience has she had to reprimand an Indian child.\n\nIt is in these sterling qualities of patience, perseverance and kindness that Sister Patricia finds her riches and rewards. And when her chosen work will soon be finished she has chosen to re-\n\nIndian Affairs.

Vancouver, plus freight and erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses.\n\nTHAT it is considered that the provision of this school is a pressing emergency and within the exemption provided in Section 36 above recited and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the provision of this building as outlined above, this being the only arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried to completion in order that the building will be available for use by the time the next school term commences.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nActing Minister of Mines and Resources.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: New Day School - Neskainlith Reserve\n\nWill you please forward as soon as possible an accountable advance of $3,000 to Mr. Bruce to enable him to meet labour costs and costs of other services, trucking, etc., in connection with the erection of the new day school on the Neskainlith Reserve.\n\nW.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of June 9th, suggesting the transfer of Sister Patricia from the Okanagan Indian Day School to the Neskainlith Indian Day School, I reviewed our files and unless some mistake has been made in this office, there does not appear to be any correspondence indicating that the Neskainlith School has been completed.\n\nThe last correspondence we have in connection with the construction of the building, is a Credit Voucher from Indian Superintendent Bruce which reached us on March 29th, 1949. We do not appear to have received any requisition for furnishings for the teacher's living quarters.\n\nIn order that our file may be complete, we would appreciate it very much if you would arrange to have Superintendent Bruce submit a complete report at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nJune 13, 1949.\n\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Neskainlith Day School\n\nI am enclosing herewith requisitions covering school desks, teacher's desk and chair, furnishings for the teacherage and janitor supplies for the above-mentioned school which is to be opened in September.\n\nThe desks, primary table and chairs and teacher's desk and chair can be purchased in Vancouver at a cost of approximately $488.00.\n\nIt is recommended that authority be granted to arrange for purchase of the items as requested on the requisitions.\n\nW.S.

Owing to difficulty encountered by Superintendent Bruce in securing what we considered to be a suitable heating installation, I have been unable until now to advise exactly what funds would be required. We now have for consideration the attached tender from Carr & Son, covering the installation of an adequate warm air heating system, at a cost of $775.00 which I would recommend for acceptance.\n\nIn addition to this amount, the following expenditures will be required to complete the school -\n\n1. Plumbing fixtures, as per quotation from Carr & Son dated April 20th, attached.................. $360.00\n2. Labour for installation of rough plumbing and fixtures................................. $345.00\n3. Painting material and labour........................................... $445.60\n4. Carpenter work...................................................... $2000.00\n5. Deep well pump..................................................... $50.00\n\nIt will be apparent from the above that the cost of completing this School will be approximately $4090.00 and I would ask that funds to this extent be made available and that an accountable advance of $2000.00 be forwarded to\nMr. Bruce so that the building may be completed and ready for occupancy September 1st.\n\nW.S.

It will, therefore, be necessary for us to transfer additional funds, and consequently, there will be some delay in paying these two Vouchers.\n\nWe hope that no further expenditures will be necessary, and if any additional amount is required, you should advise us immediately.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6382, file 793-1, part 1)\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING JUNE, 1945, ON KWAWEWLTH INDIAN AGENCY\n\nEducation\n\nIf some temporary arrangement can be worked out, it is my intention to request the Department to open a Day School at Gilford Island and another at Turnour Island. Many children reside at both these villages but are without an opportunity of receiving an education. It is hoped the Department will keep this constantly in mind as I am very much concerned over the lack of educational facilities for so many bright Indian youngsters.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945, ON KWAKWELTH AGENCY\n\nEducation\n\nThe work in all schools referred to in my last report is being carried on satisfactorily. The attendance is exceptionally good when the families are home. In some cases the families have been living at Imperial Cannery, Steveston, working for the B.C. Packers. While the families are there, the children attend the white school through an arrangement made by this office and company officials with the school board. It is hoped that a School Inspector for the Indian Affairs Branch will be appointed and instructed to visit this agency at an early date, as the planning for the erection of new schools is being held up pending the new School Inspector's report on same to the Department. Personally I can see no need in having our plans held up pending the arrival of a School Inspector, because his report can only be arrived at after obtaining the needed information from this office, which can be readily given by myself. If the appointment of a school Inspector is delayed too long it will mean that we will not have sufficient time to plan and make the necessary arrangements to have the schools built this year. Two new schools are desperately needed - one at Turnour Island and another at Gwayasdums Reserve. In these two villages there are many children without an opportunity to be educated. This matter has been kept before the Department for sometime past, and I plead with the Department to make every effort to see that these schools are provided during the coming summer so that they may open at the beginning of the fall term. A special report is being made in connection with Gwayasdums Reserve.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 16, 1948.\n\nR.C.

Mr. Todd proposes to employ Indian labour on a day basis for demolition of the buildings, to rent a barge and to utilize Indian seine boats for hauling the barge between Fort Hardy and Gilford Island when such boats are in port over the weekend. He estimates that it will cost $600.00 to salvage and deliver to Gilford Island sufficient material for one average Indian home. As erection costs will be taken care of by the Indians themselves in most cases, and if his estimate is reasonably close the proposal is certainly economically sound. We were unable during our discussion to go into any great detail regarding the school building, but salvage and use of the materials for this purpose should be equally economical.\n\nWith regard to financing the work, there is a balance of approximately $10,000 of the appropriation for new housing, Anawakwah Agency, and so that the work may be proceeded with while the weather is good and Indian labour available I would ask that an initial advance of $5,000 from Vote 515, Allotment 13 be forwarded to Mr. Todd.\nWith regard to the school construction part of the program, I note from Mr. Phelan's letter of June 27th that transfer of $20,000 for Gilford Island has been recommended to the Treasury Board. Will you please have an initial advance of $3,000 of this amount forwarded to Mr. Todd.\n\nIf at all possible, I should appreciate a communication from you by wire as to whether or not this proposal is approved so that work may be commenced immediately, and if necessary, prior to the receipt of the advances requested.\n\nW.S.

We have yet to secure from Mr. Todd an estimate of the cost of completing the Alert Bay day school and although I had hoped to be able to advise you the total amount of funds which should be transferred from some other project for the completion of schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency, rather than delay the matter further I would recommend that an amount of $3000 be made available now for completion of the Campbell River and Turnour Island day schools, but in the absence of information with respect to the specific provisions made for school construction at various points this year cannot suggest from which proposed school the funds should be transferred.\n\nMr. Todd, in his letter attached, requests an accountable advance of $2500 for the Turnour Island School. It is thought that this amount will be in excess of his requirements as part of the estimated cost is for material. I would recommend that an advance of $2000 be forwarded to him as soon as possible. The completion of the Alert Bay Day school will be the subject of a separate communication at an early date.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.

These two\ncarpenters have just left Englewood where they have been working and\nhave offered to do this work for us before going to Vancouver providing\nwe can give them a reply within a week.\n\nI have carefully perused Turnour Island project and am satisfied\nit can be completed within the estimate of $2500.00. I made a trip to\nTurnour Island yesterday to check on the material on the spot and find\nthat some is missing.\n\nAlthough no orders or vouchers passed through this office; never-\ntheless, I am of the opinion that the blackboards and rails for same for\nthis school were purchased and shipped to Port Hardy. During my visit\nyesterday I could not locate any blackboards and would therefore suggest\nthat you 'phone the Surveys and Engineering Branch and ascertain whether\nthese blackboards were purchased and if so, where they are stored. If\nthey have no knowledge of same, then order sufficient blackboards for the\nschool immediately.\n\nI also found other materials short but will try and locate them\nat the Army Camp. There is no galvanized pipe to install the plumbing.\nThere is none in storage any place and this will have to be purchased.\nPlease 'phone Col. Whyte and ask him to give you an estimate of how much\npipe and the size required and arrange to have it purchased in Vancouver\nand shipped to me at Alert Bay. All other fittings can be procurred out\nof stores here.\n\np.t.o.\nI do not know if you have been advised what funds have been provided for schools as yet, but as this is our only chance of getting this school completed and have it ready for September 1st, I would kindly ask that you communicate with Ottawa, if necessary, and obtain approval for the expenditure of $2500.00, and have the accountable cheque for this amount forwarded this office. These men will wait for their money a short time but it is necessary to receive approval to proceed within a week, in which case I will start the men and the money can be forwarded thereafter.\n\nThe men I refer to above will finish all the carpentry work, install the electrical wiring and paint the building. I will have to get someone else to do the plumbing, but this can be done after the other work is completed.\n\nI am writing at some length because it is necessary that we have immediate action on this and obtain the Department's approval to go ahead, otherwise I can hold out no hope of having the school ready for September 1st, and for this reason I am asking you to communicate with Ottawa by wire to obtain their approval so that we will not take any chance of not having the school ready.\n\nTime sheets will be prepared and men paid from this office, so please arrange to have the accountable cheque forwarded as quickly as possible, and any unexpended balance would, of course, be returned to the Department.\n\n(W.

Estimated cost - $500. All this work can be done with local labour and it is understood you will have the matter attended to when you are advised that the necessary transfer of funds has been made.\n\n(2) Turnour Island Day School - your estimate of the cost of completing this school is $2500. As in the case of the Campbell River school the work can be completed with local labour under your supervision when the necessary transfer of funds is made.\n\n(3) Alert Bay Day School - It is understood that the work necessary to complete these buildings consists of exterior painting, installation of plumbing and insulation of ceilings. It is understood that Mr. Scanlon can attend to the matter of insulation and that the only cost involved will be for material. Will you please let me have an estimate of the cost of material. With respect to the painting, etc., will you please submit a tender covering completion of this work under contract.\n\nOn receipt of estimates of the costs of completing the three school projects above mentioned, arrangements will be made for transfer of the necessary funds.\nWith respect to the Cape Mudge School, we are presently ascertaining how many of the senior pupils can be accommodated at the local white school with a view to determining whether a one or two classroom school is necessary.\n\n-W.S.

C.,\nJune 22nd, 1948.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRE: TURNOUR ISLAND SCHOOL\n\nSince I have received a request to take charge and supervise the completion of the Turnour Island School and Teacherage, I have perused the concluding report of the Surveys and Engineering Branch which was submitted at the end of the fiscal year when they closed down work on this project. I have also inspected the work done and wish to make the following report.\n\nWhen the Department approved of the construction of this school they requested School Inspector Davey and myself to visit the village and pick out a suitable site. This we did during 1947 prior to any construction being undertaken. A few years ago the Department, with the cooperation of the Indians, built a good domestic water system. At that time we located a natural spring up a ravine a short distance from the village. A dam was built and the water was piped to the village. This was done without the services of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, who were not called upon at that time. Since the site was particularly kept in mind having the school and teacherage located in a position whereby it would not be higher than our dam, so that the water could gravity feed into the school, the same as in the homes in the village. We also picked an alternative site in case the Engineers found the first choice was too high.\n\nBefore going on sick leave I went to Mr. McClure who was in charge of the construction for the Surveys and Engineering Branch and requested him to check on the height to see if such that the water could gravity feed into the new school. I also told him that the Chief and other principal members of the band assisted Inspector Davey and myself and knew the exact sites we had chosen, and to see them before starting construction if there was any doubt as to the location. It was particularly emphasized the importance of having the right site to that we could get water to the school.\n\nWhen I returned to duty I found that Mr. McClure had never checked to see whether water could reach the school - in fact, he built the school in a different site entirely, further up on a hill and now it is impossible to get water into the school from our present water system unless the Department goes to some expense of installing a pump and tank or finding a new supply of water which could be gravity fed to the school.\n\nIn the Surveys and Engineering Branch final report they give the impression this school and teacherage is practically completed and that the work can be finished by Indians. The facts are four walls were built and the roof put on. The exterior carpentry work is not completed neither is the painting. Only a few panels on the interior were temporarily nailed up. These were done in such a manner that they will all have to be removed as none of them fit. The floor has not been finished. No interior panels, insulation, partitions or that portion of the teacherage or school room have been installed. In fact, most of the school has yet to be built. The engineers have suggested that the plumbing, wiring and finishing, which is always considered technical and skilled work, be done by Indians. This is their recommendation.\n\np.t.o.\nThe original plan of the school was to have the classroom facing south and the teacherage built in the north end of the building. For some unknown reason the whole plan of this school was changed so that the classroom was put on the north end of the building thus reducing maximum light in the classroom, and the teacherage built on the south end. The living-room and kitchen of the plan received a few days ago shows that they face the forest. These two rooms should face the sea.\n\nIf the Surveys and Engineering Branch did not intend to complete this project and were going to ask the Indian Affairs Branch to complete same, why did they not say so when they closed down construction work?\n\nWhen the Indians learned the work on this school was discontinuing, they came to me and offered to work saying they would wait for their money, if necessary, and pointed out that they had time before going fishing to complete the work. I informed the Indians at that time that the work was slowing down only on account of it being the end of our fiscal year and that assurance had been given me through the Commissioner's Office that the work would be resumed in the new fiscal year and the school completed by the Surveys and Engineering Branch in time for opening on September 1st. The Indians are now going fishing and nothing has been done in regard to finishing the school, and I have been requested to take over the work and have it completed.\n\nThe Engineering Branch, if they have any plans, have not submitted them in respect to the plumbing and wiring. I also find we are short some materials which will have to be purchased.\n\nIf the Department will give me authority to go ahead and finish the school without referring it to the engineers, which would only delay completion, and provide sufficient money, I will undertake to complete it and have it ready for September 1st. This is going to be very difficult without necessary Agency staff, but I will do my best under the circumstances.\n\n(M. S.

C.\n\nRE: TURNOUR ISLAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nAs the Department is aware, this school was built in a location by the Surveys and Engineering Branch other than that arranged by School Inspector Davey and myself. The location chosen by the Surveys and Engineering Branch would not permit water reaching the school from the village domestic water system. It was, therefore, necessary to build a dam farther up the mountain in order to gravity feed water to the school.\n\nThis winter while the Indians were home they offered to do this work, and as this was the only opportunity we had, I arranged for them to do same. The work is now nearly completed and I attach hereto pay sheets covering wages for the month of March, 1949, together with vouchers #355-#364, and would kindly ask that the Department approve of this and forward individual cheques as per vouchers attached to this office for transmission to the Indians concerned.\n\nThis is in line with our recent conversation while I was in your office.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEncs.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Superintendent Todd's letter of March 31st and Kwawkewlth Agency Vouchers Nos. 241 and 355 to 364 inclusive, totalling $574.70 covering material and labour for the extension of the domestic water supply system on Turnour Island, to provide a domestic water supply for the new school.\n\nMr. Todd mentions in his letter that this work, which was not specifically authorized, was discussed with me in this Office, but I would like to point out that it was discussed after the work was completed. I informed Mr. Todd that it was not known whether funds could be made available to meet the cost of the work which he had undertaken but that the vouchers when received would be referred to the Department.\n\nThe cost of this project would appear to be a legitimate charge against either the Education Vote or the Agencies Vote in that the extension of the pipeline provides water to the School and the improvements to the storage facilities will provide an improved water supply for the village.\n\nI would recommend that the Department endeavour to make funds available for payment of vouchers enclosed from either Vote 516 or Vote 511, or both.\n\nW.S.

Volume 6382, file 794-5, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAcknowledging your letter of April 21st last, file #794-5(E.1),\nI beg to advise you as follows:\n\nTurnour Island School was built by the Engineers in a location\nother than determined by School Inspector Davey and myself, thus\ndepriving the school of a domestic water supply from the village\ndomestic water system. Last year the Department provided funds to\ncomplete the school which included plumbing and wiring for electric\nlights. Indians were asked to finish this project. We completed\nthe school with the exception of the plumbing and electric wiring,\nas agreed; but when the school teacher arrived with his family and\nfound there was no water available and that it had to be carried in\na pail for some considerable distance, they refused to stay unless\na water system was put in.\n\nI was, therefore, faced with taking some action, and the late\nCol. Whyte of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and Commissioner\nArneil visited the school during 1948 during construction. The late\nCol. Whyte stated the only solution was to build another dam farther\nup the mountain and connect it with the present system, thus giving\nsufficient height for water to gravity feed into the school. Rather\nthan put in the electric lights and sewerage system out of the funds\nmade available, I used some of this money to build this new dam\nemploying Indians to carry out the work. As we had to do the work\nwhen Indian labour was available, the work was proceeded with during\nthe month of March.\n\nI informed the Indians I did not have sufficient funds to\ncomplete the job, and they said rather than not see the water system\nput into the school, they would continue working and wait for their\nmoney, if necessary, so long as I guaranteed they would be paid\neventually. As it was near the end of the fiscal year, there was\n\np.t.o.\nnot sufficient time for me to place the matter before the Department and complete it, and as the Indians would not be available later, it was imperative that we proceed at once.\n\nThe whole project is now practically completed and in a few days we will have water in the school. On April 26th last Commissioner Arneil and School Inspector Davey visited Turnour Island Indian Day School, and Commissioner Arneil saw what we had accomplished, and I think was pleased with the work of the Indians and what we have accomplished for the expenditure.\n\nDuring the end of our fiscal year I discussed this matter with the Commissioner's Office and they advised me to forward my accounts up to the end of the year and write a covering letter, which I did. I cannot give you exactly the amount still owing on this project as I have not received the payroll as yet. We have had to buy two hundred lineal feet of 1/2\" galvanized pipe and a few fittings. This, together with the payroll will be the total cost of the balance due. I shall give you a further report in a few days when the project is finished.\n\nIn addition to this approximately $500.00 will have to be provided to put in our sewerage and plumbing in the school itself together with the wiring of the building for electric lights. This will complete Turnour Island School, and I believe will turn out to be one of the cheapest schools and teacherage the Department have built in the Province.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\n11th May, 1949.\n\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the Turnour Island Day School. We have carefully noted the contents of your letter, but the Department still feels, and I think you will agree, that it was possible for you to obtain our authority before proceeding with the work.\n\nIn these days of rapid methods of communication, it is only very exceptional cases that warrant a Superintendent's proceeding with work without first obtaining authority. I feel certain that you appreciate our position in the matter and will conform with our wishes in the future.\n\nWith special reference to the last paragraph of your letter, it is evident that you consider that an additional expenditure of $500.00 should be made over and above the balance of the expenses which you have already incurred without authority.\n\nOn reviewing our file, I cannot find that you have written us with reference to installing sewerage and plumbing in the school itself together with the wiring of the building for electric lights.

(RG 10, Volume 6382, file 794-5, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Turnour Island Day School Water System\nYour file 794-5 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of April 21st and Supt. Todd's reply thereto, enclosed herewith is Kwawkewlth voucher No. 421 in the amount of $12.10 covering the supply of additional material for extension of the domestic water supply system at Turnour Island to the day school.\n\nI note from Mr. Todd's letter that at that time he was unable to advise what funds would be required to meet the balance of the cost of this work and this information has still not been provided. The attached account is small, however, and it is recommended for payment and if funds are not available from the Education Vote the expenditure might be charged against the $2000 provided in the Estimates this year under the Agency Vote.\n\n-W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of Airmail letter dated May 11th last, file #794-5 (E.1) relative to Turnour Island Indian Day School, received from the Superintendent of Education.\n\nIn my letter dated May 3rd, 1949, sent direct to Ottawa, copy of which was forwarded your office, I stated it would take approximately $500.00 to complete the sewerage, plumbing and electrical installation. Since then I have had time to go into the cost more thoroughly and find it will take approximately $700.00 to complete the above work.\n\nAs this school has been built almost entirely by Indians who, incidently, have done a splendid job; I am now most anxious that it be completed before the fishing season starts. Yesterday Mr. Tom Smith, who has been our foreman on the construction work and is a very capable man, checked very carefully with me the small amount of materials required to be purchased that cannot be supplied from the Army Camp Stores, together with the cost of labour. As near as we can estimate the total expenditure to complete the school will be as above stated, and I am requesting the Department to give immediate approval for the expenditure of $700.00 to cover this work.\n\nI am not asking for an accountable advance but rather authority to proceed with the work and submit vouchers covering the expenditure. Mr. Tom Smith and Oly Shaughnessy will be installing the plumbing and sewerage. These Indians have a short time available to do the work before starting fishing and it is imperative that we act quickly otherwise nothing can be done until next November when the fishing season is over. The teacher and his family will be remaining at the village all summer and I feel we owe it to them to make this installation at once, particularly when we have the water now in the school and there is nothing to prevent us from proceeding with the work.\n\np.t.o.\nWould you, therefore, please refer the matter to Ottawa by Airmail and request Col. Neary, if approved, to wire me direct if I may proceed with the work at once.\n\nAs I have a large building program on this year I am very anxious that we complete this school and be through with it so that I can give my full attention to other work.\n\nYour kind and early attention to this will be greatly appreciated.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nc.c. enclosed for Ottawa.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Turnour Island Day School\nYour file 794-5 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 11th to Supt. Todd regarding expenditures incurred in connection with the above-mentioned school, particularly the extension of the water system to serve the building, you will note from Mr. Todd's letter of May 17th attached that an expenditure of $700 will be required to complete the sewerage, plumbing and electrical installations. This work should be completed this year despite the fact that no specific provision was made in the Estimates.\n\nI would recommend that the required funds be transferred from the balance of the appropriation for the Alberni classroom block and that Mr. Todd be authorized to have the work proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\nW.S.

Todd on April 3rd from which you will note that he has an opportunity of having additional playground space cleared by a bulldozer at the Turnour Island Day School at an approximate cost of $650.00:\n\n\"Caterpillar now available to clear site for Turner Island Day School playground which is essential. This school cost Six Hundred and Fifty Dollars recommend this expenditure and accountable advance for above amount be forwarded from next year's appropriation after April first caterpillar leaving district in few days only opportunity this year Wire reply.\"\n\nThis is one of several urgent requests for funds received from Mr. Todd since early in March and why these matters could not have been attended to prior to that time we do not know.\n\nIn the case of the Turnour Island Day School playground, we knew and Mr. Todd knew prior to March that there was a bulldozer in the vicinity but we were not aware that additional clearing at Turnour Island was necessary. The fact remains, however, that if we do not take advantage of the availability of the bulldozer it may be another year before an opportunity presents. I would recommend that if possible the Department approve the expenditure requested and I have no doubt that if funds cannot be made immediately available arrangements for payment of the cost later in the month could be made. If the expenditure is approved we will advise the Department of the name of the owner of the bulldozer and the operating cost when this information is received from Mr. Todd.\n\nW.S.

C.\n\nIn your letter dated March 8th, file 156/6-1-794 you informed this office the Department had approved an expenditure of $700.00 for clearing and levelling playgrounds in the above mentioned school.\n\nIt is regretted due to an oversight this work was not undertaken before the year end. I am now informed a caterpillar will be available later this spring, and I am recommending that approval be given for an expenditure of $700.00 for clearing and levelling these playgrounds and that this office be advised so that arrangements could be made to have the work done when the caterpillar is available.\n\n(W. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Turnour Island Indian Day School.\n\nI sent you an army signal message on April 13th regarding the clearing of playground space at the Turnour Island school and advised that the expenditure of $700.00 approved in your message of March 8th was sufficient and that a voucher would be submitted in time for payment from last year's funds.\n\nThis advice was based on information received by telephone from Mr. Todd, but his letter of April 17th, attached indicates that he was misinformed as apparently no clearing had been done and funds will be required to meet the cost of the work this year. Mr. Todd anticipates that a bulldozer will again be available in the vicinity of Turnour Island and in order that we may take advantage of this would ask that an accountable advance of $700.00 be forwarded to him.\n\nW.

Your File 156/6-1-794\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th ultimo in which you advise that Superintendent Todd was unable to arrange for the clearing of the playground space at the above school.\n\nIn view of the present situation, the Department considers it advisable to have more definite information before authorizing any expenditure for the work. Please let us know the size of the plot of ground that Mr. Todd wishes to clear, and also the approximate number of hours that it will be necessary to have a bulldozer and the rate per hour.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Todd has advised that the area is approximately 250' x 350' and estimates that it will take approximately seven 8-hour days at $11.00 per hour for the bulldozer and operator. Will you please have the accountable advance requested forwarded to him.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nJune 14th, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Turnour Island Indian Day School, Your File 156/6-1-794\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th instant with reference to clearing playground space at the above school. It is noted that Superintendent Todd wishes to clear approximately 2 acres at a cost of over $600.00.\n\nWhy is it necessary to clear so much ground for the playground? A considerably smaller space should be sufficient. No funds were specifically provided for this purpose in the current year's appropriation. However, we are prepared to allow an amount not exceeding $176.00. This would mean that he could use the bulldozer and operator for two days during which time it should be possible to clear sufficient land for a playground for this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Turnour Island Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of June 14th (file 794-5) regarding the clearing of playground space at the above mentioned school, the Provincial Dept. of Education ordinarily requires three to five acres of playground space for a two-room school. An addition to the proposed one room school at Turnour Island is contemplated within the next few years and it is considered that sufficient playground space might as well be cleared at this time.\n\nIf it is a matter of securing funds, we do not anticipate that the whole amount provided for the two-room school at Gilford Island will be expended and $600 could be transferred from this source.\n\nW.

This would release more space in Fraser Lake Residential School for children from reserves not large enough to warrant day school activity.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nNovember 20th, 1946.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: your file No. 163-1-1 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 20th and further to my report of October 12th last in connection with the truancy situation at Lejac Indian Residential School. I wish to advise that Adanas Alexis of the Stony Creek Band, one of the parents who failed to return his children to School, and also influenced and prevented others from doing so, was prosecuted by Corporal L.F. Fielder of the local detachment of the R.C.M.P., and fined $2.00 and costs.\n\nFollowing the prosecution, Corporal Fielder and Farming Instructor Andros made numerous patrols involving considerable time and expense, and apprehended and conveyed a number of absentees to the School. The School quota has now been reached, and the Reverend Principal advises that he can only accommodate about four more children.\n\nMay I suggest that the Department forward a letter to the Officer Commanding the R.C.M.P. at Vancouver, B.C., commending the services, tact and good judgement rendered by Corporal Fielder in carrying out a disagreeable and difficult task.\n\nThe majority of the Stony Creek Band are extremely bitter and resentful at having to return their children to the Residential School. I have had several meetings and many delegations from the Band in this connection, urging that a Day School be established on the reserve. In view of the attitude of the Stony Creek Band towards the local Indian residential School, and the fact that there are considerable number of children at home between the ages of 7 and 16 years who are not receiving an education, I would strongly urge the establishment of a Day School at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe Band are most anxious to cooperate and agree to turn over the Band recreation hall for School purposes, until such time as the Department is in the position to construct a new building. The hall was constructed last year, and with some minor alterations, it would be quite suitable for the purpose.\n\nI would appreciate having the Department's attitude towards the proposal so that I may be in the position to advise the Band.\n\nR.

We gave him authority to enforce the compulsory clause of the Act as a number of children from the Stony Creek Band did not return to the Lejac Residential School upon the expiry of their summer holidays.\n\nThe School has now reached its quota and Mr. Howe recommends that the Officer Commanding at Vancouver, B.C., be advised that we appreciated the services tact and good judgment rendered by Cpl. Fielder. Please convey our appreciation in this regard.\n\nWe wrote you recently regarding the situation that developed with the Stony Creek Indians. Evidently they are insistent that a day school be established on their reserve and Mr. Howe states they are prepared to turn over their recreation hall to be used for school purposes until such time as the Department is in a position to construct a new building. The Agent states that the hall, with some minor alterations would be quite suitable for school purposes.\n\nPlease let us have your comments on Mr. Howe's suggestion. Possibly it would be preferable to let the matter stand until the new inspector has an opportunity to visit the Stuart Lake Agency. The question of securing a teacher also arises. The 1944 census shows that all members of the Stony Creek Band are listed as Roman Catholics. Would it be possible to secure a Roman Catholic teacher in the event of this school being opened in the band's hall? Mr. Howe has not supplied any information\nregarding living quarters for a teacher.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 163-1-1 (W.T.I.)\n\nI have your letter of November 26th in which you refer to the truancy situation at the Lejac Indian Residential School, and the question of establishing a day school on the Stony Indian Reserve.\n\nIn regard to the first mentioned item it would appear that the situation has been composed to some extent, for the time being at any rate, the school having reached its quota.\n\nWith respect to the matter of establishing a day school at the Stony Reserve, it will be noted that in July last Mr. Indian Agent Howe reported some 249 children of school age in his Agency not attending any school, 21 of whom were from the Stony Creek Reserve. Mr. Howe also showed 41 children from this reserve enrolled at the Lejac Indian Residential school and 44 children under seven years of age at home in the village. It is clear from the information submitted by Mr. Howe that the Lejac Indian Residential School cannot meet the school needs of the Stuart Lake Agency and consequently consideration should be given to the establishment of day schools where indicated to provide the necessary accommodation.\n\nReverting to the proposed school at Stony Reserve, it is not seen, now that we have entered the second half of the school year, how a school can be organized and the services of a teacher secured and anything worthwhile accomplished before the term ends on June 30th. The writer feels, however, that in view of the situation and the difficulties in securing materials for new school buildings we should take advantage of the offer of the Stony Indians of their recreation hall and make the necessary arrangements for its use for school\npurposes. With this in mind I am writing to Mr. Howe requesting the following information:\n\n(1) An estimate of the cost of materials and labour required to make the building suitable for school purposes.\n\n(2) The possibility of securing the services of a qualified Roman Catholic teacher in the area in the event of the school being opened.\n\n(3) The possibility of the teacher securing board and lodging with nearby white settlers and if this is not possible what can be provided in the way of suitable quarters for the teacher on the Reserve.\n\n(4) The number of children of the Stony Creek Band, excluding those in attendance at the Lejac School, available to attend the new school in the event of its being opened.\n\nI will communicate again with the Department on this matter following receipt of Mr. Howe's report.\n\n/EW\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nJanuary 24th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: your file No. 218-13-5936.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter dated December 3rd, 1946, which relates to the establishment of a Day School on the Stony Creek I.R. As requested, an estimate of the cost of materials and labour required to make the recreational hall suitable for school purposes is submitted hereunder:\n\n1. Insulated brick siding for sheeting exterior walls - material only ........................................... $447.00\n2. 30' brick chimney @ $4.00 per foot including material and labour ........................................... $120.00\n3. Heater and stove-pipes ........................................... $28.00\n\nTOTAL ........................................... $692.00\n\nLabour sheeting the buildings will be done by the Band without cost to the Department. The Band have also acquired 5,000 B.F. Shiplap and about $170.00 towards construction of a three room house for use of the teacher. Chief Antoine advises that construction of the house will proceed in the Spring. This project is being undertaken by the Indians on the Band without authority or advice from the Office. It is possible that the Department may have to provide some finishing materials and furnishings for the quarters. In addition to the above, desks and other school equipment will be required. The Department will no doubt have data on hand with respect to cost of desks and school equipment.\n\nThere are at present 66 children of school age in the Stony Creek Band. 33 of this number are in attendance at the Lejac Indian Residential School, leaving 33 at home who are not receiving the benefit of an education. Referring to paragraph 4 of your letter, may I point out that in event of the establishment of a Day School on this reserve, it would be very difficult indeed to enforce attendance at Lejac School for those who are now enrolled at Lejac. With the exception of a few orphan and underprivileged children, the parents would undoubtedly insist on the children attending the Day School.\n\nThere is no possibility of securing the services of a teacher in this district for the current term, but Mr. J. Wilson, a teacher at one of the local White Schools is interested, and his services can be available for the 1947-48 term, commencing September 1st next. Mr. Wilson is a Bachelor, aged about 50 years and a Roman Catholic. He holds a Grade Teacher's Certificate, and has taught school in the province for the past 20 years. In my opinion, he is a very suitable candidate for Indian School work. In this connection, will the Department please\nadvise as to salary and allowances payable to teachers in this category, and also, whether they come under the provisions of the Civil Service and Superannuation Acts.\n\nIn view of the opposition and antagonism displayed by the Stony Creek Band towards the Lejac Indian Residential School in recent years, and the extreme difficulty experienced in enforcing attendance at Lejac, I would strongly urge that authority be granted to proceed with the necessary improvements to the Recreation Hall and that a teacher be engaged to open the Bay School September 1st next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

If not, the matter may be left until after March 31st. In any case the building should be in readiness for the beginning of the school term on September 1st, 1947.\n\nD. M.

I have had many opportunities for observing the work carried on in these schools by Mr. Wilson, and can, unhesitatingly, recommend him as a teacher of more than average ability. For the past two years Mr. Wilson has been engaged in teaching the Senior Grades in the Kamloops City Elementary Schools where he has met with a large measure of success as a member of the staff directing the platoon system of teaching carried on in these schools.\n\nMr. Wilson has a pleasing personality, which, in addition to resourceful and stimulating teaching methods, easily wins for him the hearty cooperation of his pupils in the class-room.

He was under my immediate supervision, and I wish to say that his methods and skill were highly satisfactory. Particularly would I like to mention the successful manner in which he made use of the energies of the pupils in varied and interesting types of Handwork, and in managing the school forest, which was planted with about five thousand pines. In addition, under his instruction, the boys build a fine log cabin after the Canadian fashion.\n\nHis great interest in child life was further displayed in his various position in the Scout movement of Tumut.\n\nI have much pleasure in recommending Mr. Wilson to those who may require his services.\n\n(signed) R.H.

During the period he has been with us I have found him to be a very capable teacher, and a disciplinarian of high order. The result of his good work in class is very evident. Together with his main subject - mathematics, he was Editor of the College magazine. In this work he organized a boy's editorial staff with very desirable results.\n\nAt all times I have found him to be a consistent and enthusiastic master.

Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nRe: your file 215-13-6683\n\nI wish to refer to the last paragraph of your letter dated February 28th, and to enclose herewith, application of Mr. J.A. Wilson, Teacher, Willowvale, B.C., for the position of Teacher at the new Day School to be established at the Stony Creek I.R., commencing September next.\n\nAlso enclosed, a number of testimonials from various sources, testifying to Mr. Wilson's qualifications. I would also point out that the applicant has been granted a first class permanent certificate by the B.C. Department of Education.\n\nMr. Wilson is receiving a salary of $1,700.00 at his present School, consisting of 12 pupils and I understand that there is an excellent possibility he will be offered a position at the Vanderhoof Public School at a salary of $1,600.00 for the next term. In view of this, and also that the Stony Creek School will consist of about 45 pupils, of various grades, I doubt if Mr. Wilson will consider less than $2,000.00 per annum.\n\nThe applicant would also like to know definitely whether he would be eligible to come under the provisions of the Superannuation Act.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Wilson is a very suitable teacher for Indian School work, and I would strongly recommend his appointment.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6382, file 795-1, part 1)\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 25, 1947\n\nMemorandum\nTo: Indian Commissioner\nFrom: School Inspector\n\nRe: Application of Mr. J.A. Wilson\nfor the position of teacher,\nStony Creek I.R.\n\nMr. Wilson's application indicates that he is well qualified for this position, but it seems unlikely that the Department will be willing to pay a salary which will be acceptable to him.\n\nAt the present time the highest salary paid in an Indian Day School in this Province is $1450.00, plus living accommodation. I am not familiar with the salaries which are being paid in the area in which Mr. Wilson is now teaching but believe that it is in the neighbourhood of $1500.00 per year for a teacher without experience. This would indicate that Mr. Wilson will certainly be able to secure an appointment in which the salary is in the neighbourhood of $2000.00.\n\nOn the occasion of my recent visit to the Skeena River Agency where conditions are comparable I was informed by the Provincial Inspector that the lowest salary paid in his inspectorate is $170.00 per year, which applies to qualified teachers without experience. In addition to this, provision is made for annual increments of $100.00 up to $2400.00. In 50 of the 72 organized school districts in B.C. a salary scheme is now in operation under which teachers in elementary schools have a beginning salary of $1300.00, and a maximum of $2400.00 with annual increments of $100.00. This indicates that the Department will have to institute some similar scheme if it is to secure and retain qualified teachers for the Indian Day Schools. In view of this I would recommend that a schedule of teachers' salaries be drawn up along the lines of the one used in the majority of the Provincial schools. This schedule is known in British Columbia.\nas the B.C. Teachers' Federation Schedule.\n\nI am not prepared to recommend that Mr. Wilson be appointed at the salary of $2000.00 per annum as suggested by Mr. Howe. Under the \"Basic Salary Schedule for Grant Purposes\" as recommended in the Cameron Report and used by the Department in setting teachers' salaries in the past Mr. Wilson would receive a salary of $1650.00 per annum. This amount is lower than his present salary.\n\nR.F. Davey\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6382, file 795-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Indian Day School - Stony Creek Reserve\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of April 12th (file 163-7-1 W T), Mr. J. A. Wilson has withdrawn his application for the position of teacher at the Stony Creek Day School as he does not consider that the remuneration is sufficient.\n\nDistrict School Inspector Davey will contact Bishop Jordan's office with a view to having the Bishop nominate a qualified Roman Catholic teacher.\n\nFor D.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIndian Day School - Stony Creek Reserve\n\nReference your 215-13-6944 of March 31\n\nAccording to our new teachers' salary scale,\nan advance copy of which I attach for your information,\nMr. Wilson could be classified as a Grade 3 teacher and his\nstarting salary would be $1,560 a year. To this of course\nwe would add whatever janitor's fees you would deem neces-\nsary in this new school.\n\nIt is not our intention to classify teachers\nas welfare teachers unless we have the specific recom-\nmendation of the Agent and Commissioner concerned. You will\nnote that Mr. Wilson, if so classified, would be entitled\nto $1,800 a year.\n\nFurther details concerning the salary scale\nwill be printed in the forthcoming issue of the School\nBulletin. However, I would like to point out that British\nColumbia has been the most difficult province to deal with\nin regard to teachers' salaries. Provincial salaries are\nmuch higher than in any other province except Ontario. As\na result, our salary scale is much higher than the scale,\nfor example, for the province of Nova Scotia and probably\nlower than most school board scales in British Columbia.\nI hope to have an opportunity of discussing this with you\npersonally on your intended visit to Ottawa.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 163-7-1 (WTD)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of February 25th in connection with the establishment of an Indian Day School on Stony Creek Reserve, Stuart Lake Agency, and in particular the proposed appointment of Mr. J.A. Wilson as teacher, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Howe's letter of March 17th and enclosures referred to therein, together with a memorandum dated March 25th from School Inspector Davey. It will be observed it is Mr. Howe's opinion that Mr. Wilson would not be interested in a salary less than $2000.00 per annum and that he will have no difficulty in securing a salary equal to or in excess of this amount at a Provincial Public School, but that Inspector Davey is not prepared to recommend salary at this rate.\n\nIn the final paragraph of Mr. Neary's letter above referred to it is noted that on receipt of an application from Mr. Wilson a decision will be made as to what salary may be allowed him.\n\nD.

Authority for this expenditure has not yet been received.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Howe has now submitted requisitions for finishing materials for the teacherage, furnishings, etc. which are briefly detailed as follows:\n\n(1) The Indians are at present constructing a 20x20', 3 roomed teacherage and have supplied all rough material and labour so far. The Dept. intimated that they would be prepared to supply finishing materials for this teacherage and Mr. Howe has submitted the attached tender covering both material and labour as the finishing was apparently beyond the skill of the Indians.\n\nTender for material and labour for finishing residence..........................$628.73\n\n(2) Construction of a chimney in the teacherage as per attached tender.............................$5.00\n\n(3) Supply of a suitable heater for the classroom $74.60\n\nTotal.... $717.73\nFor your information I would advise that commitments made with respect to expenditures in connection with this school since April 1st, this year are:\n\n(1) Purchase of Brick siding for classroom........$489.24\nA voucher covering this item has already been submitted.\n\n(2) Construction of a brick chimney in the classroom .... 110.00\nAn order has been placed covering this item.\n\n(3) Purchase of classroom furnishings and supplies..690.00\nThis item was previously recommended to the Department.\n\nIn addition to the expenditures above mentioned the Department will be called upon to provide furniture for the teachers' residence, an estimate of the cost of which is not available yet.\n\nI should appreciate being advised if it will be in order to proceed with the expenditures necessary to make this school and teachers' ready for use in September.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 14th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant purchase order 21210 was issued on July 17th, 1947 and forwarded to Messrs. Smith, Davidson and Wright, Ltd., 1198 Homer St., Vancouver, covering the items mentioned on the requisition which you forwarded with your letter of June 20th. It is realized that we should have sent the copy of the purchase order to you but apparently it was sent to Mr. Howe. As you now have the address of the firm and the purchase order number you can check with them and ascertain if they have shipped the items.\n\nApproval is granted for the following expenditures in connection with the teacher's residence:\n\n(1) Material and labour for finishing residence - $628.73\n(2) Construction of chimney - $85.00\n(3) Purchase of a heater for classroom - $74.60\n\nThese expenditures are authorized on the understanding that you are reasonably assured that the services of a teacher can be secured for the academic year 1947-48.\n\nBernard F.

I was unable to secure the service of a carpenter, so I engaged Chief Antoine, who is handy with tools and performed a fairly good job.\n\nThe Chief has given unstintingly of his time and labour towards the project, far more than any other Member of the Band, and if it were not for his efforts we would not have been able to open the School on October 1st.\n\nI might add that Carpenters command $1.50 per hour in this district.\n\nAntoine is urgently in need of funds. It will be appreciated if this voucher can be dealt with by Air Mail.\n\nA. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/jf\nencl:\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Stony Creek Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of August 14th (file 163-7-5 WT 1), approving various expenditures in connection with the above mentioned Indian Day School, I am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Howe's letter of October 2nd and Stuart Lake Agency voucher No. 804 in the amount of $20.00 in favour of J. J. Antoine.\n\nThe expenditure covered by this voucher is in addition to those mentioned in Mr. Neary's letter and in view of the information given by Mr. Howe is recommended for approval.\n\nIt should be observed that the tender of Bowman's Lumber Yard submitted under cover of my letter of August 9th, although including labour in connection with the installation of doors and windows, did not include labour for other finishing work.\n\nD. W. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAirmail:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Howe has requested supply of a\nteacher's desk and two chairs for the Stony Creek\nIndian Day School.\n\nA suitable desk is obtainable in Vancouver at an\napproximate cost of $55, and chairs at $7. each.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would authorize\nan expenditure of approximately $70. for the purchase\nof these items.\n\nMr. Howe has also requested two cupboards with\nshelves for storing stationery, but it would appear to\nme that he should be able to arrange for construction\nof these locally. I am unable to give an estimate of\nthe cost, but would suggest that local construction\nof cupboards be approved at a cost not exceeding $50.\n\nD. N.

Costs have risen several times, however, since the order was placed but even so $15.10 is in excess of other suppliers' prices at the moment, Clarke & Stuart's current price for No.3 desks being $14.55. If the Department so desires the matter will be taken up with Smith Davidson and Wright.\n\n-W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 22 JUNE 1948\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 9th June, 1948, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat it is immediately necessary, and funds are provided in the 1948-49 estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, to provide a one-room Indian day school with attached teacher's residence on the Stony Creek Indian Reserve, Williams Lake Indian Agency, in the Province of British Columbia;\n\nThat it is essential that educational facilities be provided for the Indian children on the Stony Creek Indian Reserve;\n\nThat Section 36 of the Public Works Act, Chapter 166, R.S.C. 1927, provides in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any works are to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the Minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such works except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest . . . . . .\";\n\nThat, due to the very isolated situation of this reserve, there are no builders or contractors in the area nor are outside contractors interested in tenders if invited as aforesaid, as they have all the work they can do in their own localities;\n\nThat a competent building company, namely Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, has agreed to undertake the provision of a prefabricated school with attached teacher's residence immediately on a basis of $5,550.00 f.o.b. Vancouver, plus freight and erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses;\n\nThat it is considered that the provision of this school is a pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above recited and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted for the provision of this building as outlined above, this being the only arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried to completion in order that the building will be available for use by the time the next school term commences.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR ONE-ROOM SCHOOL AND ATTACHED TEACHER'S QUARTERS TO BE PREFABRICATED BY PREFABRICATED STRUCTURES, Ltd., VANCOUVER, B.C., FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH, DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\n(1) GENERAL - Good grade Pacific Coast Fir, Hemlock or Cedar especially selected for the purpose for which it is to be used.\n\n(2) FOUNDATIONS - One 6 x 8 ins. centre beam to be supplied for each wing of the building.\n\n(3) BASEMENT - Basement sash, doors, stairs, beams and posts to be supplied.\n\n(4) WATER TABLE - This to be supplied if building to be placed on full concrete foundation.

Johns Manville asbestos fireproof shingles for outside walls in lieu of cedar siding. Mineralized shingles for roof. This will offset expensive paint jobs for life of building.\n\n2. Fibre glass insulation for entire building, not included in bill of material. May be obtained from Prefabricated Structures, Ltd. Insulation is very essential in this cold climate.\n\n3. Complete storm and screen windows throughout (standard equipment). May be obtained from Prefabricated Structures, Ltd.\n\nIn view of the fact that Electric Power is not available, no provision has been made for wiring the School. Regarding furnace and installation, Bovill & Hann will submit a separate tender at a later date.\n\nWith regard to the domestic water problem, I am unable to secure tenders for sinking an 80' well, which should be located in the basement of the building. This will have to be done outside the School later, when a drill and operator are available.\n\nBovill & Hann are the same Firm who tendered on the Lejac School Barn. As in the case of the barn, I am unable to obtain tenders from any other source, on any basis. The numerous Contractors and Carpenters I have approached are definitely not interested.\n\nIf and when the tender is approved by the Department, instructions will be given for shipping the material from Prefabricated Structures Ltd.\n\nBY AIR MAIL\nPAR AVION\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6382, file 795-5, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRE: New School - Stony Creek Reserve\n\nI have been deeply concerned over the inability of Superintendent Howe to secure tenders, or submit a concrete proposal, covering the erection and completion of the above-mentioned building, but am now pleased to advise, reference Mr. Howe's letter of September 27th and enclosures, attached, that he has secured a tender from Messrs. Bovill & Hann, contractors of Smithers, B.C., covering the supply of material and labour necessary for excavation of the basement and erection of the basement and foundation to floor level, at a cost of $4,362.50, which amount is considered to be reasonable.\n\nThe balance of the contractors' tender, covering erection of the prefabricated sections, is not clear and could be interpreted to mean that the contractor anticipates receiving payment of the cost of erecting the sections plus 10% of the cost of the sections and labour costs. I have wired Superintendent Howe today, reference the attached copy of my telegram, and will clarify this point at a later date.\n\nIn the meantime, in view of the lateness of the season and the possibility that early frosts might make completion of the concrete impossible, it would be greatly appreciated if every possible effort could be made to have the tender of Bovill & Hann, covering excavation, concrete\nwork, erection of chimneys, and painting of the building when completed, and including all the materials necessary for this work at a cost of $4,362.50, approved as soon as possible.\n\nWill you please advise by Army Signals when this approval is obtained.\n\nI may say that the prefabricated sections of the building are complete and ready for immediate shipment when the foundation is ready.\n\nW.

In that case we would ask you to send us the figures covering the cost, as well as to return the TOTAL statement, and the last copy of statement # X9, in order that we may make the entry thereon.\n\nIn our letter to you, dated Sept., 25th, 1948; we quoted you as follows: \"we are prepared to erect same on a 10% cost plus basis of prefabricated portion of the building and labor involved.\"\n\nIn your letter to us dated Nov., 30th, 1948, you state \"the Minister has accepted the offer of Bovill & Hann to erect the new school at Stony Creek, on a day labor basis, plus 10% for supervision.\n\nApparently we went ahead on this job with no other contract than the letter, and at this time they do not seem to be adequate as to details. On jobs of this kind we have received 10% on the cost of materials sold by ourselves, as well as any materials supplied by the owner. Where we do not make any selling profit on materials, and merely receive 10% on the labor, it means that we pay out the cash for labor and taxes, and that is all we would receive with the exception of the wage of the supervisor, and in this case the mileage and the cost of hotel room while away from home.\n\nWe trust that you will agree with us that we should have this percentage, and will send us the cost of the materials which we believe is in the neighborhood of $7600.00. The most of our account is merely for money paid out by us for labor, which is being returned to us, after we have been paying interest on it.\n\nMr. Hann has left for Francois Lake, and Mr. Bovill is at Telkwa on a job, therefore I am writing this in order to reach you with other matter.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Stony Creek Indian Day School\nYour File 14-11-3 (163)\n\nWe regret the delay in accepting the amount due for the work of Bovill and Hann. However we have discussed this account (your Voucher #660) with the Treasury Branch on several occasions and they do not agree that we owe the firm the amount mentioned on the Voucher.\n\nIn paragraph 3 of your letter of September 29, 1948 you recommended as follows:\n\n\"It would be greatly appreciated if every possible effort could be made to have the tender of Bovill and Hann, covering excavation, concrete work, erection of chimneys, and painting of the building when completed, and including all the materials necessary for this work at a cost of $4,362.50, approved as soon as possible.\"\n\nWe submitted the recommendation to the Minister and you were advised on October 23, 1948 that the Minister approved the expenditure of the amount mentioned in your letter. Subsequently you sent us a signal on October 19 reading as follows:\n\nRE TEL STONY CREEK SCHOOL BOVILL AND HANN REFUSE TO ESTIMATE LABOUR ON COST PLUS BASIS I WOULD ESTIMATE TOTAL COST OF WORK THAT SAME FIRM IS PREPARED TO DO ON COST PLUS BASIS NOT MORE THAN $3,800.00\nIn brief our file shows that the total authorization granted amounted to $5,162.50. Our records also show that the following payments were made:\n\n| Voucher | Amount   |\n|---------|----------|\n| 1046    | $3,271.87|\n| 658     | $1,090.63|\n| 99      | $1,466.00|\n| 245     | $1,382.29|\n\nTotal: $7,210.79\n\nIt therefore appears both to the Treasury and to this office that the balance due Bovill and Hann is $951.71. I would also direct your attention to our signal of February 24 and your reply of February 25. In the latter part of your message you stated that you were communicating with Mr. Howe regarding possible reduction in the contractor's tender as cartage to the reserve was not provided by Bovill and Hann. We paid the full amount requested by Lee's transport in the amount of $1,092.15 and no deduction has been made by Bovill and Hann. This fact should be kept in mind when making any final settlement with the firm. In reviewing our whole file we cannot find any communication in which we promised to pay the cost plus 10% basis which is apparently what Bovill and Hann expect.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| October    | To hauling water for Domestic Purposes for September and October, for Stony Creek Day School | $12.00 |\n\n**Note:** I promise to certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

We have advised our officials in British Columbia to the effect that we are prepared to pay the balance of $951.71, but we have not yet received any additional information which would justify our paying the account amounting to $3,765.22.\n\nWe wrote to the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia some weeks ago regarding the matter, but have not yet received a reply. On receipt of your memorandum, we wired to Mr. Arnell, the Indian Commissioner, requesting him to supply the required information. In reply, he stated in a signal message, dated December 6th, that he was awaiting information from the Indian Superintendent of the Stuart Lake Agency in which the school is located.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Stony Creek Day School\nBovil and Hann Contract\nYour file 795-5 (EL)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of Nov. 17th, I regret that we have been unable to write at an earlier date with regard to settlement of Bovil and Hann's account covering erection of the above-mentioned school but as intimated in my recent Army Signals message we have been awaiting information from Supt. Howe, which information is set out in his letter of December 6th attached.\n\nWe are greatly concerned at the Department's attitude with regard to this account as a careful review of our file indicates that on several occasions we emphatically stated that the estimated cost of erecting the prefabricated sections of the building, $3,800, was arrived at in this office and it is doubtful if Bovil and Hann, who quite rightly were under the impression that they were working on a cost plus 10% of labour basis, were even aware of our estimate. In this connection I would refer to Mr. Neary's Army Signals message of November 24th wherein we were advised that the Minister had approved acceptance of the contractor's quotation to supply all labour and materials for the excavation and construction of concrete footings, etc., at a total cost not exceeding $3,800, and to my reply thereto dated November 26th, 1948, wherein we presumed that the expenditure authorized, $3,800, referred to the erection of the prefabricated sections and completion of the building rather than to excavation and construction of the concrete foundations, etc., which work was previously authorized in Mr. Neary's Army Signals message.\nof October 23rd. In the final paragraph of my letter I emphasized that the cost of the erection of the prefabricated sections was estimated in this office and nowhere in our file can I find any suggestion that payment to the contractors was to be confined to the amount of $3,800.\n\nVouchers Nos. 1046 and 658 referred to on Page 2 of Mr. Phelan's letter covered the amount of the contractor's firm bid for the concrete foundation, etc. Vouchers Nos. 99 in the amount of $1,466 and 245 in the amount of $1,382.29 covered part of the cost of erecting the prefabricated sections of the building and voucher 660 in the amount of $3,765.22 covers, in addition to labour costs in connection with the erection of the building, certain materials additional to those which the contractors undertook to provide in their contract.\n\nAs I see the matter, Bovil and Hann have completed that part of the work covered by their firm tender in the amount of $4,362.50 and have been paid this amount. They have, in addition completed the erection of the building to the satisfaction of Mr. Howe and are entitled to reimbursement of the expenditures they have made in this connection which are covered by vouchers 99, 245 and 660, plus 10%, which was the proposal they made to the Department and which apparently was acceptable at that time. The only adjustment which might be effected is a deduction of $71.30 from the amount claimed by them to cover the expenditure of which they were relieved when we arranged for trucking of the school from the factory to the site.\n\nThe confusion with regard to this construction project is regretted but you will recall that at that time, in the case of the Klemtu school funds were advanced by the Department for payment of labour costs and formal contracts were insisted on by the Department at Pemberton and elsewhere, whereas at Stony Creek, reference the final paragraph of my letter of December 18th, 1948, to you we were unable to find out just how the Department wished the matter handled.\n\nI would recommend payment of $3,693.92 to Bovil and Hann, which is the amount of their outstanding account less the adjustment for cartage from the railroad to the school site.\nwhich was not supplied by them but which was covered by their firm tender for the foundations, etc.\n\n-W.S.

He feels that this school will have a better chance of success and is needed more than schools on these other reserves.\n\nHowever, we do not have any money in our next year's estimates for this school but have included $8,000 each for Doig River and Stoney Creek schools.\n\nIt would seem that this project should be included in our supplementary estimates, but we, of course, do not know when these will be brought down in the House.\n\nWith regard to Stoney Creek and Doig River, we should try out log schools at both these places if you consider they will be successful. Major Clark places them in the \"dubious class\" and would prefer another visit at a different time of the year before making a final decision.\n\nI understand that you may be visiting these reserves and you might keep the school question in mind.\n\nBernard Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| December | To hire of truck and operator removing an accumulation of dirt near toilets, Stony Creek Day School. |        |\n|          | 10 hours @ $1.55 per hour                                               | 15.50  |\n|          | To removing eve troughs and drains, Stony Creek Day School to prevent ice forming and destroying shingled roof of school. |        |\n|          | 11 hours @ $1.55 per hour                                               | 17.05  |\n|          | Emergency work                                                           | $32.55 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied; the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

There should now be added to this amount 6% for interest we have paid the bank for their advance.\n\nJust to keep the record straight, and also find out what is wrong, and where we go from here, the writer will give you all the details, AND HOPE THAT WE MAY SECURE PAYMENT OF THIS LONG PAST ACCOUNT. If there is anything wrong with our account, we have not been advised, and if the delay is an account of the freight from Vanderhoof to Stony Creek, we have not had your account for it. You should have deducted the account from our account and sent the balance otherwise. The only information we have on that matter is in a letter from Mr. Howe, dated Dec., 30th, which says the rate was $2.30, but does not say if per cwt., or ton, and if from Vanderhoof, ONLY, which is what it should be. Not from Vancouver.\n\nWe have letter from Mr. Howe, dated Aug., 17th, saying he had forwarded the account to OTTAWA on July 13th. In the same letter he mentioned that you did not authorize the 10\u00a2 on the material.\n\nOn Sept., 12th Mr. Howe wrote that \"he had air.mailed the Department requesting them to expedite payment of $3765.22.\"\n\nOn Oct., 24th \"I have again wired OTTAWA re this account.\"\n\nOn Dec., 30th. \"I have done everything possible from this end to hasten payment of the account, and sincerely hope that a settlement will be made at an early date.\"\n\nYou will note the mention of Ottawa in all of these letters. Therefore the writer wrote a PERSONAL letter to our R.P., asking him what he could do about the matter. He wrote that he had been assured that payment would be made IMMEDIATELY.\n\nToday I was talking with Mr. Boys at Hazelton, and he said that all of his accounts went through your office. We sincerely hope that we will not have the same trouble at Hazelton, on our job there; ALSO--THAT YOU MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT OUR STONY CREEK JOB.

Douglas Galbraith, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nMiller Bay Indian Hospital,\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nDear Doctor Galbraith:\n\nFurther to our letter of Nov. 20th, we have been endeavouring to find a teacher for your hospital school.\n\nWe have recently been corresponding with Miss Ellen Thomas of Fort William, Ontario, who is willing to teach in an Indian hospital school for a period of a year on a trial basis. At the time of her application being received, she wished to go to the Charles Camsell Hospital at Edmonton. However, Dr. Meltzer has two satisfactory teachers employed there and there is little likelihood that he would wish any change made. Therefore I enclose, for your consideration, a statement of her qualifications. You will note that Miss Thomas is fully qualified and that she has already had experience in teaching adult Indians at the Fort William T.B. Sanitarium.\n\nUnfortunately her services will not be available until this summer. However, if you have been unable to locate any other teacher in the meantime and would wish me to find out on your behalf if she is willing to go to Miller Bay for the 1947-48 academic year, then I will be only too glad to do so.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n439 Cathcart St\nFort William Ont.\nFeb 12, 1947\n\nSupt. B.J. Henry,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Henry,\n\nNow that several weeks have elapsed since our correspondence in Indian affairs, I wonder what new plans have developed regarding the Education of the Indians.\n\nThe local Sanatorium was able to engage a clinic nurse and an occupational therapist with money derived from the Christmas Seal Campaign. Perhaps a similar scheme could be encouraged in Coqualeetza or Edmonton for a teacher of Basic English, Music and Speech Therapy through newspapers. I notice that the Board is working for a teacher's pension for those engaged in Indian work.\n\nAlthough my present salary increased from $200 to $250 with annual 5% increments to $2500, January 1947, I am willing to take a year off to help the Indians. Working with Indians is neither new nor discouraging to me.\n\nWhen you have had sufficient time to\nconsider and form arrangements will you please notify me at your earliest convenience?\n\nYour sincerely\n\nP.S. If there is no position open for me, will you kindly let me know so that I can make other plans?\nOttawa, February 19, 1947.\n\nMiller Bay Hospital Indian Day School\n\nReference - your letter M-17-S of 12 February -\n\nDear Doctor Galbraith:\n\nWe have today written to Miss Thomas, asking if she will accept the position as teacher of your school and outlining the points which you raise in your letter.\n\nWe have offered her a salary of $152.00 a teaching month, in view of her high qualifications and long teaching experience. We normally pay beginning teachers at the standard B.C. salary scale and endeavour to keep to the B.C. scale for our day school teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Douglas Galbraith, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nMiller Bay Indian Hospital,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nCopy sent to Inspector Davey\nOttawa, February 19, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Thomas:\n\nFurther to my letter of February 14, I have now received a communication from Dr. Galbraith, Medical Superintendent of the Miller Bay Indian Hospital at Prince Rupert, B.C. He is quite prepared to have you at this hospital as a teacher of the Indian children of school age who are receiving treatment there.\n\nHe suggests that if you would care to go to the hospital before September, he would be glad to have your services for all or part of the summer months. You would of course be paid for this period.\n\nWe can offer you a salary of $152.00 a teaching month under our present salary scale.\n\nDr. Galbraith describes the local situation as follows:\n\n\"Miller Bay Hospital is some eight miles from Prince Rupert, and there is not very satisfactory transportation available to allow employees to go back and forth each day. As a result, the majority of our employees are living at the Hospital. Here again we are beginning to experience some difficulty because we have not sufficient accommodation. I would be interested in hearing from you regarding the salary rates which might be considered for the teaching positions here.

It would appear that Miss Thomas is quite well qualified to take on this type of work, and I would be pleased to have you contact her, with a view to having her come to this Hospital.\n\nMr. Davey, District Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, has recently paid a visit here, and advises that teachers are very difficult to get, and intimated that he did not think it would be possible to fill this position until September 1947. Incidentally, if Miss Thomas was available before September we would be interested in having her here, even during the summer months, if this could be arranged.\n\nMiller Bay Hospital is some eight miles from Prince Rupert, and there is not very satisfactory transportation available to allow employees to go back and forth each day.

D.\nMedical Superintendent.\n\nCc: Mr. Davey\nDistrict Inspector,\nIndian Schools.\nOttawa, February 14, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Thomas:\n\nOn the 25th of January I wrote to Dr. J. D. Calbraith, Medical Superintendent of the Miller Bay Indian Hospital at Prince Rupert, B.C., and sent him a copy of your qualifications. I hope to hear from Dr. Calbraith in the near future concerning your employment as teacher at his hospital.\n\nWe have also opened an Indian Day School at the Clearwater Lake Hospital in Manitoba. We were able to persuade one of our retired teachers to take on the position of teacher for the remainder of this year.\n\nTherefore there are two positions which I think will be open in September, 1947, and in which I hope you will be interested. You can rest assured that we have not forgotten your application and that I will write to you as soon as I hear further from the Medical Superintendents of these two hospitals.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard S.

Not knowing the location of Coqualeetza, I signed for Edmonton just to complete the form.\n\nIf convenient I should be very pleased to receive any literature bearing on the knowledge of the Indian life from the Dept. of Indian Affairs or any other Government Dept., that has a mailing list.\n\nYou understand that I am contracting for a year only, just to find out if I fit into the work. I certainly do like the Indian people.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 796-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 23, 1946.\n\nDear Miss Thomas:\n\nYour letter of September 18 has been referred to me for answer.\n\nWe are now conducting an Indian school for the children in the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital and one for the children in the Indian Health Services Hospital at Edmonton. You will find the salaries in these schools considerably higher than those in the residential schools. For properly qualified teachers we are paying salaries of $1,250.00 a year and upwards. I am enclosing one of our application forms, merely to have on record a statement of your qualifications. I will expect to hear from you further in this regard. We appreciate your interest in the welfare and the education of the Indians of Canada.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Ellen Thomas,\n439 Catherine Street,\nFort William, Ontario.\n439 Catherine St\nFort William Ont.\nSept 18 1946\n\nThe Minister & Dept. of Indian Affairs\nParl. Bldg.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIf you will allow me, my purpose in writing is to learn if there is an opportunity for me to teach English to the young adult Indian people next Sept. 1947, either among the curable tuberculosis cases in our Canadian Sanatorium or on the Indian Reserves.\n\nYou naturally will wonder what prompted my unexpected suggestion. About five years ago, I, as a certificated Ontario teacher and speech therapist, became interested in the Indian people while teaching the Indian children in the Fort William Sanatorium for four years. At that time the adult Indians begged me to teach them also. I arranged to do so on Saturday.\nmorning and the optimistic results well rewarded me for my voluntary efforts. This experiment also acted as a mental therapy for them and in addition we became sincere and mutual friends. I would do more of it but I am now on the city staff as a home relocation leader.\n\nThis summer my interest was again revived while attending a two weeks' course on the study of the Indian Problem at the Portage La Prairie Indian Residential School. Mr. Doucet was one of our outstanding lecturers. On account of the teacher shortage in the Indian schools, I was asked to volunteer, but on finding out that the salary was not even a necessary living wage, and that there was no pension scheme, I kept my present position in Fort William.\n\nNext September 1947, however, I would still be interested in teaching Indian people, chiefly the adults. Would there be a possibility of being an itinerant teacher in Canadian Sanatoria, teaching enough English for the curable patients to return and help their own people? I can ask for leave of absence for one year. Perhaps my letter & suggestion can further a different scheme.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) Ellen Thomas\nOttawa, October 16, 1946.\n\nDear Miss Thomas:\n\nShortly after receiving your letter I had a report in from Dr. Meltzer, Medical Director, Charles Gassell Indian Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. Therefore I took occasion to write Dr. Meltzer and mentioned your interest in our work. On hearing further from him I will write you again. Incidentally, Coqualeetza Indian Hospital is near Chilliwack, British Columbia.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Prince Rupert district is my choice. There are a few matters that I should like clarified.\n\nWhat are the transfer relocation arrangements? Was the Indian Dept. adopted a Teachers' Pension scheme as was promised this year? Now the salary $52.75 per month - do you honestly think that adequate for a highly qualified teacher, taking over a position of responsibility, and in direct contact with T.B. patients? About a month ago a hospital near Prince Rupert - it must be this one - advertised in the \" Globe\" for nurses aides at a monthly salary of $18.00 no experience or qualifications being necessary.\n\nCan you discuss this matter with your department?\n\n439 Catherine St  \nPort William, Ont.\n\nMarch 12, 1947.\nWe finish school in Fort William in June, after which I shall go home to visit my people in St. Marys. I may be ready to teach by the middle of August or at the latest, the first of September. I am taking several of my own books so that we can start school immediately upon my arrival.\n\nAwaiting further details from you before advising my present board of plans for September.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEllen Thomas\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 23rd June, 1945.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE\n\nThe Board recommend that Order in Council of November 10, 1943, P.C. 11/8660, as amended, authorizing payment of local, living or special allowances to employees stationed at Prince Rupert and Prince George, B.C. and White Horse, Y.T., be further amended by deleting therefrom all provisions for payment of such allowances at Prince Rupert and Prince George, B.C., and that there be paid a special allowance of $300 per annum in lieu thereof to employees in classifications, the minimum and maximum salary rates of which are within $720. and $3000. per annum, both rates inclusive, effective from July 1, 1945.\n\nThe Board further recommend that the above allowance shall not result in any employee being paid more than $3000 per annum and that it shall not apply to those employees who are now receiving a living allowance or special allowance greater than the special allowance herein recommended.\n\n(Sgd.)

The amount mentioned is computed from a basic salary of $1,560. plus a special allowance of $300. per annum for employees stationed in the vicinity of Prince Rupert.\n\nThe Department does not pay transportation costs.\n\nThere will be an annual increase of $60. a year. At the present time we have no superannuation plan for teachers, but we are hopeful that we will be able to arrange one within the next year.\n\nI would appreciate your advising me as soon as possible if you are prepared to accept the appointment at the Hospital, effective September 1st, 1947.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Saunders, Teacher\n\nI have your letter of March 25th regarding the above-noted, and would certainly be very pleased to arrange to have this teacher here during the summer months. I believe she could come here any time now.\n\nI presume the matter of salary might be discussed with the Inspector of Schools, Mr. Davey. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Neary.\n\nOne of the immediate concerns here may be that of accommodation for this teacher. However, I think that we will be able to work out some satisfactory arrangement. We are at present just about at the limit of our female accommodation. Please advise the date that Miss Saunders might be able to report here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Galbraith, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\nMemo\n\nMr. B.

A. Procter, M.D.,\nAssistant Director,\nIndian Health Services.\nOttawa, March 25, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDoctor Moore\n\nAre you using this attached Order-in-Council to pay your medical staff at Miller Bay Hospital a $300 allowance per annum?\n\nIf so, I can pay it to this teacher (see folio 2 down).\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Reary,\n\nYour reply today was most reassuring.\n\nOn account of the acute teacher shortage, my school board granted leave of absence only to those wishing to attend university; or for illness. I shall remain on the Fort William teaching staff until the Dominion Government completes suitable plans about employing teachers for Indian work, as you advised.\n\nI shall continue to be interested in the position at Prince Rupert. While teaching the Indian pupils I want to learn craft work from them also.\n\nWith reference to all maps, I think Brentford and Muncey are the nearest centres.\n\nPerhaps during the approaching school year I shall hear from you again on this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEllen Thomas.\nOttawa, May 21, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Thomas:\n\nI regret sincerely that your school board has refused your request for a year's leave of absence for the purpose of teaching in Indian schools.\n\nI do not recommend your resignation at the present time. However, we are now setting up proposals whereby Indian teachers will be superannuated under the Dominion Government superannuation plan. When these proposals are accepted, I will write you further concerning future employment in our schools. Then we feel we will be able to offer you worthwhile employment plus security.\n\nThere is no Civil service transportation rate between Fort William and Prince Rupert. Insofar as I know, we have no school in the immediate vicinity of St. Mary's, Ontario. I would suggest that you inquire on your next visit there as to the whereabouts of our schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Ellen Thomas,\n439 Catherine Street,\nFort William, Ontario.\nMr. B. Henry,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Henry,\n\nI am very sorry that it was necessary to delay my reply. It was not until today that the Administrator of Education advised me of the Board's refusal of my request for a year's leave of absence to do Indian work. I was disappointed but I understand that the Board must make a general move of the situation, as other teachers might ask for absentee leaves for various reasons other than illness or education.\n\nMy only other alternative is to resign, which means forfeiting my annunciation & leaving while at the maximum salary, a secure position. Nevertheless, I am keen to undertake Indian work.\n\nI have an aged aunt of seventy-eight, living in St. Marys, Ont., who is solely dependent on me for a living and friendship. In event of her being seriously ill, at any time after the next school year, would it be possible to be transferred near her place for that particular year, were I to join your permanent staff?\n\n431 Catherine St.\nFort William.\nMay 28, 1947.\nIs there a civil service transportation rate? The Protestant and Catholic churches have a rate for those in their employ throughout Canada. The return transportation between Fort William and Prince Rupert is $1.25 for complete tourist which is rather high for any individual going to work each year (in the under $2000 salary bracket).\n\nI would very much appreciate your opinion or advice regarding my position well in advance of May 31, the deadline date for submitting positions throughout Ontario.\n\nMy next letter will give my final answer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEllen Thomas.\nOttawa, May 30, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Galbraith:\n\nI have today been interviewed by Mrs. Grace Anderson, who holds a high school teacher's certificate for the Province of Ontario. She is 41 years of age and is married to a retired Civil Servant who is 70 years of age.\n\nI mentioned the vacancy at your school to her, in view of our being unable to obtain the services of Miss Thomas, and she seemed very interested. She will probably be writing to you concerning this position. I recommended that she do so, in view of the fact that her husband would also like employment of some kind at your hospital.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C.,\nFourth Floor, Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Davey:\n\nWe have a member of our staff here who is doing some handiwork training with our patients here, that is Miss Drummond. Miss Drummond knows of a teacher who would be free and willing to come to Miller Bay Hospital to carry on some school work with our children here during the summer holidays. I now have an application from Miss Margaret Emma McLeod. She states that she would be available from July 7th until August 22nd. Even though this is only for a short time, I feel that it would be very well worth while to have her on our staff during the summer months. The carrying on of regular school work is of considerable assistance to general discipline on the children's ward, and I am sure that all around it will be of benefit.\n\nSo far as salary is concerned I believe that this will be authorized through your Department. I trust that arrangements can be made to pay a salary which will be acceptable to Miss McLeod.\n\nI have asked Miss McLeod to go in to see you to have an interview with you regarding the work here. I thought that you would like to see her, and I am sure that you will be able to give her some helpful suggestions regarding her work here. Incidentally I have recently sent through a Requisition for some School Materials. I suppose it will take some little time to get this material through to us. Should you have any supplies of any kind that are readily available it might be well to have some sent here. We could use some now since Miss Drummond is carrying a certain amount of rudimentary work with pupils here.\n\nMiss McLeod will be living in the staff quarters residence and she will be living with her friend, Miss Drummond. We make a charge of $30.00 a month for room and board. However if there is to be any difficulty about the amount of remuneration for these few weeks, we could easily make an adjustment on the board and room which might help to solve any problem which you might have in allowing this teacher sufficient salary to warrant her coming up here for this short time. I have not dis-\nMr. R. F. Davey,\n\nPage 2\n\n12 June 1947\n\ncussed salary with Miss McLeod at all. I will leave this entirely in your hands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJBG/mm\n\nA.J.B.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nre: Miller Bay Hospital School\n\nI have your letter of June 30th, Your File No.168-41-1 (WT) regarding the above-noted.\n\nI feel that we would be very well advised to accept Mrs. Hughes as a teacher for our Hospital here, and have her report for duty as soon as convenient. As indicated in your letter, this would be the 1st of August.\n\nIn view of the fact that our Hospital is some eight miles from Prince Rupert, it will probably be most satisfactory for Mrs. Hughes to live in the Hospital. In this case she will be charged $30.00 a month for room and board. However, should she prefer to live in Prince Rupert and go back and forth each day, we would be quite happy to have her do this, since our accommodation is limited at the Hospital. There are some employees who do go back and forth each day, and after a short period here she may well decided to take up residence in Prince Rupert. However this is a matter that I feel can be worked out after Mrs. Hughes reports for duty here.\n\nSome two or three weeks ago I sent in a Requisition for some school supplies. This was made up by one of our employees here who has been trying to help us start some instruction for our children at the Hospital here. It might be well for you to go over the matter of what you consider suitable supplies for our Hospital here. I think that as a basis you might estimate for some fifty or sixty children, a great number of whom have had very little previous training in school. It should be kept in mind too that we are not going to be able to follow a very ambitious curriculum and necessarily the school classes will have to be simplified and will probably include more than the average amount of handicraft work. Certainly among the older patients we are anxious to promote as much handicraft work as possible, although I realize that this is not primarily the duty of a schoolteacher. I believe that we will be able to provide an additional employee, who will not be considered as a schoolteacher, but who will definitely sponsor...\nthe handicraft type of work, particularly among the older patients who are not considered eligible for school. This whole program of school and handicraft we feel is very important in the matter of keeping our patients occupied during the period of time which they have to remain in Hospital.\n\nI might mention that we have a Moving Picture Projector with the usual sound attachments, and we are starting to collect some films of an educational nature. These are very well received by our patients, and I believe that it would be well to keep in mind even in connection with school work.\n\nI trust that some time you will have an opportunity to visit our Hospital here. I am sure you would be able to offer some helpful suggestions in connection with our educational problems among patients.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Macdonald, M.D.\nFor: Medical Superintendent.\n\n(Dictated by:\nDr. J. D. Galbraith)\nOttawa, July 29th, 1947.\n\nDear Mrs. Hughes:\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th instant and we are advising the Superintendent of the Millar Bay Hospital that you will not report for duty until September 1st.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The teacher states that the Medical Superintendent informed her she was an appointee of this Department, and it would appear possible that a definition on this point could be helpful to all concerned. Would you please advise in this connection, as we are not anxious in any way at all to interfere at Miller Bay, but I am quite prepared to give any assistance possible if so directed by the Department.\n\nF.

Original on file 51-168-3\n\nI should mention here that we still have only one school teacher for some sixty pupils here. There are a number of adults who would like to take on some work, and since I consider the school work here to be primarily therapeutic rather than academic, I am anxious to have our two school teachers here as soon as possible. There is a teacher who is willing to come here at the present time, but I have felt that we could not take her here when we are so crowded in our staff quarters building. I feel that we have at the present time to give preference to the taking on of graduate nurses and practical nurses. I should mention too that it is my hope that we can attract an occupational therapy teacher who has had training in this line of work, and who would be able to organize our occupational therapy department here.

Miss Starratt has been examined and is considered to be quite competent for appointment at the Miller Bay Hospital School. This appointment, however, cannot be made until accommodation becomes available at the hospital, and until Archbishop Duke states that he is not in a position to nominate a Roman Catholic teacher. (As you know, where more than one teacher is employed, and where the constituency is of mixed faiths, we try to appoint one Protestant and one Catholic instructor).\n\nOn the whole, therefore, it would seem to be apparent that there will be at least a considerable delay before Miss Starratt is appointed. I am sorry that this is the case, but I am afraid that there is nothing to be done about it, unless she would like to be considered for some other teaching post in British Columbia. In that case we might perhaps find her a position more quickly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. L.

At the Miller Bay Hospital School we now have a Protestant teacher, and before we can appoint a second Protestant it will be necessary to ensure that there is no properly qualified member of the Catholic church readily available.

It has been our policy in the past, in these hospital schools, to have one Catholic and one Protestant teacher, where the hospital is serving a population of mixed denominations.\n\nThe delay in answering this letter was caused by the misplacement of the file concerned. It was necessary to consult this file in order to ascertain definitely the religious affiliation of the present teacher. It was only after a delay of some days that it was found in the office of one of the officials of the Indian Health Services, who had been consulted some time previously with regard to the payment of Mrs. Hughes' board to the Superintendent of the hospital concerned.\n\nWe are at the present time setting up a register of teachers, which will contain all the necessary information concerning them. You will recall that the Civil Service Commission was unable for over a year to fill the vacancy for a clerk with teaching experience, who could be directly responsible for the personnel details of all of our 360 day school teachers.\n\nThe whole purpose of preparing this register is to provide immediate information on these teachers and, when instituted, will prevent a repetition of such delays as occurred in this instance.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was necessary to consult this file in order to ascertain definitely the religious affiliation of the present teacher. It was only after a delay of some days that it was found in the office of one of the officials of the Indian Health Services, who had been consulted some time previously with regard to the payment of Mrs. Hughes' board to the Superintendent of the hospital concerned.\n\nWe are at the present time setting up a register of teachers, which will contain all the necessary information concerning them. You will recall that the Civil Service Commission was unable for over a year to fill the vacancy for a clerk with teaching experience, who could be directly responsible for the personnel details of all of our 360 day school teachers.\n\nThe whole purpose of preparing this register is to provide immediate information on these teachers and, when instituted, will prevent a repetition of such delays as occurred in this instance.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

HOEY\n\nMiller Bay School\n\nI am returning the attached memo for more information on this matter.\n\nAm I to assume from what is written in your memorandum of the 20th of January that the present teacher at the Miller Bay School is a member of the Protestant Church, and that in consequence Miss Starratt cannot be appointed unless there is no member of the Catholic Church available?\n\nWill you please note that although my original memo on this subject was sent to you marked \"Urgent\" on the 12th of January, your reply was not received until the 21st of that month, in spite of the fact (so far as I can see) that it was not necessary to refer the matter to anyone outside the Branch. There is no evidence in your reply to indicate that the officer to whom the matter was referred could not have replied within half an hour instead of over a week. I do think that relatively simple matters of this kind ought to be handled more expeditiously.\n\nH.L.

We have also reminded him of our policy in employing one Catholic and one Protestant teacher at these schools. This system is working out very well at our various hospital schools and we depart from it only when a teacher of one denomination is definitely not available.\n\nIf this policy is to be adhered to, it would be necessary to ascertain from Archbishop Duke whether or not a Catholic teacher is available for this school.\n\nDirector.\nDr. P.E. Moore,\nDirector,\nIndian Health Services,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. J.C. Rutledge Executive Assistant\n\nRe: Vocational Teacher\n\nI have Dr. Hazelton's letters of Dec. 10, '47 file Personnel 13-91 regarding the above noted.\n\nI would advise that since I have had a further opportunity to observe Miss Drummond's general ability that I am not prepared to recommend that she be paid above the general level of $1056 plus maintenance at the present time. Miss Drummond really does not possess the ability to organize and operate the occupational therapy dept. the way it should be run. Her main difficulty I feel is her inability to handle money or a business to put it a different way. Miss Drummond's services here are quite satisfactory as a practical nurse - she is still carrying on some occupational work but this is limited and the majority of her duties are such as we would allot to a practical nurse.\n\nI feel that we will have to obtain someone with more definite training to operate our occupational therapy dept. and until then Miss Drummond will carry on what could be considered a minimum of this work. It is possible that after a year's service we will be prepared to recommend an increase for Miss Drummond.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. Galbraith M.D.\n\nIndian Affairs.

So here it is. I have applied for a teaching position in Prince Rupert in an Indian hospital there. Mrs. Hughes, the present teacher is a friend of mine, as well as an old school-mate. We worked together in Ottawa. She has been trying to look after 58 children and finds it impossible so has asked for another teacher. Major Davey, here, has interviewed me and says he has recommended me for the position. Is it asking too much of you to speak to Hugh Keenleyside on my behalf. He is Deputy Minister isn't he? I've met him but once, but his brother Irvine was one of my pupils in Vancouver many moons ago.\n\nThe position is one just made for me. I'd reside in the hospital. The work would be light in comparison with what I've been doing these past ten years, and I'd rather teach than do anything else. My three years with a deaf and dumb pupil and my social service work with the Baptist church in Moncton should assist me in working with Indians! Don't you agree?\"\n\nThis note to you is just to state that Miss Starratt is a woman of outstanding character and ability, and I feel confident that she could fill the role even more capably than she suggests, should it fit your Department's programme.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Signed) Milton.\nMilton F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nCapital Theatre,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAt the end of this month I shall have completed my first year at the Miller Bay Hospital School. It has been a happy and interesting experience, presenting countless problems and trying my patience to the utmost.\n\nMrs. Hughes has organized the school\u2014following the wishes of Dr. Keenleyside that we make the children literate, teach them to express themselves intelligently, and to make them conscious that they are Canadians. I trust Miss O'Connor and I shall be able to follow a similar programme this next year.\n\nWhen Mrs. Hughes took me on my first tour of the wards, the curly heads of the little girls and the pink and white skins of many of the boys contradicted all my preconceived notions of Indian children. But I learned that Indian girls and white are alike in wanting to be \"beautiful\" \u2014 curl papers are regular night equipment. Fair complexions are very common but they subject the owner to taunts of \"white\" and nothing could carry a greater stigma. The children are very proud of being Indian.\n\nAll are bed patients. You can imagine the difficulty of keeping in bed small boys, who though ill, are bursting with pent-up mischief and curiosity. The novelty of hospital routine soon wears off and means of evading doctors', nurses', and teachers' orders bothers them not. Climbing up a water pipe, hanging on with one hand is a mere incident in the day of a little boy.\n\nDr. Galbraith has appointed the hours 9-11 a.m. and 3-4 p.m. as school hours. He has asked the doctors and nurses to interrupt these periods as little as possible. I should like to express my sincere appreciation of the co-operation all have given me.\n\nSince the New Year Mrs. Hughes and I have been going over to the nursery children as well, from 2-2.30 p.m. Here is where we get a regular fusillade of questions, such as, How you make bacon? Why it rain? Where have sun gone? Jesus stand on mat? Here too, we have been hampered by lack of kindergarten equipment.\nEach children's department consists of a large ward of eight beds and four smaller wards of four beds each. In my section\u2014the boys\u2014I have the youngest children in the big ward. But the personnel changes from time to time, as patients are discharged and new ones enter. When children are using the same books we like to group them together. But this is not possible always. The physical condition of the child determines his position in the wards. The doctors and nurses are as interested in the boys' schooling as I am, and a move to a child's advantage is made whenever possible.\n\nI am very proud of the \"beginners.\" They were very shy at first and hesitant about speaking in English. English is, of course, a foreign tongue to most of them. (What a terrifying experience for a child to be put in a room where he knows no one, where no one speaks his language, then to be \"poked\" and X-rayed and even put in a cast. No wonder they can't talk.) But after we had played games\u2014a language all understand\u2014they became vocal, and the adjective shy applies to them no longer.\n\nThe first accomplishment toward which the children is to send their first letter home. It consists of one or two sentences, printed with very wobbly letters, and with many sighs of satisfaction as each letter is made and each word finished. And the acme of happiness is reached when I ask, \"May I give this letter to Dr. Galbraith to read?\"\n\nThe small boys take pride in hearing one another spell. We have a champion in each ward but have not found the Champion champion yet.\n\nI have been trying to interest the older boys in tales, pictures and designs of their own tribes. Judith Morgan's display of her own pictures in the National Gallery at Ottawa has aroused their interest. I am hoping it may be an incentive to her brother, Howard, who is a patient here.\n\nYou can understand how little we accomplish in a day. Three hours shared with twenty-four boys is less than ten minutes for each. Our teaching is from bed to bed and from ward to ward. It is unwise to remain longer than ten minutes in a room if an orderly calm is to pervade \"Ward E.\"\n\nRest is such an essential in the cure of the children that we must watch them very carefully lest they become weary or overexcited.\n\nThis is difficult work, difficult physically, mentally and emotionally. But the results are gratifying. I am happy in teaching the children and interested in helping some of the men who have not had school experience.\n\nI am enclosing pictures of the boys of Ward E, taken for me by Mr. Wrathall, photographer of Prince Rupert. Little Earl used to say when I went over to the ward at three o'clock, \"Aren't we the handsome Boys, Miss Starratt?\" I am sure you will agree.\n\nSincerely,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our school has not sent such reports in up to this time neither have we had registers. The latter (two) came in this morning also.\n\nThis is an Hospital school\u2014not a Day school. I had been told that a record of attendance was not required. Our pupils are all bed patients so their attendance is constant until discharge.\nGrading is a very difficult matter. We receive no statement of the child's school grading when he or she is admitted as a patient and pupil in our wards. So we accept their statements\u2014without mental reservations\u2014until we can decide for ourselves. Teaching as we do, from bed to bed, and with less than ten minutes per day for each pupil, makes grading uncertain. We cannot cover the work of a normal school year.\n\nWe have no cards to send the parents showing their children have made, nor to the teacher in their district, when they have been discharged. As such available. To date we have 61 pupils.\n\nToday I had a patient changed to another ward and a young man was brought in. He thinks he'd like to do school work.

Hughes from the Miller Bay Indian Hospital School to the Goodfish Lake Indian Day School which was established by authority of R.C. 2966 dated June 29, 1948.\n\nEffective January 1, 1950, Mrs. Hughes has been reclassified as a Grade III Welfare teacher at a salary of $3,000.00 a calendar year on the 1949 scale, with credit for a First Class Teaching Certificate, eight years of provincial and two years of Indian school experience. This classification and salary will cease to be in effect effective July 1, 1950.\n\nHer salary cheques should be sent to her in care of Mr. J.K.

Taylor,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\n\nGoodfish Lake Indian Day School\n\nDear Mrs. Hughes:\n\nThe Department has approved your transfer to the Goodfish Lake Indian Day School from the Miller Bay Hospital School. Effective January 1, 1950, your salary will be adjusted, and after a review of your qualifications, teaching record and inspector's reports, you have been classified as an Indian School Welfare teacher, Grade III. Your salary to the end of June, 1950, will be at the rate of $255.00 a teaching month.\n\nIt is very likely that the Goodfish Lake School will cease to be classified as a welfare school after July 1, 1950, when your salary will probably revert to that of a Grade III teacher. This will mean that full holidays will be given to you for July and August and you will resume your teaching duties on September 1, 1950.\n\nIf you wish to return to hospital duties after that date, you may now make application for such a move.\n\nIt has only been possible to reclassify you from January 1, 1950, due to the fact that you had left the Miller Bay Hospital School.\nThe continued classification of the Goodfish Lake Day School as a welfare school after July 1, 1950, will depend upon local conditions as reported by the Indian Superintendent and the Regional Supervisor concerned.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nCol. B. F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nIndian Hospital Schools\n\nIn reply to your memo 796-1 (E) of 9 January '50 we can advise you that the Sioux Lookout Hospital has been receiving some patients although the official opening will not take place until 17 February '50. The number of patients in hospital up to the present would hardly warrant the posting of a teacher immediately but we would anticipate that within five or six weeks there will be enough patients that the teacher might get started there.\n\nI am confident that we can provide satisfactory accommodation for your teacher in the nurses quarters on the upper floor of the hospital.\n\nMoose Factory is scheduled to open probably about 1 May '50. Due to anticipated difficulties in finding enough nurses the building up of occupancy may be rather slow but undoubtedly by mid-summer or early fall there will be enough patients in this hospital to warrant posting a teacher.\n\nThere has recently been an addition on the Fort William Sanatorium and while this institution does accept a number of Indian patients it is a community sanatorium and the only relationship with Indian Health Services is that any patients admitted for us are paid for on a patient day rate. I imagine that, at the present time, there are about 60 Indian patients in the hospital but the institution employs teachers and welfare workers on its own staff and I am given to understand that the Indian patients receive the same instruction as all other patients.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.\nDirector,\nIndian Health Services\nJanuary 23, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Indian Hospital Schools\n\nI have been requested by Dr. Campbell of the Nanaimo Indian Hospital to secure a ruling on the holidays which teachers in our Hospital Schools may be granted. The attached copy of a circular sent to all Indian Hospitals in B.C. will indicate the policy being observed with regard to the daily hours of work and the length of the teaching week. A statement of policy with regard to the normal school holidays, such as Thanksgiving Day, Christmas and Easter is requested.\n\nAs the Department is aware some of our hospital teachers are giving instruction in handicrafts of an occupational therapy nature. This is normally done in addition to the time spent in the wards on academic instruction. One of the questions raised by Dr. Campbell is whether or not teachers should be completely free on Provincial school holidays which are not normally Civil Service holidays, or whether they should be expected to carry on as if these were regular school days or whether the academic work should be dropped on these occasions and the teacher devote her time to handicraft work.\n\nMy own feeling in the matter is that teachers in hospital schools should be granted only Civil Service holidays and that all other days should be considered as normal teaching days, and that the teaching week which conforms with the hours of Civil Servants employed in other capacities on the hospital staff remain as indicated in the attached circular.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n1. Actual teaching time on wards should average five hours daily. Preferably, this should be between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Minimum time required on duty to be seven hours daily (Monday to Friday).\n\n2. Opportunity for uninterrupted class or individual teaching periods is to be arranged by the Medical Superintendent as far as disposition of patients in the wards will allow. Routine ward work in these particular areas is to be completed before the teaching period or deferred until after.\n\n3. For purposes of general supervision of work, hours of work, discipline, attendance, and leave, teachers will be responsible directly to the Medical Superintendent.\n\n4. Guidance and advice on academic matters is to be provided by or requested from the Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\n5. Teachers should be required to sign the daily attendance register. Monthly attendance report to be sent by office to Mr. Arneil.\n\n6. Teachers to confer once a month with the Medical Superintendent for the purpose of discussing routine, amount of individual patient participation, and any other relevant matters.\nJune 12, 1950.\n\nMajor R. N. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDr. H. A. Procter,\nIndian Health Services, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFuture Appointment of Hospital School Teachers\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter sent to Dr. Burgess, Acting Medical Superintendent of the Miller Bay Indian Hospital. Your attention is kindly directed to the following change in policy:\n\n(1) All future appointments of new teachers at Indian hospitals will be on a 10 month basis rather than on a 12 month basis. In other words they will be classified as day school teachers and not as welfare teachers.\n\n(2) All present hospital teachers classified as welfare teachers will retain this classification for the time being. There is no guarantee that their classification will not be changed at a future date.\n\n(3) Hospital teachers will be expected to teach at least 30 hours during the week. This applies to future appointments as present appointments under the welfare teacher classification are expected to teach at least 36 hours. This is exclusive of time spent in lesson preparation, correction of exercises, etc., which should take at least 10 or 15 hours per week.\nIf any clarification is required of this change in policy, we would appreciate specific questions being raised. All hospital teachers will be advised of this change in the September 1950 issue of the Indian School Bulletin.\n\nWould Inspector Davy kindly keep this change in mind when interviewing prospective teachers for the Miller Bay Hospital vacancies.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 12, 1950.\n\nG. F. Williamson, Esq., M.D.,\nMiller Bay Indian Hospital,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nDear Doctor Williamson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 6 concerning your welfare teachers.\n\nWe have a number of applicants for hospital schools and intend to write to you and to Inspector Davey concerning them at a later date.\n\nIt is not our intention to appoint new hospital teachers as welfare teachers (on a 12 month basis) but only as day school teachers (on a 10 month basis).\n\nTherefore, these teachers will be required to teach during the week approximately the same number of hours as required of teachers in our Indian day schools, namely 30 hours. This means hours of actual teaching and does not include lesson preparation, travelling to classes, etc. We expect that each teacher will spend at least 10 to 15 hours in lesson preparation, marking of exercises, etc.\n\nThe Medical Superintendent of the Hospital is the one who decides on the actual hours during which instruction can be given on various wards. I hope that the above will guide Dr. Burgess in preparing a schedule for next September.\n\nWhere there are two teachers at a school, it is recommended that the two months' holiday period be staggered, in other words that one teacher be permitted holidays during June.\nand July and the other teacher during July and August. During these months no salary is provided for the teacher concerned.\n\nThe above applies only to newly appointed teachers at Indian hospitals. Those now in the service will continue to be classified as welfare teachers but, as stated above, all new appointments will be day school teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1950.\n\nDr. Willard Beatty,\nEducation Division,\nUnited States Indian Service,\nWashington, D.C., U.S.A.\n\nSummer Course for Teachers of Indian Schools\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would appreciate receiving from you the outline of the courses which will be offered by your Division in the summer of 1950.\n\nOne of our teachers attended the school at Carson last year, and we have now received requests from other teachers for more information.\n\nYour cooperation in this regard would be sincerely appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6383, file 796-5, part 1)\nMiller Bay Indian Hospital, Prince Rupert, B.C.\nNov. 4, 1947.\n\nCol. Bern N. F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare & Training, Indian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building, Ottawa.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nWe now have fifty-two children in our school and four have just come in around five and six years of age who should be in it, but until the supplies (invoice has arrived) come, it seems best to defer their start. These supplies are coming by freight, which seems a painfully slow process, and will hold up our work. Is there no arrangement by which sorely needed school supplies could be hastened in a special case such as ours?\n\nI wish to ask if we may have a record player and radio for the school, in order to provide Christmas (and other) music, and also to take advantage of the school broadcasts of the P.C. Dept. of Education such as the Prince Rupert schools enjoy. Such a machine (General Electric) would play ten to twelve records as a concert and also enable us to tune in on the provincial broadcasts. The bulletin supplied to schools by Indian Affairs clearly state that in this province we must follow the course of studies of B.C. May we not also enjoy some of the more luxurious features of the British Columbia program? This machine which I have priced in P.R. costs $165 and I believe that is about the price of any standard make. The record player without the radio plays only record at a time and may be had for about twenty dollars, but that would eliminate the opportunity of the broadcasts which are a daily feature.\n\nWe have children of Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths, and it seems to me that the opportunity to present to them the old story of Christmas in the great music which belongs to both should not be disregarded. We would need some provision to purchase records, which would of course be only those acceptable to both faiths. These children are confined to the small world of the hospital, some of them in rigid casts and flat on their backs, and while some of them have bedside radios and small musical instruments, their choice is poor and untrained. I feel that part of their education should be to love and know good music, the music of the masters, and for that reason I ask you to\nlet me have an early reply.\n\nThe condition of the children's lungs in a t.b. hospital makes it impossible for them to sing, so I have had them learn to recite O Canada and God Save the King, but that is dull for them, and I feel that the Department should consider these helpless children as a special case and must see the opportunity we have here to inculcate a love of good music, which is so much a part of the ordinary school program to-day.\n\nUnder separate cover I am forwarding some pictures of our children, that you may see for yourself what manner of child we have at Miller Bay. They are alert, intelligent and possessed of incredible patience, working, many of them, under stringent physical handicaps. I also enclose an article from the Prince Rupert News of yesterday's date, written by myself for Education Week, which will tell you in a little more detail of our school.\n\nHoping for the best,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Mrs. A.C. Hughes)\n\nP.S. Dr. Galbraith is in hearty accord with this request and said that he would add a note when I wrote to you, but he is at the moment in Edmonton and I did not wish to defer this letter longer, as Christmas seems very near when considered in terms of the time it takes to get schools from Ottawa to Prince Rupert!\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FILL IN THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nthe MILLER BAY INDIAN T.B.

Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare & Training, Indian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building, Ottawa.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nThe cheque dated Nov. 28th to cover my travelling expenses to Prince Rupert has come to hand, for which I thank you. It was for a full month.\n\nWe now have fifty-eight children of school age, and I have asked Dr. Galbraith for a second teacher. While our original order for supplies has not yet been filled in toto, and I shall shortly be sending another order, the number has grown to such an extent that it is impossible to do justice to any of them under present conditions.\n\nAs a teacher I have recommended a young woman who is now in Vancouver and has a B.C. teacher's license as well as a B.A. from Acadia University. She worked with me in Press Censorship and before that in the Air Force Pay Office, I think. She was with the government for about four years, and left our office there in order to return to B.C. She has also had a summer school session in B.C. in the last two or three years, and is well qualified in kindergarten work, as well as that of the higher grades. She would be a distinct acquisition to the Indian Affairs branch. Since she is about my own age I realize I can hardly call her a young woman, that was unpremeditated! Dr. Galbraith said he would ask Major Davey to call on her for an interview.\n\nWe have many young children of pre-school age and several who are more likely to respond to manual work than to ordinary teaching. The disposition of the wards here requires quite a lot of rapid \"foot-work,\" which eats up time for teaching which is all too limited on account of the rest periods.\n\nWe had a Christmas tree for the children and many gifts came in from friends in Prince Rupert and even Vancouver; some mentioned the article in the \"News\" as the reason for their interest, which pleased the writer.\nare to publish a monthly magazine in the new year, on the order of the Camsell Arrow. Dr. Galbraith is very keen on this project and I hope it will be a success. The hospital has a new Gestetner machine and when our first issue appears we shall put you on our mailing list.\n\nThe record player and phonograph which I asked for may or may not have arrived; yesterday a very handsome machine came in and was placed in the nurses' residence. It is a General Electric cabinet, and I heard a rumour that it came as a Christmas present from the Dept. of Mines & Resources. However it did not come to the school nor to the hospital and is therefore of no use to our children, who did not have any Christmas music. As a teacher in this atmosphere is considerably lower than the angels, I have hesitated to ask if this is our machine, but I should appreciate it if you will enquire of the Purchasing Agent and advise me. There is considerable hidden antagonism to the work of the school on the part of some employees of the hospital, and the situation is delicate. It appears that the residence has long wanted such a record player and radio.\n\nThe Christmas parcels which came in as a response to my articles in the News were addressed to me, as was also at least one letter addressed to me. None of these were handed to me, nor was I permitted to handle them, they were whisked through the front office to a locked room and disposed of by hospital employees. The Prince Rupert friends who sent these articles are quite disturbed over this situation, and as it concerns public relations I feel I must bring it to your attention. The hospital got a grant of One Hundred Dollars from National Health and Welfare for Christmas presents for the hospital, but none of this came my way for the school. A blanket order was sent to T. Eaton's who sent ready wrapped gifts, among them a croquet set.\n\nWe cannot expect the Prince Rupert to take a sympathetic interest in our work if we do not patronise them. I mention this especially because Mr. McCrae who owns McCrae's book-store called me on the telephone and said that he had read my article in the News and wished to send me some gifts to distribute. He sent about Fifty dollars worth of gifts, and this I was told by the clerk in the front office to hand over to the matron. It would seem to me that a school teacher whose relationship to her pupils is always close should at least be permitted to apportion the gifts that she is given by a friend of the school. Mr. McCrae had just arrived home from the Liberal Convention to which he was a delegate, and perhaps wished to show his public spirit. I feel he would be annoyed to know the disposition of his gift. Since I had no money to spend on my school at Christmas, I feel that those gifts which came to me as a result of my articles in the News should have been mine to distribute.\nThis plaint is not because I wish to show my importance, but my position as a teacher ought to be recognized, as otherwise I do not feel I can carry on. I have never been of the opinion that a teacher in a hospital school is just an employee of the hospital who passes books instead of bedpans. I am sure the Medical Supt. is not aware of this situation, but I do not feel adequate to bring it to his attention, as in addition to his work he has had a sick child at home. However, the atmosphere is depressing and inimical to my work as a teacher and certainly needs clearing up.\n\nI do not wish to add to your troubles, either, but while I resolved not to interfere with the good-will of this season, now that Christmas is over, I would like to have a little help in this problem.\n\nI enclose the second article I wrote for the News for your examination. The two articles stirred up a lot of public interest and I was invited to two of the city schools and asked to tell something of the school here. It seems to me that that is a good thing in organizing a school such as this, and I believe Dr. Galbraith was pleased. He told me he had been trying to get the editor of the News out here for a year to give the hospital some publicity, but he never seemed willing to come. A taxi-cab company also called up the Dr. and offered to transport free any gifts to the hospital, but they could not understand why parcels addressed to the teacher could not be delivered to the teacher.\n\nOur Christmas passed off happily despite the heartburnings of the teacher, I may say, but I repeat I think the situation is one that should be changed if my work is to prosper.\n\nWith kind regards and best wishes for the New Year, and with many thanks for your past kindness,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We will expect to hear from you with regard to further supplies required at your school and hope we can forward them a little faster this time.\n\nWe are expecting to hear from Major Davey with regard to the second teacher, whom I understand he has interviewed recently in Vancouver.\n\nI was very pleased to hear of your Christmas tree and also of your intention to publish a monthly magazine.\n\nWith regard to the radio phonograph, it is not from the Department of Mines and Resources. Unfortunately, I could not obtain this information sooner but I am now told by Dr. Falconer that it was purchased by the Department of National Health and Welfare for the use of the nurses. We are endeavouring to work out a compromise whereby the two Departments can share in the expense of another radio for classroom use.\n\nI have brought the other matters in your letter to the attention of senior officials of the Indian Health Services. The Medical Superintendent of the Hospital is, of course, your direct superior, even though you are working for a separate department.

Santa Claus is a real figure, despite the pronouncements of scientists. Children still write letters to the old fellow and think with shivers of awe of the passage over the frosted roof of his fleet reindeer and the jingle of his sleigh bells. Even some grown-ups delight in the press\u2014\u201clay down his sweet head.\u201d They pray for his visit because, whether he does not all know what a stable is or one believes in him or not, he has been known to bring leaves behind some useful and interesting things among boats and fishermen, among farmers and lumbermen.\n\nSleighs, toboggans, electric stables. They know about traps, trains, engines, toys that wind up, pets and animals for a brief frenzy of motion and many of them express something deeper than mere pride that \u201cTeacher\u201d would be there to skate, ski, doll carriages, afraid to meet a bear\u2014or even in which the Christmas doll is a world away. It was proudly proclaimed, at least, by the teacher when she told the story of Christmas from the Bible\u2014Christ\u2014Christmas, it is disconcerting to see a picture for normal children. Say the least, to find that their living an everyday life. Construction toys, model houses, pictures of a horse and cow. It was permitted sewing machines explained that a manger was cut out of a long list the children the feed box for cattle, could write with undimmed hope at long strips or hay. To blank Christmas to the end of rain, snow, cold, and milk in this part of the world and there is not a horse. I am told, in Prince Rupert, where the weather is colder, the children have no idea what a horse is. The children are very fond of animals, and they regard them accordingly. In a surprising and satisfying number of cases, via postcards and the school myth given a new infusion of energy.\n\nAt Miller Bay Hospital, spirits are high. The road in Port Edward is a setting of natural beauty and grandeur, more than 50 children go to school to build their own homes in the nearby buildings by the walls of the hospital. They too look for Santa Claus and listen eagerly to the story of the baby Jesus whose little cradle was a manger. Some of them know that story well, even though they do not care for the music. They know the story of the mother and father who had to seek shelter in a stable, that the little Lord Jesus might have a place to lie. Richard Crooks sounded through travelling in a straight line, but the words. Afterwards they will be the beginning of a respect for his own achievement, and his family will share his pride.\n\nThe request presents itself to the parents of these children. When I consider the advantages of this medium of communication also, and the tasks I wish some of it might be used for, I am sure that it is a good thing. Teachers were very quiet with delight.\n\nIt is thrilling to find among our children one now and again mind for some familiar aspect, such as radio, in them but by which they are able to make a turn. Teacher remembers a child who has just learned to read and write. This week sent his first letter, including a request for a book. Books of the right kind for spare time reading are what these children need. The libraries are small although their backgrounds are limited. Sometimes a book is the only pleasure possible when a child is in bed with the flu, or his back or his stomach. While school books in use are pleasant, they are often dull, and simple stories, well told and illustrated with attractive pictures, are very welcome. The cards are made using old cards which have been sent in by kind friends of the school, and are colored with crayons or paints. Some of the cards are well executed although some are bound to be described as \u201cboring,\u201d but they are given to their parents and grandparents with pride.\n\nINSPIRATION OF CONRAD STREET\n\nThe children of Grade One in Conrad Street School made a colorful scrap-book of their own crayon drawings and sent it with their best wishes to the children which pleased and interested them. It also spurred them on to emulate this achievement and the little girls are very proud of their work\u2014a book for a ward of four small ones who are not yet doing school work.

JOHN, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the Prophet River Indian Day School. Local purchase of the supplies mentioned on your requisition is approved.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of labour will be approximately $200.00.\n\nThe Department was pleased to learn that you are satisfied with the manner in which this school is being operated.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFort St. John, B.C.,\nDecember 9th, 1946.\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have inspected the Prophet River (R.C.) Indian Day School recently established at Prophet River, on the 4th and 5th instant. His Lordship Bishop Coudert accompanied me. Although that school has been in operation five weeks, I have been agreeably surprised to find already a noticeable change in the Indian children and adults attending classes; they are neater and clean. Precision drill and P.T. exercises were remarkably good. Posture is only fair and will improve once we can do away with the Mess Hall tables we use as desks and seats; they are of a local pattern and suitable for tall persons. Scabies, scrofulas, ringworms and other skin infections have been treated efficiently by the teacher, Rev. Father Tanguay. Clothing is scant on some of the pupils but what they wear is much cleaner than it used to. I am asking the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Nelson, to send more children's clothing when they pay the next Family Allowance.\n\nAs your letter of October 28th, file 143-5-1 WT, reverses a previous decision as to ownership of the building used as classroom and places upon us instead of upon the Church, the responsibility of making that building fit for its use as a classroom and teacherage, I have agreed to accept an account from Father Levasque, of Fort Nelson, for the cost of the alterations made under his supervision before your letter was received. As I have to take over for the completion of the necessary alterations, I wish to inform you of the arrangements I have made or will make within the next few days, urgency due to lateness of the season and severity of the weather making it imperative that I proceed with that work without delay.\nyour sanction.\n\nI am attempting to hire a carpenter at the going wage of $1.00 per hour to go to Prophet River to do the following work:\n\n1. To build porches for the front and rear doors\n\n2. Window sashes to be windproofed and cracked panes replaced.\n\n3. The interior of the building is lined with pieces of Ten/Test of odd sizes and shapes. It will be necessary to cover this Ten/Test with building paper, glued on, sized and painted with kalsomine. Walls and ceiling to be done.\n\n4. Install Yukon type chimneys (2), roof jacks, asbestos sheeting, and two Co\u00b2 Fire Extinguishers.\n\nThe cost of labour is estimated to run up to $200.00. Form 37 herewith lists the material required for which I have already placed order with local firms. I will be unable to haul the material myself, there being two tons of it, and will send it by British Yukon Navigation Freighth trucks or by other freighters as can best accommodate me.\n\nThe local Indians are not ready to undertake to supply the fuel for the school. Rev. Father Levaque will see to it that it is supplied and has agreed to hire for that purpose all the Indian labour that is available. Later on this will be entrusted to Indians exclusively.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.J.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Fuel, Prophet River Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of May 28th, your file 143-6-3, you authorize the procuring of the cordwood required for next winter for the above mentioned school.\n\nI have been after the Indians of Prophet River since last March for them to undertake to supply this wood, but so far they have not made a move. I have therefore made arrangements with an Indian of Moberley Lake, Harry Desjarlais, of the Saulteau Band, who has undertaken to cut, haul and pile in the school yard, thirty cords of dry wood and 10 cords of green wood @ $15.00 per cord.\n\nThe nearest stand of dry wood is at Milepost 219, about 14 miles from the school, and the green wood can be cut at Milepost 234 about two miles distant from the school.\n\nHarry Desjarlais, nor any of the Prophet River Indians, have the equipment for hauling and it will be necessary to sublet to a white for the trucking job. At my request the Hudson's Bay Company have consented to advance to Desjarlais, provisions and supplies to the extent of $100.00.\n\nWould it be possible therefore that you obtain an accountable advance of $600.00 to cover the cost of supplying this fuel, to enable payments to be made from this office as needed, instead of waiting for the submission of number of accounts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nN.

St. John Indian Agency\n\nIt was noted from Indian Agent Galibois' Diary for the month of April, that an early arrangement for the supply of fuel for the above day school had been requested by Bishop Coudert. I therefore wrote Mr. Galibois on May 28th, asking him to make the necessary arrangements to obtain fuel.\n\nMr. Galibois, in the letter attached, has requested that an accountable advance of $600.00 be provided to cover the cost of laying in the wood required for fuel. It is most important that provision for the coming winter be made now, and it is my request that this grant be made available as soon as possible.\n\nC. H.

Indian Day School at Milepost 232.5.\n\nMr. A. Lambert who did the work last January, is now available and I have hired him at the going rate of $1.25 per hour; also Mr. J. Norman, his partner, also a carpenter, at $1.00 per hour. Both have been supplied with transportation and will leave on Monday the 30th instant. In addition I am providing them with a helper, Indian Harry Desjarlais, who will dig a root cellar under the school and bank the building with earth in readiness for the winter. I have agreed to pay him $5 per hour.\n\nThe following work is to be done:\n\n1\u00b0 Completing front and rear porches; installing two Yukon chimneys; change front and rear doors; find ways and means of improving ventilation of the building; repair school seats and adjust them to improve posture of pupils;\n\n2\u00b0 Big Root Cellar 6'x 8'x 5' and shore same; cut and hinge trap door in floor.\n\n3\u00b0 Repair leaky roof and coat all old seams with pitch.\n\n4\u00b0 Erect fence along highway side of school grounds, using 8\" dia. swamp spruce posts supplied by Indians and 2\" x 4\" and 2\" x 6\" planks salvaged from dismantled building; Whitewash same.

Lambert and Norman while they were repairing the Prophet River Day School Building, and expressing your surprise as to the time taken. I have been able to see Mr. Lambert only lately as he has been away during the winter, and upon checking with him his time sheets and the items of work done I find that I did not report on the voucher, the replacement of a large part of the foundations of that building.\n\nAs you may be aware the North West Highway Command had agreed to clear and level off an area contiguous to the building as a playground for the pupils. While their bulldozers were at work they uncovered the foundations of the building and it was found that all the timbers at one end had rotted and had to be replaced. Subsidence of the building started shortly thereafter and after the week had passed conditions had become so bad as to cause a large crack to appear in the newly repaired roof. Lambert took it upon himself to make the necessary repairs. Jacks and other equipment he borrowed from N.W.H.S. of Mile 245; 6\" x 6\" timbers could only be had from another building which Lambert and Normand themselves had to dismantle from the roof down, none of the Indians being there to lend assistance as they had left to hunt in the mountains. Lambert has no definite figures to show for this work but he estimates that no less than 200 hours were spent on repairs to the foundation out of which 180 hours were for retrieving five 6\" x 6\" x 20' timbers. About five thousand feet of lumber were salvaged at the same time and this was later used by the Indians in building new homes.\n\nI called at Prophet River School only once while the work was in progress, on July 10th, and felt satisfied of the work being done properly and speedily. Other occupations did not permit me to make more frequent visits at that time.\n\nI trust these explanations will be found satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\nC. A.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nReplying to your letter 797-5 (E.1) dated the 23rd instant.\n\nI am returning herewith the requisition sent you direct by Father Tanguay, teacher at Prophet River Indian Day School. I also enclose his order for various school supplies and books received here. Shipments from both requisitions should be addressed to Dawson Creek, B.C., which is the rail terminal for this district.\n\nRegarding the supply of an electric light plant as requested by Father Tanguay, I would like you to explore every avenue within your command to make the supply of same feasible. The school is very poorly lighted by natural light which makes it necessary to have the best and most economical artificial light. If you would supply that plant, it could be run the first year on gasolene, but afterward I would press more strongly to have the land the school is built on, properly surveyed and the title acquired from the Province. The moment the land is ours, we can tap a first class gas well which lies on the property and will fill the school and the Indians' needs for some generations. This well is at present capped. It could be made usable at slight cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. L.

Galibois, Superintendent of the Fort St. John Indian Agency which is self-explanatory. We would appreciate your comments on his proposition.\n\nDirector.\n\nAJD:MKW\nFort St. John, B.C.,\nAugust 19, 1949.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Lighting plant for Prophet River Day School\n\nNow that the school site is to be included in an Indian Reserve for the Sikkenni Bend of Prophet River which is about to be surveyed, I would like you to reconsider my requisition of March 31st last for an electric lighting plant to operate on natural gas.\n\nThere is a gas well on the property, which I desire to uncap to provide heat and light for the school. Light can be produced at no expense other than wear and tear of the plant. Heating of the school by natural gas will enable us to make a saving of $600.00 per year.\n\nThe piping of the gas from the well to school will necessitate digging a trench across the Alaska Highway. Mr. C.W. Fox, Superintendent, Southern Division, North West Highway System, is anxious to have this work done early this fall as a mechanical trench digger will be available in the district in the near future. I anticipate that this work of pipeelaying and necessary trenching will cost no more than $200.00\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) E.J. Galibois,\nSuperintendent,\nFort St. John Indian Agency.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Lighting Plant for Prophet River Day School\n\nReference is made to letter from Indian Affairs dated August 26th and your notation thereon asking how soon we can give Major MacKay information on this matter.\n\nI wish to point out that there is insufficient information given in connection with this matter for us to make any recommendation at the present time. It is noted from the letter of Mr. E.J. Galibois, Superintendent of the Fort St. John Indian Agency, that there is a gas well on the property which he proposes to use for the supply of natural gas for heating the school. He also proposes to install an electric lighting plant to operate on natural gas.\n\nBefore any recommendation can be made regarding the gas-driven electric lighting plant, it would be necessary for us to have one of our engineers make an examination to determine the quantity and pressure of natural gas available in the well. Arrangements can be made to have an engineer proceed to the school and make this investigation if it is considered desirable.\n\nMr. Galibois states that the piping of the gas from the well to the school will necessitate digging a trench across the Alaska Highway, and that a mechanical trench digger will be available in the district in the near future. He estimates that the cost of the necessary trenching and pipe laying would not exceed $200.\n\nUnder the circumstances we would recommend that the necessary trenching and pipe laying be carried out immediately to provide gas for heating purposes, if the Indian Affairs Branch is satisfied (without further investigation) that the supply of gas is adequate.\n\nR.A.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nThe local Roman Catholic Mission proposes to start a seasonal school at Shesley Station, about 40 miles north-west of Telegraph Creek on the Telegraph Line at the junction of the Salmon and Eggell Creeks, and the Shesley River. This point is the site of an Indian winter camp which has existed for many years, and seven or eight Indian families who trap in that area live there.\n\nThe Church has no buildings at Shesley, and although any plans are tentative, it has been suggested to Father Carpentier that we might obtain use of the Dominion Government telegraph station at Shesley. This building has not been used since the closing of the telegraph line between Telegraph Creek and Atlin, but it is still equipped, and in fair condition.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could interview Superintendent R.G. Bishop of the Government Telegraph Service in Vancouver and enquire whether that Department has any objection to use being made of the building.\n\nA previous enquiry directed to the Government Telegraph Service about obtaining 'line' cabins and equipment for the Indians resulted in the advice that the telegraph line had not yet been abandoned and permission could not be granted to use the cabins. However, if the Shealey Station cabin could be secured for use, it could be on the understanding that it would be relinquished if the G.T.S. needed it again.\n\nR.H.S.

In reply to this I have just received his letter of the 15th instant and requisition, enclosed herewith, advising that ten to fourteen pupils will be available if the school is opened and that it should operate from September 25th to December 26th.\n\nUnfortunately the matter has been delayed to such an extent that it is difficult to see how we can ship in the books and equipment as I understand that after the close of navigation, which will be about October 10th, from Wrangell, supplies would have to go in by first class mail, the cost of which would be prohibitive, and would then only leave about two months for the school to operate.\n\nI would approve of the opening of the school, and if the Department concurs and can ship the material to reach Vancouver in time to catch the last boat to Wrangell, which leaves probably during the first week in October, I could purchase the blackboard material, cups, broom and gas lamps here. Your advice by airmail would be appreciated, also fuel requisition is attached.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D.M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nFather Forget, O.M.I., came in today with the enclosed requisition for school supplies and equipment for the new Shesley Seasonal Indian Day School. In your letter of February 22, 1946, file 215-12-3148 you instructed this office to take action if assistance was required.\n\nUnfortunately Father Forget left the matter of obtaining supplies until too late for proper action this season. However, it will be appreciated if you can forward the requisition by airmail and request that the supplies be shipped immediately so that they will catch the last boat of the season, about October 10 from Wrangell. The supplies should preferably come by mail as there is less likelihood of them not reaching here.\n\nFather Forget has also asked for 5 cords of firewood for the school, and a requisition for same is attached.\n\nThere are ten pupils who will attend for certain, and possibly three or four others who may attend. The school is to operate about three months, from Sept. 25 to Dec. 25.\n\nAs the children who will make up the pupilage have not yet had the opportunity of attending school the opening of this proposed Shesley Seasonal School is recommended. Although Bishop Coudert has not nominated Father Forget officially as teacher, this man will be in charge, and the salary cheque should be made out in his name.\n\nR.H.S.

Mission on establishing a seasonal school at Sheslay. There are four of five Indian families living there during the winter whose children have so far not had the opportunity of attending school. The school is to operate only for about three months which is unfortunate, but unavoidable owing to a shortage of R.C. Missionaries.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nIn a letter dated Dec. 15th from Bishop Coudert, on File No. 166-17-1, he advised the Department that the following teacher would be in charge of the school for 1947:\n\nShesley School - October, November and December - Rev. Jos. Forget, O.M.I.\n\nF&D.\nStikine Agency  \nTelegraph Creek, B.C.  \n11 December 46.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver.\n\nReplying to your file 215.12.5715 of November 14th, re; establishment of Sheslay Seasonal Day School, I have to advise that this school was opened by Father Forget in early October, and has been operating ever since. It is not expected it will continue after Christmas holidays.\n\nA few of the most urgent school supplies were secured from a small stock on hand, and two dozen pencils were purchased locally. As the school will not be operating after Christmas there is no point in requisitioning further supplies this year. Next season's supplies will be requisitioned at the conclusion of the current term.\n\nHowever it would be appreciated if authorization for $50.00 worth of fuel could be granted. Father Forget had Nelson Queck, (Indian) cut seven cords of fire wood, and as the man was destitute there was no alternative to giving him an order on the local Hudson's Bay Company for that amount of provisions, etc. The account for this merchandise is being held here pending authority.\n\n\"R.H.S.

Philip Philen\nChief Training Division\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI take this opportunity for sending you my best wishes for a happy new year. It is my intention also to thank you very heartily for your kind services towards the cause of our northern Indians. In the mission and to the Indians in the bush the burden is heavy at times, due partly to the lack of proper interest and efficient cooperation by the local agents. Were it not for your intervention together with the arrival of a divine cause I doubt very much that we could face any longer the struggles and hard times of these out-of-the-way camps and missions.\n\nEnclosed you will find my report for the summer taught at the newly opened Shirley Day School. Included also is a minor bill to the Department for expenses connected with same. There is a discussion here from Government circles regarding their share of education and instruction. They insist that I stay a month or at least for a month or two because of my yearly visit to the camp. I might teach a month to the children but they do not know what you think of the plan.\n\nSincerely yours in Christ,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian AFFAIRS.

J. Forget, O.M.I., was appointed teacher of this school effective Oct. 1, 1946, at a salary of $162.00 a teaching month. The school was in operation from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, a period of three months and a cheque in payment of salary due should be issued for that period. The cheque should be issued in favour of Rev. J. Forget, O.M.I., and sent to Rt. Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I., Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nThis is a seasonal school and we will advise you later if any further payment should be made to the teacher. Father Forget taught at Dease Lake School (No. 858) and I understand you have the usual forms for him.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nSHESLAY SEASONAL SCHOOL: This school operated during October, November and December with an average attendance of only seven. It was inspected November 22nd by the writer. Owing to the short season, and lack of supplies and facilities, the results were not very impressive. These children need schooling and they have no other opportunity.\n\nR.H.S. SAMSON,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 5th, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nThe following report regarding the Sheslay Seasonal School has been received from Indian Agent Sampson:\n\n\"This school operated during October, November and December with an average attendance of only seven. It was inspected November 22nd by the writer. Owing to the short season, and lack of supplies and facilities, the results were not very impressive. These children need schooling and they have no other opportunity\".\n\nLack of supplies is due to the fact that the Order in Council establishing the school was obtained at such a late date that we were unable to ship supplies before navigation closed. However, this condition will not apply next year and instructions are being issued to Indian Commissioner MacKay to ship the supplies required during the navigation season so that they will be on hand when the school reopens in the Fall.\n\nFrom the Agent's remarks it can be inferred that he feels that the school should be operated for a longer period than three months. I would appreciate it if you would give this suggestion your careful consideration and let me have your opinion in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor of Yukon & Prince Rupert,\nBishop's House,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, March 5th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of November 8th with reference to the new day school at Sheslay, Stikine Agency. In that letter you were authorized to purchase locally, books and other supplies required for the school. In your letter of January 8th you stated that by the time you received the authority, transportation had closed and, therefore, it was not possible to make the shipment.\n\nWe want to have sufficient supplies on hand at this school when it reopens next Fall and I would appreciate it if you would arrange with Indian Agent Sampson to forward a requisition immediately for the supplies that will be required.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nand Whites, all counted. The local Indian Agent should appreciate what we are doing and give some encouragement to our missionaries instead of always trying to find fault with our work and criticize it.\n\nFew years ago, at the time of the depression, when lay teachers were rather easy to obtain, we managed to find two or three lay teachers to go to those out-of-the-way places and teach at two different secular schools each; but they all got into trouble either with the Indians or with the local Agent, and besides they were not duly qualified, though they were well equipped for such a rough country. Owing to the impossibility of getting duly qualified lay teachers to come and live under those conditions, the local Indian Agents, as well as the higher Officials of the Branch, begged me to allow our missionaries to conduct those schools. It was a great imposition on them, and they have done so with the understanding that such a work would not paralyze their essential duties as priests and religious. This is one point I must always watch carefully and safeguard, but which Agent Samson does not seem to be able to understand. After the sad experience we had last year at Telegraph Creek with one of our missionaries, my orders from Rome were that I should watch still more carefully over the priestly and religious life of our men.\n\nI know that you will appreciate this frank exposition of our position and will try to have Agent Samson encourage our men instead of nagging them.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop J.L. Coudert O.M.I.\nVicar apostolic of Whitehorse\nMarch 11, 1947\n\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nBooth Building, Ottawa  \n\nRe Shealey Seasonal School\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nI have your communication of March 5th re Shealey School.\n\nI beg to say that the report received from Father J. Forget O.M.I. was very encouraging for the first educational experiment made at that point.\n\nThere were 27 Indians in the Camp, of whom 11 children of school age; you may have seen at any rate from the School report directly sent to you by the Teacher that the attendance was not bad for this first attempt at giving some schooling to those children who never had any before.\n\nThe extreme difficulties of communication, and the delay of the Indians to arrive at their winter quarter prevented Father Forget from starting the School as early as anticipated. I think that with a little coaxing of the Indians to rush them to their trapping ground and the facilities of some local air transportation, the teacher could be able another year to give those Indians three full months of School, perhaps even four, viz., from September to Christmas.\n\nI do not see, however, any possibility for Father Forget of teaching at Shealey after Christmas; he has to return to Telegraph Creek for Christmas to attend to the spiritual needs of the local white and half-breed population, to answer his Christmas Mail, make his yearly accounts and reports; this normally keeps him busy until the middle of January; by that time he has to visit Cariboo Hide, which is located some 200 miles away and where the missionary has to make at least this yearly visit. That trip keeps him busy at least two months, until the middle or the end of March. Meanwhile his companion is teaching four months of School at Iskut Lake or Klappan, from January to end of April. In the summer months, one priest has to stay at Telegraph Creek, which is a very busy place during the summer, whilst the other is employed in one of our other summer schools, such as Lower Post. That's all those two priests can possibly cover in the educational field, if we take into account their other obligations as priests and missionaries, viz., their religious exercises, the unexpected sick calls, their buildings and repairs, woodcutting, care of the dogs, cooking, washing, studying etc., etc.\n\nI do not see how they possibly can do more, until I will be able to give them a third companion; we are already doing our utmost for that district by providing two priests for a Catholic Population of 233 Indians.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th instant in connection with the situation at the Shesley Seasonal School. We realize the difficulties that both yourself and your missionaries are working under.\n\nNo doubt you will have an opportunity of visiting Ottawa some time during the current year and we can then discuss the matter more fully.\n\nPossibly you could also discuss the situation at Shesley with Major Clark when he goes to your section of the country in connection with the proposed Teslin Lake Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor of Yukon & Prince Rupert,\nBishop's House,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\nOttawa, August 25, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 19. As I understand it, you wish the following teachers appointed at the day schools shown hereunder:\n\n(a) Shealey Indian Day School - Rev. Father E. Turenne, O.M.I., for October, November, December and possibly January.\n\n(b) Klappan - Rev. J.

Father Turenne, dated September 13, 1948. Original on 158-6-1.\n\nThe school reports have been sent at the end of each month to our Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, but in case you have not as yet received these reports, you will find a copy of them here enclosed.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Jean-Louis Coudert, O.M.I., is telling me that you would like to have some information on our activities in Shesley last winter.\n\nFather J.M. Mouchet, O.M.I., and I left Telegraph Creek by trail on January 22, 1948, for Shesley where we arrived on the 24th. Our plans were first to repair and readapt the B.C. Telegraph building to be suitable for a school, after which we wanted to teach school to the few children in the camp.\n\nTo repair the house, both of us had to work 24 days, from January 26 to February the 21st. This work, which, to my opinion, should have been done and paid by the Indian Department, was made at our own expenses; by our expenses here I mean especially our time since as for material we had to take what we had already on the spot. To note again that this extra work was done for the sole purpose of opening a convenient school during fall 1948.\n\nIn case you would like to have details on the work done, here are the major repairs involved: we had to take out the kitchen floor in order to renew the rotten joists; we took down a whole partition and made a smaller bedroom in order to have the main room bigger and brighter by the addition of another window; we then had to repair a very bad corner of the room as well as the ceiling.\n\nAfter completion of the improvements, the Indians were so enthusiastic about them that they were anxious to come in good number the next fall for the opening of the school. They expected then to have from 12 to 15 children ready for school this fall. Though I had no contact with them since last spring, I am positive that there will be enough children at Shesley this fall for the opening of another school term.\n\nAs all this work left us free for only the last week of February, I then taught school to the only six children\nchildren in the camp.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., came to visit the population during the first week of March and we then went back to Telegraph Creek where other duties were calling us.\n\nI went into rather long details, Sir, so that you could see by yourself what we are trying to do for our dear Indians often at the cost of many sacrifices and hardships.\n\nHoping that this letter will please you and help you in your co-operation with us, I remain\n\n(Sgd.)

Rev. Forget plans to operate the school from October 1st to January 31st in future, and expects to have an attendance of about 15. However, it is not at all certain that an increase will actually take place. The habits of this group of Indians vary from year to year, and nothing definite can be stated about how many children will be available for school except that it is fairly certain that the attendance will be no less than last year.\n\nIn the event of establishing a first class day school near Telegraph Creek these children from Sheslay would attend here.\n\nR.H.S.

As preparations had been completed for improving the Shesley School, including the provision of lumber and materials, and an advance for labour and carpentry had been made in connection with plans that these repairs would be useless this season if the children were not going to be available for school attendance. In addition to this there were a number of local Catholic children available for school if a school were operated in Telegraph Creek. In consultation with Rev. J. Forget, O.M.I., of the Roman Catholic Mission, it was decided to apply for authority to use the Shesley materials and supplies in preparing the local R.C. Church for a school room.\n\nAssurance was given by Father Forget that he would operate this proposed school at least until Christmas, and upon receipt of the above-mentioned telegram from the Department the R.C. Mission undertook to make the necessary alterations in their Church to accommodate the school-room. This work was completed about October 15th, and school opened, the average attendance for the remainder of the month was 7.0, and the number of Indian children on the roll 10. There were 17 children then enrolled for school, but owing to the epidemic of mumps locally some were away sick. An improved attendance has been noted so far this month, but all parents are not co-operating fully and have been warned of probable loss of Family Allowances if children still fail to attend.\n\nFather Forget has admitted a number of children of white status to the School, but there seems no particular objection to this provided the Indian pupils receive adequate attention. At present there are more white pupils than Indian attending.\n\nIn addition to the supplies authorized by Departmental letter No. 158-11-5 (W.T.1) of July 5, 1947, through the Indian Commissioner's office, Father Forget purchased the following wire, sotex board, and curtain material billed on the Hudson's Bay Co.'s Account covered by voucher No. 326 attached hereto. These items were used in constructing desks, and providing a screen across the church interior to shut off the altar, etc. during school hours. Payment of the account is recommended. Voucher No. 371 covering the purchase of lumber and screws as authorized is also attached.\n\ncont.\nSheslay-Telegraph Creek Day School, cont.\n\nWith regard to the advance for labour and cartage supplied by the Department, the following account is submitted:\n\nAdvance .......................................................... $125.00\nCredit Voucher No. 373 - wages, labour & cartage $33.00\n\nUnused balance. .................................................. $92.00\n\nThe unused balance of $92.00 is being refunded by cheque to the Receiver General under cover of Payment Sheet No. 11.\n\nThe operation of this Sheslay-Telegraph Creek Indian Day School is contingent somewhat upon whether or not the local Public School is open. This term the School Board was unable to secure a teacher, and the school did not open. This meant that Catholic children normally attending the Public School, and for whom the Department was paying a tuition grant, were without schooling until the opening of the Indian Day School. However, with the possibility of the Public School re-opening next term it is quite likely that these same Catholic Indian children will attend the latter school because of the full-term advantages. This will probably bring about a corresponding decrease in possible attendance at the Indian School, lowering the pupilage to such an extent that it will not be feasible to operate.\n\nA percentage of the Catholic Indian children mentioned in the above paragraph are children of tax-payers and entitled to attend the Provincial public school without payment of the usual tuition grant per capita required for Indian children from the local Reserve.\n\nR.H.S.

Sampson, Indian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nThe Department has just received your letter of November 21st with reference to operation of an Indian day school at Telegraph Creek instead of Sheshley. We have noted the contents of your letter and unless the attendance increases, the Department does not see much advantage in continuing the operation of the school.\n\nIt has already been brought to our attention that by conducting the school at Telegraph Creek we are encouraging the Indians to live in the village rather than to follow their usual winter habits.\n\nIn the event that you decide to close the school owing to the small attendance, is it the intention to operate the Sheshley school during the balance of the current winter?

(RG 10, Volume 6383, file 798-5, part 1)\nJanuary 21, 1948.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nWe have recently been advised that the day school in operation in the village of Telegraph Creek was closed on December 19th. The average attendance was very disappointing to us as it was only 10.2 during the months of November and December.\n\nJudging by past experience it is doubtful if any very regular attendance could be secured if a school is operated at Sheshley. This statement is made in view of the fact that during the 45 day term in the fall of 1946, the average attendance was approximately seven.\n\nUnless the Department can be definitely assured that the average attendance will be much larger than it has been in the past, we do not see any great advantage in reopening the school either at Telegraph Creek or at Sheshley.\n\nFrom the information we have received it would appear that Indian children in this district should be recruited for the new Teslin Lake residential school when it is opened.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Rev.I. Coudert, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVisar Apostolic,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 798-5, part 1)\nI beg to acknowledge the Department's letter of December 20, 1947, file 158-11-5 (ST1), concerning operation of Indian day school at Telegraph Creek.\n\nAttendance improved somewhat during November and December, and the average for the quarter was finally 10.2. The school closed on December 19 with no assurance that it would reopen at least until March, 1948. Unless an attendance of at least 10 is certain this school will not be opened again this term, either at Telegraph Creek, or Sheslay. If the Indian families do as they have in previous seasons there will be more children at Telegraph Creek than Sheslay; the men usually bring in their families in late March and leave them in town while they themselves go out beaver trapping.\n\nThe original opening of the Sheslay School was only recommended on the understanding that the attendance would be at least ten. During the 45 day term in the fall of 1946 the average attendance was near 7. Bishop Coudert of Whitehorse was advised early in 1947 that unless Rev. Forget, the teacher, would guarantee to extend the term to 4 months, and assure an attendance of at least 10, this office would not recommend reopening the school in 1947. As Rev. Forget realized he could not get that attendance at Sheslay his alternative was to open the school in town where it appeared he would have a good attendance. Owing to sickness the average was down for the first month, but was sufficient in November and December to warrant continuation of the school in town. However, the school only operated 45 days again this term, and this is not considered satisfactory for a continuation of the scheme in future years.\n\ncont.\nThe opposition of local fur traders to an Indian day school operated in town is quite understandable. They feel that if the families remain in so that their children may benefit from schooling, they may lose business from decreased fur catches owing to the late start possibly made by trappers. Under the present hit and miss school system in effect in this agency I am inclined to feel that the Indians are indeed better off out on, or near their traplines even if the children are deprived of a few weeks school, but if a regular Indian day school were established here where the children could attend the full term and receive professional instruction I would not hesitate to state that the long-term benefits to be derived from schooling would far outweigh the immediate advantages of living out of town. The trader's interest is naturally selfish, and it seems to me that from past experience the trapper goes out to his line as soon as he realizes there is no chance of securing further supplies until he produces some fur. Many of the trappers already leave their families in early November and go out to their trap-lines alone, and if the others are not encouraged to remain in town by supplying them with relief assistance they too will get out.\n\nIn conclusion, the information requested by the Department is stated briefly here: In the event that the attendance in town is not sufficient to re-open the school in March it would not be practical to open the school at Sheslay either because the attendance there is likely to be lower even than in town, and the difficulty of transporting supplies to Sheslay, for the sake of a few weeks schooling, is not justified; neither is the expense.\n\nR.H.C.

Indian Reserve, Bella Coola Agency have informed me they have almost completed a log building 33' x 18' which they hope may be used for a Day School. It is possible they may get financial assistance from the Roman Catholic Church to line it and make it habitable for school purposes, this work to be completed by August of this year.\n\nThere are approximately fourteen children of school age available in the immediate vicinity of Anaham Lake for attendance at such a school if opened on a seasonal basis for six months a year.\n\nThis new building when completed will require the following equipment to make it usable as a school:\n\n1. One 48\" Cordwood heater, $24-50 est. cost (with stovepipes etc.) $50.50\n2. Two sheets hyloplate blackboard, 4 x 12 and 24 feet chalk trough. $42.40\n3. Eighteen desks, 18/3's complete; 3 fronts, 3 rears. $193.70\n4. One teachers desk, #7250 desk and chair. $44.90\n5.

(RG 10, Volume 6383, file 799-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWill you please give this your consideration and if favourable consult the Roman Catholic Archbishop Wm. Duke as to the reaction of the Church to opening such a school and the possibility of securing a teacher this winter. It is recommended that such a school be instituted as a seasonal school from November 1st to April 30th for a year or so and then extended as to duration if results warrant same.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 14, 1945.\n\nF.E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nYour File 71-11-1\n\nI have to refer to your letter of June 5th wherein you recommend the establishment of a Day School at Anahim Lake.\n\nPerhaps I should point out that no provision was made in the current year's estimates for the outlays required in providing for the teacher's salary and the necessary accommodation. However, I am quite prepared to put the matter up to the Department because where a need for a school exists every effort should be made to meet the situation as soon as possible, but as you are going into the area shortly I should first like to have further information from you regarding the building referred to and the names and ages of children of school age and pre-school age living in the area the school would serve. You might list the information regarding the children under the following headings:\n\n| Name of Parent or Guardian | Names of Children | Church | Home Address | Conditions |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|------------|\n\nHome conditions should be listed as good, fair or poor.\n\nIf the Department approves, sufficient funds will be provided to meet our needs so that I doubt if it is necessary or advisable to approach the Church for assistance in lining the building.\nAs you know, the Ulkatcho Day School has been closed since 1943 as we have not been able since then to secure a teacher. In view of this, what possible chance have we for getting a teacher for the proposed school at Anahim even if the expenditures required were forthcoming? I am afraid that we are going to have some difficulty getting teachers for seasonal schools because of the remoteness of their location and the short term.\n\nThe Sisters of Christ the King are in charge of our Day School at the Anahim Reserve, Alexis Creek, and it is just possible that they may be in a position to find sufficient staff for the existing Schools at Redstone Indian Meadows and Ulkatcho and the proposed school at Anahim.\n\nYou might look further into the matter when you are at Anahim Lake and let me have the information requested herein and the benefit of your views on the proposal as a result of your visit.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Proposed Anahim Lake Indian Day School.\n\nRe your file 2-11-3 of June 14th, a complete survey of the above named project was undertaken and the following is a summary thereof:\n\n1.

The building. The Anahim Lake Indians have constructed a log building 30 x 20 feet, and 11 feet to the ceiling. Roof is shiplap, with roofing paper thereon. It is a strong, well constructed building, with shiplap floor. This floor should be doubled, and the ceiling should be lined in. The windows (two) have been placed on the wrong side and there are not enough of them. The Indians have consented to put four, six light windows on the left side of the building.\n\nThe Indians have given free labour on this school, but have incurred bills for lumber, roofing etc., totalling \u00a3185.25 but I understand that the Roman Catholic church is going to assist with part, if not all of these accounts.\n\nIn addition to the items enumerated as equipment in my letter to you of June 5th, file 7-4-1, I would estimate that the following would be required to put this building in condition for a classroom.\n\n2,000 f.b.m. shiplap for double living of floor and ceiling @ $25.00 M. plus $25.00 for hauling and delivery $75.00\n\n4 rolls building paper 12.00\n\nNails and Misc. 13.00\n\n$100.00\n\nLater on the log walls should be lined with panels.\n\n3. Teacherage. The Indians agreed to have a building erected, of similar size to the School, with partitions, suitable for a teacherage, by October 1st of this year. They have the logs cut now, and the lumber and fittings have been ordered. They will incur, apart from labour which will be free, an expense of \u00a3131.90 on this unit, and here again, I understand the Church is assisting in meeting these accounts. In addition to this building, the Indians will build separate outhouses for pupils and teachers. There is suitable water supply adjacent to the proposed teacherage.\n\nPhotos were taken of the building presently erected (on Anahim Lake Reserve #2) and of the children who came to the meeting with their parents. These will be forwarded shortly.\n\nThe Indians asked me if there was any chance of opening a school this November. I informed them that if the school building was completed as outlined herein and if the teacherage and outhouses were completed as planned, I would recommend that the Department ask the R.C. Church to nominate a teacher for a seasonal school of six months duration, but that I could give no guarantee that the teachers could be supplied or funds for their salaries provided for the fiscal year 1945-46.\n\nIt is recommended that in view of the evident need of a school for the children available and willing to enroll therein, immediate steps be taken to provide funds for equipment and salaries for a teacher for this School and that the R.C. Church authorities be approached re the possibility of providing teaching staff.\n\nIt is my opinion that as between the Ulkatcho School and the proposed school at Anahim, the latter should be used in preference to the former. It would be easier to obtain staff for this school; it is not as isolated, and I believe that the majority of the Ulkatcho children (including the Anahim Lake part of the band) are located in the vicinity of Anahim. Several Indians informed me that were a school opened at Anahim, they would bring their children out rather than keep them in Ulkatcho.\nRe: Proposed school at Anahim Lake.\n\nIt is recommended that no single man or woman be sent to Ulkatcho alone. The place is too lonely and conditions of living are too strenuous. It would appear more reasonable for the Church to endeavour to send either two Sisters or two Brothers to these isolated Reserves.\n\nF.

Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAn application has been received from Mr. Indian Agent Anfield for the establishment of a Day school at Anahim Lake, Bella Coola Indian Agency. A copy of the correspondence relating to this application is enclosed, and I should say that the information submitted indicates the need of a Day school at this point.\n\nThe Indians have erected a log building in anticipation of the Department's approval of provision of a Day school for their children. Mr. Anfield has reported that the building is quite suitable for the purpose. It is understood that an expenditure in excess of $300.00 has been incurred in connection with the building, which the Department will be asked, in due course, to meet.\n\nThe recommendation of Mr. Anfield that a Day school be established at Anahim Lake is endorsed.\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/KT\nEncs.\nOttawa, 10th September, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI was somewhat confused when I received your letter of the 7th instant this morning as you were recommending the establishment of a Day School at Anahim Lake. We have a school by that name in the Williams Lake Agency.\n\nAfter reviewing the latter and also some of our files, I reached the conclusion that the school recommended in your letter of September 7th is the successor to the school formerly known as Ulkatcho. If I am correct, the latter name should be used in all future correspondence instead of the name of Anahim Lake so we will not confuse it with the school in the Williams Lake Agency.\n\nI agree with the statement made in your letter of June 14 to Indian Agent Anfield namely if the Department approves, sufficient funds will be provided to meet our needs consequently it will not be necessary to approach the Church for financial assistance.\n\nReverting to Agent Anfield's letter of July 11th, the following expenditures are approved:\n\n(1) $185.25 - for lumber, roofing, etc.\n(2) $100.00 - for purchase of shiplap, building paper, nails and misc.\n(3) $131.90 - for material for teacher's residence.\n\n........over\nAuthority is also granted for you to purchase the stove, blackboards, desks, fuel and other miscellaneous items that may be necessary either for the school or teacher's residence.\n\nIn forwarding accounts covering the expenditures authorized above, you should attach copy of your Purchase Orders.\n\nAll these expenditures are being authorized on the understanding that you will be able to secure satisfactory teachers. If you can obtain sisters as suggested by Agent Anfield, a salary will be allowed each of them of $110.00 a teaching month.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 160-2-1\n\nI have to refer to your letter of September 10th regarding the establishment of an Indian Day school at Anahim Lake.\n\nAlthough reference was made in your letter of October 14, 1943, to the establishment of schools at Alexis Creek and \"Anahim Lake\" Reserves, we have no school at Anahim Lake nor a school designated Anahim Lake. We have, however, a school at the Anaham Reserve established under Order in Council No. P.C.88, reference your 160-2-1 or January 15, 1943, in this connection.\n\nThe following Indian Day schools have already been established in the Cariboo district:\n\n(1) Anaham Indian Day School on Anaham Indian Reserve approximately five miles south easterly from Alexis Creek Post Office.\n\n(2) Alexis Creek Indian Day School on Charley Boy's Meadow I.R. No. 3, Redstone Meadows, twenty-two miles north westerly from Redstone Post Office.\n\n(3) Ulkatcho Indian Day School on Ulkatcho Indian Reserve No. 2 some eighty-two miles north-westerly from Tatla Lake Post Office.\n\nThe Anaham and Alexis Creek schools are in the Williams Lake Agency, whereas the Ulkatcho school is in the Bella Coola Agency. The proposed new Indian Day School is on the Upper\nDean River at Anahim Lake, Bella Coola Agency, approximately forty-nine miles north-westerly from Tatla Lake Post Office. You will note the spelling Anahim in this case, whereas Anaham is used for the Reserve and school five miles south easterly of Alexis Creek Post Office. Should the Department approve of the establishment of a school at Anahim Lake, as recommended in my letter 2-11-3 dated September 7, 1945, it might be well to call it by some other name than the one suggested in order to avoid confusion with the school already established at the Anaham Reserve. Perhaps the name \"Upper Dean River Indian Day School\" would be more suitable under the circumstances.\n\nI am enclosing a road map of the Province whereon I have marked the schools already established in the Cariboo district westerly from Williams Lake and the location of the proposed school on the Upper Dean River at the southerly end of Anahim Lake and trust the information marked thereon may prove of assistance to the Department in dealing with the proposed application and matters relating to the schools already established.\n\nIt is somewhat unfortunate that in drafting the covering Order in Council establishing the school at Redstone Meadows the school was designated Alexis Creek as it is actually over seventy miles by road to the west of Alexis Creek Post Office and continues to be confused with the Anaham school which, of course, is located close to the white community of that name. In order to avoid confusion, I should say that it will be necessary to call this little school Redstone Meadows and not Alexis Creek.\n\nThe school at Ulkatcho has been closed for some time owing to the difficulty in getting a teacher and I have no hope at the moment that a qualified teacher will be found for this term. Reverend Father Hennessy is to continue at the Alexis Creek (Redstone Meadows) school for this term, and it has been reported that if the Department approves of the establishment of a Day school at Anahim Lake that arrangements to secure the services of a qualified teacher for same can be made.\n\nD.M.

The roof is shiplap with roofing paper. It is a strong, well constructed building. The Indians have given free labour on the school but have incurred an expenditure of approximately $800.00 for material, which they would like the Department to pay.\n\nThe Indians have also agreed to erect a log building, suitable for a teacher's residence. Apart from the logs and lumber, which will be free as far as the Department is concerned, there will be an expenditure of $150.00 on this unit.\n\nIn view of the above, I recommend the establishment of this school, to be known as \"Upper Dean River Indian Day School\", and enclose Memorandum to Council, as required by Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act.\n\nDirector.\n13/2/1\n\nOttawa, October 27, 1945.\n\nB.C.

Some work of a minor character is required in connection with both buildings before they will be ready for use.\n\nDuring my visit I also discussed with Mr. Indian Agent Christie the possibility of securing a teacher for this school having in mind Mrs. Lester Dorsey who with her husband and family resides in the district. Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter of October 29th in this connection is enclosed from which it will be noted that Mrs. Dorsey's services if acceptable to the Department might be made available after the Christmas holidays. Mrs. Dorsey is not a Roman Catholic but I have discussed her proposed appointment with Archbishop Duke who would not oppose it inasmuch as he is not in a position to nominate a qualified Roman Catholic teacher. Although I am not aware of Mrs. Dorsey's academic qualifications I understand she is a certificated teacher and it is considered that the Department would be well advised to secure her services. I would recommend approval of her appointment at a salary of $135.00 a teaching month. As tentative approval of her appointment will be required by Mr. Christie before November 11th it would be appreciated if you would wire him if her appointment is approved.\n\nI may say that it is my intention in the near future to recommend that both the Anahim and Ulkatcho Indians be brought under the administration of the Williams Lake Agency office as their reserves are much more accessible from Williams Lake than from the Bella Coola Agency headquarters.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th instant regarding a teacher for the Upper Dean River Indian Day School, I went out to Rose Lake yesterday accompanied by Father Hennessy to interview Mrs. Lester Dorsey.\n\nFather Hennessy and I were both favourably impressed with Mrs. Dorsey and she would like very much to teach at the Upper Dean River School so that she could at least go home for week-ends. However, Mrs. Dorsey would not leave her present position until the Christmas holidays and she does not wish to make any definite arrangement until she has seen Mr. Dyson, the Secretary for the school district. Mrs. Dorsey would also prefer that another teacher could be got for Rose Lake before she resigned but she will give me a definite answer on November 11th when she will be attending the teacher's convention at Williams Lake.\n\nSince Mrs. Dorsey is not a Roman Catholic, I would however, like to be assured that when I see her on November 11th, I can make a definite arrangement with her since she would have to give notice to her present employer.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dorsey are very favourably known to the Indians at Anaham Lake and from what I can gather they are not active members of any church, and would not be likely to prejudice the children one way or another. Father Hennessy, C.M.I. will be able to look after the religious instruction of the children and he is of the opinion that this arrangement should work out very well. He is anxious to see the school open at Anaham Lake, in view of the interest that the Indians have shown in building the school and teacher's residence.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOctober 1st, 1946.\n\nDept. Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\nHerewith quarterly report of the Agent, Bella Coola Agency,\nfor the period ending September 1946.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nDay Schools have re-opened at Bella Coola, two divisions; Bella Bella, two divisions; Klemtu, one division and Kitamaat, two divisions. No teacher has yet been appointed for the Upper Dean River school. Mr. Gordon Robinson, native of Kitamaat attended Normal school last year and did very well indeed. He has been appointed to the staff of the Day School at Kitamaat.\n\nIt is too early to judge attendance at the various schools, but with the closing of the canneries, families are now returning to their home villages, and school attendance should become regular. Reports for September from teachers in the villages have not yet been received.\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nActing Indian Agent.\nBella Coola, B.C., April 6, 1946.\n\nMARCH QUARTER REPORT\n\nUpper Dean River Indian Day school. This school has been furnished and equipped but so far no teacher has been appointed. Fuel for the 1946-47 term has been cut and stored. The Ulkatcho Indian Day school has remained closed this year.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nJanuary 17, 1946.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945.\n\nEducation: During the past quarter the senior teacher at Bella Bella resigned and has been replaced. It has not been possible to secure a second teacher for Bella Coola. A new school has been established at Upper Dean River at Anahim Lake, but so far no appointment has been made. A second teacher was secured for the Kitamaat school. Attendance on the whole has improved but education in the broader sense of the word is the real weak link in the Indian programme. Right now in B.C., there is no inspector of Indian Schools, qualifications for teaching and calibre of appointments made is generally very low and most schools are seriously overcrowded. These conditions are not conducive of a good response by the pupils and a complete overhauling of the entire educational policy of the Department appears more and more urgent as time goes on. There is a great deal of criticism by the parents of the operation of the Residential Schools and some of this is undoubtedly based on real grievances, caused by unsuitable staffing of the schools in question.\n\nF.

(RG 10, Volume 6383, file 799-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nA trip was made to Ansham Lake early in March, the roads having been ploughed and conditions quite favourable at the time and the Upper Dean River Indian Day School was visited in the Bella Cools Agency. Although there is no doubt that Mrs. Dorsey is an outstanding teacher only 8 Indian pupils were present. These pupils however, are with one or two exceptions, doing very well and attending quite regularly. The difficulty here, as elsewhere in this Agency, is that the parents are so widely scattered in isolated meadows, feeding cattle or on their traplines. There are other Indians of course, who are indifferent, but day schools are still in their infancy in this Agency and I think that wherever possible they should be continued if at all possible with the hope that the Indians will become more conscious of the benefits to be derived.\n\nWm Christie\nIndian Agent\n\nCopied:\nJum\nAugust 11th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Upper Dean River Indian Day School\n\nSuperintendent Christie has informed us that due to the late harvest there is unlikely to be sufficient pupils in the vicinity of the above-mentioned School to warrant its opening until the beginning of October.\n\nIt is recommended that authority be given to delay the opening of the School until that time and that Mrs. Dorsey's cheque for the month of September be withheld pending information as to the date of the re-opening of this school.\n\nW.

We have just received the following letter from Indian Superintendent Christie:\n\n\"Mrs. Ann McKilvington, teacher at the Upper Dean River Indian Day School advised me by telephone that a cheque was received by her husband, H.W. McKilvington, for approximately $315.00. It is not known if this office or by Mr. McKilvington that this money was owed him by the Department. Therefore, it is presumed that the cheque was meant for Mrs. Ann McKilvington for teaching the school. It would be very much appreciated if you would kindly advise me by return mail, and in future please make the salary cheque for teaching payable to Mrs. Ann McKilvington.\"\n\nIf possible, we would appreciate it if you would arrange to have future payments of salary issued in the name of \"Mrs. Ann McKilvington\".\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nSeptember 1st, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Upper Dean River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th August, regarding the opening of the Upper Dean River Indian Day School, I contacted Mrs Mc Kilvington by phone today. She advises that there are no Indians at Anahim Lake at present but that haying should be almost completed by the end of September. She suggested that school should open on October 3rd.\n\nPersonally I am of the opinion that the residents of Anahim Lake and surroundings will be haying up to freeze up this year and in my experience of that district I would consider the beginning of October in every year the earliest we can expect a satisfactory school attendance.\n\nI shall be going into Anahim Lake in about a weeks time and can advise you further after getting more information but there is no doubt that opening of this school should be delayed at least one month.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Upper Deer River Indian Day School\n\nYou will note from Superintendent Christie's letter of September 1st attached, that the above-mentioned School will not likely open until October 3rd.\n\nfor W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 799-l, part 1)\nW. S. Arneil Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nOn my recent visit to the Upper Dean River Indian Day School it was noted that Mr. and Mrs. McKilvington had three Indian children boarding with her - Isabella Squinas, daughter of Louis Squinas, for whom they are receiving $20.00 from the parents plus Family Allowance, also Edward Canoose and Helen Zulin, children of Jimmy Zulin and Nellie Baptiste, for whom they are only receiving Family Allowance.\n\nIn this connection I would quote from a letter received from Mrs. McKilvington:\n\n\"When you and Mr. Lees were here a week ago, I spoke to you about the three youngsters who are staying with us. We asked you if there was any remuneration for anyone rooming and boarding youngsters so that they can attend school.\n\nFrom Nellie (Canoose) and Fatty Zulin we are receiving nothing, except the Family Allowance, which amounts to seven dollars ($7.00) for each child or a total of fourteen dollars ($14.00) a month altogether. Louis Squinas is paying us twenty dollars ($20.00) a month plus the Family Allowance\".\n\nWhile Mr. and Mrs. McKilvington are taking very good care of these children and treat them like they were their own I doubt very much if the Department will consider\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.\n\n18/3/50\n\ncontributing anything on their behalf since this would only create a precedent, as there are many other children belonging to the Ulkatcho Band, who have just as much right to this assistance as these two children of Jimmy Zulin.\n\nI would appreciate, however, receiving a letter from the Department giving an answer to Mrs. McKilvington's request so that I may reply to the letter received from Mrs. McKilvington.\n\nWm. Christie, Supt.,\nWilliams Lake Indian Agency.\nApril 23, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Upper Dean River Day School\n\nI attach herewith a letter from Mr. Superintendent Christie concerning the boarding of three Indian children with the teacher at the above-mentioned school. It will be noted that Mrs. MacKilvain has requested assistance in defraying the cost of boarding these children, but that Mr. Christie does not feel he can recommend that the Department make any contribution. Although I am inclined to agree with Mr. Christie, it may be that the Department has had experience with situations of this nature and if so, I would appreciate the Department's comments and ruling.\n\nOne factor has not been mentioned by Mr. Christie. It is impossible in this area to provide transportation for the children in question due to the lack of roads and severe winter weather.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMay 9, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nUpper Dean River Indian Day School\n\nReference your 160/25-1 of April 25\n\nWe have noted the request from the teacher of the above school for payment of board of Indian children residing at her home. We have never previously received a similar request and we do not have funds to make any payment for the children's maintenance at Mrs. McKilvington's home.\n\nBernard F.

Supply of the items listed on the requisition is recommended.\n\nIt is assumed that if the Department approves the purchase of a rhythm band it will be necessary to buy the instruments in Vancouver, and it is suggested than an amount of $17.00 be allowed for this purpose.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nApril 17th, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

You may also purchase rhythm band equipment at a cost of $17.00.\n\nIn view of the small enrolment at this school, as mentioned in the third paragraph of Mr. Christie's letter of March 14th, the Department does not consider it advisable to purchase a sewing machine at the present time.\n\nBernard F.

(RO 10, Volume 6383, file 799-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nLast week I contacted Mr. Lester Dorsey at Anaham Lake and he has definitely agreed to teach at the Upper Bear River Indian Day School next term commencing September 1947.\n\nI might add that the white people have been agitating for a school for white children who have got tops out for same. They were waiting for the Inspector to go in and pretty well talked Mr. Dorsey into accepting the position as teacher. Mr. Dorsey realized however that the white school was only a possibility this year. I was talking to some of the whites and pointed out that the Department was not very particular who ran the school at Anaham Lake so long as Indian children were not locked up unfavorably. One party in particular felt that the Indian children were too dirty for her children to associate with so that I think that the Department should go ahead and give the living accommodation for Mr. Dorsey as comfortably as possible. Personally I think we are fortunate to get a teacher like Mr. Dorsey who is not too squeamish and knows and understands the Indians at Anaham Lake very well.\n\nI looked over the buildings with Mr. L. M. Mathews, who I discovered building a frame house up there and also asked him to get together with Mrs. Dorsey regarding a few cupboards and shelves for the Teacherage and School.\n\nYou may recollect that we bought some Donnacoma from Mr. Kenney last fall. This has never put on and is only about half enough. It is not satisfactory to put Donnacoma on top of logs and I would suggest that the logs be stripped with \"x\" x 4\" and lined with rough lumber of which there would seem to be sufficient here, before applying the Donnacoma. A second floor of shiplap 14\" apart between will make the Teacherage much warmer. Mr. Dorsey would like to have the floor covered with linoleum but I do not recommend it.\n\nIt is important the Indians did not put on the Donnacoma last fall because they did not know how to do so and I think that it will be better to have a man who understands a little more about carpentry do the finishing work. In any case the Indians are all busy making new ceiling of the school was not lined. The lumber is only sufficient to tack Vancouver board on which is not satisfactory. Some of the board has fallen off the ceiling already. I would suggest that where the edges of the Vancouver board can they should be stripped and we might get along with this for a year or two. Eventually the school should be lined with lumber along the ceiling and inside the logs.\n\nI could have supplied all of the lumber from the sawmill at Anaham but it is shut down for haymaking and I do not think we have any double dressed boards for shelving. We may still be able to get it there however as everything in the building shop is very scarce here.\n\nI was unable to get any quotations on Donnacoma here but might be able to get it shipped up from Vancouver with material for the convent at Anaham once I receive authorization. I would appreciate authorization to get the material wherever I can get it as although Gardiner and Sons have sent a quotation there is no assurance that they will be able to supply this material when we require it which is right away.\n\nRegarding labour, I talked the matter over with Mr. Fred Johnson who is very helpful and he figured the actual work to be done to approximately $350.00 without leaving any profits and thinks that the figure quoted by Mr. Mathews is fairly reasonable.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As previously advised this school is much more accessible from the Williams Lake Agency than from the Bella Coola Agency, consequently I have had Mr. Christie look into the matter.\n\nThe Agent's letter of August 2nd and enclosures are forwarded herein, from which you will note that expenditures totalling approximately $1100.00 will be necessary. $679.00 only was provided in the Bella Coola Agency estimates, but now that we have been assured of the services of Mrs. Lester Dorsey as teacher, it is considered that we should take such action as may be necessary to make the buildings comfortable. I would appreciate being advised if the amount of $1100.00 can be made available for this school, and if it will be in order to purchase the furnishings and materials requested by Mr. Christie.\n\nD.

The other half of the cut is being disposed of to the Department or elsewhere and the proceeds, less a certain percentage reserved to meet unforeseen expenditures, is used to meet operating costs of the mill. Under this arrangement the Department is assured of a supply of lumber at prices which today are reasonable. The Indians are assured of a supply of lumber to meet their housing requirements and the Department is relieved of the cost of operating the mill.\n\nThe enclosed vouchers are recommended for payment and I would appreciate receiving confirmation from the Department that the proposal as set out above with respect to the operation of this mill is acceptable.\n\nD.

C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 13 regarding repairs and improvements required at Upper Dean River Indian Day School, I have looked over the requirements of this school and discussed them with Inspector Davey and also Mr. McKilvington, who is prepared to carry out this work. The improvements to be done, and for which quotations for material and labour have been received, are as follows:\n\n- Fencing of teacherage and school grounds\n- Digging of school well and installation of pump\n- Painting of teacherage walls and ceiling\n- Doors for cupboards in teacherage\n- Shingle roof for teacherage\n- Puttying windows\n- Installation of window screens\n- Chinking between logs of school and teacherage\n- Construction of well house\n\nTotal repairs amount to:\n\n| Material | $483.92 (plus freight) |\n|----------|------------------------|\n| Labour   | 352.50                 |\n\nEven though considerable expense is indicated, this school and teacherage has not cost very much money and these improvements are all necessary for the comfort of the pupils and teacher, and also for the general appearance of the grounds.\n\nRegarding the stock fence for which no quotation is submitted, I have quoted the prices given on similar fences supplied for Anaham and Redstone Schools. I would suggest that you verify these prices from Mac and Mac by telephone, which will expedite the carrying out of the repairs.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated as Mr. McKilvington is prepared to go ahead immediately.\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm. Christie, Supt.,\nWilliams Lake Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nFollowing District School Inspector Davey's report of June 2nd in connection with the Upper Dean Indian Day School, Supt. Christie was asked to investigate and report with regard to repairs and improvements required. These are outlined in his letter of July 20th attached and you will note that the estimated cost is approximately $840.00.\n\nNo specific provision was made in the Estimates for any work at this school, possibly on account of the confusion between the Bella Coola and Williams Lake Agencies in connection with the administration of the school, but as stated by Mr. Christie this school was established at very little cost to the Department and if at all possible it is felt that the expenditure necessary to bring the school up to a reasonable standard should be made.\n\nI would recommend that the Department endeavour to secure funds to the extent required and that an accountable advance of $352.50 be forwarded to Mr. Christie to meet labour costs. This office can arrange for purchase of the materials.\n\nW.S.

Z.2. had not, up to the time of writing, reached the Department. In reply I beg to state that enquiries for the missing articles have been made of the Post Office Inspector here who has promised to do what he can towards the recovery of the Photographs.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge your letter 478-V-4, dated January 16th 1906, asking for information as to the manner in which Miss Rhodes School-teacher at Alert Bay attends to the duties devolving upon her in that capacity, and the reason why so few pupils attend the School.\n\nFirst, Miss Emily Rhodes is a very clever person and well qualified. She taught in a private school on the continent nine years, and had private classes in \"English Literature\" in Vancouver for four years; and in London, England, she was Collegiate Science and Literature Lecturer.\n\nShe appeared to me to be attending to her duties well, and the girls at the school seemed delighted with her. Of course the Indian School work is new to her. She asked me a great many questions regarding the conducting of the school and I tried to assist her by suggestions.\n\nSecondly, The reason so few pupils attend the school was due to the fact that quite a number were sick. Mumps and whooping-cough had been epidemic, and several were sick at the time of inspection. Others were absent with parents from the village.\n\nMiss Rhodes informed me that the camp children did not attend. She said she had taken out 10 summonses in September against Indians for not sending their children to school, but they had not been served. She asked to whom she should apply for help in getting in the children. I referred her to the Indian Agent who lives in the village.\n\nMiss Rhodes\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\nMiss Rhodes is teaching while Mrs. Hall, who taught the school for years, is on a visit to England. Mrs. Hall knew every child in the village and so had great influence in getting the children to attend. Miss Rhodes, a new teacher, cannot be expected to know them as well and have as much influence in such a short time. She has only taught since the summer holidays.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) A.E. Green,\nInspector.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in which you refer to the application (which was returned to you from this office) of Miss E. Rhodes, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School for extension of two weeks to the usual Christmas holidays in regard to which you were asked to either recommend or disapprove of the request so made. In reference to your remark as to your impression \"that everything in connection with these schools was under the management of the Missionary Society and that the Department held the Church Missionary Society responsible for anything in connection with them.\", I may state that while it is true that the Department does look to the Society named for the proper management of the institutions under its charge, it nevertheless expects its Agent in the locality to exercise a general supervision over the affairs of these schools to satisfy himself that the best possible use is being made of the funds of the Department and the time of the pupils. To this end it considers it incumbent upon the Agent to deal specifically with each such application for leave, etc., to determine in how far it is deemed advisable to comply with the application. Each request emanating from the Society must have the comments of the local Agent made thereon by way of a separate letter containing either a recommendation of the application or disapproval of it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) A.W.

Rhodes, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, for the extension of two weeks to the usual Christmas holidays, and asking for my approval or disapproval and in reply I beg to say that from previous correspondence on the matter of the Indian schools, I was under the impression that everything in connection with those schools was under the management of the Missionary Society and that the Department held the Church Missionary Society responsible for anything in connection with them; however, it doesn't matter now as Miss Rhodes has left and I understood from her that she intends to take the holidays anyway.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) G.W.

Rhodes, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, for an extension of what you term the usual two weeks Christmas holidays, to the 17th of January next. I have to return your letter and its enclosure as you neglected to either approve or disapprove of the request made to you. As you know, it is always necessary for the Agent to make a recommendation one way or the other in a case of this kind.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) A.W. Vowell\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nG.W. DeBeck Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that on or about the 9th ultimo I received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent DeBeck enclosing a communication addressed to him by Miss Rhodes, Teacher of the Day School at Alert Bay, asking for extra holidays in addition to what he referred to as the usual two weeks Christmas holidays.\n\nAs he merely forwarded Miss Rhodes' application without any comment as to the necessity or desirability, etc., of acceding to her request the application was returned to him for his recommendation or otherwise.\n\nI inclose herewith copies of the following letters received and written on the subject for the information of the Department, viz:-Letter from this office, to Agent, of 9th ultimo, No.74 V-4; do., from Agent, of 13th ultimo; do. from this office, to Agent, 26th ultimo, No.237 V-4; do. from Agent, 4th instant; do., from Revd.A.E. Green, Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nTouching Agent's remark, in letter of 19th ultimo, to the effect that from previous correspondence he considered that such matters were under the management of the Missionary Society, etc., I may say that as he neither gave dates nor numbers in connection with the correspondence referred to, I am at a loss to know to what he alludes.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 3, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult., inclosing correspondence relative to the application for leave made by Miss Rhodes, Teacher of the day school at Alert Bay, and in reply I beg to say that from the correspondence the Department considers that you should have dealt with this application.\n\nWhen forwarding the return for March quarter from this school you should state in the marginal column for remarks whether or not you consider Miss Rhodes should be paid for the time she was absent. If she was absent without leave and you are not satisfied with her explanations for such absence, a deduction will be made from her salary for the time lost.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nT D McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian schools throughout the superintendency were sent to the local Indian Agent in order that he might either approve of or disapprove of the same. In this instance, although Miss Rhodes observed the necessary procedure by forwarding her application, in writing, to Mr. Agent DeBeck, who in turn sent it here, he failed to either recommend the request for leave or disapprove of the same. On receipt of the Agent's letter covering Miss Rhodes request for leave, it was at once perceived that he had omitted to make the usual and necessary recommendation, whereupon he was asked to make a specific recommendation either for or against the application. Had the Agent observed the required procedure when forwarding the request no difficulty would have been experienced in at once satisfactorily disposing of the application. When I received the Agent's reply, dated the 19th of Dec. last, a copy of which was with other communications transmitted to the Department on the 23rd ultimo, under cover of letter No. 574. V. 4., he stated, as will be seen by a reference to the correspondence, that \"it doesn't matter now\" as Miss Rhodes has left and I understood from her that she \"intends to take the holidays anyway.\"\n\nFrom this it will be seen that I had not been supplied with the required data by the Agent on which to deal with the application in point; indeed, as a matter of fact, it was not until writing to this office on the 4th of last month that Mr. DeBeck stated that he did not approve of the holidays being extended and in the meantime,\nas already remarked by the Agent, the teacher had left the school, without receiving from this office the necessary authority for taking that step, thus practically by her own act taking the matter out of my hands before having had time to dispose of it according to the usual practice observed with respect to requests of this kind.\n\nBefore closing I should like to be informed if, as I interpret the spirit of the Department's letter herein acknowledged, it is intended that I am to deal with applications of this nature without first having either the Agents' recommendation of the request or his disapproval of it, expressed in unmistakeable terms. Visiting the schools of his agency as he does periodically the Indian Agent is naturally familiar with their every day requirements, and is consequently in a position to definitely advise this office as to whether such requests made to him by the teachers thereof are or are not to the advantage of these institutions. It will, therefore, I think, be readily perceived that very much depends upon the nature of the remarks the Agents see fit to make respecting all applications of the kind emanating from the teachers of the schools within the limits of his agency in the matter of my determining whether such requests are as a matter of fact inimical to or in the best interests of these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ult., in further reference to the application for leave of absence made by Miss Rhodes, teacher of the Indian school at Alert Bay; and in reply to your enquiry as to whether it is the intention of the Department that you should deal with applications of this nature without first having the Agent's recommendation or disapproval of the request I beg to say that all applications for leave should be sent to you through the Agent, who should make such comments thereon as the case requires. It would then be for you to decide whether the application should be granted or not.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nA. W.

(See letter to Supt. Vowell, on 117260/1.)\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Frank Nelson who was teaching the Indian Day School at Alert Bay did not care to resume his work at the opening of the school in August. His reason was that the salary was too small to keep his family on. Rev. A.J. Hall has been trying to get a permanent teacher but so far has been unable to do so. Miss Louisa Harris, an Indian girl of Alert Bay, who has herself been educated here has been filling the vacancy. I would not consent to her permanent appointment until she at least had demonstrated not only that she was able to teach but also that she could get the attendance of the children. So far she has done very well. This school is now only a primary school as all the larger boys are in attendance at the Industrial school.\n\nThere is an epidemic of measles at Alert Bay. Miss Harris herself has just been stricken with them and I have temporarily closed the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. Vowell Esq.\nSup't Indian Affairs for B.C.\nVictoria.\nIndian Office, Victoria, B.C.\nOct. 11th, 1909.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Department letter dated 7th inst., No. 4/7 from Mr. Agent Halliday concerning the Teacher of the Alert Bay Industrial School, Mr. Frank Nelson, who has left and reporting that owing to an epidemic of measles the school is now temporarily closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 20th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Agent Halliday in which he advises you of the temporary appointment of Miss Louisa Harris as Teacher of the Alert Bay Imperial School, in place of Mr. Frank Nelson, who did not resume his work at the re-opening of the school in August.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the temporary engagement of Miss Louise Harris, but trusts that the Rev. Mr. Hall will be able in a short time to secure the services of a qualified teacher. As you are aware the Department has increased the salaries in several of the schools in British Columbia to $400.00, and will be prepared to pay that amount to a teacher for the Alert Bay School, provided one with the necessary qualifications can be secured.\n\nThe Department regrets that it has been found necessary to close the school for a time on account of the epidemic of measles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 27th ultimo regarding the temporary appointment of Miss Louise Harris as teacher in the Alert Bay Day School, I have the honor to state that I informed Mr. Hallix that it was the wish of the Department that he should make all due haste towards the securing the services of a certificated teacher. I also informed him that in event of such an one being employed the Department was prepared to increase the grant towards the school to $400.00 per annum.\n\nHis reply was that he wished to fulfill in every way the wishes of the Department but he said \"would it not be possible to retain Miss Harris' services for the term until next June\". His reasons were that Miss Harris was having better attendance than any previous teacher, and all the pupils are elementary and she is well able to teach them. She being an Indian is well able to explain everything to them in their own tongue. Mr. Inspector Green recently visited the school and expressed himself to me as being well satisfied with the work being done.\n\nSo far Mr. Hall has been unable to procure a certificated teacher and I beg to recommend that Miss Harris be retained as long as her services prove satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nTo the\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nI hereby give notice of my intention to resign as teacher in the Alert Bay Day School on the Nunkiose Reserve at the end of this quarter.\n\nWilliam Brotchie\nTeacher\n\nAlert Bay\nMay 8th\n1912.\nOttawa, May 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing the resignation of Mr. William Brotchie as teacher of the Alert Bay School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this resignation is accepted. The records of the Department do not show that the appointment of this man was submitted to it at all; the first intimation was the receipt of the returns. In future the Department must be consulted and, should occasions arise when it is desirable to make an appointment without awaiting the sanction of the Department, such appointment is only to be temporary and the matter must be submitted to the Department for final approval. You will be good enough to consult with His Lordship the Bishop of Columbia and name a teacher for this school at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose the resignation of Mr William Brotchie as teacher of the Alert Bay Day School, which takes effect at the end of this quarter. I would recommend the acceptance of the resignation were particularly as his work as teacher has not been at all satisfactory but he was only filling in until a proper arrangement could be made.\n\nDr J.C. Reper, Bishop of Columbia is at present at Alert Bay and will visit this office today by appointment to discuss the educational question and this matter will be brought to his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of May 23rd, last, in reference to the appointment of a teacher to succeed Mr. William Brotchie at the Alert Bay Day School and to ask what action, if any, has been taken by you in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, August 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the temporary appointment of Mr. Moody, but would have much preferred had the church authorities been able to get a person with some professional qualifications and in such a case would have paid a larger salary. The usual salary paid at this school, $300.00, will be allowed Mr. Moody and should he meet with success in the work the Department will be prepared to grant an increase at an early date, his retention in the position will be dependent upon the success with which he meets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher for the Alert Bay Day School I have the honor to inform you that after receipt of your letter of May 23rd I took up the matter personally with His Lordship the Bishop of Columbia on the occasion of his visit to Alert Bay.\n\nA few days ago there arrived from Victoria a Mr G.H. Meady who had been sent by the Bishop to teach in the school. Mr Meady has no Provincial certificate but has had a good Grammar school education in England. He has not taught except in Sundayschool and church work. It is very difficult in British Columbia to get a certificated teacher for any of the Indian schools as the pay is too small. At Alert Bay there is a public school for white children and though the school is small having an average of about 18, we pay $60.00 per month for 12 months in the year, and at the last meeting decided to increase to $70.00 per month.\n\nI would recommend that Mr Meady be given an opportunity to see what he can do in the way of teaching, and I will report as to his success from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nAlert Bay,\nB.C. Oct. 2nd./12. 421709\n\nThe Honoursble,\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir.\n\nI have been appointed by the Lord Bishop of Columbia, to Alert Bay, and Rupert District.\n\nIt has been my duty and privilege during the last 27\u00bd years to teach and to care for, and to find teachers for your Indian Schools; first at Alert Bay, 1886-1887, Kitkatla, 1887-1888, Kinkolith 1888-1889, Skeena River, 1889-1911.\n\nI have only on one or two occasions had cause to write to your Honour, and I do thank you for your kind and prompt attention paid to my letters, and the fair treatment you have shown in your dealings with us.\n\nI have always tried to obtain the best teacher possible for the work to be done, and latterly you have expressed a wish for white teachers for the Indian Schools: knowing your wishes in this matter, I secured in July a reliable man age 38, of good Grammar & School education, capable of teaching; one who has been teaching in a Military school in England, for Alert Bay. I agreed to pay him salary Seven hundred dollars a year, ($700.00).\n\nI am told by your worthy Indian Agent at Alert Bay that a sum of only $300.00 can be allowed for this school until he proves himself efficient.\n\nSurely there must be some mistake.\n\nWill you kindly give this your earliest attention.\n\nI will not at present go into the conditions under which he has to teach.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\n2.

Price.\nOttawa, October 18, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the salary allowed by the Department to Mr. Moody, whose appointment as teacher of the Alert Bay Day School was approved on August 13th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as Mr. Halliday, the Indian Agent, was advised the Department would have much preferred had the church authorities been able to nominate a teacher with some qualifications for this position. Mr. Moody's academic training may have been satisfactory, but he has had no experience in the teaching of primary work nor with Indian children. Should, however, Mr. Halliday report that Mr. Moody is giving satisfaction the Department will be prepared to consider an increase in his salary, but not to the extent asked for by you, viz.- $600.00 a year. The Agent is being asked for a report on Mr. Moody's services.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. Alfred E. Price,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, October 18, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of August 13th, last, approving of the temporary appointment of Mr. Moody as teacher of the Alert Bay Day School I have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department have a report by return mail on the work which has been performed by Mr. Moody since he took charge after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of a letter from you requesting information regarding the success of Mr. George H. Meady as teacher in the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nI have mislaid the letter and cannot quote number and date.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that Mr. Meady has shown great aptitude in teaching the Indian children. He is learning the language quickly which is a great help in explaining matters to them. He is patient and painstaking in the extreme and I would recommend an increase in his salary as teacher to date from the beginning of the present quarter.\n\nI regret to state that at present Mr. Meady is very ill in the hospital at Alert Bay with double pneumonia and is not yet out of danger. During his illness Miss Louisa Harris who lately taught in the school is taking his duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 18, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reference to the work of Mr. O. H. Moody, teacher of the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will pay Mr. Moody at the rate of $500.00 per annum from the beginning of the present quarter. You will be good enough to advise him and the Rev. Mr. Price accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nExtract from Report of Inspector W.E. Ditchburn for the Month of November, 1912. Original on File 164027-56.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 26th, I visited the Indian Day School and found Miss N. Clowes substituting for the regular teacher Mr. Moody, who is now sick. There are only eight children in attendance\u2014three boys and five girls\u2014all of tender ages. At the present writing it is difficult to say whether this day school will in the future serve the purpose for which it was intended, as I found that practically all the larger and elder pupils of the past have now been placed in the Girls Home, and now only the very smaller ones attend. None of those could speak English, and were only learning to make their letters on slates. The original intention was, I understand, that this building should be used as a class-room for the new Girls Home, the teaching staff to look after the education of the pupils of both the Day School and Girls Home, but it has been considered by the Church of England authorities that this plan would not be feasible or satisfactory and consequently the idea will not be carried out.\n\nSgd. W.E. Ditchburn,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nIn your letter of Dec 17th No II7262/1 you make reference to Mr Greens report on the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nMr Green came to Alert Bay at an unfortunate time. Nearly all the Indians were away from home at the time and had not been at home for some time and the average as will be seen from last quarters report was only 8.5%. The school register shows that the latter part of the term that the attendance was often as high as 17.\n\nSince the opening of the school term this quarter Miss Clowes informs me that the morning average is about 10 and the afternoon about 15. It seems to be very difficult to get the Indians to attend in the mornings. They sit up all hours of the night and never think of sending the children to bed until they go themselves, and it is quite a common thing to see the children playing round the street at night until midnight or later. The result is that they do not get up early. The parents are at the best apathetic on the educational question.\n\nMr G.H.Moody whose appointment as teacher was approved by the Department has been in the hospital with pneumonia and typhoid fever for nearly 12 weeks, and I am informed by the church authorities will be disconnected from the Mission. During the most of the time the school has been taken by Miss Margaret Clowes, who has had five years experience in teaching in England. I call at the school every few days to see how everything is going along and\nhave been very much impressed with the progress the pupils have been making. Miss Clowes had special training in Kindergarten work and uses that system largely and the pupils are much interested in the musical drills and calisthenic exercises which she mixes up with the other lessons. This helps to insure a better attendance.\n\nIt has not been definitely decided as to whether Miss Clowes will remain permanently but personally I hope that she may.\n\nA number of the pupils who would ordinarily attend the Day School are now inmates of the Industrial School and Girls Home which of course decreases the average for the Day School.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Miss Margaret Clowes, teacher in the Alert Bay Indian Day School has resigned, her resignation to take effect at the Christmas Holidays.\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from Mr. A.W. Corker, the Church Missionary Society's Missionary in charge at Alert Bay that by the recommendation and approval of His Lordship Bishop Roper\u2014[illegible]\u2014that he has appointed Miss Ferryman to the position.\n\nMiss Ferryman has been for some months assisting in the Girls Home and has been used to teaching kindergarten work in England.\n\nI beg to recommend that the appointment be confirmed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 3, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo with reference to the attendance at the Alert Bay day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that Miss Clowes will be allowed to remain at the school and that with your co-operation an improvement in attendance will be effected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Halliday, J.S.C.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB.C.\nWith both a boys' Industrial school and a girls' industrial school located at Alert Bay, I cannot see the necessity for a day school, also. The work would be done much more effectively in the residential schools. The results would be much more satisfactory. Both residential schools at the time of my visit were much below their capacity.\n\nDate of Inspection, September 29th, 1916.\nOttawa, December 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant advising the Department that Miss Margaret Clowes, teacher of the Alert Bay Day School, has resigned, her resignation to take effect at the Christmas holidays, and that Miss Ferryman has been appointed in her place.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Ferryman as teacher of this school is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, January 11th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Cairns, in a report on the Alert Bay day school, states that, as there is both a boys' and a girls' industrial located at Alert Bay, there is no necessity for a day school.\n\nThe Department agrees with the Inspector that this school might be closed and you will kindly communicate with the Church authorities, stating to them the contents of this letter, and advise the Department of their decision in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Halliday, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nJANUARY REPORT OF AGENT HALLIDAY ON THE ALERT BAY DAY SCHOOL.\n\nIt will be noticed that there is a big discrepancy between the number on roll and the average attendance. This can be accounted for very largely that when Indians from other places come to Alert Bay, if they are remaining more than a day or two the children go to the Alert Bay day school and are put on the register.\n\nReport dated, - Feb. 1st, 1917.\nOttawa, February 16th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your January report on the Alert Bay school, the Department has noted your remarks in regard to the discrepancy between the number on the roll and the average attendance.\n\nIt is considered that there is no necessity of entering on the roll, the names of children who only attend a day or so. Their attendance must retard the progress of the regular pupils and the Department considers it would be as well, if these stragglers were not allowed to attend the school. You may inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW.M. Halliday, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 11th, dealing with the recommendation of Mr. Inspector Cairns, regarding the closing of the Alert Bay Day School, I have the honor to enclose a copy of a letter just received from the Rev. A.W. Corker, Missionary in Charge at Alert Bay.\n\nAlthough in this report Mr. Corker is opposed to the closing of the school, I would remind you that in all past communications and conversations Mr. Corker has been opposed to day schools, and thinks that the Industrial and Boarding school are the only ones that can do effective work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChurch Missionary Society,\nAlert Bay B.C.\nFebruary 8th 1917.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 22. No 225/11, in reference to Mr. Inspector Cairns's recommendation to close the Alert Bay Day School. Dept. letter 1172621/1.\n\nI have consulted the Lord Bishop of Columbia, & his committee, and we feel it would be detrimental to the Indians' work to close the day school at the present time. A good work is being done there, and the average attendance is good. The Industrial school, and Girls Home are full and there is no accommodation at present for day scholars. We therefore respectfully request the Department not to close the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) A.W. Corker,\nC.M.S. Missionary in charge.\n\nW.M. Halliday Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay B.C.\nOttawa, February 27, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to that portion of your report on the Alert Bay Day School, dated the 29th of September, last, in which you stated that, with a boys' industrial school and a girls' industrial school located there, you could not see the necessity for a day school. On the strength of this report Mr. Agent Halliday was informed that this school might be closed and he was requested to communicate with the church authorities to this effect.\n\nThe church authorities object to the closing of this day school and to allowing the day pupils to attend the boarding and industrial schools, as they claim that they would be a menace to the resident pupils on account of their uncleanly habits.\n\nThe Department will, therefore, not insist on this school being closed at once and should be glad if you would reconsider your recommendation and state what could be done to improve the conditions at the day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. R. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 18,\n249 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, February 27, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant in reference to the closing of the Alert Bay Day School and enclosing a communication from the Rev. A. W. Corker in regard thereto.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, on the strength of representations made by the church authorities, the Department has decided to postpone the closing of this day school for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n249 Hastings St.East,\nVancouver,B.C.,\nMarch 12,1917.\n\nDuncan Scott,Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,Canada.\n\nSir;\n\nYour letter of Feb.27,numbered 117262/1,re the\nclosing of Alert Bay Day School was received in due\ntime.\n\nI regret very much that I did not make my mean-\ning clear in my report of Sept.29,1916.\n\nIn the residential schools at Alert Bay there is\naccommodation for 65 pupils,and on Sept.29,there were\nonly 77 present.In the Boys'school,36 were enrolled,\nand 21 were present.There is accommodation for 35 in\nthis school.\n\nMy idea was that pupils in the village attend-\nDay School should be transferred to the residential\nschools.Six or seven pupils taken from the village\neach year in addition to what is already recruited\nfrom this village would do away with the necessity\nof a Day School.\n\nI shall be very glad to reconsider my recom-\nmandation,and on the occasion of my next visit I\nshall take up with Mr.Agent Halliday and the repre-\nsentative of the Church this matter.It should be\npossible to reach a conclusion that would be satis-\nfactory concerned.\n\nI remain,Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.M.Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nOttawa, July 13, 1917.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is advised that Miss E. W. Ferryman, who has been teaching the Alert Bay Day School for some time, has resigned and that it is proposed to engage an Indian named George Martin Luther, an ex-pupil of the industrial school, to take her place.\n\nAs the Department is not favourable to the employment of an Indian if a white teacher can be secured, it has occurred to me that it might be well to offer this position to Miss Hobden, who was in charge of the Lytton Day School, as the attendance there is not sufficient to justify its continuance.\n\nI should be glad if you would submit this proposition to Miss Hobden and advise the Department of her decision. If she takes charge of the Alert Bay School she will paid at the same rate as at Lytton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W.

Due notice of this however, will be forwarded.\nOttawa, July 13, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Alert Bay Day School for the months of May and June, which you state that \"Miss E. W. Ferryman, who has been teaching for sometime there, has resigned and it is expected that George Martin Luther, an ex-pupil of the industrial school and for some years assistant teacher there, will take over the work,\" I beg to say that the Department has a teacher in view for this school and you will be further advised in regard to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn your letter of July 13th, No 117 262/1 you state that the Department has a teacher in view for the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and that I would be advised further in regard to this matter.\n\nUp to the present no further advice has been received on this matter and I beg to draw your attention to the fact that the other Indian schools at Alert Bay opened on or about the first of August, while this school is still vacant, and the children who should be in attendance are running around.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ass't Deputy & Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 11, 1917.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you state that no teacher has yet been appointed for the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has not yet secured a teacher for this school and in the meantime you may appoint George Martin Luther, an ex-pupil of the Industrial School, temporarily, as teacher of the Alert Bay Day School, Salary at the rate of $450.00 per annum will be allowed him for his services.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform him accordingly and instruct him to re-open and begin duties at this school as soon as possible. In the meantime you should communicate with the church authorities with a view to securing a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. W. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\nI beg to recommend that the salary for Mr. George M. Luther, the teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School be increased from $500.00 per year to $650.00 per year as is done at the Cape Mudge Day School. The school at Alert Bay has a much larger attendance than the one at Cape Mudge, and the teacher takes care of it himself, thus saving the expenses for a janitor and is quite as capable a teacher for Indian children as is the teacher at Cape Mudge.\n\nIt is true that Mr. Luther has not a teachers certificate but he was well trained while assistant teacher at the Alert Bay Industrial School and is both capable and efficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, January 17, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant enclosing the report from the Alert Bay Day School for the December quarter, last, and embodying a copy of a letter from George M. Luther, the teacher, in which he asks that he receive the same salary as the former teacher of this school received.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to allow Mr. Luther the same salary as the former teacher, viz., $500.00 per annum, and he is being paid at this rate from the time he took charge. You will be good enough to inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose the quarterly report from the Alert Bay Day School for the December quarter. The Department in confirming the appointment of George M. Luther as teacher intimated that the salary would be reduced from $500.00 per year to $450.00.\n\nI am in receipt of the following letter from Mr. Luther as follows:\n\nAlert Bay B.C.\nJan 4th 1918.\n\nTo the Department,\nOttawa\u2014Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Halliday:\nI have heard that the Department is reducing the grant for the Alert Bay Day School of which I am taking charge now. So far as I know there is no reason why it should be reduced. I beg the Department to take it into consideration and to give the decision allowing the same grant as has been given for some years past. I am capable to do the work and feel entitled to the full grants of the school.\n\nI also beg the Department to consider that I am not asking for more grant but only that there should be no reduction.\n\nYours very Respectfully,\n\n(signed) George M. Luther\n\nIn connection with this I feel that it is only a matter of justice that the grant should not be reduced. Mr. Luther is doing better work than has been done for many years in that school. He was trained to teach in the Alert Bay Industrial School where he was assistant teacher for a number of years and I feel that it is only fair more particularly taking into consideration the tremendously increased cost of living that there should be no reduction. I have left the amount due blank on the reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE ALERT BAY DAY SCHOOL.\n\nMr. Luther is doing fair work, but it appears to me that when a change was being made an attempt should have been made to get a trained teacher. He was appointed Oct. 1st. He is a very nice mannered Indian and would do good work, if trained.\n\nDate of Inspection, December 12th, 1917.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing the usual quarterly report for the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nMr. George M. Luther, the teacher, was recommended by Dr. Felton to go away for about a month so that the insipient tuberculosis which was developing might be checked in time. Although the report is signed by him I gave permission to Miss Nellie Hamilton, an ex-pupil of the Alert Bay Girls' Home and who took a year and a half in the Victoria High School to act for him while he is away on this health expedition.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW.

I am including this increase in my estimates for the coming year.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW. H. Halliday\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 3, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 74 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to an increase in the salary of Mr. George Luther, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School. This question was brought to the Department's attention by Mr. Inspector Gains in November, last, and he was informed that the Department could not give favourable consideration at the present time. Mr. Luther received an increase of $100 as from September first, 1922.\n\nAt the commencement of the next academic year, if Mr. Luther continues to do good work and the attendance keeps up, you may bring this matter to my attention again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the salary paid to Mr. George Luther, teacher at the Indian Day School at Alert Bay, and respectfully suggest that his salary be increased to at least what is paid at Cape Mudge Village. He is a very capable and efficient teacher and keeps the school in good condition and for the extra office as janitor he receives no salary whatever. Mr. Inspector Cairns always speaks very highly of the work which he is doing and agrees with me that his services are worth a little more than what he is being paid.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Nov. 13th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nRegarding your recommendation for an increase in the salary of Mr. George M. Luther, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I beg to say that at the present time he is in receipt of salary at the rate of $700 per annum and bonus at the rate of $150 per annum, a combined salary and bonus of $850. I would point out that Mr. Luther has no professional qualifications, having received his education at the Alert Bay Residential School. We consider that the salary he now receives compares favourably with that paid to teachers having his qualifications in the neighbouring white schools. In fact, it is doubtful if a teacher would be granted a permit to teach in a white school on the qualifications which Mr. Luther possesses.\n\nThe Department granted Mr. Luther an increase of $100 in his salary on the 1st of September, 1922, and we are not prepared to further increase his salary at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 402 Holmen Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector's report on the ALERT BAY DAY SCHOOL, October 18, 1923.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that Mr. Luther, the teacher, receive an increase of $50.00 per annum to begin April 1, 1924.\n\nI think the work done by Mr. Luther warrants me in recommending him for this increase.\n\nH. H. Cairns, Insp.\nOttawa, June 6, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, reporting on the complaint regarding the use of the Alert Bay Day School building for dancing purposes. As you state there are other buildings where entertainments of this nature can be held, the school building is on no account to be used for purposes of holding dances. You will be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOttawa, June 6, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of April 17th, last, regarding the use of the Alert Bay Day School for dancing purposes. I have been directed to state that, upon enquiry, we are informed that the teacher held a dance on a Saturday night and dancing was continued until 2 o'clock on Sunday morning. The agent was away from home at the time, but he has taken this matter up with the teacher and given instructions that dances in the school building must not occur again. The teacher has expressed his sorrow that the dance had not broken up at a reasonable hour instead of continuing until Sunday.\n\nThere are other buildings at Alert Bay where entertainments can be held, and it is hoped that there will be no further cause for complaint regarding the holding of dances in the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. W. Corker,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 4th with reference to a complaint which had reached you regarding the use of the Alert Bay Indian Day School for dancing purposes.\n\nIt is too bad that this matter was ever brought to your attention as I had dealt with it immediately after the one occurrence.\n\nThe teacher apparently had given a little dance on Saturday night and it was kept going until nearly two o'clock Sunday morning. I was away from home at the time but on my return I took the matter up with the teacher and told him that this should never occur again and he expressed his sorrow that they had not broken up at a reasonable hour instead of continuing on Sunday.\n\nI informed him that there were other buildings now at Alert Bay where such entertainments could be held and on no account should such entertainments take place in the Indian Day School without first bringing it to the attention of the Agent and getting his consent.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nThe attention of the Department has been drawn to the use of the day school building at Alert Bay for dancing purposes. It is stated that dances have been held by the teacher until a late hour at night, extending, on Saturday nights, into the Sabbath. This is reported to be very detrimental to the Mission and to the morals of the Indians.\n\nYou should ascertain from the teacher what authority he has for holding these dances, and you should inform him that he is to discontinue holding the same in the school building. I shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding these dances, and a statement relative to the action you take.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aest. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, April 30, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Corker:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to allowing dancing until a late hour in the Alert Bay Indian Day School. I am grateful that you have brought this matter to the attention of the Department, and a communication is being addressed to the local agent.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter relative to certain Indian stores remaining open on Sunday, I have to state that I am of the opinion this is a matter for provincial and municipal authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. W. Corker,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nAlert Bay B.C.\nApril 17, 1923\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret to have to make a complaint before in regard to our Indian Day School being used for dancing in the manner they are conducted. Last Saturday a dance was given by the teacher George M. Reith, and it was about 2:45 Sunday before it was over. This kind of thing is very detrimental to the Mission & to the morals of the Indians, & I cannot believe it has the sanction of the Department.\n\nSome time ago, through Bishop Foster I asked the Dept. whether the Mission had, as heretofore, the superintendence of this school, but no ruling has been given.\n\nWhile on the subject of Sabbath desecration I may point out the fact that the Indians keep their stores open all day on Sunday. The white stores are closed, why should not the Indians be closed?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J. Cottle\nChaplain\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\nALERT BAY DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe teacher here is an Indian, but is doing good work and is getting a satisfactory attendance in a building which is adequate for the purpose.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, August 11, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, recommending that an increase in salary be granted Mr. George M. Luther, Teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an increase of $100 per annum in Mr. Luther's salary from the first of September, next. This increase is granted on the understanding that he will, besides teaching, perform his own janitor services. This will make the salary allowed him from the above date at the rate of $700 per annum. He will also be entitled to receive any bonus provided by law during the present fiscal year.\n\nYou may inform Mr. Luther of the increase in salary granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nYesterday afternoon Mr. George M. Luther, teacher in the Alert Bay Indian Day School, approached me on the matter of an increase of salary. He had borrowed from me some of the Department's blue books and he told me when returning them that his object in getting them was to see how his school compared in attendance etc., with other schools in other agencies. He says there are many schools where the teacher is receiving a much larger salary than what he is getting, with a much smaller attendance than what he has. The salary at present paid to Mr. Luther by the Department is $600.00 a year. He does his own janitor work whereas in many other schools sums varying from five to ten dollars a month are allowed for the janitor. I would recommend that his salary be increased to $60.00 a month as he is doing efficient and capable work and keeps his school in good shape all the time.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant recommending that an increase be granted in the salary of Mr. George M. Luther, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it has been decided to grant Mr. Luther an increase of $100.00 in his salary, which will take effect from the first of October, last. This will make his salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum and he will also be entitled to receive the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Luther accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nMr. Agent Halliday recommends that the salary of George M. Luther, teacher of the Alert Bay Day School, be increased from $500.00 to $650.00 per annum, the same salary as he states is paid the teacher at Cape Mudge. (The teacher at Cape Mudge receives $700.00 per annum.) The Agent states that there is a larger attendance at Alert Bay than at Cape Mudge, and, although Mr. Luther has no professional qualifications, he considers him quite as capable as the teacher at Cape Mudge, and besides, he does the caretaking, thus saving the expense of a janitor.\n\nMr. Luther was assistant teacher at the Alert Bay Industrial School for several years and has been teaching the day school since the first of October, 1917. He is an Indian and obtained his education at the industrial school.\n\nThere is an enrolment of 30 children, with an average attendance of 20 at the Alert Bay Day School. (At Cape Mudge there is an enrolment of 16, with an average of 8.) The Inspector states that the pupils are making fair progress.\n\nWhile Miss Wright, the teacher at Cape Mudge, has a smaller enrolment, she has had training and taught school in London and Dublin and was also at Heidelberg and is a clever and superior woman.\n\nAs Mr. Luther has had no increase in salary since he began teaching in the day school three years ago, I would recommend, as most of the teachers in British Columbia are now receiving $600.00, that his salary be increased to that amount from the first of the current quarter. I shall be pleased to have your decision regarding the Agent's request.\nOttawa, April 13th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, forwarding the March quarter return of the Alert Bay Indian Day School. It is noted that the regular teacher, Mr. Geo. M. Luther, has, upon the recommendation of the doctor, been absent for about a month and that Miss Nellie Hamilton, who attended Victoria High School, has been acting as substitute teacher.\n\nThe Department regrets the illness of Mr. Luther, and the arrangements made for carrying on the work while he is away are satisfactory. Until such time as he returns, the services of Miss Hamilton will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nMr. George Luther (Indian) Age 45\n$900.00 per annum, with $50.00 per annum for janitor work.\n\nNo training or certificates. Experience in this school since 1917. Previous to the year 1917 the teacher states he was with Rev. Mr. Corker in the Indian Residential School, Alert Bay. I do not know just what kind of teaching he undertook there.\n\nAfter my inspection was finished the teacher, Mr. Luther, informed me that he had been ill after the last inspection and towards the end of the school year. He stated that his heart was giving him trouble and that he felt the strain of trying to teach so many small children. I suggested that perhaps he would be better off in a small Church school but he would not consider transfer to any such school not under the Department of Indian Affairs. He told me that he could be willing to retire if the Department would give him some help during the remainder of his life. I said that I could not possibly say what the Department might or might not be willing to do, but that his best plan would be to WRITE TO HIS INDIAN AGENT STATING THAT THE SCHOOL WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM AS HE WAS NOW AGEING AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER GIVING HIM A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IF HE RETIRED FROM THE SCHOOL AT THE END OF THE PRESENT SCHOOL YEAR. I talked this over with Mr. Todd later, and impressed him with the necessity of having Mr. Luther, who is of course an Indian, state that he was unable to continue the charge of the school. I do not wish Mr. Luther to be dismissed on the result of this last inspection and report alone. If the Indian Agent wishes him notified that his services are no longer required, the Department will be free from this report as to how the school stands. There is no question that Mr. Luther is failing in his work, particularly with the younger children. I am perfectly willing to support the recommendation of the Indian Agent who has been keeping a very close watch on this school. I should like to suggest that it would be perfectly possible for me to obtain an experienced teacher with a First Class Certificate and years of successful teaching at a salary of $800.00 with $50.00 per annum extra for or even without this and allow the $300 or $150.00 thus saved to be applied as a shot of Relief to this Indian, Mr. Luther, as long as he lived. This has not been done in other cases but I suggest it here as this school certainly requires the services of an experienced teacher to pull it up to the required standard. I have recommended to the Indian Agent that two children from this day school be permitted to go into St. Michael's Indian Res. School owing to special circumstances of which he is aware. In conclusion I may state that the standing of this school is at present \"Unsatisfactory\" and the teacher's control \"Weak\".\nOttawa, April 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Alert Bay Indian Day School on the 14th ultimo.\n\nMr. Barry reports unfavourably on the work being done by the present teacher, Mr. Luther, and recommends that the services of an experienced teacher be engaged. From the information given the Department by the Inspector, it is considered that it would be in the best interests of the work at this school to make a change. Please let me have your views in the matter at the earliest possible date.\n\nMr. Barry suggests that a small annuity be given Mr. Luther in the event of his retirement. There is no provision for the super-annuation of teachers of Indian day schools. All that Mr. Luther could be allowed would be two months' salary as a retiring gratuity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 18, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter dated April 11th,\nNo. 156-29-1 regarding Inspector Barry's report on the Indian Day School at Alert Bay, in which he reports unfavourably on the work being done by the present teacher, Mr. Luther, I beg to submit the following information.\n\nThe Alert Bay Indian Day School naturally has come under my close observation as it is located at the Agency headquarters, and I have felt during the past year that progress made was not as good as might have been expected. I have also felt the discipline and regular attendance could be improved on, and when Inspector Barry visited the Agency recently I spoke to him about these matters and asked him to make a very close inspection. He reported back to me that he was under the same impression as I was, and felt it would be in the best interests of all concerned if a change was made.\n\nMr. Luther advises me he has been teaching Indian Schools for thirty years, of which twelve years was in the old Residential School, and eighteen years in the present Day School. Inspector Barry informed me he discussed the matter of his retirement with Mr. Luther, but he stated he did not have sufficient money saved to retire on, and disliked the thought of having to accept relief or charity after having worked all these years. Personally I know Mr. Luther has been very liberal with his money in assisting Indians, and possibly this is the reason why he has not sufficient funds to retire on as his earnings would indicate. Mr. Luther's health is not very good and I feel under the circumstances he should retire, and he has expressed his willingness to do so in the enclosed letter, but has requested the Department to grant him a small remuneration each year.\n\nI am of the opinion if the Department could arrange to do this it would be a very suitable gesture and a means of showing the Department's appreciation for his thirty years of service and at the same time retain the good will of all Mr. Luther's Indian friends. There is no doubt Mr. Luther's presence in the village has a good effect on the Indians as a whole as he lives a very clean and Christian life and we would always be in the position of having his services if needed.\n\nAs there is no provision for the superannuation of teachers of Indian Day Schools I realize it is going to be difficult for the Department to undertake anything along this line, but I would like to suggest some means be found in which the Department could grant Mr. Luther an amount of fifty dollars a year or if they felt they could increase this amount to one hundred dollars a year it would be most satisfactory to me. Possibly some special arrangement could be made to do this as I am anxious that a change be made and at the same time the Department show their appreciation for the long years of service Mr. Luther has rendered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Barry, Department School Inspector made his recent inspection of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I took up with him the matter of my health in the interests of this school.\n\nFor some time I have not been feeling well owing to a heart ailment, and as I have been teaching for thirty years, of which twelve years was in the old Residential School and eighteen years in the present Day School, I feel with my health as it is I should consider resigning my position as teacher.\n\nThere is, however, one thing which worries me and that is after all the years of service I have not been able to put aside sufficient funds through various reasons to care for me in my latter years, and I dislike to give up my position so long as my health will permit me to carry on with the possibility that I might find myself having to ask the Department for assistance later on. I talked the matter over thoroughly with Capt. Barry, and explained to him my financial position as well as the state of my health.\n\nIn view of the above, do you think the Department would favourably consider granting me a small sum each year in consideration of the many years service which I have given the Department as teacher. I realize there is no superannuation fund for teachers in the Indian Department the same as there is for those who teach under the Provincial Department of Education, but possibly the Department might find some way in which they could grant this to me.\n\nIf this could be done, I would be willing to tender my resignation to take effect at the end of the present term, and I would appreciate if you would take this up with the Department and advise me accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. M. Leither\nOttawa, July 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing the resignation of Mr. George M. Luther, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that the resignation of Mr. Luther is accepted. You may express to Mr. Luther the Department's appreciation for his long and faithful services as teacher in Indian schools.\n\nA retiring gratuity, equal to two months' salary, will be sent Mr. Luther, in due course.\n\nI would request that, as directed in official letter of April 30th, last, you consult the church authorities interested, with a view to having them nominate a qualified teacher to succeed Mr. Luther as from September first, next. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. If the church authorities are not interested in the nomination of a teacher, I would advise that you consult Mr. Inspector Barry, who, no doubt, will be able to recommend a qualified teacher.

In view of this I would appreciate if the Department would arrange to forward Mr. Luther this gratuity and at the same time write to him, expressing the Department's appreciation for his thirty years of service as teacher, of which seventeen were spent in the Alert Bay Day School and thirteen in the Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

(RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nOwing to several Day School teachers having resigned this year from their positions and the necessity of successors being appointed, some to positions where the school is held in buildings erected by the Church and others to schools erected by the Department, it is felt with a view to raising the standard of our teachers, some distinction should be made between the schools owned by the Department and those which are the property of the Church. In the past the Church have always nominated the teachers to all these positions, but to meet local conditions often teachers not very well qualified were appointed.\n\nAt the present time we have a new school to be opened at Uatsine which will be held in the Anglican Church which was erected there last year. The Village Island School is a similar case, as well as the Kingcome School and Smith Inlet School at Takush Harbour. At Alert Bay the Department built the school, and financially the Church are not interested in any way. I am not quite sure, but I feel the Cape Mudge School was also built by the Department.\n\nThere is a possibility of a vacancy occurring at the Alert Bay Day School, and we feel in this particular instance as the Church is not interested, the Department should make their own appointment. The new school which is to be built at Campbell River will also be purely a Department School, and in our opinion the school teacher should be appointed by the Department here as well.\n\nSince taking over the Agency I have been closely watching the progress of our Day Schools, and in my opinion so long as the Department find it necessary to be more or less guided by the wishes of the Churches, it is going to be difficult to make the progress expected with the amount of money expended each year for salaries in these schools. I am trying to be quite frank with the Department in expressing only my own personal views, and I am bringing this matter to the attention of the Department after discussing it thoroughly with our Mr. Phelan who was privileged to visit the Alert Bay Indian Day School where an Indian teacher, Mr. George M. Luther, has been teaching for the past seventeen years.\n\nMy views are for the amount of money which the Department expends each year by employing qualified teachers, we are reaching the point in advancement where the education should be gradually placed more and more under the direct supervision of the Department rather than being expected to be guided more or less by recommendations from the Church. I feel if our Department could have more say in the education, more progress would be made.\nI would also like to point out to the Department the Churches have in the past erected buildings on reservations with no Agreements from the Department, and look upon these buildings as belonging to them. On one of my visits to Victoria some time ago His Lordship Bishop Schofield raised this question with me, and said he felt the time was coming when our Department should take over the administration and all other responsibility in connection with the running of these schools. I would like to see, when funds are available, the Department take over any school which is considered an \"established\" one, as at present the situation is confusing. I believe if the Church was properly approached we would have no difficulty in coming to an understanding in which they would be willing to practically leave the education of the Indian children to the Department to look after entirely.\n\nI am writing this letter to place my own personal views before you, and I would appreciate if after careful consideration you would write me giving me your views as to the future. I might add I am in close touch with His Lordship Bishop Schofield, and I have found him very willing to co-operate and work with me. I feel if the Department looked favourably upon my views, possibly His Lordship and myself might work out a solution more suitable to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S.

Mr. Wickett graduated from normal school in 1934, with a first class diploma, and, last year, he took second year university work at Victoria College. The Department is approving of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present holidays - September third, next. Mr. Agent Todd is being informed.\n\nI would request that you inform Inspector Barry of the appointment of Mr. Wickett.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.-F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nMr. George L. Luther, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School (Electoral District of Vancouver North) has tendered his resignation as from June 26th, last. This school is not on an Indian reserve but is on land which has been set apart by the British Columbia Government for the purposes of an Indian school, adjoining Alert Bay Reserve No. 1, on Cormorant Island, B.C.\n\nHis Lordship Right Reverend Charles D. Schorfield, D.D., Bishop of Columbia, under whose auspices the school is conducted, has nominated the services of Mr. W. Percy Wickett for this position. He holds a first class certificate for the province of British Columbia, has taken second year university work at Victoria College and also attended a teachers' summer school. The salary rating for this school is $90.00 per teaching month. Mr. Wickett's appointment is recommended by Mr. Agent Todd, Alert Bay, and Mr. G. H. Barry, the Department's School Inspector for British Columbia.\n\nI would request your concurrence in the appointment of Mr. Wickett as from September third, the beginning of the new school year.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 15, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nUnder date of July 3rd I wrote you enclosing the resignation of Mr. George M. Luther as teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, to take effect immediately.\n\nOn my recent visit to Victoria His Lordship Bishop Schofield recommended Mr. W. Percy Wickett of 1580 Monterey Avenue, Victoria, B.C., for this position, and for your information I am enclosing copy of Mr. Wickett's application which has been duly received at this office.\n\nWhile in Victoria Bishop Schofield requested me to meet Mr. Wickett and discuss with him the problems we have to deal with at the Alert Bay Day School. I met Mr. Wickett and had a long talk with him and I am thoroughly convinced he is a very suitable person for teacher of this particular school. He has also been recommended to me by our School Inspector, Captain Barry. At present Mr. Wickett is attending the Provincial Summer School and will be free to accept this position at the beginning of the new term.\n\nAs Mr. Wickett's application is recommended by the Bishop as well as our School Inspector, I would request that the Department approve of this appointment and advise me accordingly in order that I can instruct him to report for duty when the school term opens on September first.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMr. M.J. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to make application for the position of teacher in the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nI am 19 years old, weigh 147 pounds, and am 5 feet, 9 inches tall. I graduated from the Normal School in 1934 with a first class diploma. This year I took a second year university course at Victoria College, while at the last session of the Teachers' Summer School I received certificates for Technique of Teaching, English, and Choral Music. I am at present taking the course in Primary.\n\nAt the Normal School I was president of the Badminton Club, a position which involved the arranging of tournaments and matches. I occupied a similar position on the executive of the College Badminton Club this year. Among the sports which I have played and am able to organize are softball, rugby and soccer. I obtained a Strathcona Trust Certificate for Physical Training and have no difficulty in taking drills, exercises and group games.\n\nI am able to teach singing, having a good baritone voice and considerable musical knowledge. I am a soloist in St. Mary's Church Choir. I have also held office on the executive of the Victoria Junior Musical Arts Society. I have had further experience in leadership and executive work as president of the International Relations Club, the largest and most important club of Victoria College, and as stage-manager of this year's college play.\n\nTrusting that my application will receive your favourable consideration, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) \"W. Percy Wickett\"\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, No. 156-29-1, advising of the appointment of Mr. W. Percy Wickett as teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, vice Mr. Geo. M. Luther, resigned.\n\nInspector Barry has been advised of this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C.

C.\n\nP:HN\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOffice of Inspector of Schools,\nat Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nJanuary 25, 1936.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Alert Bay Indian Day School, Kwawkewlth Agency, which I inspected on Thursday last, January 23rd.\n\nMr. Wickett has very greatly improved the condition of the school, though he has made mistakes with regard to demoting certain pupils, etc.\n\nI have spent a considerable time with this young teacher. The main items of my report have been talked over with him, and this includes the recommendation for promotion in certain Grades. He is anxious to make a success of his work here, and responds very well to professional advice. I hope that he will have the support of the Department and its officials in B.C.\n\nThere is, as no doubt you are aware, a very awkward situation in Alert Bay just now. The local Indian teacher who taught here for many years was replaced by the present teacher last September, and while this Indian teacher has given no trouble, it is a fact that the present teacher has not received much support from the Anglican Missionary. The Anglican Missionary is opposed to the Indian Agent, and to a greater or less extent is creating trouble throughout the village. While Mr. Wickett has tried to keep clear of these local disputes he has to some extent been involved. On the whole I think that Mr. Wickett has handled the local situation very well. He has been informed by the Anglican Bishops of the Diocese that there will shortly be a change here and a new Anglican Missionary will be appointed. I am certainly very glad to hear this.\n\nI should be glad to see new single desks in this school, and I may say that the Indian Agent has been offered the loan of the necessary desks which are spare at St. Michael's Indian Residential School. The local Anglican Church Group object to the old desks being changed, as the modern single school desks would not accommodate the old Indians attending the Friday night Bible Meetings HELD IN THE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL. There are several other places where the Bible Class might well be held, and it seems very foolish to me to deprive the children of the advantage of suitable desks which happen to be available to please some foolish old Indians. I believe the Indian Agent and the Teacher wish for these new desks but they do not wish to stir up any more friction in Alert Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY\nDATED FEBRUARY 9, 1937, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nALERT BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nName of teacher: William P. Wickett\nAge: 21\n\nHealth: Excellent\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMr. Wickett was trained in the Victoria Normal School, 1933-34, and has taken the following courses in addition, English; Technique of Teaching; Choral Music; Primary Work; at the Provincial Summer School, Victoria, 1935, and Language Arts in 1936.\n\nThis teacher has been more of a success with the younger children in Grade 1, than he has with the older children. In my last report I stated that he had made a very good start in this his first school. The work since that inspection has been carried on in a successful manner on the whole, but Mr. Wickett has developed a very unfortunate manner in the schoolroom.\n\nHe has become abrupt with the pupils and while not perhaps shouting at them certainly snaps at them, using such foolish expressions as \"Where you before giving an order.\" I have of course spoken to him about this very poor schoolroom manner and use of voice. His nerves are under a strain, thought from what actual cause I do not know. If he does not take things quietly he will have a breakdown. In fact if he is unable to modify his nasty manner with the children during the next year, I shall be forced to recommend his removal. I shall not recommend him for a permanent Provincial Certificate this next June, but shall suggest to the Provincial Department of Education that his present Interim Certificate be extended for another year.\n\nColonel G. S. Pragnell spoke to me about the untidy state of this schoolroom when he last visited here. I took this up with Mr. Wickett who tells me that no official has told him that his room is untidy. I am only doubtfully statement, as I feel certain that Mr. Indian Agent Todd has warned him be more tidy. The room is certainly untidy and needs to have books and papers, etc., not being used at the moment placed in cupboards or in the storeroom. The teacher was given instructions to tidy up the room.\n\nWhile Mr. Indian Agent Todd has very greatly improved the physical conditions here, I am far from satisfied with the educational standing which has not kept pace with the improvement in the schoolroom.\n\nI would ask that this teacher be warned that unless the work of the older children has very greatly improved by the time of the next inspection, and that the schoolroom can be described as tidy, his services will not be required.\n\n* Continued\nMr. Wickett is showing signs of a definite \"Superiority Complex\" which under the circumstances are quite usual. Such a warning as I have suggested may be what is necessary to bring him to some more reasonable understanding of his own position and of the standing of his school which is not better than \"Satisfactory\" at best.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF INSPECTOR BARRY WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE ABOVE REPORT,\n\nYou will see from my report that while the actual school has been greatly improved during the past year, and new desks provided, the actual teacher has not kept pace with the material improvements.\n\nI am sorry that I shall not be able to recommend the granting of a Permanent Certificate to the teacher, when this matter comes up at the end of June, next.\n\nIf the warning be given to him as suggested in my report, Mr. Wickett may quite likely improve his teaching and manner.\n\nAlthough I am far from satisfied with the standing of the school, I would not suggest that this young teacher's services be terminated at the present time. He is in my opinion entitled to another chance to improve. Probably my own remarks to him after the inspection will have proved a considerable surprise and tend to modify his manner with the children.\nOttawa, February 25, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Alert Bay Indian Day School on the 9th instant.\n\nFrom the information contained in this report, we are not satisfied either with the work of the older pupils or with your own attitude towards all the children. It is also reported that the schoolroom is very untidy.\n\nIn view of the Inspector's report, it might be advisable for you to consider tendering your resignation as teacher at the end of the current academic year. However, if you wish to continue during the academic year 1937-38, the Department will expect a decided improvement, not only in the academic work with the senior pupils but in your attitude towards all the pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Todd, Indian Agent, and trust with the help I have received the condition of my school will show a decided improvement.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW. Percy Wichett.\nREPORT ON KWAWKWEWLTH AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MARCH 1937.\n\nThe Alert Bay Day school is 26 years old, built by the Department, and serves many children of various tribes now living at Alert Bay. It was remodelled and redecorated, both interior and exterior in 1936 and is in splendid condition. I have not altogether been satisfied with the progress made here this last year but since School Inspector Barry recently inspected the school I have noticed a decided improvement. It is a difficult school owing to so many transient children attending for short intervals. There are 39 pupils on the school register. The school is under the auspices of the Anglican Church.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KEANKEWALTH AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MARCH 1937.\n\nThe Day schools at Campbell River, Cape Mudge, and Alert Bay are in splendid shape and a real credit to the Department. While the Missionary schools at Village Island, Kingcome Inlet, Quatsino and Smith's Inlet which were built by various Missions with assistance from the Department are in fair state of repair, they are difficult to administrate. I feel the Department should own these schools and have full administrative powers as the buildings are on reserves. I would recommend if and when funds are available the Department should purchase any equity the Missions may have in these buildings to avoid any future complications which may arise between the Indians and interested parties.\n\nM.

Quainton, Bishop's Commissary, has discussed with me the qualifications of candidates for the vacant position of teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nDean Quainton, in the attached letter dated July 9th, has nominated two candidates as being the most suitable for the vacant position. These are:\n\nMrs. Sarah Covey 795 Nicola St., Vancouver, B.C.\nand Mr. Noel Stewart 1269 Deman St., Victoria, B.C.,\nthe present teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nAs you will see from his letter, the Dean considers Mr. Stewart the better of the two candidates, and in this I fully agree with him, though I hope that Mrs. Sarah Covey will receive Bishop Rix's nomination for one of our Indian Day Schools in the North.\n\nI have therefore to recommend the transfer of Mr. Noel Stewart from Hazelton to be teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and would ask that, if you and the Indian Affairs Branch agree with me, the Indian Agents concerned be notified as soon as possible.\n\nFor the information of the Indian Affairs Branch I may say that Mr. Noel Stewart was trained in the Edmonton Normal School 1929-30, holds a Permanent First-Class Certificate in Alberta; attended the Summer School in Edmonton in 1933, 1934, and 1935 where he obtained the special Intermediate Grade Certificate; taught grades 6 to 12 in the St. Paul's Indian Residential at Cardston for 5 years, and has been the teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School since January last. During the years 1926-29 Mr. Stewart attended the Ohio State University and there obtained his B.Com.Sc. degree. Mr. Stewart is at present, on my advice, taking a Primary course at the Provincial Summer School in Victoria. He appears most anxious to carry out the wishes of the Indian Affairs Branch as expressed through its officials in British Columbia, and I have every reason to believe that he will be able to make a great success of his work at Alert Bay should he be transferred, as he is very anxious to devote himself entirely to school work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

It is possible that some of the children that have been attending this school during the months of October and November belong to other Reserves and will return there in the near future. However, our officers in British Columbia consider that it would be advisable to open a second class room. No funds are available for the purpose during the current fiscal year but I am writing to Commissioner MacKay to arrange for the opening of a second class room in a building opposite the present school from April 1 next. During the three month period ending June 30 the attendance will be carefully checked with a view to determining definitely if two teachers are required for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nI should appreciate it if you could nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of the second class room for the period April to June, 1939, with the understanding that if it is decided to employ two teachers for the next academic year the services of the teacher nominated for the three month period can be retained.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

This is the practice followed at all public schools and is a very sensible arrangement. Mr. Barry's recommendation, concurred in by yourself, is acceptable to the Department.\n\nI regret to state, however, that it will not be convenient or possible at this time to send out a circular notifying our teachers and Indian agents of this departmental decision. Mr. Phelan is at present absent from the office and is not likely to return for a couple of weeks. It is simply impossible to undertake even this additional task with the limited staff at my disposal. In the meantime, Inspector Barry will have the authorization necessary to enable him to inform the agents and teachers he may meet of our decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

The Department will hold Principals of Indian Day Schools responsible that their schools are conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act and Departmental regulations.\n\n\"In the case of any conflict of opinion between Principals and other teachers in Indian Day Schools, the matters in dispute should be referred to the Inspector of Indian Schools through the Indian Agent concerned.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Owing to a second classroom being established in connection with the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and the necessity of transferring children from the Residential school to the Day school and other places, it was necessary for me to remain here to supervise the repairs and changes which are taking place.\n\nThe second classroom which we are providing here will open on time, but we have had difficulty in completing same owing to the Department not approving of the full amount of money I estimated it would cost to put this building in repair. In this connection I should like to inform the Department Mr. Stewart, the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, returned earlier at my request in order that he could help us rearrange the equipment and supplies before school opened. Mr. Sharpe, who assisted with the carpenter work, has offered to donate some of his services to the department if necessary in order to complete the work, but in my opinion this should not be necessary and it is my intention to put in his full time even though it does exceed the total amount of $205.00 approved by the department, and I hope any small expenditure beyond the approved amount will be paid.\n\nThe Residential school opened on August 28th with a full attendance.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant there is no objection to the contents of the letter which you propose to send to the teachers of the schools in British Columbia with the exception that the last part of paragraph 3 of your letter which reads -- \"Which may be required by the officials of the Department of B.C.\" -- should be changed to read -- \"Which may be required by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch in B.C.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

C.\nA second classroom was opened in connection with the Alert Bay Day School and Miss D.V. Flick, newly appointed teacher to this position, took up her duties at the beginning of the term and I am quite pleased with the progress she has made to date.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENCY'S REPORT ON KWAKEWILTH AGENCY FOR MARCH 1940.\n\nWithin this agency there are one residential school with 208 pupils, and six day schools, that at Alert Bay being a two-room school. The progress being made in the various schools seems satisfactory, but should the Coqualeetza Residential school be closed, it will be necessary to enlarge or build a new day school at Cape Mudge to take care of the children who I understand will be returned to their home village.\n\nM. S. Todd\nIndian Agent.\nMEMO: O.C.No.1/1569, dated April 19, 1940\n\nIn explanation of the amount of the attached cheque, I have to inform you that under the above noted Order-in-Council, 5% of the salary of employees in the Public Service, appointed to temporary positions (other than casual) since September 1, 1939, is required to be withheld from May 1, 1940, and deposited in the Retirement Fund, to be paid to you, on your retirement, with interest at 4% per annum.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed copy of Memorandum dated April 19th 1940 has been received by Miss D.V. Flick, junior teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Flick informs me that she does not understand what this means as she did not know there was such a thing as a Retirement fund for Day School teachers.\n\nWould you kindly write me giving full particulars, and whether this applies to all Indian Day School teachers in Canada and also if the five percent of the salary will be deducted regularly each month. Any information you can give me in respect to this will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to O. C. No. 1/1569, of April 13, 1940.\n\nAs stated in the Order-in-Council, an amount of 5% will be deducted from the salary of every employee who has been appointed since September 1, 1939.\n\nThis amount is funded and interest allowed at the rate of 4% per annum. Principal and interest are payable when the employee leaves our service.\n\nYou will note from the above that this applies only to those appointed since September 1, 1939.\n\nWhen the Order-in-Council was first passed, we understood that it did not apply to teachers in Indian day schools, but a ruling has been made that it does apply and consequently, as stated above, the provisions of the Order-in-Council will apply until further notice to all persons appointed since September 1, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M.

It is noted that during the coming academic year this school will operate for a nine month period, namely, October 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941.\n\nAs no specific provision was made in the current year's appropriation for the funds that would be required to operate this school during two of the summer months, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your recommendation. However, if the same conditions exist next year, the matter will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M.

Barry, and Indian\nAgent (H.F. Wood) at Alert Bay.\n\nIn resigning I might add how sorry I am to\nleave the Day Schools. The Indian\nchildren have been a real\ninspiration to me and have\nmarvellous talents if only\ndeveloped. Our little scholars\nat Alert Bay led the province\nof British Columbia in art\nlast year and their work is\nnow in the Normal School,\nVictoria. I also enjoyed my\nstudy of Indian psychology\nand found the parents most\nresponsive to my efforts in village work.\nMy only reason for\nleaving is due to the fact\nI have to assist financially\nat home and find we\ncouldn't manage on the\nTo be the maximum pay for 1940-41. Probably however next year, if our condition is improved, I might ask to be reinstated in your Day Schools, for I am more than interested in their progress. I fully believe the Day Schools will be the solution of the Indian problem.\n\nMay I also hereby thank the many Indian officials for their many kindnesses. I come now with my best wishes for the progress of your Indian Education.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nNoel Stewart.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Todd, Kwakwewlth Agency, dated May 29th last, in which he recommends that Miss D.V. Flick's salary as teacher of the primary division of the Alert Bay Indian Bay School be increased from $80 to $90 per teaching month.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that Miss Flick is a successful teacher with over ten years teaching experience in the Provincial schools of this Province, and that he is just as anxious as the Indian Agent to retain her services at Alert Bay. He informs me that Miss Flick's work is just as important and, in many ways heavier than that of the teacher of the Senior Division of the same school who has been in receipt of $90 per teaching month. He has recommended that such a salary be paid to Miss Flick as from the end of the present academic year, June 30th, 1941.\n\nI would request that the Department give consideration to the Indian Agent's recommendation and, if possible, increase Miss Flick's salary as recommended by the Inspector.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

This school has a large attendance, and Miss Flick has made a real success of her work here.\n\nAt the present time it appears difficult to get good teachers, and I am afraid we may lose her services under the present arrangement of a nine-month term at her present rate of salary, viz: $80.00 per teaching month, as she could no doubt obtain a larger salary for a longer term in the Provincial Schools, in which she has had considerable experience.\n\nAs her classroom is one of the most important in my Agency, I am recommending to the Department that her salary be increased to $90.00 per teaching month, in order that we will be assured of retaining her services and in recognition of her work in the past.\n\nWould the Department kindly advise me as soon as possible if this is approved?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMajor D.M.

Her resignation will be effective from July 1, 1941. Consequently no salary should be paid her after the end of June.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Alert Bay Indian Day School inspected on May 20, 1941.\n\nMiss Aitken was appointed last January to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Miss Benton. Miss Aitken has resigned as from the end of the term in June. This resignation is being forwarded through the Indian Agent, Mr. M.S. Todd, in the usual way. A well qualified teacher with experience is needed here, to take charge of Division 1 from October 1st, 1941.\n\nMiss Flick has made a success of her work in Division 2. She has had about ten years experience in Provincial schools and has been here for nearly two years now. Her present salary is only $80 per teaching month for a nine month year. Her record in Provincial schools has been so good that I am afraid she may decide to return to Provincial work where she could easily obtain a good appointment for a ten month academic year.\n\nI should like to suggest that Miss Flick be given a salary of $90.00 per teaching month as from the end of the present academic year in June. This is the salary allowed for the teacher of Division 1 where the work is not as difficult, there being far fewer pupils in attendance.\nKHAWENALTH AGENCY\n\nMonthly Report of M.S. Todd, Indian Agent\nfor the month of\nAPRIL 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith my Report for the\nmonth of April, 1941.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nAll schools are progressing favourably. During the\nmonth I visited the Campbell River Indian Day School,\nalthough not officially advised, I am given to understand\nthat Miss Aitken, senior teacher at the Alert Bay Indian\nDay School will not be returning after the summer holidays;\nthis information is being passed on so that the Department\nwill have sufficient time to look for a suitable teacher.\n\nAll Day School buildings are in fair state of repair,\nand it is not considered that any extensive repairs will\nbe necessary for some time.\n\nM.S.

Owing to considerable illness amongst the Indians the attendance is not very good up to the present. In connection with the Kingcome School, I am just informed by Mrs. Massey, the newly appointed teacher, that up to the time of her writing no Indians had returned to Kingcome from Gilford Island.

Mines & Resources.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter received from the Rt. Rev. H. Sexton, D.D., Bishop of British Columbia, Victoria, B.C., in which he nominates as temporary teacher of the Senior Division of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, Kwawkewlth Agency, Miss Janet Aitken, B.A., 236 East 62nd Avenue, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that Miss Aitken called on him seeking a position as teacher in an Indian Day School. She was advised to write to Bishop Sexton as, although she is not a member of the Anglican Church, neither is she a member of any other church, not, in fact, having been baptized.\n\nMiss Aitken was educated at the University of British Columbia where she received her B.A. degree, majoring in French and English. She speaks French and can read a little German. She holds an academic certificate. At the university Miss Aitken was a member of the Students' Christian Movement.\n\nApart from her lack of church affiliation and practical experience as a teacher, Inspector Barry considers that if Miss Aitken follows his instructions there is every chance that she may prove a success in the senior room of the Alert Bay Indian Day School. He informs me that there are hardly any qualified teachers available and that there is little or no chance of obtaining an Anglican teacher for this position at the present time.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Inspector Barry suggests that Miss Janet Aitken be given a temporary appointment, to expire at the end of June, 1941. Her further employment would, of course, depend on whether or not her work proved satisfactory.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nDecember 28, 1940.\n\nto the Inspector and Bishop Sexton,\n\nI would recommend that Miss Aitken be given a temporary appointment as suggested above, and would ask that I be informed by night letter if the Department is prepared to approve of this appointment and, if so, what salary would be allowed to this teacher.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

I have visited the two classrooms of the Alert Bay Indians Day School as well as the Residential School. In connection with the Day School, I should like to report there are now sixty-five children on the register of the Junior room. This is too many children for one teacher, but we are doing the best we can under the circumstances.

She has had five years teaching experience in provincial rural schools of that Province and is qualified to teach children up to and including Grade 10. Captain Barry considers that Miss Benton is very well qualified for the vacant position at Alert Bay and likely to be quite successful with the senior children there as her manner is exceptionally good.\n\nI would recommend that the nomination of Bishop Sexton be accepted and that Miss Dorothy Maude Benton be appointed teacher of Division I of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nShould the Department agree to Miss Benton's appointment, I would request that I be notified by wire as it will be necessary for this teacher to leave Vancouver on Friday afternoon, the 27th instant.

Captain Barry considers that the appointment of Mr. Stewart at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, would considerably strengthen the teaching staff of that school. Under the circumstances, I would recommend that Mr. Noel Stewart's resignation be accepted as teacher at the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nTo save time I have requested the Rt. Rev. H.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n29th May, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast year this office requested the Department to establish a summer school at the Alert Bay Indian Day School but were advised by Departmental letter No. C-687 of June 25th, 1940, that owing to lack of funds this was not possible at that time, but requesting that I include an item in my Estimates for 1941-42 and if the same condition existed this year as did last, to take the matter up with the Department and it would receive favourable consideration.\n\nProvision was made in our Estimates on page 9A for sufficient funds to operate a summer school, and as the need for same is even more this year than last, I am again recommending to the Department that a summer school be established at Alert Bay during the months of August and September.\n\nMy reasons for making this request are as follows:\n\nThe British Columbia Packers have practically doubled their capacity at their cannery here, which means that twice as many women will be employed this year, and in order to get these women they will have to be brought in with their families from outside villages. This will mean approximately one hundred small kiddies will be living in this village during the summer and fall. During the month of July, the women will not be so busy in the cannery and can take care of the children, but during August and September the heavy run of fish is on which will mean the children will be running the streets with no one to look after them, and as the Department is aware, Alert Bay has only one street and no children's playground. It would therefore be of great benefit to the children as well as the parents from the children's health and safety point of view, if a summer school were established during this period.\n\nI have spoken to Miss Flick, the present Junior teacher, and she has promised to stay during August and September, and at the present time I believe Mrs. Massay, teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Day School has an application before the Klitsa Reserve E.Sexton for a transfer to the Senior Room of the Alert Bay Day School, and if this is arranged she would be available as from August 1st.\n\nThe situation in connection with children in Alert Bay during this summer is going to be very serious, and this is the only way I can see that we can possibly cope with it. I hope, therefore, that the Department will see their way clear to approve of this arrangement. As the teachers will no doubt wish to make plans for the summer, I would appreciate the Department's decision at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter dated May 29th last from Mr. Indian Agent Todd, Kwawkewlth Agency, in which he recommends that a summer school be established at Alert Bay during the months of August and September. The need for such a summer school is set out in Mr. Todd's letter.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with Inspector Barry and I am informed by him that Mr. Todd's statement of the case is quite correct.\n\nIt will be remembered that owing to lack of funds, it was not possible to establish a summer school at Alert Bay in 1940. Provision was made in this year's Estimates for sufficient funds to operate such a summer school and the need would appear to be even greater this year than last. The School could be carried on in the buildings at present used for the regular Indian Day School at Alert Bay and I would recommend that if at all possible such a summer school be authorized. The question of teachers for such a school is dealt with in paragraph 4 of Mr. Todd's letter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing a letter from Indian Agent Todd dated May 29. The advisability of conducting a day school during the summer months at Alert Bay is extremely doubtful. It appears from the Agent's letter that what is really required is supervised play. It is quite possible that this would be much more beneficial to the children than classroom work during the months mentioned in the Indian Agent's letter. There is another point to consider; namely, that the efficiency of the teachers for the regular academic term starting on October 1 might be impaired by requiring them to teach during the summer months.\n\nI hesitate to approve of this arrangement if it is intended to be a permanent one, although the inference might be taken from the Agent's letter that it is only due to the extra help required by the British Columbia Packers this year.\n\nI feel that it would be advisable for you to again consider this whole matter very carefully and possibly correspond again with Indian Agent Todd. If, after reconsideration, you still think that the school should be operated during the months of August and September you may make the necessary arrangements to do so. In that event you can secure the services of Mrs. Massey and Miss Flick. Please let me have a further report from you regarding what action is being taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

If, however, it is decided to open this school for August and September she will be allowed the increased rate for these two months.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacKay, and we would be pleased to hear as soon as possible whether this nomination is approved.\n\nWith regard to an increase in salary to Miss Flick, teacher of the Junior classroom to $90.00 per teaching month, I am very pleased to concur in this, and have today advised Miss Flick that such increase will be effective as from October 1st, 1941.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

Flick from $80.00 a month to $90.00 a month, effective October 1, 1941.\n\nPossibly this school will be open for the months of August and September and operated as a seasonal school for this period. In that event Miss Flick would receive salary at the increased rate of $90.00 a month for these two months. However, she should not be paid salary for the months of August and September, 1941, unless you hear further from this Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 12th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of June 10th last, file 13-6-2475 in respect to the establishment of a summer school for the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I beg to advise you as follows.\n\nMrs. Massey and Miss Flick have both informed me they would be free to start teaching on the first of August and continue for the balance of the term; in fact they are both very anxious to do so. They would have one month's holiday during July, and I am certain that teaching from August 1st would have no ill effects on their health, as they are both strong and healthy people.\n\nIt was my intention to ask that a permanent summer school be established here, as the same conditions will prevail year after year so long as the cannery operates.\n\nInsofar as the routine to be followed, I was under the impression this was more or less arranged by Inspector Barrie as I thought they had a special course for this type of school. Personally, I would be in favour of physical training activities in the open in addition to the academic work, as during that period we have a great deal of sunshine and I am sure it would be beneficial to the children's health.\n\nI hope the Department will be able to arrange this, and I would ask that you take it up by Air Mail so that I may inform the teachers at an early date, as they have already advised me it was their intention to obtain other employment during the summer months if the summer school is not opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of Departmental letter 156-29-1 dated the 7th instant, Mr. Indian Agent Todd was asked for a further report with regard to the proposed summer school at Alert Bay. This report dated June 12th is attached herewith for your information.\n\nI may say that the matter of the establishment of this summer school has been again discussed with Inspector Barry who is of the opinion that a modified class room routine should be followed and that this should include physical training activities in the open. Captain Barry considers that the efficiency of the teachers would not be in any way impaired by requiring them to teach during two of the three summer months vacation, particularly as neither of the teachers will be attending the Provincial Summer School in July.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that there will be a number of children, many of them quite young, in Alert Bay this summer, neither the Inspector nor I wish that those children who have regularly attended the Alert Bay Indian Day School during the past academic year should be forced to attend the proposed summer school but it is recognized that such a school would be of considerable assistance in the case of those children from outlying points including Kingcome Inlet, Turner Island, Fort Rupert and Village Island, who have not had an opportunity of attending a day school during the whole of the past academic year.\n\nNo doubt the employment of Mrs. Massey and Miss Flick at the proposed summer school would ensure their continuation in the Department's service during the next academic year.\n\nAlthough Mr. Indian Agent Todd is asking for a permanent summer school at Alert Bay, neither Inspector Barry nor\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nJune 14, 1941.\n\nI would recommend that such a school as is now suggested should be established on a permanent basis.\n\nI would recommend that authority be given for the arrangement of a summer school of two divisions at Alert Bay during the months of August and September of this year with Mrs. J. Massey and Miss Flick as teachers of this school and that salary be allowed them at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month while the school is in operation.\n\nAlthough the Department has given me authority to make the necessary arrangements for the establishment of this school and the employment of Mrs. Massey and Miss Flick as teachers, I should be glad to hear by air mail that the recommendations herein made are approved before instructing the Indian Agent to proceed with the arrangement and establishment of the school.\n\nThe school should be considered of an experimental nature and Inspector Barry will be instructed to carry out an inspection during the summer. On receipt of his report it will be easier to assess the actual value of the school to the community.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n2nd October, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of September 12th last, file 15-6-4131, I beg to give you my views as to the results obtained from the Summer School which was held at Alert Bay during the months of August and September this year. As this school was officially inspected by Inspector Barry on September 25th last, who will also be making a report, it is my intention not to comment on the academic side but rather, give my impressions in general on this experiment.\n\nI should like first to state I was disappointed in the attendance in both rooms. In the junior room, there were 60 pupils on the register, but who attended irregularly, the average being 20.88 for the full two months. In the senior room, the enrollment was 34, and the average attendance 12 for the two month period.\n\nIn breaking down these figures, I find the reasons for the small attendance were as follows: First, the establishment of a Summer School was a new idea to the Indians, and the attendance was voluntary, which meant that the choice of attending was left to the children. I am under the opinion that had the Department left the matter of attendance in the Agent's hands, to decide who should go and who should not, our attendance would have been somewhat better. I feel there were some children in the village who should have gone but owing to their parents working and no one to check up on their attendance, they merely went when they felt like it. I feel because it was on the voluntary system that the attendance was somewhat poor, as previous to the Summer School commencing I had called a meeting of the parents, explaining the idea to them, and asked their cooperation, and they expressed their thanks to the Department and assured me they would do everything they could to cooperate.\n\nThis year, the Indians are experiencing one of the most profitable years in the fishing industry, and with shortage of labour a large number of boys from twelve years of age and upwards obtained fishing licences under Permit, and went fishing with their parents, and a great many of the girls from ten years of age and up were given employment at the local cannery by Stanley, and it from the Labour Department at the request of the management of the B.C. Packers to assist in putting up the pack owing to the Company being unable to get help. When the application was made for the Summer School I did not anticipate the situation such as developed this year, and it may never happen again; however, it has been responsible to a great extent for the irregular attendance and reducing the average.\n\nI do feel, however, that on the whole, the Summer School has been a real success. From the health point of view, through the fact that the children were attending school\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nnecessary for them to carry out personal cleanliness as supervised by the teachers, and their living habits were regular. The absence of the usual skin diseases which have always been prevalent after the prolonged holiday period is very noticeable, and this situation would have been aggravated this year owing to so many more families living here and the homes being overcrowded. The village has also been very free from accidents, through the supervised play, and we have had no hospital accounts to meet in this connection.\n\nEach year during the summer holidays when there are so many children playing around the village, it gets into a deplorable state, and one of my requests to the teachers was to keep the village clean and tidy as an outdoor project. I arranged for the teachers to take the children one day per week and go through the village for this purpose, and this in itself has been of great benefit not only to the children but to the Indians as a whole in respect to health.\n\nAfter taking everything into consideration, I feel the Summer School has been a success and worth while.\n\nFor consideration another year, I wish to make the following recommendations:\n\n1. That the attendance be not altogether on the voluntary system, but left to the discretion of the Agent.\n\n2. That the summer School at Alert Bay be conducted under the supervision of one teacher instead of two during the months of August and September.\n\n3. That a similar project be established at Knight Inlet Cannery, Glendale Cove, under supervision of one teacher, where large numbers of children are congregated with not even sufficient playing space or anyone to supervise them while their parents are working in the cannery. This was brought to the attention of the Department early this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant with further reference to the summer school conducted at Alert Bay during August and September of the current year.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of June 7 the Department is still of the opinion that what is really required is supervised play rather than academic training.\n\nBefore next summer Indian Agent Todd, Inspector Barry and yourself should fully review the whole situation, not only at Alert Bay but at the other two points mentioned in your letter, and submit a definite recommendation early in May in order that the recommendations you make may receive our careful consideration before the time arrives for taking action.\n\nIt has occurred to me that the British Columbia Department of Education has a very splendid plan of physical training and it might be possible to adopt some of their methods in the event of your recommending the continuance of this summer school principle. I agree with you that the cannery officials should be approached with a view to determining what financial assistance they might give. I feel they should be interested in this matter because as employers it is partly their responsibility.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOctober 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you to my letter 15/6/4410 of October 1st with which I forwarded Inspector Barry's report on the Alert Bay Indian Summer School, Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a further report on the above summer school prepared under date of October 2nd by Mr. Indian Agent Todd.\n\nNeither Inspector Barry nor I consider that the results obtained at Alert Bay last summer were as valuable as they are apparently considered to have been by Mr. Todd. Further, as I have stated on a previous occasion, I do not consider that Indian children, particularly those who have attended the regular Indian Day School during the previous academic year, should be forced to attend a summer school or that their attendance should be left to the discretion of the Agent, as is suggested by Mr. Todd.\n\nThe necessity for the conservation of even those funds now available during the present emergency must, of course, be taken into consideration and, at least while the present war continues, I am not prepared to recommend that the Department provide in full the salaries of even one teacher at Alert Bay and the Knight Inlet Cannery, Glendale Cove.\n\nInspector Barry and I feel that if the operation of summer schools at these two points in the Kwawkewlth Agency is, in fact, of definite advantage to the Indian people, both the Anglican Church and the canneries themselves should be\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nasked to assume a proportion of the cost of these schools. I am, therefore, prepared to suggest that if the Anglican Church and the cannery management provide the salary of one teacher at Alert Bay and at Knight Inlet for the month of August, 1942, the Department might well pay the salary for the teacher at each of these points for the month of September, 1942.\n\nShould the Church and cannery officials not consider the proposed summer schools of sufficient value to warrant the expenditure of $90.00 for a teacher's salary at each of the above points, I do not consider that the Department would be well advised to sanction the arrangement of such schools or to provide for the salaries of teachers for even one month.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just finished writing a reply to your circular letter in respect to the closing of Indian Day Schools, and in view of this I hesitated to make the following recommendation, but after giving the matter very careful consideration I feel under the circumstances I am justified in doing so.\n\nAs you know, a Summer School was held at Alert Bay during the past year, and while in my opinion it was not the success I had hoped for, nevertheless it was an experiment and proved of untold value to the Indian children, particularly from a health point of view, which, I am sure, meant money well spent by the Department.\n\nWhen the Day School reopened the children returned in a good state of health, which can be directly attributed to the supervision of the summer school, and I feel that consideration should be given to the operation of a summer school at Alert Bay this year, but with a more limited scope. I feel that one teacher instead of two could handle the load for the extra cost of one teacher's salary for three months it would be money well spent by the Department. I am therefore recommending that a Summer School be held during the months of August and September, employing only one teacher to supervise the same.\n\nI am making this recommendation because I feel with the increased activities of this fishing centre and the demands now made by the war effort on Indian women in the fishing industry, we are going to face difficulty problems in respect to the children who have no place to play and no supervision of them.\n\nI trust the Department will see their way clear to grant this request, even if we have to curtail expenses in some other way to provide funds for same. I might add the Village Island and Quatsino Day Schools have not been opened this term, and some of the funds provided for them in the next term could be utilized for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

You should so inform Indian Agent Todd.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter dated the 16th instant received from Mr. Indian Agent Todd requesting the operation of a summer school at Alert Bay following the close of the term.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with Mr. Inspector Barry who is not in favour of the proposal as it was not considered that the summer school last year justified the expenditure, a view with which I concur. Consequently, I am unable to recommend favourable consideration of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nSir,-\n\nThe two teachers of the Alert Bay Indian Day School have asked me to write the Department and request, if possible, that their salary cheques be forwarded a little earlier than usual this month so that they may receive same before leaving Alert Bay for the summer vacation.\n\nPerhaps the Department could arrange to have the cheques issued a few days previous, and sent by Air Mail, and if so it would be also be appreciated by myself, as the teachers are leaving Alert Bay on the 28th of June. This applies to Mrs. Jane Massey and Miss D.V. Flick, of Alert Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S.

Todd, Indian Agent\nfor the month of May 1942.\n\nSir:\n\nEDUCATION\n\nThe Day Schools as well as the Residential School appear to be carrying on satisfactorily, with the exception of the Cape Mudge School, where the Department has notified the teacher that his services will not be required after the present term.\n\nThis year the usual Empire Day celebrations were held at Alert Bay, and owing to it coming during the time of the Red Cross Appeal, the citizens of this community arranged to make it a Red Cross Day entirely, with all financial receipts going to the Appeal. A varied programme was arranged, a parade taking place in which all schools participated. I am pleased to state that the senior pupils of the Alert Bay Indian Day School under the direction of Mrs. Massey received the first prize. Mrs. Massey spent a very great deal of her own time in preparing costumes for her pupils to represent the Canadian Junior Red Cross, of which they are chartered members, and in passing this information on to the Department I would like to state how very fortunate we are in having Mrs. Massey as a teacher as she takes such a keen interest in the welfare and activities of her pupils.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON KWAKWEWLTH AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JUNE 1942.\n\nOCCUPATIONS\n\nThe fishing season has now started, and all of my Indians are busily engaged in this industry. There appears to be a shortage of labour, with the result that High School students are being absorbed into the industry to fill the vacancy created by the shortage of manpower. During the early part of the month, quite a number of Indians were engaged in halibut fishing previous to the sockeye season, and this industry has been very successful, as it has been a good season both for price and quantity of fish. Very few of the Indians have remained in the logging industry where they are receiving exceptionally high wages, some as much as ten dollars a day; they do not seem to be able to resist the call of fishing when the season opens.\n\nPossibly I should again draw to the department's attention the closing of the B.C.Packers' Cannery at Alert Bay owing to War Regulations, and the Indian women and their families previously employed here have been transferred to the B.C.Packers Imperial Cannery at Steveston, just outside of Vancouver. I understand these women will be employed there for many months, and this may affect the children's return to the Day school at Alert Bay. However, this matter is being looked into and if its effect on the Alert Bay Day School is serious, a further report will be made at a later date.\n\nM.S.Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nJune 19th, 1942\n\nThe Indian Agent\nKwawkewlth Agency\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd,\n\nI, the undersigned, hereby resign my position as teacher of division two in the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn resigning, I might say that I have enjoyed my work here, have been keenly interested in the children and feel satisfied that I have accomplished something towards their progress.\n\nSincerely yours,\n(Miss) Dorothy V.

I would, however, advise that in my opinion the five minute recess is too brief and that the fifteen minute recess should be given.\n\nI also enclose Mr. Todd's letter of the 4th instant requesting that Mrs. Massey be allowed to take the primary room when the additional teacher arrives, instead of being with the seniors as at present. This would appear satisfactory and I would recommend same on the understanding that Mrs. Massey would remain Principal of the school.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 13, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the Department approves the Alert Bay School being operated on a half-day basis; namely, half of the available pupilage being taught in the morning and the other half in the afternoon. This procedure may be followed until a second teacher is secured.\n\nI agree with you that the fifteen minute recess should be taken.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nEDUCATION:\n\nI would like to draw the Department's attention to the rather serious situation at the Alert Bay Indian Day School, where there are 53 pupils enrolled. The Department informed me that Miss Elvidge had been appointed as Junior teacher, but to date she has not reported for duty, and Mrs. Massey is still carrying on both classrooms. A special letter is being forwarded to the Indian Commissioner in this connection, with a view to relieving the congested situation of a second teacher is unobtainable.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KNAWKELTH AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1943.\n\nEducation - As no teacher was obtained for the Junior Room of the Alert Bay Day School, arrangements were tentatively made and later approved by the Department, that the school be held on a half-day system until a second teacher can be secured. On account of the severe weather, this school was closed for three days during the month. The Campbell River and Cape Mudge Day Schools were inspected during the month, and found in excellent order. It is noted however that the Cape Mudge School is overcrowded, and as the structure itself is very old, the Indians made application at their general meeting to have a new school provided. It was explained by Inspector Coleman that this would not be possible during the emergency, but that consideration would be given same at a later date, and I would support this as soon as funds are available.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nExcerpt from\nCopy of letter Received from\nMrs. R. Wilson, Teacher, Cape Mudge School.\n\nCape Mudge, April 21, 1943.\n\n\"In your circular letter of April 9th I note that the\nCape Mudge School will open on September 1, 1943. It is my\nintention to retain my present position here for the next term.\"\n\n\"Margaret Wilson\"\n\nExcerpt from letter Rec'd from\nMrs. M.M. Yeatman, Teacher, Campbell River School.\n\nCampbell River, April 23, 1943.\n\n\"About my staying another year I would like to very much\nbut my health has not been up to the mark this year and I think\nI had better take a rest this coming year. I might be very glad\nat some future date to come back to one of your schools, and at\nany time you were stuck for a teacher I would be glad to fill in.\"\n\n\"M.M. Yeatman\"\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n4th May, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nKnowing the scarcity of teachers, for the Department's information I have communicated with the teachers in this Agency to ascertain from them whether it is their intention to remain in their present positions for the term starting on September 1st next, and have had the following replies.\n\nAlert Bay Indian Day School: Mrs. Jane Massey has signified her willingness to remain with the Department here provided she can get suitable living accommodation, and I enclose herewith copy of her letter. This will leave one room vacant. Mrs. Massey's request to have the junior room was forwarded to your office on January 25th last. In my opinion there should be a teacher appointed to the senior room as I understand from Mrs. Massey that from a survey she has made there will be approximately twelve beginners next term; last fall when school started she had sixty pupils on the roll including both junior and senior rooms. Later it was found necessary to request the Department for permission to carry on the half-day system, but this was later found not very satisfactory and when a number of the pupils returned to their home villages Mrs. Massey carried all grades in the one room the full day. A further survey will be made and definite recommendations made to the Department before school closes this term insofar as the second room is concerned.\n\nCape Mudge Day School - Mrs. R. Wilson has advised she would like to remain at this school next term, and as her services have been very satisfactory so far as I can learn, I would recommend that she be retained in this position.\n\nCampbell River Day School - Mrs. Yeatman has advised me owing to her health she is resigning at the end of the present term. In respect to this school I have received an application from Miss Jean Hill, at one time teacher of the Cape Mudge School, and who is now at Port Simpson, to be appointed to the Campbell River School. Miss Hill advises me the severe weather in the northern country is too much for her parents and as she makes her home with them it is necessary that she move south to a warmer climate and it is for this reason she is resigning from the Port Simpson at the end of the present term and requests a transfer to Campbell River. As Miss Hill's teaching ability is well known to the Department as well as the good influence of herself and family in the life of the Indian village, I would recommend that she be appointed to the Campbell River Day School.\n\nVillage Island Day School - This school has been closed for some time owing to our inability to obtain a teacher. The Indians of this village are most anxious that the school be reopened if at all possible, and as I have previously informed the Department, Miss Flora Hanuse has been carrying on this year without any remuneration from the Department. As stated previously, I will make a further report and definite recommendation at a later date as to whether I consider she should be employed or not for next term.\nKingcome Inlet Day School - In regard to this school, I reported after my last visit there that I was not satisfied with the services being rendered by Mr. Christmas, the teacher. While it is recognized an almost impossible situation was created by the Indians' custom activities there this winter, nevertheless I do not feel that Mr. Christmas has the ability to successfully carry on the work, and would strongly recommend that a new teacher be appointed to this school.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of the 4th instant with reference to teachers at the various Indian Day Schools in his Agency.\n\nAn endeavour will be made to secure the additional teacher for Alert Bay Indian Day School and it is hoped that the 10 months term will be sufficient inducement to interest a suitable person.\n\nI have written Mr. Indian Agent Gillett with reference to Miss Hill's desire to transfer from Port Simpson Indian Day School to Campbell River Day School, requesting that she be asked to apply for a transfer through her Church authorities if the information supplied by Mr. Todd is correct.\n\nI have already written the Department in respect to the re-employment of Mr. Christmas as teacher of the Kingcome Indian Day School.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 13, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.

We have carefully noted his remarks on every school and will await further recommendations from you before any action is taken.\n\nR.A.

St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, which has already reported a full attendance and up to capacity. Junior room in the Alert Bay Indian Day School in charge of Mrs. Jane Massey, teacher, will carry on for the time being jointly with the senior room.

The Cape Mudge Indian Day School with Mrs. Wilson, teacher, in charge, who carried on the work there during 1942. The Campbell River Indian Day School with Miss Jean Hill, teacher, in charge. Miss Hill has been transferred from Port Simpson Indian Day School to Campbell River, and this Agency welcomes her back as she is an outstanding teacher.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KWAWKWLTH INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1943.\n\nEducation;\n\nIn regard to the Alert Bay Indian Day School, Mrs. Jane Massey is still carrying on the work of the two classrooms, but every effort is being made to try and find a suitable teacher to relieve her of this very heavy burden.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of an application for the position as teacher of the senior room at the Alert Bay Indian Day School from Miss Grace Madeline McGill of Saskatoon who is an Anglican, born October 27, 1916, of Irish origin. Miss McGill is a graduate of the Saskatoon Normal School in June, 1939, and holds an interim certificate with a primary methods summer school certificate of June, 1939.\n\nAs you are aware, teachers are very scarce, and as this young lady appears to be qualified for the position I would recommend approval of her application at a salary of $90.00 per month plus Cost of Living bonus subject to the approval of Bishop Sexton of Victoria who has been written to in this connection. In view of the urgency of having this room opened at the earliest possible date and as Miss McGill is in a position to sever her present business associations, it would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me in the matter by air mail.\n\nMiss McGill wishes to undertake this position without being \"frozen\" to same until she is certain that she is satisfied to continue Indian work.\n\nD.M.

I am very much concerned over both these schools and hope that every effort will be made to replace these teachers, particularly as there is a good attendance and the Indian families are showing exceptional interest in having their children educated. With regard to the Alert Bay Indian Day School, it will not be possible to ask Mrs. Massey to take over these two (2) rooms and carry on as she previously did before Miss McGill was appointed to the senior room. At that time Mrs. Massey was so run down due to overwork that it took her many months to regain her health.

I told Mr. Todd that I am quite agreeable to Miss Shatto's appointment, if you are in agreement with the suggestion... It is preferable to secure a Teacher who is a member of the Church of England but if Miss Shatto is from other lands or a Protestant she will, no doubt, let her understand that she must not escape in anything & the nature of proselytising. My chief reason for mentioning this is that there are a number of Pentecostals and other Fancy Religious Bodies who are keen to make use of such people,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6383, file 800-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nand if we & our teachers were active in such a cause it would, of course, lead to trouble which we are anxious to avoid.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves the appointment of Miss Margaret Riddell Shotts as teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $100 a teaching month. I am forwarding, under separate cover, a supply of the forms required in connection with the appointment of teachers and one set of these should be completed by Miss Shotts as soon as she begins duties.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nEducation:\n\nApproval has been given for the appointment of Mrs. M.M. Yeatman as teacher of the Campbell River Indian Day School and as Mrs. Yeatman is a very splendid teacher we are very fortunate in again obtaining her services. On December 30th, 1944, this office was advised by Mrs. M. Wilson, teacher of the Cape Mudge Indian Day School, that she had resigned, and it is presumed her resignation was sent to Rev. W.P. Hunt, Superintendent of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, Vancouver. Previous to receiving this notice from Mrs. Wilson I had been informed by her that Rev. T.F. Moore, United Church minister located at Cape Mudge, was interfering with her school work to such an extent that unless this ceased she would have no alternative but to resign. As Mrs. Wilson is one of our best teachers and I being personally familiar with the circumstances referred to by Mrs. Wilson, I reported the matter fully to Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, enclosing a statement made by Mrs. Wilson, and requested that the matter be taken up with Rev. Hunt, as I was sure Mrs. Wilson was not to blame in any way. I might state I have written to Mrs. Wilson requesting her to stay on until June 30th next, and informed her that Rev. Moore informed me he had resigned from the Church and was leaving Cape Mudge at the end of December, 1944, to study medicine in the United States. To date I have not had any further reply. As the department is aware, Miss M. McGill, teacher of the senior room in the Alert Bay Indian Day School, ceased her duties on December 31st, 1944. I am again drawing it to their attention with the hope that every effort will be made to re-open this classroom as soon as possible. I have forwarded one application to the Commissioner's Office, with a hope that we may be successful in obtaining the services of a teacher.\n\nM.S.
