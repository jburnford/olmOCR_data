At this season each year most men cease and unhinge will pause for a moment and take a retrospect of the past, and form new resolves for the future. The year that is now closing has been like the last, full of its joys and sorrows, and its lessons have brought sorrow and disappointment to many, who entered upon it with bright hopes of happiness and success. Whilst to others, it has been a year of continual prosperity in business, and of domestic happiness. So it will ever be, in the ever changing vicissitudes of human life. It behoves us then to enjoy and improve the present, laying the foundations of a future existence, which will reflect all around well. It is indeed a wise provision that, the gift of prescience is withheld from humanity. How miserable would it be if it were otherwise. If we could see into futurity, if it were the evils that are to befell us, and which we could not prevent, how wretched would be our everyday lives! no enjoyment of the present, nothing but the very prospect of rear of evil come, which would render our lives unendurable, and make us long for death to terminate our misery. Yet, it is best that the veil of futurity should hide the future from our sight, so that we can (only for a brief space) enjoy the pleasures of our present existence whilst we can, trusting to Providence to care for the future.\n\nThe year just closed marked by the success of British arms in Egypt, where the rebellion led by the Arab Pasha has been crushed by the English troops, under Sir Garnet (now Lord) Wolseley, will known Canada as the leader of the Red River Expedition; and who since has then has added many fresh laurels to his brow. There is always a dark side to every picture, and in this case of victory is saddled by the thought (that although the life of life outside was remarkably small yet there will be many a once happy home in old England, which will mourn the absence of some dear ones, whose blood has been poured out on the sands of Egypt.\n\nIn our own Dominion, no event of national importance has occurred. Peace and plenty reign within our borders, and the labors of the husbandman have been crowned with abundant success. No intestine strife, or fear of foreign invasion has disturbed the harmony of our people, whose eyes are bent to promote the welfare of their country, to the development of this great country, and the advancement of their own individual fortunes. One of the most remarkable events in our own history is the unexampled rapidity with which the Canadian Pacific Railroad is being built. The road has been pushed forward at the rate of four miles a day, a fact unparalleled in railroad engineering, and more than a road a point nearly three hundred miles west of Winnipeg. Emigrants have poured in by thousands during the year to settle the fertile lands of the great North West, and no doubt during the next year more will be bought than numbers will be largely increased during the coming year, when greater building facilities will be afforded.\n\nAnd the prospects for the New Year are brighter still with the certainty of two (if not more) railways being commenced (one of which is said will be finished by the spring), lines of telegraph connecting with the eastern Provinces, and a weekly mail established, the future of Prince Albert is assured. Full of hope then, and faith in a glorious future, we bid farewell to the Prince Albert year, and bid God speed to our readers on a prosperous and all a happy and a prosperous new year.\n**A CARD.**\n\nTo Messrs: Acorn & Cross.\n\nThe pump which you have put in my well is giving entire satisfaction being easily worked and keeps the water in the house at all times.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nE.
