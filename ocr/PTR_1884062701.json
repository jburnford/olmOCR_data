It seems certain that the Government will be detached on the Egyptian Policy, and active preparations are being made throughout the country against the policy. Mr. Waddington, French Statesman, has assured that the change will be made without delay.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES\n\nThe American papers are not in favour of the remodelling of the Egyptian government, but the English press is divided. The Times, for instance, is favourable to the change, while the Daily Telegraph is opposed to it.\n\nR. H.
