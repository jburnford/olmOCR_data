I agree with your recommendation that the school should be inspected again about May or June and you will no doubt make the necessary arrangements in this regard with Inspector Barry.\n\nAfter carefully considering the contents of Inspector Barry's report I am under the impression that we should dispense with the services of Miss Daly at the end of the current academic year unless Inspector Barry finds, on his next inspection, that there has been a very decided improvement both in the work and in the teacher's attitude toward it. In order to permit a month's notice being given to Miss Daly in the event of her dismissal it would be advisable to have the school inspected early in May.\n\nI cannot agree that there is any advantage in reducing the length of the academic year at this school so drastically as suggested by Inspector Barry. Every endeavour should be made, however, to increase the attendance at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A.

Teachers' convention, and Miss Dynes, stenographer at the Indian Agency Office at New Westminster, came to her school and demanded a written apology for the action in closing the school. Miss Daly refused to give this apology and apparently there is a great deal of friction over the matter.\n\nSurely it is right for a teacher at an Indian Day School to attend a Teachers' Convention for a day and try to keep up with her work, particularly as I understand their appointment is merely temporary, and she may have to leave shortly to teach in the ordinary provincial schools.\n\nWould you please advise me if it is contrary to the instructions of the Superintendent of Education for teachers in the Indian Department to attend an ordinary Teachers' Convention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nsgd) George Cruickshank\n\nGeorge Cruickshank, M.P.\nFraser Valley\n\nGAC:MI\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1940.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant your salary rate is $90.00 a teaching month. From this the following deductions are made:\n\n1. National Defence tax -- which must be paid by all wage earners -- 2\u00a2 .......... $1.80\n\n2. An Order-in-Council recently passed provides that in the case of those engaged since September 1, 1939, a deduction of 5% of their salary must be made. This amount is funded and interest allowed at the rate of 4%. When you retire as teacher of an Indian day school the amount of the deduction, plus interest, will be paid to you. The 5% deduction amounts, monthly, to ......................... 4.50\n\nYou will note from the above that there is a total monthly deduction of $6.30 which makes the amount you receive, namely, $83.70, correct.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Maureen Daly,\nTeacher,\nKatzie Indian Day School,\nPort Hammond, B.C.\n\nR.A.

We have been deluged with a large number of resignations recently and it is almost impossible for the Department to secure teachers at this comparatively late date. If teachers in charge of public schools acted in this way, their certificates would be immediately cancelled by the Department of Education.

Even with this assistance, the average attendance has only been nine pupils. The children arriving at school age this summer will barely balance the discharges, so we cannot hope for any improvement in this condition. So far as attendance is concerned, therefore, I do not think this School warrants its continuation.\n\nOn the other hand, however, the question arises of what we are to do with this average of nine pupils? The St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School is full to capacity and they cannot be taken in there. Langley Municipal Schools on the south shore, and Pitt Meadows, on the north shore of the Fraser, are not very conveniently situated for the Reserves, even if the local Authorities were willing to accept Indian children.\n\nIt would seem that if these children are to continue to receive an education, we have no option but to endeavour to get a new teacher and continue to operate the school for the time being.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O.N.

It was not immediately forwarded to the Department, however, as enquiries were being made of Mr. Indian Agent Daunt as to whether he considered it advisable to continue this school in operation, copy of his reply of the 6th instant being enclosed herewith.\n\nThe present difficulty of teachers resigning on short notice has been due to the demand for them in the various war services in the Province and in view of the grave shortage of teachers for Provincial Schools it is doubtful if the Provincial Department of Education would agree to cancel the certificates of our teachers who are resigning without giving sufficient notice.

Although it has not functioned for several years, it nevertheless should be reshingled as it is leaking and if allowed to remain as is, the lining, ceiling and flooring will be damaged. An amount of $203.00 was placed in the current year's estimates for this work.\n\nJordan's, General Merchants at Port Hammond, had their building contractor make a survey, and their tender is attached for $232.40, plus $55.00 for paint work. Every window-pane in the building is broken. The cost of supplying the glass and glazing, will according to Jordan's cost $97.50.\n\nThese repairs may be held in abeyance, pending the reopening of the school. The windows are boarded up, and I think no further damage will be done.\n\nThe Indians of Katzie have requested that the school be reopened. I am gathering data as to the number of children etc., and will submit a report in the very near future.\n\nJ.

The fourth school at Katzic Reserve has remained closed, and the desks have been shipped to the Skeen Agency.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nRepairs to Buildings - The only Departmentally owned buildings in the Agency are four day schools, viz:- Pemberton, Chehalis, Skwah and Katzic. These are all in fair repair, except Katzic. This latter school has been closed for two years, and most of the windows were broken by boys. We boarded them all up, so no further damage is possible. The roof is also in poor condition, and we stopped actual leaks with such material as was on hand. The desks were all shipped to Skeena Agency in January. Both Chehalis and Skwah schools should be painted and redecorated, but it is impossible to interest people in submitting tenders at the present time. When there is more work available in the cities and towns than can be attended to, no workmen are anxious to go out in the country on jobs.

Four parents only, comprising nine children pledged to send their children to School.\n2. Four of the nine children would have to be transported daily by boat at a cost of $3.00.\n3. Two children living on the Reserve on which the School is situated can attend a White School.\n4. Ten children will be at the Canneries with their parents indefinitely.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, that an expenditure of $287.40 for repairs to the roof only be authorized for the time being.\n\nJ.

I agree with Mr. Gillett that it would not be advisable to reopen the school until there is an increase in the available pupilage, but as it is considered advisable that the school building be kept in good repair I would recommend that an expenditure of $287.40 be authorized to repair the roof.\n\nFor D.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSIR:-\n\nI am informed by Miss Mary Winter, Teacher of the Katzie Indian Day School, that her requisition for school and janitor supplies, dated the 26th of December, has been incompletely filled.\n\nShe requested six copies of high roads readers, primer, and received none. High roads readers, book one, six copies and received one. High Roads Readers, book two, requested four copies and received one. High roads readers, book three, requested four and received one. High roads readers, book 4, copies requested three and got one.\n\nOn the second page of her requisition, she asked for the following, which were not authorized by the Department:\n\nPlane (5\u00bd in.)\nBrace and Bit.\nColorless varnish.\nAge\nTo Brooms\n2 Pails\n2 Gallons of floor oil.\n2 Dozen cakes of soap\n8 Lengths of stove pipe.\n120 Feet of halliard wire for flag pole.\nLumber for building a cupboard for woodwork tools and a bookshelf.\n\n(The boys will perform this work themselves in connection with manual training.)\n\nIf the Department are not prepared to authorize the above, I would be obliged if you would let me know.\n\nThe Inspector of School, Captain G.H. Barry, is pushing the handicraft work, and he lays particular stress on the \"High Roads Readers\", and expects to find them on hand, when he inspects the various Schools throughout the Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant you may purchase the following articles for use at the Katzie day school:\n\nPlane (5\u00bd in.) 2 Pails\nBrace and bit 2 Gallons of floor oil\nColorless varnish 2 Doz. cakes of soap\nAxe 8 Lengths of stove pipe\nTwo brooms 120 Ft. halliard wire for flag pole.\nLumber for cupboard and bookshelf\n\nThe account covering the cost of the above should not be forwarded until after April 1.\n\nWith regard to the Highroads Readers I may say that 1 copy of the Primer, Book 1, Book 2, Book 3 and Book 4 were ordered from the Government Stationery Office and if they have not yet reached the school will no doubt be delivered in the near future. These have been forwarded for supplementary reading purposes. I must say that I do not see the connection between the handicraft work and the supplying of the Highroads Readers.\n\nFor some time past the Katzie day school has been supplied with the Corona Readers and as far as we are aware these readers have been quite suitable for this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

While Inspector Barry had been urging the teachers at certain Indian schools in British Columbia to secure the Highroads Readers, I discussed the matter with him when I was in British Columbia in August and it was decided that he would not insist on these Readers being used in future. Under these circumstances, the Highroads Readers were not ordered.\n\nThe only other articles on the above requisition were as follows: jack hammers, 4 back saws, 1 Lbs nails, 46 sheets sandpaper, 36 coping saw blades, 3 bottles Lepage's glue, 1 quart orange shellac, 1 package sizing glue, 1 quart varnish stain, 6 spools white thread, 6 children's thimbles, 12 balls knitting wool, 4 pairs knitting needles, 24 skeins embroidery wool, 24 skeins embroidery cotton, 2 yards varnish, 1 yard curtain net.

Daunt, Indian agent, New Westminster, B.C.\n\nThe Stationery Office has forwarded to me S.D. No. 251524 on which you make the following notation \"This school is not operating and supplies should not be sent unless requisitioned for\". I agree with what you say but these special books were ordered by the Minister, and we were instructed to send them to all the schools. At the time these books were shipped we were hopeful that we would obtain a teacher for that school.\n\nOf course, there is another side to the question, and that is, if we delay shipping the supplies for any schools until it is actually in operation, the teacher inevitably complains that she has no supplies to work with. As you know there is always a delay in shipping supplies from the Stationery Office to the schools in British Columbia and especially at the present time when materials are hard to obtain, and due to congested railways deliveries are uncertain.\n\nAs to the six books to which special reference is made you may either keep them until the Katzie school re-opens or send them to other schools in your agency which are in operation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 10th of November, in connection with two parcels containing school supplies for the Kettle Indian Day School at Hammond, B.C.\n\nWe collected these from the Post Office in Hammond, and are holding them pending the appointment of a teacher.\n\nNo supplies have yet arrived at the Freight Office, but when they do so, the agent at Hammond, will forward them here.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.O.M.

A shipment of supplies was also made by freight during recent weeks, at which time we were not aware that we would be unable to secure a teacher.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would get in touch with the Postmaster and Freight Agent at Hammond, B.C., and arrange to accept delivery and have the supplies carefully stored at the school until a teacher is secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

This has been recommended previously in my reports of February and November, 1932. From a health point of view, if from no other, this rekalsomining should be carried out during the summer vacation of this year, 1934.\n\nThe teacher has done her best to keep this school in a sanitary condition as reported last year. She even bought material herself to kalsomine the interior of the toilets, as has been previously reported.\n\nThe school is in other respects in a satisfactory state of repair, and the toilets are clean.\n\nIN FORWARDING THE ABOVE, ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER C. C. PERRY, WRITES AS FOLLOWS:\n\nIn regard to the proposed expenditures it should be pointed out that in the Agency Estimates of 1934-35 under the heading of \"Indian Education\" we included an item of the sum of $500 for repairs to three day schools, viz., the Chehalis, the Katzie and Skwah Schools, and it is presumed that if the services mentioned by the Inspector are to be installed the Department will give the necessary directions to the Indian Agent to proceed with the work.\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nMay 4th, 1933\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 54, amounting to $4.35 in favour of Matheson's Model Stores, Limited, Port Haney, B.C., for Supplies for the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 153-18-5 dated April 20th, 1933.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nFebruary 6th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 854, amounting to $3.70 in favour of Hanson's Mercantile Company, Hammond, B.C., for Supplies for the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 153-18-4 dated January 25th, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Hanson's Mercantile Company,\n\nHanson,\n\nB.C.\n\nDATE 1934.\n\nSERVICE\n\nAMOUNT\n\nFeb. 6 To Supplies for the Patzie Indian Day School, under authority of Department dated January 25th, 1934, File No. 155-18-4.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52\n\nIndian Affairs., (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nMay 4, 1933\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 53, amounting to $5.90 in favour of Hanson Mercantile Company, Port Hammond, B.C., for Supplies for the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 153-18-5 dated April 20th, 1933.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nFebruary 6th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 854, amounting to $3.70 in favour of Hanson's Mercantile Company, Hammond, B.C., for Supplies for the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 153-18-4 dated January 25th, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\n\nIndian Affairs., (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-5, part 1)\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo Hanson's Mercantile Company\n\nHAMMOND\n\nBoCo.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb. 6 | To Supplies for the Katzie Indian Day School, under authority of Department dated January 25th, 1934, File No. 155-18-4. | |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\n\nForm 52\n\nIndian Affairs., (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n| Description                        | Quantity | Price |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| For Katya Indian School           |          |       |\n| 2 Lb. of Tobacco                  |          | 25    |\n| 1 Bottle                          |          | 191   |\n| 1 No. 3                         |          | 135   |\n| 3 10g 3/4x7 O'Neal               |          |       |\n| Received Mary Wentworth           |          | 59    |\n\nTerms\u2014All Accounts Rendered Monthly and Are Due When Rendered.

This report has now been received, and a copy is attached for your information.\n\nThere would appear to be sufficient justification for the extension of the electric light system to include Katzie School, and I would recommend that the amount involved in having this done be authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O.Box444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDecember 2, 1938.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read Departmental letter 152-12-5 of November 19th last with reference to the proposed electric light installation at the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency. I also visited the school yesterday for a routine inspection, and have discussed the matter with Mr. Indian Agent Daunt.\n\nThe B.C.Provincial Department of Education has never as far as I know discouraged the use of electric lighting in Provincial day schools; but on the other hand has encouraged its proper use in an effort to prevent harm to the eyes of the children attending such schools in such places as the electric light was available.\n\nThere would be only a very small expenditure for the replacement of electric light bulbs, of which only six are I find necessary. There should be four drop lights each of 150 watts in the schoolroom, one of 60 watts in the entrance hall and one of 60 watts over the porch.\n\nExtra windows were placed in this school to improve the lighting, which they did, but on dull winter days the schoolroom is rather dark and there is a strain on the pupils' eyes in working from material on the boards.\n\nThe charge for connection to the B.C.Electric Power Lines is more or less nominal as in any case the lines will be passing very near the school house. One dollar a month minimum charge for current, itself very reasonable, would be the largest expense in connection with the proper lighting of this small school.\n\nI would recommend that the electric light be installed as recommended by the Indian Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nNovember 19, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to providing electricity in the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nI understand that some of the Provincial Departments of Education discourage the use of electric light in day schools. It increases the fire hazard and in addition there is generally a considerable expenditure for replacement of electric light bulbs.\n\nI note from your letter that the Katzie School is inadequately lighted. Possibly something could be done to improve the school in this regard. Before deciding to install electricity I should appreciate it if you would give the matter further consideration and let me have your opinion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, in which it is suggested that the Katzie Indian Day School be provided with electric light. The proposal has been discussed with Capt. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, who expressed himself as strongly in favor of Mr. Daunt's suggestion. The cost of installation would be $135.00, and the minimum fixed current charge would be $1.00 per month. The circumstances outlined by Mr. Daunt and Capt. Barry are such that I consider an expenditure warranted here, and I would recommend the proposal for favorable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl\nDM/AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe British Columbia Electric Railway Company are putting in a Light and Power line from the village of Hammond to Mr. Chatwin's farm, which lies to the west of the Katzie No. 1, Indian Reserve, upon which we maintain an Indian Day School.\n\nThis line passes a short distance from the school, and I was wondering whether the Department would care to take advantage of the fact, to provide satisfactory lighting in the building. Apart from the understood question of adequate light during the dark winter afternoons, this school is not particularly well lighted at any time, and I think Captain Barry will agree with me, that there are or will be, a number of ordinary winter days, when artificial light over the blackboards would be an advantage.\n\nFor your information, I checked up the cost of connection, with the B.C.Electric, and am told that this will amount to $125.00. This includes the line from the school to the Power Line right-of-way on the Dyke, nine lights in the school, being four on the blackboards, two in the school-room, one in the store-room, one in the hall-way, and one on the porch. The inside wiring would be done in conduit pipes, as is required in public buildings. Switches are also covered by the quotation.\n\nThe minimum charge for current would be $1.00 per month.\n\nAs this line had not been considered by the Company at the time our Estimates went in, I made no provision for such an expense, but am now bringing it to your attention, in case the Department may consider such service beneficial to the school, and well-being of the pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner, for B.C.A.T.N.Daunt,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs., (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-5, part 1)\nP.O.Box 444  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nNovember 2, 1938.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nP.O.Box 70, B.C.  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read Mr. Daunt's letter 1-8-E dated October 28th last with reference to the provision of adequate lighting at the Katzle Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency.\n\nI may say that I certainly do agree with Mr. Daunt that the above mentioned school is not well lighted at any time and particularly in winter, when it is quite difficult to make use of the Blackboards during the afternoon session.\n\nThe usual method of lighting a country schoolroom is by means of four drop lights placed some distance from each corner and about over the outside rows of desks. Such lights are better than any special lighting near the actual Blackboards, and the desk tops are thus properly illuminated.\n\nMay I suggest to Indian Agent Daunt and the Department that the provision of what is called SIGHT SAVING CHALK a new product in which a little yellow pigment is introduced into the ordinary hard blackboard crayon would make it much easier for the children to read the work on the Blackboards, particularly if the electric light is brought into the school.\n\nI am very strongly in favour of the Indian Agent's suggestion that the above school be connected with the B.C.Electric mains and the light used by the teacher when necessary. The cost appears to me to be very reasonable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry  \nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs., (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-5, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nOctober 6th, 1938.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 484-11-10, amounting to $5.00 in favour of James Adams, Katzie Indian Day School, Port Hammond, B.C., for Removal of School toilet at the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Sub-Allocation No. 78-11-699.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\n\nIndian Affairs., (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-5, part 1)\nKatzik Indian Reserve,\nPort Hammond B.C.\nDec. 1, 1938.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn account with Andrew James\nfor transportation of children across the\nKawartha River to the Katzik Day School on\nthe following dates:\n\nNov. 4th\nNov. 7th to 10th inclusive\nNov. 14th to 18th inclusive\n\nTotal of 17 days @ $1.00 per day\n\nNov. 22nd to 25th inclusive\nNov. 28th to 30th inclusive\n\nSeventeen dollars $17.00\n\nAndrew James\nO.K.

It has been renovated and answers the purpose fairly well. It makes a fair class-room.\n\nThe windows drop from the top, making it possible to ventilate the room.\n\nOne of the Indians loaned his Organ to the school. This is quite a contribution to the school.\n\nThere are two toilets and a playground. The school has a flag.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.)\n\nMiss Coughlan does excellent work. She wins the confidence and good-will of her pupils. The tone of the school is splendid. Her teaching is scientific and systematic.\n\nThe pupils read with expression. They spell accurately. They are taught to add without counting. The tables are learned and used. The simple rules are applied to practical problems. The class-room work is very satisfactory.\n\nPhysical exercise is practised, but so far it is difficult to get them to enter into it with any degree of enthusiasm. Pupils are lined up outside and marched into school in an orderly manner. They also go out orderly.\n\nThis is another Day School that justifies its existence. I am pleased with the work. Here again the main factor in the success of the work is an interested and trained teacher. Sometimes a trained teacher fails to make good; sometimes a teacher who has not been trained makes good. There is certainly a wide difference in these two classes. I would be pleased to see our schools in the hands of trained teachers.\nInspector's Report on the Katzie (Day) Indian School situated on Katzie Reserve New Westminster Agency\n\nDecember 13, 1915\n\nNumber of pupils present: 10 Boys, 3 Girls, 7 Number of children of school age on the Reserve: 15 Boys, 6 Girls, 9 Number of children claimed by teacher to be of his own Faith: 15 Number of children that should attend this school: 15 Number of children enrolled: 14, being 93 per cent of those that should attend.

This is her first school.\n\nMiss Coughlan is a bright girl. She is very sympathetic toward these Indian children. She is an excellent teacher. Her work is satisfactory. Her methods are modern and the pupils are making progress.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES.\n\nThe pass room is an Indian house. It has been repaired since my last visit. The ceiling has been painted, and heavy building paper will be put on the walls at once. It has been very much improved. The windows drop from the top. There is also good light.\n\nThere is one toilet with two apartments. These are sanitary. There is lime to be used as a disinfectant. There is a good playground.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.)\n\nI visited some of the homes and talked with the parents. They are pleased with Miss Coughlan and are prepared to co-operate with her. In this way good results are attained.\n\nThe Indians have brought an Organ from one of their homes to the class room. The pupils are learning to sing. They sang two pieces. They did well. Their voices are musical and it was surprising how well they did.\n\nTwo of the pupils are in the Second Reader. They read, spell, add, and write well. They are also doing some crayon work. The general knowledge is satisfactory. These pupils have good English, due largely to the fact that the parents use English in the homes.\n\nI hope Miss Coughlan may remain on after Christmas. She can get higher wages in a Public School. She is doing such excellent work and is so interested in the Indian children. I should like to see her remain. Perhaps an increase of $5.00 per month would decide her to remain.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will therefore understand why my report did not reach you earlier in May.\n\nSix schools were inspected before I went to the interior of the Province.These I am forwarding to-day.The others I will send with my May report.\n\nHerewith,I enclose report of inspection of the following schools:-\n1.Squamish Boarding School.\n2.Sechelt Boarding School.\n3.Sliammon Day School.\n4.Homalco Day School.\n5.St.Mary's Boarding School.\n6.Katsie Day School.\n\nThere is also a Special report concerning Manual Training for the boys of the Sechelt Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES.\n\nThe building is not up to date.

He thinks his pupils do excellent work. He says they compare favorably with pupils in rural schools.\n\nThis school is situated about one mile from the village of Hammond through which passes the main line of the C.B.R.\n\nIt is only a few hundred yards from the Ripper River.\n\nThis school is progressing and in a few years the pupils will stand out well.\n\nI would like to see trained teachers taking the place of untrained teachers.\n\nWhen changes are made every effort should be made to get trained teachers. Normal he would be very much more efficient.\n\nIn fact he would be a splendid teacher.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES.\n\nThe building has been so improved that the class-room is now a fairly good one.\n\nAt the time of my visit the room was warm and comfortable. The windows were down from the top. The air in the room was excellent.\n\nOne of the Indians brought his organ to school for the use of the teacher in practising singing and calisthenics.\n\nThere are two toilets in good condition.\n\nA flag pole has been erected, the flag was floating in the breezes.\n\nThere is a playground.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.)\n\nMiss Coughlan does excellent work. She is sympathetic and the pupils respond to her efforts. Her teaching is systematic, persistent, and scientific.\n\nSinging and calisthenics are practised.

It has been there for nearly two years.\n\nI was pleased to see the British flag floating in the breeze as I approached the school.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.)\n\nA little girl, Bertha Johnson, died February the 6th, 1920. She was six years of age. She had stomach trouble. This was the only death during the winter. There has been no epidemic among the pupils. Some four or five had colds at the time of my visit which accounts for the number absent.\n\nThe Department pays to some Doctors a sum of money annually. Many of these Doctors are conveniently located and should be asked to visit any schools in the territory in their jurisdiction. There should be at least one visit each year and a thorough examination of all the pupils. I most respectfully recommend this policy to the careful consideration of the Department.\n\nI found Doctor Wilson of Alert Bay doing this work very thoroughly. His idea was that when a weakness was discovered in a pupil, to follow it up and apply the remedy.\n\nOne of the pupils read an Address in which it is declared that this Band appreciates what the Department has done in giving them a school. \"We desire that you convey to the Indian Department our devotion and loyalty to the Government of CANADA.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

The parents are interested in the progress of the children though not to any very great extent. I went into the question of the number of children who are of school age and who should attend, and found that, on the statements made by the teacher, all the children with perhaps one exception were attending school.\n\nThe average attendance for the quarter ending March 1932 was 8.71\nQuarter ending June 1932 was 9.41\nQuarter ending September 1932 was 9.68\n\nClassification:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| 1B    | 1    | 0     | 1     |\n| 2A    | 1    | 0     | 1     |\n| 2B    | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| 4B    | 1    | 2     | 3     |\n| 5B    | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n\nTotals: 6 5 11\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY: Satisfactory.\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION: As above.\n\nPRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF FURNITURE: Very Good except that desks should have been placed on strips about 3 in. by 1 in. and not on 2 in. by 4 in.\n\nCARE OF MATERIAL: Very Good.\n\nCLEANLINESS of Pupils: Fair.\ndo School-house: Very Good.\n\nOBEEDIENCE: Very Good.\n\nCONDUCT of Pupils in School: Very Good.\ndo out of School: Very Good.\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nInventory.\u2014Teacher's Desk 1 Desks 25 Benches 0 Chairs 0\nCupboards 1 Blackboards 24 Stoves 1 Stovepipes 1 Washbasins 1\nBrooms 1 Axes 1 Soup 11 Towels 3 Pails 1\nDrinking Cups 18 Looking-glasses 1 Other equipment Maps & Globe 1\n\nSince my last report a wire for the flag pole has been obtained. The Union Jack was flying while I was inspecting the school. The New Corona Catholic Readers have been supplied since the last report.\n\nNew Equipment Required:\u2014\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspectors will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nThe buildings belong to the Department. They consist of a school house and two toilets, with a small shed for coal and wood.\n\nThere is a leak in the school-house roof; this should of course be repaired. I understand that some time ago the Indian Agent had some work done on the roof, but this does not seem to have been entirely successful. I have not seen the Indian Agent for some time and he has not been made aware of any part of this report.\n\nAs recommended last year the inside plaster of the schoolroom and halls should be realkalsioned. The schoolroom is kept perfectly clean. The teacher varnished the desks since my last report.\n\nThe Boys' Toilet has been repaired since my last report.\n\nThe teacher has recommenced the inside of the windows with the help of one of the children. She bought the material herself, and in my opinion should be highly commended for her efforts to keep the school buildings in a sanitary condition.\n\nReport on School Work Continued.\n\nReading: Grade 1B. The teacher taught a lesson from the Blackboard and from the Every Day Ornament Primer. This lesson was well taught. The children used markers. Their reading is too much of the \"word for word\" type. The class has been working through Reading Work Book for Beginners. On the whole their work is \"Very Satisfactory.\"\n\nGrade 2 are reading slowly from the Corona Primer 1.\n\nGrade 3 are reading well from the Corona Reader Book 2 Part 1 Page 68.\n\nGrade 4 are at Page 450 of Part B of the Corona Reader Book 3 and Grade 5 are at Page 51 of Part 1 of the Corona Reader Book 3.\n\nThe Reading of the school is much better than the Arithmetic.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nSpelling: The Grades from 2 to 5 were tested with the Morrison McCall Scale.\n\nGrade 2 made a Mid Score of 8 which is the Norm for a Grade 1.5.\n\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 20, which is the Norm for a Grade 2.\n\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 27, which is the Norm for a Grade 3.1.\n\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 33, which is the Norm for a Grade 5.1.\n\nArt Work: This has been entirely ruined as far as colour is concerned by the poor paints supplied by the Department to this school. These cheap inferior paints are not permitted in most schools.\n\nA very simple paint box is all that is required. Reeves' New Watercolour Box No. 61 is by far the best for our schools. Spectrum Refills may easily be obtained for the New Box, which originally costs retail about $4.00 per Dozen.\n\nControl: The teacher's control of the class is \"Good\".\n\nGeneral: The teacher has small bright curtains at the sides of the windows. The schoolroom is well heated, clean, and bright, and suitable small pictures and cut-outs are displayed on the walls.\n\nI certainly consider this a very satisfactory small school, at which satisfactory standards, with the exception of Arithmetic, are being maintained.\n\nVery good Reading and Number Charts have been constructed by the teacher as a result of her course at Summer School. The teacher keeps a Time Table and Preview.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP.O.

Experience of three years teaching in Vancouver and two years in this school.\n\nHealth: Excellent health.\n\nSuccess: Small but successful school.\n\nSuggestions: This teacher has made many excellent suggestions at the last inspection. The arithmetic books recommended by the last report have been obtained, and the various charts made by the teacher. The teacher has taken much trouble over these charts and some are very good indeed.\n\nThe school is quite definitely below the required standard in the subject of handwriting. Attention should be given special attention to this subject during the next year.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nReading: The Grade 2 children are at different places in the second Canadian Readers. The children seem willing and their reading is good. Grade 4 are at Page 110 of the Fourth Canadian Reader; Grade 5 are at Page 100 of the Fifth Reader. All these children speak with neither soft nor loud voices. The reading is, however, satisfactory.\n\nWriting: This is good in all grades.\n\nHandwriting: Much better than last year's. The general design work of the children has been made less effective by the use of the very inferior paint boxes just supplied to this school. It is quite impossible to teach any colour work with such inferior material, the use of which would not be permitted by any teacher in a B.C. Provincial School.\n\nSIGNATURE OF INSPECTOR: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only.\n\nForm No. 142\nATTENDANCE PROBLEM, REMEDIES SUGGESTED, Etc.\n\nThe attendance continues to be fair.\nThe parents are anxious that their children should make progress at school.\nThe average attendance on the past three months was as follows:\n\nQuarter ending March 1931: 8.49\nQuarter ending June 1931: 7.10\nQuarter ending December 1931: 6.75\n\nClassification:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| 1     | 1    | 1     |\n| 2     | 1    | 1     |\n| 3     | 1    | 1     |\n| Total | 3    | 3     |\n\nRegister: The register of pupils is properly kept.\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY: satisfactory.\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION: above; the grading is satisfactory.\n\nPRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT of Furniture: very good.\n\nCARE OF MATERIAL: very good.\n\nCLEANLINESS of Pupils: good.\ndo School-house: very good.\n\nOBEYANCE: very good.\n\nCONDUCT of Pupils in School: very good.\ndo out of School: very good.\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nPlease indicate what classroom equipment should be supplied.\n\nINVENTORY.\u2014Teacher's Desk: 1\nDesks: 25\nBenches: 0\nChairs: 2\nCupboards: 1\nBlackboards: 2\nStoves: 1\nStovepipes: 1 set\nWashbasins: 1\nBrooms: 2\nAxes: 2\nSoap: -\nTowels: -\nPails: -\nDrinking Cups: 4\nLooking-glasses: 1\nOther equipment: maps: 6; globe: 1.\n\nThe list of Texts and Work Books recommended during my inspection is given on the first page of this report. Owing to instructions received since my inspection, I have now to cancel the New Corona readers.\n\nThe school has a flag and has obtained a new wire for the flag pole. The fixing of the wire on the pole is being attended to when this is done the flag will be flown on days when the school is in session.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-6, part 1)\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspectors will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nThe buildings belong to the Department. They consist of a school house and two toilets, with a small shed for coal or wood.\n\nThe schoolroom is in very good condition. The inside plaster of the schoolroom and halls should be repainted this summer.\n\nThe woodwork of the interior appears to be in very good condition.\n\nThe ventilation is excellent. The lighting is very good.\n\nThe toilets were clean when I inspected them.\n\nThe door of the boys' toilet was off its hinges and resting against the wall of the toilet. A few minutes work and the use of some large screws might remedy this state of things. One of the adult Indians could very easily do this repair work, if so instructed by the Indian agent.\n\nReport on School Work Continued.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 2 have finished the Combinations & separations. They have also worked through the Hexagons, and are working at addition and subtraction.\n\nGrade 4 are about finished the work on the multiplication table in their new book, Sheffield's Practical Arithmetic.\n\nGrades 5 & 6 are at work in the second book of the New Canadian Arithmetic by Sheffield and Sons. None of these children in Grades 4, 5, & 6 were able to give any answers to simple tests. This was very evident when the children were ranked with the All Canada Tests. In this test Grade 4 made a mid score of 10, the norm being 20. Grade 5 made a mid score of 15, the norm for the Grade being 30. Grade 6 made a mid score of 21, the norm for the Grade being 31.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nSinging: No singing is taught in this school.\n\nSpelling: The Morrison School Scale was used in testing the spelling. Grade 2 made a mid score of 11, which is the norm for Grade 2. Grade 4 made a mid score of 20, which is the norm for a Grade 4. Grade 6 made a mid score of 31, which is the norm for a Grade 6. It will be seen from the above results that the spelling of the school is about normal.\n\nControl: The teacher's control of the class was good.\n\nGeneral: The teacher has a small bright curtain at the side of each window. The schoolroom is well heated, clean and bright, with suitable small pictures on the walls. I consider this to be a very satisfactory little school, at which normal standards, with the exception of that in arithmetic, are being maintained. The teacher will give extra attention to the arithmetic before the next inspection.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arithmetic continues to be a weak subject. The teacher is much interested in the progress of the children and is very active in everything that is for their welfare.\n\nSuggestions Much more attention should be given to Arithmetic, in so far as this subject is taught in the Primary Grades. The children in Grades 3 to 5 have improved somewhat in this subject since the last inspection.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nArithmetic Grade 1B can read and write the numbers to 5. They have no knowledge of the Combinations and Separations. These should be started at once. The teacher has been so informed. Grade 1A are working the Combinations and Separations to 12. This work is \"Good\". Grade 2 is working with Grade 3 at Multiplication to the tens of 5's Grade 4 is working Long Division and Grade 5 is doing Fractions. In the All Canada Test in the Fundamentals, Grade 3 made a Mid Score of 8, the Norm for this Grade being 8. Grade 4 made a Mid Score of 12, the Norm being 10. Grade 5 made a Mid Score of 12, the Norm being 12. Grade 3 is slow, and it will be seen that Grade 4 is \"Weak\" in this subject.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

The floor of the woodshed is in poor repair; but repairs to this are not absolutely necessary at the present time.\n\nThe inside of the school should most certainly be reeked out.\nThis has been recommended previously in my reports of February and November 1932. From a health point of view if from no other this reeked outing should be carried out during the summer vacation of this year, 1934.\nThe teacher has done her best to keep this school in a sanitary condition as reported last year. She even bought material herself to kalsomine the interior of the toilets, as has been previously reported.\n\nThe school is in other respects in a satisfactory state of repair, and the toilets are clean.\n\nThe Rev.

Gillen O.M.I., the Principal of the Mission Residential School, and the new representative of the Oblate Order for the various Missions and Catholic Schools of the Archdiocese of Vancouver drove me to the Ketia Day School, and was present during my inspection.\nI was anxious to have him actually with me during an inspection of a Day School so that he would be in a position to understand my methods of inspecting such schools. He had spent some considerable time with me during the inspection of the Mission Residential School, and I am very glad to have had the cooperation of the Rev. Father Gillen in this work.\n\nGeneral Condition of Schoolrooms:\nThe teacher has small bright curtains at the sides of the windows.\nThe schoolroom is well heated, clean and bright. Suitable small pictures and cut outs are displayed on the walls.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nReading: Grade 1B are reading at Page 12 of the Primer Two Little Indians, and are making use of the Work Book, Joe and Ruth and ordinary Flash Cards. These children speak well; but do not know very many words yet, possibly only about 50.\nGrade 1A are at Page 28 of the Corona Primer II. They have read several primers and can read quite well for such a Grade.\nGrade 2 can read in a fairly manner from Book 1 of the Corona Readers.\nGrade 3 have finished the Corona Reader for this Grade and are at work on the Third Canadian Reader. Grade 5B are reading well from Book 3 of the Corona series. Reading Exercise Work Books in Silent Reading are used.\n\nSpelling: The spelling of the children is very good.\n\nIn the Buckingham Ayres' Test the following results were obtained:\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 65% the Norm for the Grade being 60%.\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 100% the Norm for the Grade being 75%.\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 100% the Norm for that Grade being 90%.\n\nWriting: This is well taught.\n\nLanguage: The Work Books in English Usage and Composition are in daily use.\n\nGeography: Grade 5 are using the Geography For Juniors, Etc.\n\nMental Ages and I.Q.'s: These have been tested by the teacher and are found to be below the average. I.Q.'s range between 64 and 96, the average being between 76 and 80.\n\nControl: The teacher's control of the class is very good indeed.\n\nThe school seems to be very well conducted, and satisfactory progress is being made in the school work.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a letter dated January 26th, instant, received from Inspector Gerald H. Barry, together with his report of inspection on December 15th, ultimo, of the Katsie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, B.C.\n\nIn regard to the proposed expenditures it should be pointed out that in the Agency Estimates of 1934-35 under the heading of \"Indian Education\" we included an item of the sum of $500.00 for repairs to three Day Schools, viz:- the Chehalis, the Katsie and Skwah Schools, and it is presumed that if the services mentioned by the Inspector are to be installed the Department will give the necessary directions to the Indian Agent to proceed with the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAttendance problems: remedies suggested. Etc.\n\nThe attendance is satisfactory. There has been some illness among the pupils as in most of the schools this year. This has probably held the work back a little. The children attend too many \"Picture Shows\" and are often up far too late at night, the teacher informs me. The average attendance is small, but the percentage attendance is quite good as will be seen from the statements tabulated below:\n\n| ATTENDANCE FOR QUARTER ENDING |\n|-------------------------------|\n| School Year | 1934-35 | 1935-36 | 1936-37 |\n| September   | 7.86    | 10.57   | 8.61    |\n| December    | 8.25    | 9.52    | 8.88    |\n| March       | 8.60    | 5.55    |         |\n| June        | 6.72    | 5.46    |         |\n\nPRESENT CLASSIFICATION\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| 6A    | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n| 4A    | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n| 4B    | 2    | 0     | 2     |\n| 2B    | 2    | 0     | 2     |\n| 1B    | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| 1C    | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| Totals:- | 6    | 4     | 10    |\n\nIn addition one Non Indian, a boy, attends in Grade 1C. His mother is I understand an Indian living on the Indian Reserve, while his father is stated to have been a \"White Man\". This boy is not included in the above averages.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThe schoolroom was perfectly clean, and obvious effort had been made to have it as neat as in the past though my visit was a great surprise to teacher and children. It was much better arranged than on the occasion of my last visit. The teacher's desk and those of the pupils are now properly arranged. The children were cleaner than on the occasion of my last visit. Their clothes were fair.\n\nThe whole school was much better organized and the teacher is doing her best to comply with the instructions of Indian Affairs Branch whether given in correspondence from Ottawa or suggested by myself during inspections.\n\nThe Vocational Training must be developed in this little school. I have asked the teacher to do her best in this direction. She will probably take a special course this summer in Arts and Crafts suitable for her work here. The girls are with the exception of two quite young. The older children have again taken up sewing as recommended at the time of my last inspection. Aprons have been made and some shoulder and a skirt is being made on some plain dresses this week.\n\nThe teacher's work on Posters is very good and there are a number of good teaching posters on display.\n\nOn the whole I am much better pleased with the work being done here. The Letter from the Chief of the Training Division helped greatly, and the teacher is doing her best. The necessary promotions at the end of June were gone into with the greatest care and the teacher will follow my advice I am certain. She made notes during the inspection. The standing of the school is \"Fair\".\n\nSechelt, B.C.\nMarch 16, 1937.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nOttawa, December 8, 1936.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Katzic Indian Day School on the 19th ultimo. We are pleased to note from this report that you have always made an effort to carry out any suggestions made to you by the Inspector. However, it appears that, in order to obtain the best results, it will be necessary for you to properly organize the school work and to follow a definite time table.\n\nMr. Barry is being directed to again visit your school before the close of the academic year, and, at that time, it is hoped that he will be able to report a decided improvement, specially in the reduction of the number of sub grades and in the teaching of all subjects on the curriculum. If there are any books that you consider might be of assistance to you, please let me know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Mary Winter,\nTeacher,\nKatzic Indian Day School,\nPort Hammond, B.C.\nOttawa, December 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, enclosing report regarding your inspection of the Katzie Indian Day School on the 19th ultimo, the Department has carefully considered the information concerning the teacher. Miss Winter is being written along the lines suggested on Page 3 of your report.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I consider it would be advisable for you to arrange to visit this school again before the end of the academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., covering his report of inspection on the 19th instant of the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, which I inspected on November 19th last.\n\nI am certainly sorry not to be able to give this little school a better report, but just now things do not seem to me to be very satisfactory there.\n\nI called on Mr. Indian Agent Daunt on my way back to Vancouver from the school, and discussed a number of important educational matters with reference to the schools in his Agency. He was busy and I had not much time at my disposal and we did not discuss this little Indian Day School in any very great detail, only in broad outline. I do not think that the Indian Agent can help much here in any case.\n\nIf the Department approves I shall make every effort to again inspect this school around Easter time, but it will be understood I know that it is impossible to carry out second inspections of all the schools through lack of time, and I must go north immediately after Easter to visit the Nags, Queen Charlotte Islands Etc. A second Inspector of Schools is very badly needed but till one can be appointed I am trying to carry out the duties as well as circumstances will allow. I particularly do not wish to hear of any dismissal of the teacher in this case if I can do anything further to help.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON KATZIE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nRoman Catholic Church New Westminster Agency.\n\nDate of inspection: November 13th 1936.\n\nNumber of pupils present: 7 Boys and 4 Girls. Total 11.\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 23 single desks and two rear sections.\n\nName of teacher: Miss Mary Winter Age 30.\n\nHealth: Very Good.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teachers:\n\nMiss Winter was trained in the Vancouver Normal School, and holds a B.C. Permanent Second Class Certificate, and in addition Provincial Summer School certificates in Rural and Indian Work 1932 & 1934 and Primary Work and Elocution 1934. Since last inspection she again attended the Provincial Summer School in Victoria taking the courses in Primary Work, and Reading and Language 1936.\n\nMiss Winter was shown in detail what should be taken up in each Grade in Reading when I was here in October 1935, but she has permitted her anxiety for the progress of the pupils to lead her into the mistake of having so many Grades and Sub Grades that she has become confused and discouraged. She has in fact tried individual instruction which is quite hopeless in such a school as this.\n\nThere was in fact much confusion when I attempted to find out the actual Grade of each child.\n\nI spent some time in again outlining what was to be done in each Grade and asked that the Grades should be grouped together rather than separated.\n\nMiss Winter has a very nice manner with the children. She is much loved by them. She took notes of my suggestions and will I think attempt to do more class teaching in place of the individual work she has tried during the past year.\n\nHer experience now extends to some nine years, the first three of which were spent as a Substitute in Vancouver City Schools and the last six in this school.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of pupils:\n\nReading: Grade 1C know some ten words BUT ONE HAS FINISHED TWO Little Indians. Grade 1B have finished Two Little Indians and the Corona Primer 1 and are at DIFFERENT places in Friday. The work done by the above Grade 1B & 1C children is \"good\" but they are all working at different places. Grade 2 are nearly finished Corona Primer 2. They should be reading Book 1 of the same series and will go on to this as soon as possible. They rather sing out the words, but in other respects read well. Grade 3 are quite good and read from Corona Reader Book 2. Grade 4 has finished Corona Book 2 and read Highroads Book 4 while Grade 6 has started Corona Reader Book 4 and reads Highroads Readers Book 6 as supplementary. The children all speak out well, and the reading is above the average, in many cases quite good.\n\nThe Reading Exercise Work Books are used with some success.\n\nGeography: This has not been taught regularly lately. The teacher has got so mixed up with her many classes that she has not had time to teach this subject as suggested. She will start now however.\n\nSinging: None done this term. This will be taken up now in preparation for a Christmas entertainment.\nArithmetic: Grade 1C are reading and writing the numbers to 9 and recognizing Groups to 8. Grade 1B are doing \"Satisfactory\" work in the Combinations and Separations to 6. Grade 2 can Add and Subtract with Borrowing and Carrying, BUT ARE NOT AT SAME PLACE IN THIS. Grade 3 have finished Short Multiplication and Division, know the Multiplication Tables to times 12 and are starting Long Multiplication. There work is very good indeed. Grade 4 is doing Long Multiplication and Long Division. They are a little better than average. Grade 6 works Decimals. The whole of the Arithmetic, which was greatly improved when I last inspected here, is now well above the average. Tested with the All Canada Scale:\n\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 13.5, the Norm being only 7\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 22, the Norm being 18\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 29 which is the Norm for the Grade.\n\nSpelling: This was tested by the Buckingham Ayres Scale. Twenty words were dictated from Columns \"L\" \"M\" and \"N\" for Grades 2 while Grades 2 and 3 wrote twenty words from Columns \"F\" \"G\" & \"H\".\n\nGrade 2 made a Mid Score of 85%, the Norm being 84% June\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 80%, the June 1937 Norm 94%\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 100% the June 1937 Norm 84%\n\nVocational Training: The sewing done as a rule in this school has not been started yet.\n\nThe teacher tells me it will now be undertaken.\n\nGeneral As will be obvious from the above the Time Table is not being followed, is not perhaps in existence for I did not see one which would work. I have tried to help, but the teacher must organize the Grades and her own work herself. I have made many suggestions and outlined work. The Grades must be combined in several places. The teacher is worried as she is unable to get through the necessary work. I told her to do some Class Teaching even if some pupils have to repeat and some to go on as fast as they can. They must be brought together again. Some good Posters have been made by the teacher but these were badly displayed if displayed at all, some were under cover. The desks were badly arranged and have been so placed since my last visit. I suggested many changes. Even the teacher's desk had been moved into about the worst possible place in the room to give room for FOLK DANCES and PHYSICAL EDUCATION, which should be taken outside when the weather is good.\n\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, Etc.\n\nThe parents allow their children to stay up late, attend \"Picture Shows\" or so the teacher considers. The average attendance is small.\n\nQuarter ending September 1934 September 1935 Sept. 1936.\n7.66 10.57 8.61\nDecember 1934 December 1935\n8.25 9.58\nMarch 1935 March 1936\n8.60 5.55\nJune 1935 June 1936\n6.72 5.46\n\nClassification:\nGrade: Boys: Girls: Total:\n6A 0 1 1\n4A 0 1 1\n3A 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2\n1B 1 1 2\n1C 1 1 2\nTotal 7 4 11\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nWhile the schoolroom was perfectly clean it was not as neat as on former visits.\n\nThe children were not very clean. Some did not appear to have washed for some time.\n\nThe Junior Red Cross is supposed to be active here. It is obviously not active enough.\n\nThe Vocational Training has fallen off badly.\n\nThe children are still very obedient and their conduct in school is very good indeed, with one or two exceptions. In these cases I feel that the teacher is losing some of her control. One big girl was chewing gum till I told her to put it away. The teacher is to some extent losing grip on herself, and working with the large number of sub Grades which she has made herself, she feels she can hardly get through the essential work, and thus leaves out the most important things such as Vocational Training to make time for non essentials like Folk Dances.\n\nThe children are not so much backward as disorganized. Their Arithmetic and Reading are in general good, and they are fair in spelling and writing.\n\nI believe that it will be necessary for me to pay another visit to this school in April, previous to leaving for the Prince Rupert and Nass districts.\n\nIn the mean time I should be glad if the Department would consider with care this report and compare it with previous ones on this school, the reports of the Indian Agent, etc., etc. If thought suitable perhaps a letter might be sent to Miss Winter warning her that she must organize her work better and follow a definite Time Table. She might perhaps be told that her school will again be inspected during the present school year, and that a very great change for the better is looked for, particularly in the arrangement of her room, in the reduction of the number of Sub Grades, and the actual teaching of the subjects other than Reading and arithmetic. I think some improvement might be made in the attendance if the teacher visited the Indians and insisted that the children come to school.\n\nI should be glad to hear from the Department as to what they would wish me to do in this case.\n\nMiss Winter is a very nice girl, with a good teaching voice and manner. The children are fond of her and she is most anxious to do all possible for the Indians. I should be very sorry indeed if the school had to be closed or if it were decided to replace her here, as I think she is a great influence for good on the Reserve.\n\nIn addition I may say that Miss Winter has always made an effort to follow my suggestions, if not in their entirety, at least to some extent. Just at the moment she appears to have lost hold on the work.\n\nPowell River, B.C.\nNovember 20, 1926.\n\nGerald H.

The attendance is small, though possibly increasing very slightly. I could not recommend the closing of the school at the present time. Even if all the children could be accommodated at a Residential School, which is I believe out of the question, the cost of their education and keep would be more than the cost of operating this little school.\n\nMiss Winter has a very good manner with the children and is I am certain a factor for the general advancement of the Indians on this rather out of the way Reserve. I should be very sorry if it was found necessary to close this little school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nCHD/\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON KATZIE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nNew Westminster Agency.\n\nDate of Inspection: October 25, 1925.\nNumber of pupils present: 5 Boys & 7 Girls; Total 12.\nNumber of classrooms: One.\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 32 Single Desks with two Rear Sections in addition.\n\nName of teacher: Miss Mary Winter\nAge: 32.\nHealth: Very Good.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nThis teacher is very much interested in the progress of the children, and is very active in everything that is for their welfare. Miss Winter was trained in the Vancouver Normal School, and holds a B.C. Teachers' Second Class Certificate, and in addition Provincial Summer School certificates in Rural & Indian Work 1922 and 1924, and Primary Work, and Education, 1924. For three years she was a substitute teacher in Vancouver City Schools, and she has been here for five years.\n\nMiss Winter has taken advantage of the Demonstration Lessons taught during previous inspections of this school, and has very greatly improved the standing of her pupils in Arithmetic, during the present visit to the school, the teacher explained that she was having difficulty in the organization of the Instruction in Reading. I therefore made a very complete outline for her of the Reading to be covered in the various Grades, particularly the Primary Grades. I then demonstrated the corresponding Arithmetic to be taught in the various Sub Grades of Grades 1 and 2. Miss Winter was good enough to say that this work would help her greatly. Her general methods are quite satisfactory, and she has very good control of the children.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of pupils:\n\nReading: Grade 10 know about a dozen Sight Words. They have been taught from the Board. I have asked the teacher to start on The Little Indian as soon as possible. There is no Grade 1B at present. Grade 1A have finished The Little Indians, and are starting Corona Primer 1. They are backward as they should be, finished the above Corona Primer and are starting the Corona Reader C, they are 8 year old children and can read The Little Indians quite well. Grade 2B are very backward as they have only finished Corona Primer 1 and the Highlands Primer. I have asked the teacher to get them to the prescribed Corona Book 1 as soon as possible. Grade 2 have finished Corona Reader Book 1 and Highlands Reader Book C. They have also completed the texts studied. They will have to go back to Corona Reader Book A and Highlands Readers Books E and F for these children, are ready otherwise for Grade A. Grade 3 have successfully completed Corona Reader Book E and Highlands Reader Book F. They are ready for the work of Grade C. The teacher explained that she was much discouraged with the Reading. In reply, I explained that all that was wrong was that she had got this subject rather disorganized and that the children could read quite well. I helped her to recognize this work through the Grades.\n\nArt: Not much done as yet this year.\n\nLiterature and History: Satisfactory. The Work Books are being used.\nReport on Katzina Indian Day School Continued. Page 2.\n\n**Geography:** The Canadian Geography for Juniors, B.C. Edition and the Work Books are in use. Satisfactory work is being done. General work in Geography is being done in the Junior Grades the Dent Geography Readers being used.\n\n**Arithmetic:** Grade 1C are just beginning to read and to write numbers. Grade 1A are good in working the Combinations and Operations to about 10. Grade 2 are starting the Extensions. They are able to work formal Addition and Subtraction without carrying or borrowing, and are starting the more advanced work of the Grade. This is very satisfactory. Grade 2 are working Multiplication and Short Division to the times 4 table. They are above the average now in this subject. Grade 6 are at Decimals.\n\nIn the All Canada Test Grade 7 made a High Score of 10, the Norm for such a Grade at this time of the year being only 7. Grade 6 made a High Score of 9, the Norm in this case being 8. The whole of the Arithmetic has greatly improved during the past year.\n\nThe remaining subjects not reported on here are being properly taught.\n\n**Attendance Problem Remedies Suggested, Etc.**\n\nThe attendance is \"Satisfactory\". The parents are interested to some extent in the progress of the children. The children are somewhat sleepy in school. The teacher considers that the pupils are permitted by their parents to attend \"Picture Shows\" and to go to bed very late. Miss Winter is attending to this end trying to have the children get more sleep so that their school work may improve. The average attendance has been:\n\nQuarter ending September 1924 7.86 September 1925 10.57\nQuarter ending December 1924 8.05\nQuarter ending March 1925 9.60\nQuarter ending June 1925 8.78 (Berry Picking)\n\n**Classification:**\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| Grade 6 | 0    | 3     | 3     |\n| Grade 7 | 3    | 1     | 4     |\n| Grade 8 | 2    | 0     | 2     |\n| Grade 1A| 1    | 0     | 1     |\n| Grade 1C| 1    | 0     | 1     |\n| Totals | 7    | 5     | 12    |\n\n**General Remarks:**\n\nEverything about the school is neat and clean. There are a number of very good Reading Charts, Number Charts, and Colour and Health Charts on display. These have been made either by the teacher or the children. A proper wooden picture display rail or picture moulding has been placed on the walls to preserve the plaster. The Red Cross is active here. The girls are given some Vocational Training in the way of Sewing, Embroidery, Etc. Aprons etc., will be made a little later in the term. When the present Grade 7 children have been promoted to Grade 4B the classification of the children in the Grades will be quite satisfactory. The teacher has been doing very good work here. The children are obedient and clean, and their conduct in school has been \"Very Good\". The various points raised in this report have of course been discussed with the teacher, and Miss Winter has been given a number of suggestions which it is hoped will aid her in the school work.\n\nThe general standing of the school is \"Good\".\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nNovember 7, 1925.\nGerald H.

He spoke to the children, on my invitation, later. It was due to the kindness of Father Gillen that I was enabled to visit this little school. The weather was very bad and I could not have walked in from the nearest Stage stop. Father Gillen drove me in the Residential School automobile from the Indian Residential School, Mission, on the conclusion of my inspection there. He then took me on to the Devonshire Hotel, Vancouver.\n\nYou will notice that many of the items recommended in previous reports have now been authorized. The schoolroom has been reeked out, etc. I am sorry to have to report the dirty state of the schoolroom floor. I am informed that this will be put right by a thorough washing before the end of January.\n\nThe attendance at this school remains about the same from year to year. It is not large, but I believe that valuable work is being done by having a Day School on this Reserve, and I would not recommend that the school be closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

They have finished the two Corona Primers and some of the Corona Reader Book I. I advised that they finish the Corona Reader Book I by June. This Grade reads well and speaks out. Grade 6 has finished the Third Corona Reader and Book 4 of the Highroads series. They speak well and read in a very satisfactory manner. Reading Exercise Work Books are used from Grade 3 up to Grade 6. Children in Grades 3 and 5 were absent and I did not hear them read.\n\nSignature of Inspector Gerald H. Barry.\n\nNote\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only.\n\nForm No. 142CHB/ District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspectors will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nThe buildings belong to the Department.\nThey consist of a school house, two toilets, and a small shed for coal and wood.\nThe inside of the school has now been reclassified. A new door has been placed on the woodshed\u2014the school steps have been mended. There are small bright curtains at the side of the schoolroom windows. The roof of the school has been mended and covered with a coal oil and tar mixture.\nA wooden picture rail has been placed in the schoolroom to which drawings and other handwork exhibits are fixed to save the plaster of the walls.\nA First Aid cabinet has been placed on one of the schoolroom walls.\nThe display of Reading, Colour, Number, and other Charts was good.\nThe teacher has done everything possible to make the school attractive.\nThe toilets are in a perfectly clean state.\n\nI was accompanied on my inspection by the Rev. A. Gillen, O.M.I., the Principal of the Indian Residential School Mission, and the present representative of the Oblate Order for the Catholic Missions and Catholic Indian Day Schools of the Archdiocese of Vancouver.\nThe Reverend Father Gillen drove me from Mission to the Katzie School. The weather was very bad and I should not have been able to get in to this little school without his help.\nFather Gillen spoke to the children after my inspection. I was glad to have him with me during the inspection. He was enabled to contrast the work done at one of these little Day Schools and in the various Divisions of his own Residential School.\n\nChristmas Tree: The children had a Christmas Tree and small concert during the Christmas season.\n\nSchoolroom Floor: I am sorry to have to report that the floor of the school was in a very dirty condition. In my opinion this floor should be washed at the end of each two months, if not monthly.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1B are working at the Combinations and Separations up to Group 4 which means about to the number 8.\nGrade 1A are working the Combinations and separations to about 12.\nThe above work is \"Satisfactory\". Grade 2 can Add and Subtract.\nThere are to start on Multiplication shortly. Grade 6 are doing 9. The above work is rather better than was the case at my last inspection. I used the All Canada Test in the Fundamentals. Grade 6 made a Mid Score of 27, the Norm being 30. This is an average result. One of the children was a little weak, but on the whole the work appears to have been taught in a satisfactory manner.\n\nGeography: The Canadian Geography for Juniors B.C. Edition is being used as well as the Work Pads.\n\nSinging: This is taught but there were hardly enough children present at the inspection to judge properly.\n\nLanguage and Nature: The Work Books in English Usage and Composition are being used in all Grades above Grade 2. More work might be done in the Nature Work Book.\n\nGeneral: The teacher is giving \"Satisfactory\" service here.\n\nThe school is a very small one at the present time. I believe that satisfactory progress is being made by the children. Those whom I saw appeared to be making progress. The teacher's control is \"Good\".\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Inspector Barry's report on his visit to Katzie Indian Day School, together with a copy of his proposed itinerary for the remainder of the month of September, 1937.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDM/HN\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSeptember 17th 1937.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of my proposed itinerary for the remainder of the month of September. You will remember that you asked me to let you have this in case there was need for the Indian Affairs Branch to get into touch with me while I was away from Victoria on inspection duties.\n\nSince my arrival in Vancouver on the evening of the 14th I have been very much occupied with official duties of various kinds.\n\nThe Katzie Indian Day School was visited yesterday and help given to Miss M. Winter, the teacher. The officials in Ottawa are aware that Miss Winter does not organize her work well, and for this reason I made an inspection of her school very early in the school year. Every possible help was given to this teacher, and detailed instructions as to just what each child should attempt in the main subjects were given in order to make the work easier for Miss Winter. She seemed very pleased to have my suggestions, but it will remain to be seen how well she can carry out the detail of the work. A brief report on my visit to the Katzie Day School will be forwarded to you to-morrow.\n\nMiss Weaver our senior teacher at the Skidegate Indian Day School appears to have resigned her position without any warning, on being appointed to a teaching position under the Provincial Department of Education in a school near Vancouver. Under the new arrangement the schools in the Queen Charlotte Islands do not open till October 1st, but the boat leaves Vancouver to-day.\n\nDr. Osterhout the Superintendent of the United Church was away on vacation as he believed the whole of the arrangements with regard to the next term had been made. In his absence I gave what help I could to Miss Money Dr. Osterhout's Secretary, and after meeting an experienced United Church teacher who was a candidate for the position at Skidegate, the necessary telegram and letter was sent to the United Church officials in Toronto, who were in touch with the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa.\n\nA very experienced teacher, Mrs Moses, was nominated to the Indian Affairs Branch by the United Church, and from what I saw of this lady I believe she will be a great success at Skidegate. There was not sufficient time to cover all the ground but I did what I could to indicate to Mrs Moses the more pressing needs of the classroom she will take over at Skidegate.\n\nI should be glad if you would forward this letter and a copy of my itinerary to Ottawa, with any covering remarks you may care to make.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Henry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa, October 9, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Katzie Indian Day School on the 16th ultimo. Mr. Barry has endeavoured to give Miss Winter every possible assistance and it is expected that she will carry out any instructions that he has given regarding the classroom work.\n\nYou should also inform Miss Winter that, unless her work shows decided improvement during the current academic year, the Department will be obliged to dispense with her services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.O.N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, March 25, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Katsie Indian Day School on the 15th instant.\n\nIt appears from this report that Mr. Barry has received a promise from the teacher that she will take a special course this year in arts and crafts suitable for her work at Katsie, in order that she may develop vocational training at the school. On the occasion of your next visit to the school, you should advise the teacher that the Department considers this action on her part is in the best interests of the work at Katsie and it is hoped that she will take the course mentioned. You should advise me later if she does so and, in this event, the Department will be prepared to allow a reasonable amount for material for vocational training during the academic year 1937-38.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 668,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, which I inspected yesterday, March 15th.\n\nThe attached report should be read in conjunction with one made after an inspection on November 19th 1936, a copy of which is on file in Victoria.\n\nThe present inspection was carried out in compliance with instructions contained in a letter from the Indian Affairs Branch following the receipt in Ottawa of my former report.\n\nI am certainly glad to say that a definite effort has been made by Miss Winter to carry out the instructions of the Indian Affairs Branch, whether given to her in a letter from the Chief of the Training Division or by myself during inspections. On the whole there has been a distinct improvement in the organization of the school since my last visit.\n\nI have asked Miss Winter to develop the Vocational Training at present given at this school. She is considering just what can be done in the way of Arts and Crafts next year, and will probably take a course in either Manual Arts or Arts and Crafts if she can find a suitable one this summer.\n\nA new Union Jack is being requisitioned. The old flag is so badly torn and worn out that I think the provision of a new one is badly needed.\n\nI do not consider that it is necessary to make a change of teachers here at the present time. This should not be considered to mean that I am satisfied with the progress of the children. I do think that Miss Winter is of some use here apart from her ability as a teacher. Her influence is all for the good of the Indians and their children. A more effective teacher would get the pupils further on in their academic studies, but might not be of as great a help to them in other ways. If Miss Winter can develop the Arts and Crafts during the school year 1937-38 I shall be satisfied.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON KATZIE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nRoman Catholic Church New Westminster Agency.\n\nDate of inspection: March 15, 1937.\nNumber of pupils present: 7 Boys and 3 Girls; Total 10.\nNumber of classrooms: One.\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 23 Single Desks with 4 Rear Sections in addition\n\nName of teacher: Miss Mary Winter. Age 30.\n\nHealth: The teacher's health has been good since my last inspection with the exception that she was away from school for three days during this period with influenza.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMiss Winter is very much interested in all that is for the good of the children and their parents. She was trained in the Vancouver Normal School, and holds a B.C. Second Class Certificate. She has attended the Provincial Summer Schools in Victoria on a number of occasions. She holds Summer School qualifications in Indian & Rural Work 1932 & 1934, Primary Work and Elocution 1934, and Primary 1936. For some three years she was a Substitute Teacher in the Vancouver City Schools. She has been here for some six years.\n\nWhile Miss Winter has a very good manner with the children, and is much loved by them, she is not a very great success as a teacher. She becomes very easily confused and has to be told quite clearly what promotions it is best to make and what should be taught in each Grade. She has had hours of instruction from me in the Provincial Summer Schools and during inspections, but she is not able to make use of one tenth of what she has been told.\n\nDuring my previous visit to this school, when things were found in a very confused state, Miss Winter was given very definite instructions as to what was to be taught in each Sub Grade of Grade 1 and Grade 2. The result has not come up to my expectations; but I can say that the Reading in the various Grades has improved.\n\nThe Arithmetic is very weak at the present time, and particularly poor in Grades 1C and 1B.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of pupils:\n\nReading: This has improved since last October. Grade 1C know some 50 words. They are reading and should finish Two Little Indians by the end of June. They will be ready to start Friends and Corona Primer 1 in September. Their reading is still \"word for word\" but they speak out fairly well. Grade 1B have finished Two Little Indians and Corona Primer 1. The girl in this Sub Grade is at Page 31 of Corona Primer 2, but the boy is not as far on. The girl is ready for Grade 2B in September. Grade 2B have now finished Corona Primer 2 and are at Page 32 of Corona Reader Book 1. The work of this Grade is on the whole quite satisfactory. The reading is rather \"word for word\" but one child will be ready for Grade 3B in September while one must remain in Grade 2B. Grade 4B and 4A are working at Corona Book 2 in different places and are reading Highroads Readers Books 4 and 3. Reading is good and the children speak up. Grade 6 pupil was not present but is I am informed reading Corona Reader Book 4 and Highroads Book 6.\nReport on Katzie Indian Day School:\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1C can read and write the numbers to 9 and can recognize Groups to 9. They should start the Combinations and Separations now. Grade 1B are supposed to know the Combinations and Separations to 6 on the statement of the teacher. As a matter of fact they do know these from Flash Cards but have no idea of doing the same work from the Blackboard. I have explained all this to the teacher and asked that the Board be used. Grade 2B can add and subtract without borrowing or carrying. They are starting the harder work now, and I taught a short lesson in Subtraction with borrowing to correct a wrong method being used by the teacher. These children must use the DECOMPOSITION METHOD at present. Grade 4B is working Short Multiplication and Division and are starting Long Multiplication and Long Division. Grade 4A has finished Long Division but will have to review this, to be ready for Grade 5B in September. Grade 6 was absent but is said to be working Decimals. She should go on to Per Cent.\n\nTested with the All Canada Test in the Fundamentals:\nGrade 4A made a Mid Score of 17, the Norm being 20\nGrade 4B made a Mid Score of 18, the Norm being in this case 18.\n\nWriting: This is particularly weak throughout the school.\nGrades 4 and 6 use the Maclean Manuals, but the Juniors have been writing from copies on the Board placed there by the teacher. I have suggested that these Juniors use the Bailey Manuals now at the school, as they must have some sort of Manual. Grade 1B must write in their exercise books also. Grade 1C should do so also, but at present are only writing on the Boards. From Grade 3 up ink is used. It might be used in Grade 2.\n\nSpelling: This is good as is usual in these schools where insufficient time is given to the completion of the various Work Books, Geography, Nature, Etc.\n\nIn the Buckingham Ayres Scale in Spelling:\nGrade 4A made a Mid Score of 85% and Grade 4B a Mid Score of 80% the June Norm being in each case about 88%.\n\nGeography: An attempt is being made to teach this with the help of The Book of Boys and Girls Round the World and Journeys Near and Far. Not sufficient work has been done but a Project on Japan was on display. I have asked the teacher to give more attention to Geography.\n\nElementary Science: The text supplied by the Branch, Happy Hours in Garden Field and Woodland is being used. I have suggested that Book 1 of the Pathways in Science be used by the teacher in the Primary Grades and the suggested practical work done this Spring.\n\nSinging: The children sang quite well for me, but the teacher is not giving enough time to this. I asked that a few minutes daily be given to singing.\n\nLanguage: I doubt that sufficient work is being done in the various Work Books.\n\nGeneral Achievement: The children are backward in Arithmetic particularly in the Primary Grades. Grades 4B and 4A wrote the B.C. Achievement Test for Juniors 1934 for me and the following low scores were made:\nGrade 4A made a Mid Score of 23, the Norm being about 27\nGrade 4B pupils made scores of 14, and 1, the Norm being 25.\n\nWhile the standing of the pupils is very much below the average of the Indian Day Schools in B.C. the work has been better organized since my last inspection and the Reading much improved.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSeptember 16, 1937.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 686,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, which I inspected on September 16th.\n\nThe attached report should be read in conjunction with one made after an inspection on November 19th 1936 and a later report after my inspection on March 15th of this present year.\n\nI still do not consider it necessary to make a change of teachers here till Miss Winter has been given an opportunity to develop a programme in the teaching of Arts and Crafts or to show that she is unable to do this.\n\nShould the Indian Affairs Branch give this school a small grant of from $20.00 to $30.00, on the recommendation of the Indian Agent, for the purchase of material for work in Arts and Crafts, Basket making, Etc., I would recommend that the teacher be informed that the work in this subject as well as the general classroom work of the school must show definite improvement during the present school year, if the retention of the teacher after June 1938 is to be justified.\n\nMuch better teachers than Miss Winter are available for these small Catholic Day Schools, but I do not wish to recommend a change of teachers till I have an opportunity of seeing how well or badly Miss Winter makes use of the instruction she has had at the Provincial Summer School this last July.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON KATZIE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nRoman Catholic Church New Westminster Agency\n\nDate of inspection: September 16th 1937.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys 5\nGirls 3\nTotal 8\n\nThere were two girls absent.\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 23 single desks and 4 rear sections in addition.\n\nHealth: Fair. Miss Winter was absent for the greater part of the month of June with influenza. She is now recovering from a head cold.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMiss Winter was trained at the Vancouver Normal School, and holds a B.C. Second Class Certificate.\n\nThis teacher has attended the Provincial Summer School in Victoria a number of occasions. She holds Summer School certificates for Indian & Rural Work 1932 and 1934, Primary work and Education 1934, Primary 1936, and Graphic and Practical Arts 1937.\n\nWhile Miss Winter has a good manner with the children and is loved by them, she is not very successful as a teacher. This is due to her more or less confused state of mind. This matter has been reported on previously.\n\nTo keep this school up to any satisfactory standard of work, it is necessary for me to visit it at least twice a year. During the present visit I have laid down in detail the exact work to be covered in each Grade in Reading, Language, and Arithmetic. This has of course been done on former occasions but the teacher seemed more confident when I left her this time.\n\nNow that I am to have my office in Vancouver it will be possible to visit this little school several times yearly with very small expense to the Department. With close supervision Miss Winter may be able to produce more satisfactory results in the classroom.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils:\n\nReading: Grades from 2 to 4 inclusive read for me with some success. The work of all Grades was outlined for the teacher for the year. Children speak well. They are very slow and deliberate in their reading.\n\nArithmetic: In general this is weak, though progress is being made slowly in Grades 2 to 4. The pupils in Grades 5 and 6 were absent and could not be tested.\n\nWriting: Some improvement was noticed.\n\nGeneral: As it was so early in the term more time was taken with giving help to the teacher than in the testing of the achievement of the pupils. It is far too early to say anything about this term's work as yet. Miss Winter as a result of my efforts appears more confident and tells me she understands better what is required in Grade 1. She is starting some Art and Crafts handwork. I warned her to keep the work of that which would be of use to Indian children and not to pay too much attention to the small details of the work undertaken in the Vancouver City Schools. She purchased out of her own funds the complete Vancouver course while attending Summer School this year. This course cost her $4.85 and I much doubt that it was worth it as it is arranged for \"white\" pupils who could never produce the work these Indians can if they are given the chance.\nAttendance problem; remedies suggested, etc.\n\nThe attendance has been satisfactory since my last report.\n\nMore children could attend if it were possible to arrange for a boat to ferry them across the Fraser to school and back in the afternoon.\n\nThe Indian Agent has this matter in hand, but when we last discussed it the only available man wanted far too much per month, somewhere in the neighbourhood of $50.00 I understand. I explained to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt that I would be prepared to recommend the expenditure of some $20.00 per month for the ten pupils who so who could then attend school. This is at about the rate of $2.00 per teaching child, per pupil which the Department pays for Indian children attending Provincial Schools.\n\nIt is possible that Mr. Daunt has brought this matter to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch, or that he will do so on receipt of this report. I may say that I am in complete agreement with Mr. Daunt in the matter.\n\nClassification:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| 1C    | 0    | 2     | 2     |\n| 1B    | 1    | 0     | 1     |\n| 2     | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n| 3B    | 2    | 0     | 2     |\n| 4A    | 2    | 0     | 2     |\n| 5B    | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n| Absent today | 6A   | 0    | 1     |\n\nTotal: 5 5 10\n\nSince my last report one boy CARL LION Age 8 has gone to Kamloops Indian Residential School. On enquiry I find that this boy's parents have moved away from the local Indian Reserve, and I am satisfied that his removal from this school was justified.\n\nAttendance Record for Quarter ending:\n\nSchool Year 1924-35 1935-36 1926-27\nSeptember 7.86 10.57 8.61\nDecember 8.25 9.52 8.88\nMarch 8.60 5.55 6.91\nJune 6.72 5.46 7.71\n\nThe Non Indian mentioned in my last report does not now attend this school.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThe schoolroom was clean. The general arrangement of the desks was good. The children were cleaner than was the case some year or so ago.\n\nThe teacher is doing her best to follow the instructions given her by the Indian Affairs Branch either directly from Ottawa or through the Indian Agent and Inspector of Schools.\n\nMiss Winter is I believe of definite use on this rather out of the way Indian Reserve apart from her work in the school.\n\nA new Union Jack will be flown when the wire of the flag pole has been replaced.\n\nThe general standing of the school is \"Fair\".\n\nVancouver, B.C.\nSeptember 18, 1937\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSIR:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 9th, File No. 153-18-6, the contents of which, in accordance with your instructions, I communicated to Miss Mary Winter, teacher at the Katzic Indian Day School, I am now enclosing for your information, her reply.\n\nI think there is a great deal to be said in her favour. School had only been open a few days when the visit of the Inspector was made. Holidays had been extra long, as Miss Winter had been very ill in June. Doctor Broe, of Hammond, who attended her, told me she needed a complete rest, and instead of taking it, she endeavoured to carry out the Department's views by attending a summer \"Arts and Crafts\" course. She has her class in this respect now going on.\n\nMiss Winter is very popular with the Indians, and has a decidedly good influence on the girls. I do not pretend to be an authority on new fashioned technique, but the final results achieved by Miss Winter appear to be good, and I certainly do not recommend that any hasty decision be arrived at in connection with this teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.G.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nKatzik Indian Day School,\nEast Hammond, B.C.\n\nOct. 23, 1931\n\nA.O.M. Launt Esq.,\nThe Indian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Launt:\n\nI have received your letter of the 16th inst., which quoted, at the Department's request, the information they wished me to receive.\n\nThe Inspector has evidently given me another bad report.\n\nI protest that this report is not fair, as it was given on Oct. 6th, only twelve school days after the opening of the term. That does not give any teacher who has twenty children to day, and six grades to teach much chance of getting organized. The children had also been out of school three months, owing to my long illness, during practically the whole month of June. Also the Inspector has never told me at any time that he was going\nTo give me a bad report. He only gave two or three criticisms, and as he has always done so, even in days when he was apparently satisfied with my work, I took them to be only in the nature of recommendations for improvement.\n\nI wish to protest also against private reports, which the teacher does not see. This is never done in the B.C. provincial schools. Copies of the teacher's report are rendered in triplicate, and the teacher always receives one copy, whether it is excellent, satisfactory or bad. In applying for a new school, we can furnish copies of the Inspector's reports which we are bound to do in that case. Without these it is practically impossible for an experienced teacher to secure a new position anywhere else.\n\nI have always endeavored, and will still continue to render satisfactory service to the Department, and I appreciate the help and consideration you have always given me in my work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMary Hunter.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith report of Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., together with his letter of the 16th instant, covering his inspection on the 16th instant of the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nStrictly Confidential\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Katzie Indian Day School, Roman Catholic Church, New Westminster Agency, which I inspected yesterday, December 6th.\n\nI feel that the Department would wish me to make a very detailed report on the conditions existing at the above school in view of the fact that I consider them highly unsatisfactory, particularly from an administrative point of view.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Daly, was placed here on first appointment to take the place of Miss Winter, moved after about ten years to the Seton Lake School. Miss Daly is the only daughter of Mr. C.O. Daly, the teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, on whom I reported a few days ago.\n\nIt was somewhat difficult to carry out my inspection as Miss Daly's attitude was almost hostile. She went so far as to interrupt me in my work by suggesting what the children did. I did not know how much I could expect from them, and the difficult conditions under which the work of the school was carried out. She managed to so twist around the suggestions made to her in my own office that they carried quite different meanings from those I had intended in trying to assist her when she was first appointed. Others, had they been present, would no doubt have considered her attitude to me and to my advice and suggestions highly impertinent from such a young inexperienced teacher to one now nearing the end of his professional life.\n\nIn a conference with Mr. Indian Agent Daunt in New Westminster after this inspection I explained the attitude of the teacher to the officials of the Department, including his own stenographer, Dominion Constable Higginbottom, and myself, and I suggested that were he to receive the same sort of impudence he might do well to take a very strong stand and report the matter at once to the Department. Such an action as the temporary suspension of the teacher to learn the Department's wishes would not under these conditions be perhaps a wrong course to follow.\n\nThe teacher complained of a number of things, the main headings being:\n\n1. The school was too dark, due mainly to the fact that there is a wooded piece of land some distance in front of the windows. She wanted the Indians or others to cut down the trees, and clear the bush, but said that after a number of letters to the Indian Agent she could not get action in this matter.\nMiss Daly also wanted electric lighting in her school the electric light wires passing quite close to the school.\n\nI replied that it was the first time that I had ever heard of a teacher asking for trees etc., to be cut down on another person's land to improve the conditions in the school, that I much doubted that such action would in any case be possible as the Indians would at best have to be paid for the work even if approved, and that as far as the electric light question was concerned the Department had made a decision not to have it in the school, and the matter was thus closed.\n\n2. Miss Daly stated that she could not get the school warm enough for the children on cold days, as the heating stove was too small and in poor repair.\n\nWhen I explained that Dominion Constable Higginbottom in thirty minutes had raised the temperature in the room to around 70 degrees by increasing the fuel on the fire, Miss Daly told me that this was a foolish reply, as the day was a warm one when Constable Higginbottom was there to inquire into this matter.\n\nMiss Daly then, the heater not having had coal on for the preceding one and a half hours, said she felt the room cold and took out a little thermometer to test the temperature. After a further half hour I found the temperature sixty degrees with windows open and at the end of the morning's work.\n\nI examined the heater, which is of the circulating type and burns coal or at times wood. It has had I understand some ten years use here, and due to big fires needs some repair to the top, where air can get in and thus reduce the draft.\n\nIn my opinion whether the stove is repaired or not, and considering the mild climate of the coast, it is quite possible to heat the room in a satisfactory manner, provided the fuel is added properly. I have no intention of recommending a new heater for this school and informed the Indian Agent.\n\nThe teacher tells me that the fire is lighted at 7.30 a.m. on cold mornings, by Duncan Moody, and that Mrs. Moody does the janitor work for $2.50 per month. Miss Daly did not hesitate to say that such sum was inadequate.\n\n3. Miss Daly complains that she gets her shoes wet and stockings torn by undergrowth and briars around the school. In reply I suggested she should wear gum boots.\n\n4. Miss Daly states that there are two small leaks in the schoolroom roof. This has nothing to do with me but I did mention the matter to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt. Probably quite minor repairs are all that would be necessary.\n\n5. Miss Daly did not hesitate to say that the reduction of the academic year to one of nine months had kept the children back in their work. How she could have come to such a decision without any experience I do not know. I pointed out that in the schools so far inspected this year, I could not detect any such retardation.\n\nWhile there were other complaints, I think the above will indicate the teacher's attitude.\nThe teacher was absent on November 8th 1940 when she attended a teachers' convention at Chilliwack, near where her parents live. The Katzie Indian Day School was closed that day without permission from anyone. This matter has been reported by the Indian Agent I understand.\n\nMiss Daly when asked why she closed the school without permission informed me that she thought I liked teachers to attend conventions. I told Miss Daly that none of us in B.C. had the power to give permission for the school to be closed and that such a matter would have had to be dealt with by the Department at Ottawa. In any case Miss Daly only wrote to the Indian Agent of her intention to close the school the evening before and in no case could Mr Daunt have received the letter in time.\n\nSurvey of Pupils:\n\nThe following are the children whose names appear on the roll of the school.\n\n| Name            | Age | Grade | Lives At          | Remarks               |\n|-----------------|-----|-------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Walter Florence | 13  | 5     | Katzie No.1       |                       |\n| Andrew James    | 10  | 2     | Barnston Island   | To school by boat     |\n| Alice James     | 8   | 2     | Barnston Island   | To school by boat     |\n| Bud Johnson     | 13  | 4     | Katzie No.1       |                       |\n| Earl Miller     | 10  | 2     | Katzie No.1       |                       |\n| Alma Miller     | 11  | 2     | Katzie No.1       |                       |\n| Edward Pierre   | 15  | 7     | Katzie No.1       |                       |\n| Francis Pierre  | 8   | 1B    | Barnston Island   | To school by boat     |\n| Raymond Pierre  | 10  | 1B    | Barnston Island   | To school by boat     |\n| Dolores Adams   | 11  | 5     | Katzie No.1       |                       |\n| Chester Miller  | 7   | 1B    | On boathouse off  | NOT AN INDIAN         |\n|                 |     |       | Katzie No.2       | To school by boat     |\n| Maudie Miller   | 11  | 2     | On boathouse off  | NOT AN INDIAN         |\n|                 |     |       | Katzie No.2       | To school by boat     |\n\nThe above 12 children appear on the school roll, their attendance is included in the averages given in my report and by the teacher in her reports in School Register.\n\nIn my opinion while Chester and Maudie Miller might well be shown on the School Register their attendance should not be included with Indian children in reporting to Department, and I suggest that instructions be issued to this effect. It is however necessary to note their actual attendance daily in the Register separated from the Indians for other reasons.\n\nChildren not shown on Register\n\nThe following are not shown on the Register as attending this school Mervin Pierre and Ray Miller, 7 and 11 years of age.\n\nGeneral Remarks\n\nI do not see how the retention of a teacher in an Indian school, when such teacher is highly critical of the actions of the Department or its officials, could be justified.\n\nThere is the danger that such teacher would, perhaps without intending it, say things in school which would cause the Indians to become disturbed.\n\nAt present the Union Jack is not being flown here though one has been provided. The teacher's explanation is that the wires on the flag pole have become tangled, and that she is unable to fix them.\nMiss Daly informed me that she hopes later to obtain a position in a Provincial school. She was anxious when I left the school that she would be given a good report. She asked if she would receive a copy of my report, and was informed that teachers in Indian schools did not receive copies of my reports on the schools.\n\nI recommended Miss Daly to modify her highly critical attitude to the Department and its officials.\n\nThe authorized length of the academic year at this school is one of nine months, from October 1st to June 30th yearly.\n\nMiss Daly is being allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month, less the usual deductions.\n\nThe operating expense at this school is increased through the necessity for a boat from Barnston Island to transport those children living there to and from school.\n\nWhen costs for fuel, janitor services, etc., are taken into consideration, it is somewhat doubtful if the Department is justified in keeping this small school open for a nine month academic year, particularly in war time, when there is need for strict economy.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI am not satisfied with the attitude of the teacher, but have not sufficient grounds at present to request the Department to terminate her appointment.\n\nAs there are two non-Indian children attending the school, the real average attendance of the Indian children may perhaps in round numbers be taken as 8 in October and 7 in November of this year. With a present total of 10 strictly Indian children I do not expect the average attendance to exceed 8 which would be a higher percentage attendance than in many Indian day schools.\n\nUnder the above circumstances I consider that the Department might well close the school at least during the present war period. A few of the children might possibly be taken into St. Mary's Residential School, and as the older ones completed their period in school the younger might be admitted there, where in any case the education is of a far more worth while nature that at Katzie.\n\nShould the Department for some reason not agree with me that the Katzie school be closed, I would recommend that the academic year be reduced to one of only five months, as has been done in the case of at least two Anglican day schools, Kingcome Inlet and Mamalilikulla. This would turn the Katzie Indian day school into a seasonal school, operating during the winter months, say from October 1st to February 28th or from November 1st to March 31st yearly.\n\nAs this school was opened this year on October 1st it should in my opinion be closed at the end of February if the Department accept the seasonal school plan in preference to the more general plan of closing the school for the period of the war.\n\nIn either case I would advise that the teacher be notified, as soon as the Department has come to a decision in the matter, that her services may not be needed after the end of February. This would allow her to seek a position in the Provincial schools for the term opening after the Christmas vacation. She in such case would no doubt be informed that the attendance did not justify more than a seasonal school at Katzie.\nIn conclusion I may say that I have no objection to a copy of this confidential letter being sent to Mr. Indian Agent A.O.N. Daunt for his information, on the understanding that the contents are in fact of a confidential nature.\n\nIt may be that you would like to have a report from Mr. Daunt himself regarding the suggestion for either the closing of the Katzic school or the reduction of the academic year to one of five months.\n\nI regret that it has been necessary to make such a lengthy report on this school, but it is better that the Department should have as many as possible of the facts on which to base a decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

There is no Provincial school where these children could possibly receive an education, and there is no room for them in any Residential School.\n\nThe school is clean, furniture etc., now well arranged. I am glad the Department saw fit to supply some very elementary Manual Training equipment and sewing materials. I hope that the work now being done will be continued, for it has been very successful during the past year. The teacher has carried out the suggestions made to her at previous inspections.\n\nBook shelves, little tables, book ends, etc., have been made by the boys and later decorated with Indian designs from the sheets I sent to the school. The girls have made use of Indian design in a number of ways, and also learned plain sewing.\n\nOne boy in Grade IA not shown in the averages as enrolled or present is ROBERT CHARLIE. I am informed by the teacher that his mother is an Indian and is now blind and living with her own parents on the Indian Reserve, while the father, who is white, works at or near Deroche. This young boy lives with his mother on the Indian Reserve and attends this school, there being no other for him to attend.\n\nThe progress of the children has been better since my last visit. The teacher is carrying out the various instructions given to her to the best of her ability. Her manner with the little children is particularly good, and her attitude to her work is \"Excellent\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Five children attend regularly who could not get to school if we did not pay an Indian to bring them to school in the morning and take them home in the afternoon. The charge is only $1.00 a day for this service. I hope that soon more will use the above mentioned canoe ferry.\n\nYou will note that the average attendance at this school is very low, and without some such provision as that authorized by the Department and mentioned in the above paragraph it would not be worth while keeping this school open.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON KATZIE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nRoman Catholic Church New Westminster Agency.\n\nDate of inspection: December 1st 1938.\n\nNumber of pupils present: Boys 8 Girls 3 Total 11\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 23 single desks and 4 rear sections in addition.\n\nName of teacher: Miss Mary Winter Age 32\n\nHealth: Good. Appears to have improved.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMiss Winter was trained in the Vancouver Normal School and holds a B.C. Second Class Certificate. On several occasions she has attended the sessions of the Provincial Summer School for Teachers in Victoria taking such subjects as Indian & Rural 1932 & 1934 Primary Work and Elocution 1934, Primary 1936, and Graphic and Practical Arts in 1937.\n\nMiss Winter was for some three years a substitute teacher in Vancouver which means that she was not able to get a Rural School and took any supply teaching in Vancouver she could get. She has been teacher of this small Indian school for the past seven and a half years.\n\nMiss Winter has a good manner with the children and is much loved by them. She has not been a very successful teacher. She has had many hours of instruction from me at Summer School and during inspections, and has of course had many other courses in Victoria. She is not able to make use of much of what she has been taught, as she would appear to suffer from a very confused state of mind. My very pointed instructions are sinking in slowly and she is certainly doing better work this last year.\n\nWere it not that she has done some very nice work in Handwork and is teaching the children to sew embroidery and make aprons etc., and instructing the boys in elementary work with the set of tools at this school, I should recommend that she be replaced. As it is her care of the children is so good that I have overlooked many things with regard to her actual academic work.\n\nRemarks relative to examination of the children:\n\nIn general the Reading is satisfactory. That of Grade 5 is very good and that of Grade 1B is good. Arithmetic is very weak except in Grade 5 where it is almost up to standard. Tested with the All Canada Test in Fundamentals\n\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 4 Norm 8\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 9 Norm 19\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 21 Norm 25\n\nWriting has improved a little.\n\nVery good Handwork has been done and the boys are making small articles of furniture for the doll's house made since my last visit.\n\nArt work has been improved.\n\nHealth is taught. I asked for daily lessons.\n\nThe school has been a Junior Red Cross Unit for five years now. In general there has been improvement in the academic work.\nAttendance problem remedies suggested, etc.\n\nOn page 2 of my report of September 18th 1937 it was suggested that more children would attend if a ferry could be arranged to bring them across the Fraser River.\n\nI am glad to say that the Indian Agent was able to arrange for this. The arrangement is that an Indian gets $1.00 per day for bringing the children to school and taking them back across the Fraser in the afternoon after school.\n\nAt present five pupils attend every day who otherwise could not get to school. Only one day was missed in November. The teacher certifies the account of the Indian boatman. So far this is a most satisfactory arrangement.\n\nThe children give a Christmas concert to the Indian parents. The Department used to give a small grant for oranges and candy etc. This was discontinued a short time ago, though I do not know just why. The teacher has been paying for little gifts herself, and I would recommend that the sum of $5.00 be allowed for this purpose each Christmas. This will encourage the children to attend regularly.\n\nThe average attendance has been:\n\n| School Year | 1934-35 | 1935-36 | 1936-37 | 1937-38 | 1938-39 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| September   | 7.8     | 10.5    | 8.6     | 8.5     | 5.7     |\n| December    | 8.2     | 9.5     | 8.8     | 7.8     |         |\n| March       | 8.6     | 5.5     | 6.9     | 6.0     |         |\n| June        | 6.7     | 5.4     | 7.7     | 5.5     |         |\n\nI hope that with the children from across the Fraser the attendance will increase. It is essential that every child should attend school as otherwise the Department is hardly justified in keeping this school open; and were it not that the Mission Indian Residential School and Kamloops are more than full these children or several of them could be sent to a Residential School. I believe that it would be well to warn the teacher that every child must attend school regularly if the school is to be kept open and her services retained.\n\nThough Miss Winter wishes for a transfer this could not be arranged at present. She has not been successful enough here to make it possible for me to recommend a transfer, at least this year.\n\nClassification: Grade: Boys: Girls: Total:\n5 2 0 2\n4 1 0 1\n3 1 1 2\n1B 1 1 2\n1D 3 2 5\nTotals 8 4 12\n\nThe 5 children in Grade 1D are Beginners from across the Fraser River. There is in addition one NON INDIAN boy in Grade 1B but he is not included in the above classification.\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nI should like to see a still greater effort put into the Arts and Crafts work. The teacher is able to make a success of this sort of instruction.\n\nThe boys could cut toys out of three ply wood if they had a large fret saw and sufficient blades. They have made some nice book ends which they are decorating with Indian designs.\n\nThere are some tools at this school. A new large cupboard should be constructed for the tools and other material for the Manual Training.\n\nI should like to recommend the grant of not more than ten dollars to provide a few more tools, particularly the necessary small fret saw outfit and sufficient lumber for the construction of a large cupboard for the tools.\n\nAnother small table is required for the DRESSING CORNER. These things can be made by the boys if they have the lumber. Display boards for the children's work for exhibition purposes will also be needed and can be made at the school.\n\nPossibly a pair of hand carders could be purchased out of the above suggested sum of $10.00 so that the children could go ahead with the carding of local wool which could then be spun and knit by the girls.\n\nIt is only along such lines as this that we can hope for much success at this school under the present teacher.\n\nI have sent a sheet of Indian designs to the school. These only cost 10\u00a2 for a large coloured sheet and I have provided them for a number of schools. Other schools have been supplied when the teachers sent a dime to the Vancouver office for such material.\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 153-18-5 of November 13th 1938 I have made a recommendation that the school be lighted with electric light.\n\nThis matter was gone into in detail in my letter of December 2nd addressed to the Indian Commissioner. Four 150 watt lights would be sufficient for the schoolroom which is not a very large room. Four 200 watt lights are used in the Provincial schoolrooms when electric light is available, 600 watts being the maximum for one circuit. There would in this school be need for two 60 watt lights one in the hall and one on the porch as well as the four in the schoolroom. The total would therefore come to 720 watts if my recommendation is followed.\n\nThe monthly minimum charge would be $1.00 the Indian Agent informs me, and the capital expenditure about $125.00 I consider that if we are to continue to operate this school the above expenditure is justified, but it should be noted that every available child must attend to keep us a reasonable average.\n\nThe teacher is making a real effort to follow my suggestions and might well be retained for the present.\n\nThe children are well mannered and clean.\n\nThey were neatly dressed.\n\nThe Union Jack was flying on the occasion of my visit. The general standing of the school is slightly improved and may be said to be \"Satisfactory.\"\n\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDecember 7, 1938.\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing Captain Barry's report of his recent inspection of the Katsie Indian Day School. I agree with your recommendation that the school should be inspected again about May or June and you will no doubt make the necessary arrangements in this regard with Inspector Barry.\n\nAfter carefully considering the contents of Inspector Barry's report I am under the impression that we should dispense with the services of Miss Daly at the end of the current academic year unless Inspector Barry finds, on his next inspection, that there has been a very decided improvement both in the work and in the teacher's attitude toward it. In order to permit a month's notice being given to Miss Daly in the event of her dismissal it would be advisable to have the school inspected early in May.\n\nI cannot agree that there is any advantage in reducing the length of the academic year at this school so drastically as suggested by Inspector Barry. Every endeavour should be made, however, to increase the attendance at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 27, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith report by Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., together with his covering letter of the 7th ultimo, with respect to his inspection on the 6th of December, 1940, of the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, B.C.\n\nIt will be observed from this report that Inspector Barry is not satisfied with the attitude of the teacher. Miss Daly, of course, is a young inexperienced teacher, which probably accounts to some extent for her general attitude towards Inspector Barry during his inspection of her school.\n\nThe Indians of Katzie are among the very few in the Province who remain in residence on their Reserve throughout the year, the reason being that the men are Fraser River fishermen and are employed all the year round on the River in close proximity to the village. For this reason I consider the school should continue on the present basis so long as the average attendance is satisfactory. Should sufficient children be available to keep the school in operation for the full school year, I feel it would be a mistake to reduce the term to one or five months. Perhaps I should add that Mr. Indian Agent Daunt is also of this opinion.\n\nI would recommend that the school be again inspected in May or June, following which a definite decision could be reached as to its immediate future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Father Fleury, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal of St. Mary's Residential School, Mission, arranged for my transportation to the Katzie School and was present during the inspection.\n\nIt was wet today and the attendance was very small five boys and one girl. As all but one of the children present were in Grade 1 it was somewhat difficult to estimate the progress of the children in general, but I am satisfied that Miss Daly is doing satisfactory work.\n\nMiss Daly pointed out that attendance is somewhat irregular and that this limits the progress which otherwise would be possible. Some eleven of the fifteen pupils cross by ferry boat from Barnston Island daily. Were it not for this transportation arrangement there would not be sufficient pupils available to keep the school open. The transportation service is I understand quite satisfactory.\n\nThe Department makes a grant towards the lunch provided for pupils.\n\nThe general standing of the school is satisfactory at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGerald H.

I understand from the Inspector's comments that he does not intend to insist on his previous recommendation that we dispense with the services of Miss Daly at the end of June. I presume that she intends to remain for the academic year 1940-41. It is understood, of course, that the school will be open for a nine-month period during the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl /AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNelson, B.C.\n\nApril 24th 1941.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Katzie Indian Day School, Roman Catholic Church, New Westminster Agency, which I inspected yesterday, April 23rd.\n\nThis particular inspection was carried out in accordance with Departmental instructions, and in forwarding my present report I would refer you to my confidential letter of December 7th last and the report on the Katzie school following my visit ther on December 6th 1940.\n\nYou will be glad to know that conditions at the Katzie school are now very much improved. The attendance has in particular been increased. Two of the sixteen children enrolled are Chester and Audie Miller, non Indians I believe, whose cases were dealt with in my letter of December 7th 1940.\n\nMiss Daly has greatly improved in her general attitude, and has followed my suggestions given to her during my inspection of December last. This teacher had no idea that I should visit her school at this particular time, yet the Union Jack was flying, the school perfectly clean and work being carried on properly.\n\nWhile the academic work is in general much better the Arithmetic in Grades 4 and 5 is still very weak. On the other hand the Arithmetic in Grade 2 is excellent. Tested with the All Canada Test in Fundamentals:\n\n- Grade 2 made a score of 11 Norm for Grade 3 13\n- Grade 4 made a score of 3 Norm being 21\n- Grade 5 made a score of 18 Norm being 27\n\nThe pupil tested in Grade 4 is \"null\".\n\nReading is very good in Primary Grades and satisfactory to good in Grades 4 and 5.\n\nI suggested that the Geography of B.C. be taught to the older pupils, and at the request of the teacher I outlined a suitable method for her and the children.\n\nThe children were much more responsive to my teaching on this occasion. They were in general clean and the teacher's control was very good. She has modified the attitude complained of in my last report, and should in my opinion be allowed to continue in charge of this school. Miss Daly has informed me that she may seek an appointment in a Provincial school when she meets the Provincial Inspectors at Summer School. I asked her to let the Department have at least a month's notice should she wish to resign her present position.\n\nWhile the grades given to Miss Daly in the attached report may seem very low I would ask that the general improvement from those of the last report be noted. Miss Daly states her medical adviser some few months ago stated that she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown at that time. She is now much better and able to carry on her work at the school. No school days appear to have been lost through the above noted condition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher has however been successful in increasing the number enrolled and having children attend on time and regularly. There were ten pupils in school for my visit though the ferry boat was out of commission for some days and a few pupils were home with measles. This is a far more satisfactory state of things.\n\nThe three children starting school since Easter appear quite bright and the teacher was given special assistance in the outline of the work to be done with them.\n\nReading in the Primary Grades is very good while that in Grades 4 and 5 is good. Grade 7 pupil was absent.\n\nLanguage is being taught along better lines and progress is being made.\n\nArithmetic is still uneven, that of the Grade 2 children being particularly good, while in Grade 4 and Grade 5 the pupils are two years below average.

This is a reserve where better accommodation is urgently required, and I have to ask you to again consult with Archdeacon Collison and prepare a sketch of a building that you would consider adequate to meet the needs of the Indian children. It should be of sufficient size and well lighted, and the site should be carefully chosen. Accompanying the sketch should be a statement of material required to complete and furnish the building and an estimate of the total cost. You should also state whether the Archdeacon would undertake to supervise the work, provided he can obtain the services of suitable mechanics.\n\nThe Department is anxious that this building should be\n\nCharles C.

The Indians said that when they promised to put up a moiety of the cost viz., $1250.00 it was at the season of the year when the money was in their hands. Now, they say, we have no money so cannot do it!\n\nIt is understood that in the estimates for British Columbia a grant has been made by the Dominion Government to the extent of $5000.00 for a wharf at Kinkolith. The Indians say that if the Indian Department can arrange with the Dept of Public Works to supply lumber to the extent of the moiety from the new sawmill, and get the latter Department to make an advance for that purpose, that would be the only arrangement they could think of if the mill is to be put in. The lumber could also be furnished for the school from their own reservation.\n\nCommending the suggestion of the Indians to the Departments consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 8th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nDuring last summer the Department had correspondence through the Victoria Office with the late Agent, Mr. Lorenz, in reference to the establishment of a saw-mill on the Kincolith Reserve. Finally the Department agreed to stand pledged for machinery to equip a mill to the extent of $1250.00, as soon as the moiety of the cost to be furnished by the Indians was in some way forthcoming. A condition attached to this grant was that the first lumber cut was to be used in the erection of a school-house at no cost to the Department.\n\nThe Department was of opinion that a grant for the mill, which would be a permanent and valuable asset, was preferable to an appropriation for the erection of a school building, which was under consideration.\n\nA new school-house is much needed and the Department is prepared to carry out its part of the agreement. If the Indians are prepared to stand by their original proposal the erection of a school building will have to be undertaken by the Department, but it is thought that, in view of the benefit that would accrue to the Indians from a mill with which they could supply lumber for the erection of houses and for municipal improvements, the carrying out of the above-mentioned proposition would be much to their advantage.\n\nChas. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nKindly take this matter up as soon as possible with the Council and with Ven. Archdeacon Collison, who has evidenced much interest in the welfare of these Indians, with a view to having a final decision arrived at, and report fully.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., August 9, 1909.\n\nHon. Frank Oliver,\nSup't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Oliver,\n\nI beg to transmit a letter I have received from Rev. W.H. Collison, of Kincolith, with reference to the erection of a new school building for the Indians.\n\nI would ask that you give the request of Rev. Mr. Collison your favorable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 817-1, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nI am pleased to say that I have been now laboring among the Indians of your district for the past 35 years. It was my privilege to help amongst the Indians and succeeded in converting many of them. From June 6th to October 1st, I was the first to establish a mission amongst the Indians of Queen Charlotte's Islands in 1876 when they were still quite uncivilized.\n\nAnd I founded the Upper Skeena Mission in 1881 at Hazelton. I have been here working amongst the Skeena Indians for over 20 years and it is in their behalf I now write.\n\nWe have never received any help from the government towards a school building but though in 1873 we were overtaken by a great fire which swept away all our mission buildings including a new church just completed and 30 Indian houses.\n\nI appealed to the Indian Department for help but we did not receive a cent. I erected a small school room out of my own personal means and then appealed to some friends in England who assisted me to help the Indians who had lost all and eventually we succeeded in rebuilding our church. This school room is now much too small and injurious to the children's health. We were informed three years since that a grant of $1000 would be made towards a new school building. Sadly, we sent in a petition to the Department hoping that this promised grant of $1000 might be made toward...\nSmall Saw Mill instead, to which Indians in public meetings as before proposed to add $20 each which would amount to a total of $1100. Now with the promised $1000 from the Indian Department would be sufficient to purchase a Mill. On these conditions our Indians engage to erect a School building themselves from the first lumber drawn which building will be subject to examination and approval by the Indian Agent for this District. By the Saw Mill they would be enabled to keep up their roads, fences &c. also in good repair as also to help them in house building.\n\nWe have lately received a reply from the Department to this effect:\n\nThe Department will pay a grant of $1000 to the Indian Council when the School house has been erected and approved by Indian Agent.\n\nIt is this I would beg you to have charged as you will see that no advantage is gained as under those circumstances the Indians must find or raise the same total for the erection of the Mill. As I know the Saw Mill will cost $2500 I would respectfully beg that the Indian Department advance half this amount towards the School house building the Indians to engage to complete said building from first lumber drawn in a satisfactory manner.\n\nWe shall greatly appreciate any help you can render us towards this end and with kind regards\n\nI remain dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nW.H.

C.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 119496/1, dated the 7th ultimo, in which you request that I take up with the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Caledonia the matter of appointing a fully qualified teacher for the Indian Day school, I would suggest that the Department, through Mr. Inspector Tyson, more thoroughly investigate the situation at Kincolith, in support of my reason for so doing. I beg to make the following observations for the information of the Department.\n\nPrior to the year 1904 the missions on the Nass River were largely under the supervision of the Methodist Church, but on account of that Church being unable to supply the missions with teachers and missionaries, the people sent a petition to the then Indian Agent and the then Bishop of Caledonia, asking that the Anglican Church take over the stations on the Nass River of the latter, and of the former that a denominational Bylaw which they thought existed be changed from the Methodist to the Anglican Church. The responsible authorities of the two Churches then mutually agreed to the change, and buildings which belonged to the Methodist Church at Lekhalap were transferred to the Anglican Church for the sum of fifteen hundred dollars. Since that time the Anglican Church has endeavoured to keep the missions supplied with suitable missionaries and teachers, and the Methodist Church has created missions in other parts of the coast, leaving the Nass River missions to themselves. Nevertheless for some\nreason or other the missionaries of the Methodist Church have appeared aggrieved at the method of the Anglican Church adopted for the requirements of the Hans missions, and it would appear that whenever the Indians have expressed a desire to return again to the care of the Methodist Church their attitude has not been discourteous, as might be expected in view of the mutual arrangement referred to.\n\nI have just returned from the Hans river, where I took the census, and while there was asked one night to attend a meeting of the people at Lek-halzep. When I got there the Indians expressed themselves very strongly in favor of a change from the Anglican to the Methodist Church. This was their main subject.\n\nI would, moreover, state that to reach the end in view these Indians have recently intimidated the resident missionary of the Church of England, who, desiring to return from the colchuck fisheries at Fishery Bay where he had been with his people, was told that if he returned to Lek-halzep he might be killed, and that they wanted the mission house for a Methodist missionary. They did not want the Anglican Church any more. At that time it was necessary for me to protect the missionary referred to\u2014the Rev. Sylvester Bone, M.B., and I wrote a letter to the Chief Constable, making him aware of the consequences of intimidating the missionaries, also advising him that if the majority of the people were disposed of coming under the supervision of the Methodist Church so that his people did go in a civil and Christian-like manner, by taking their case to the Bishop, in which case I would do anything in my power to stand by the Indians' interests.\n\nIn view of these facts the Department will readily see the advisability dealing cautiously with this matter.\n\nI am also of the opinion that those Indians reported to have asked an Inspector over for a\nnew teacher have no children of their own, and have never evinced an interest either in the school or in the missionaries, resident at Kincolith.\n\nAnother important matter for the Department's consideration is, that the Venerable Archdeacon's is the only white people's home in Kincolith. It is not at all likely that if Miss Collison is deprived of the position as teacher the home of the Archdeacon will be open for the accommodation of her successor, in which case it would be necessary for the Department to erect a house for another teacher on the reserve, besides having to pay a much larger salary for a more competent teacher.\n\nWhile Miss Collison is young I have never doubted her efficiency as a teacher. In fact she has had a good education herself, and is thoroughly conversant with the languages of the Indians. The fact that while the Zak-Kalazap mission was furnished with no less than fourteen different teachers and missionaries, in most instances at the request of the people, should convince the Department these Indians of the near villages will ask for a new teacher whether that teacher is efficient or not, and are glad when they are able to give missionaries subsequently appointed with the fact that \"we shifted Mr. So-and-so and we can shift you too if we like\". Thus catering to the whimsical spasms of the Indians has a tendency to lessen the influence of the teachers, and their lot is not by any means pleasant.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop has recently asked the missionaries to interchange their respective fields. The programme is that the Venerable Archdeacon Collison remove to Letiakatla, the Rev. J. R. de Cullagh, of Aiyansh, to Kincolith, the Rev. Mr Price, of Citwanger, to Aiyansh and appoint a new man for Citwanger. I would, therefore, recommend that the Department defer its decision in the matter of a successor to Miss Collison until the way appears more favourable for a change. If, however, the Dep-\nartment still wishes me to take the matter up with Bishop Du Vernet I will do so on receipt of your instructions.\n\nI have the honor to beg,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This brings the salary up fully to the average paid in British Columbia and, taking into consideration the attendance and the number of days that the school is kept open during the year, this is a very fair salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. H. Collison,\nKincolith,\nNass Mouth, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn reference to a letter from Venerable Archdeacon Collison regarding the salary paid at the Kincolith School, as stated in this letter, the salary is $400.00 per annum. Mr. Collison makes reference to Massett where a salary of $900.00 is paid, but you will see from the attached schedule, showing the schools and salaries, that this and Metlakatla are the only schools in British Columbia where $75.00 a month is paid and it should be remembered that the teacher at Massett has to change his location when the Indians go to the canneries. This entails considerable trouble and expense. The enrolment also at each of these two schools is more than double that at Kincolith and during the past year the Kincolith School was only open 148 days owing to the absence of the Indians. Late reports on Miss Collison's work are very favourable, but in 1911 Mr. Green, the Inspector, recommended that an experienced teacher, properly qualified, be secured for this village. I do not think that the attendance and length of time the school was kept open would justify\njustify the Department in paying the salary asked by the Archdeacon, but an increase to $500.00 might be allowed. In view of the fact that the teacher is a daughter of the Archdeacon I cannot see how he makes any claim to have borne part of the burden of the salary himself.\n\nA.F.

C., August 12, 1913.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Pedley:\n\nI enclose you a letter from Archibald W. A. Collison, as you know one who has spent his life Northern Country and from his letter I see no reason why his school should not get the consideration as others and I trust that you will see that his request is granted. I often think, as the Ministers realize when they traverse that Northern Country, that with the conditions which exist, that every consideration should be given in such requests. I trust that you will not forget to give this favorable consideration.\n\nWith best wishes, I am\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 817-1, part 1)\nNincolith,\n\nMrs. Clements Esq., M.D.P.\n\nDear Mrs. Clements,\n\nAugust 19th, 1913.\n\nPermit me to write you a line in regard to a matter in which a few words from you will affect much.\n\nIt is in regard to the position of School Teacher for our Indian Day School here. At Morissett and several other Indian Day Schools in your constituency the teachers are in receipt of Sixty and Seventy Dollars per month whereas whilst here at Nincolith only One hundred Fifteen Per Quarter or some $833.75 per person has been allowed. It is unnecessary for me to inform you that no teacher can exist on such an allowance as this.\n\nI therefore beg to ask you if you will be so good as to represent this to the proper quarter and to state that under present circumstances a teacher cannot meet living expenses here under $60 per person. Distinctly have borne part of the burden myself but now that the Department is allowing sufficient to other schools, it is time that a similar allowance be made to this School also, especially that the report of the Inspector has always been most satisfactory.\n\nThanking you most sincerely for your favour\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Collison (signature)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. (?), dated the 16th instant, concerning the child whom I had vacate the Kincolith Indian Day School on account of her sickness. I beg to say that Dr. MacDonald, the Reserve Medical Officer, resides in the village of Kincolith and has the child under observation. He will see that proper attention is given the child.\n\nI should have mentioned this when reporting on the subject, but this was an oversight.\n\nAt the time of my having the child leave the school, I called the doctor's attention to her case, and he promised to have the child properly cared for.\n\nI thank you for your instructions in this connection.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Mc Donald has also written stating that the disease he thinks has got beyond his control. He advises that the school remained closed until the epidemic has passed.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a requisition for school materials for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 16th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your remark in your report for October on the Kincolith Indian Day School to the effect that a female child in attendance at the school was suffering from running sores which had a most offensive odour; I beg to say that the Department approves of your having had the child removed from the school in order that her condition should not be a menace to the health of the pupils, but it is thought you should have endeavoured to make some arrangements for the care of the child. You state you told the teacher to return her to her home. It is unlikely that this unfortunate child will receive proper care in her home unless special attention is given to her case. The Department desires that you will look into the matter immediately. If there is a field matron residing within the district in which the child resides, she may be able to give her proper care and attention and if not, it may be advisable to have the girl sent to an hospital. The Department desires that you will take action in the matter immediately in the best interests of the child, but you should bear in mind that no unnecessary expense is to be incurred. You may send the child to the Hospital at Prince Rupert if you consider it necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nC.S. Perry Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n\nAsst.

The Department would like to see more improvement in the school before considering the question of an increase for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. D.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir;\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 22nd, No. 119496/8, with reference to increase of salary for Miss Alice M. Collinson, I beg to say that I advised her to apply for an increase through Mr. Agent Perry.\n\nMiss Collinson has been teaching this school nearly three years. Early in her term as teacher, Mr. Perry, the Agent, found some irregularities in connection with the conduct of the school. This was threshed out at the time. It was before I was Inspector so that I am not able to give you the details.\n\nI wish now to state frankly how I have found her work. She has a good education but no training as a teacher. She is faithful in her work and keeps the class-room clean, tidy, and attractive.\n\nThere are 53 pupils enrolled. The average attendance for the six months ended March 31, 1916 was 70.\n\nShe is now receiving $500.00 per annum. In my judgment she is entitled to an increase of $100.00 per annum. The increase to begin with October 1st, 1916.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOttawa, June 8, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Kincolith Indian Day School for the month of May last, in which you state that Miss Collison, the teacher, has asked for an increase of salary. I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to grant her any increase at the present time and you will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Original on 119496/7.\n\nMiss Collison has asked for an increase of salary, and informed me that this proposal had been made to the Inspector, Mr. Cairns, and he had promised to recommend an increase.\n\nI am satisfied that Miss Collison is putting forth all possible efforts to make her school a success.\nOttawa, May 23, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Kindelith Day School in which you state that Miss Collinson, the teacher, thinks she should have one hundred dollars per annum increase in salary I beg to say that Miss Collinson should forward her application for an increase to the Department through the office of the Indian Agent. Kindly state whether you consider she should be given an increase or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. H. Oains,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 14,\n249 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Kincolith Day School dated April 27, 1916. Original on 119496-6\n\nAlice Mary Collinson, No certificate. She has taught this school for about three years. Salary $500.00 per annum. Age 34 years. Miss Collinson thinks she should have one hundred dollars per annum increase in salary.\n\nSgd. R H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with your request contained in your letter #II9496/I, dated November 13/20, I now beg to enclose Dr. McDonald's medical report showing the result of the examination of the pupils of the Kincolith Indian Day school.\n\nIt will be noted from the report that no deaths from Tuberculosis occurred among the children regularly attending the school during the summer.\n\nThe two cases referred to by the Doctor had evidently contracted the disease elsewhere and were brought back to the village where they died.\n\nIn the case of Abel Angus, where the Doctor has advised against his attending school, instructions to this effect have been sent to the School teacher.\n\nThe floor of the School room will need two coats of good paint; I would therefore ask permission to purchase sufficient paint for the purpose.\n\nThe painting of the floor will not only have a very sanitary effect, but will also make it easier to clean.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

F. MacKensie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Kincolith Indian Day School, dated October 3, 1920. Original on 119496-6\n\nDuring the summer one pupil was drowned and two died of consumption. Dr. McDonald dwells in the village of Kincolith. He might be asked by the Department to examine the pupils of the school and report.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 22, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report of the 7th instant regarding the establishment of the boarding school system in your agency I beg to say that the Department cannot consider this matter at the present time, as there are no funds available for the purpose.\n\nIt is hoped that the difficulty in recruiting children from your agency to the Lytton Industrial School on account of the recent death of two pupils will be overcome and that the Indian parents will continue to take advantage of the educational facilities provided at that school as vacancies occur.\n\nThe death of the two children mentioned by you is regretted, but it is considered that this is not the fault of the school. There is no doubt that every care and attention was given them by the Principal and staff during their illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nNass River Agency,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nJune 7th, 1920.\n\nSir:\n\nThe boarding school system is without doubt the best system for obtaining results. It would be still better if the system were introduced into each Agency, as there is a growing feeling especially in the Nass River Agency against sending the children to boarding schools that are at a great distance from the homes of the children. This attitude has lately been emphasized to a great extent by the death of a promising Indian lad from Lakkalzap whilst in the care of the Lytton Industrial School. This case following so closely upon the death last year of a former pupil from Kincolith, in the same institution will make it most difficult if not impossible to induce the Indians to send their children to the Lytton Industrial school in future.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Sgn. W.E. Collison.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, May 17, 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report for the month of April last on the Kincolith Indian Day School, in which you suggest that prizes be granted each year in order to encourage good attendance and progress in studies, I beg to say that the Department in cases allows a small grant for the purchase of prizes for this purpose which are usually given to the children upon the closing of the school for the summer holidays.\n\nIn the case of the Kincolith school, the Department will be prepared to allow the sum of $10.00 to purchase prizes for the pupils having the best record of attendance and progress in studies during the year. If you consider it advisable to do so in the case of this school, you may expend a sum not to exceed the above amount in the purchase of suitable prizes for the two children showing the best record of attendance and for the two making the best progress in their work in school.\n\nIt should be understood that a grant for prizes cannot be made for every school as each case is dealt with on its merits.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Kincardine Indian School\nfor the month of April, 1920. Original on 119496-7\n\nAttendance was small owing to the exodus of the people from\nthe village x x x x\n\nI would offer as a suggestion that it might be a good thing\nto offer one or two prizes each year to the pupils for the\nbest progress and attendance. This would, I believe, be an\nincentive to further effort and be an encouragement to the\nchildren.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nAgent,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 817-1, part 1)\nI have the honour to submit to you my report and Diary for the month of February, 1920.\n\nRegular reports have been received from the Kincolith and Lekgulzap Indian day schools. The daily attendance from now on will fluctuate as the parents come and go from the villages. I regret to have to report that Miss Sturges, School teacher and Miss Gaynor, field worker, at Lekgulzap have signified their intention to leave about the end of September next. They have been in the employ of the Department for about five years and it will be difficult to find suitable people to fill their place owing to the isolation of the village, especially during the winter months. I would suggest to the Department that when the time comes to fill this place, that a man and his wife would be best suited for Lekgulzap.\n\nW.S. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nNass River Indian Agency,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nFebruary 11th, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith my report and Diary for the month of January, together with receipts for expenditure in connection with travelling for that month.\n\nOn Friday, January 9th, I visited the Kincolith Indian Day School which is taught by Miss Collison. I found the school well kept and the pupils clean and tidy. Whilst the attendance might be better, the real difficulty in connection with the problem of school attendance, not only at Kincolith, but also other Indian Day schools in the Agency, is largely caused by the fact that as the Coast opens up and various industries are established, offering work to the Indians, the parents remain away from the villages for longer periods than formerly with the result that the education of the children is neglected just at an age when they should be at school. To my mind the best way of meeting these new conditions is by sending as many children as possible to Indian boarding schools which are under the complete control and supervision of the Government. When the Royal Commission visited the Nass River in 1915 I believe the establishment of a boarding and industrial school for the Nass was recommended.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nTo Duncan Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sorry to have troubled you with my last letter, now that I find that I have so kindly refused any salary.\n\nUp to the 16th of this month I had only received the one cheque from Ottawa. So I concluded that some change had been made for the Sept quarter, until I received another cheque from Indian Agent Perry.\nOttawa, November 27, 1915.\n\nSIR,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Alice M. Collison, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, in which she applies for an increase in her salary.\n\nMiss Collison has been informed that the Department has decided to increase her salary to $600.00 per annum and that she will be paid at this rate from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I am only allowed $125.00 a quarter, which I am sure you will agree with me, no teacher paying house rent etc., could possibly manage to live on.\n\nFor the quarter ending September 30th, I received $75.00 without any explanation.\nhome for Christmas.\n\nat the present time when the cost of living is so high. I am sure you will understand any situation.\n\nHoping this will receive your favourable consideration.\n\nI remain Sir\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nAlice M.

Collison, Teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, this Department is favourably disposed to grant her a small increase in salary. Miss Collison has taught at this school for more than 6 years and, although she has no professional certificate, it is considered that her qualifications are satisfactory.\n\nBefore granting an increase, the Department would be pleased to have your recommendation.

She was appointed teacher of this school April 1st, 1914, at a salary of $500.00 per annum, which was increased to $600.00, the amount at present paid her, from October 1st, 1913. She has also been receiving the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum, making a combined salary and bonus of $750.00. She has no professional qualifications. She received her education in England.\n\nThe Inspector states that she is very faithful in her duties and that she would do better had she been trained for her work. The progress is fair, considering the nomadic habits of the parents of the children, which is a great handicap to progress being made.\n\nMiss Collison, in her letter, states that, while she is not a duly licensed teacher, it does not mean that her education is inferior to some who are classed as fully qualified and that, through her length of service, she is fully conversant with the Indian child's habits and modes of thought and has their confidence. She states that the salary she receives now is barely sufficient to pay for her board.\n\nShe is no doubt earnest and faithful in her duties and I would judge from the reports received that she is doing as good work as some of the other teachers who are qualified and receive a higher salary. I would recommend that she be granted an increase from the first of April, next, of $100.00 per annum. This is submitted for your consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 817-1, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nOn repeated occasions I have made application for an increase in my salary as teacher in the Kinoshit School, but as my efforts have been unsuccessful, I am writing to you direct, trusting that your department will do me the justice which has so long been denied.\n\nI fail to understand why I should be expected to teach for half the salary that all the other teachers receive. My school is as large as the others and I give it practically all my time, and as to progress, I am in a position to observe that the intellectual development shown by pupils from this school is fully up to that of the best of the others.\n\nWhy then should I receive just half of what the others receive besides their extra for fuel, etc.? No amount is barely sufficient to pay for my board, and although I live at home, I can not...\nvery well as a government employee, except too much on the charity or friends who like the great majority have their own struggles for existence.\n\nTwo explanations have been given to me. A few years ago as to the reasons for the small salary.\n\nOne was that \"This was a mission School. This is entirely incorrect, as the mission exercises no jurisdiction whatever over the school or myself, but is in all ways treated as an independent government institution.\"\n\nThe other explanation was that \"I was not a duly licensed teacher.\" While this is a fact, it does not mean that my education is inferior to that of some of those who are classed as fully qualified, and I think it is of far greater value to be conversant with the Indian child's habits and modes of thought, as well as to have his confidence that the efforts put forth are for his own benefit.\n\nFurthermore, I know of other teachers in the neighboring agencies who are not qualified but yet who receive the full salary which makes it appear as\nIf I were singled out for special treatment,\nI trust that you will see the justice\nof my request and accord me similar treat-\nment to the other teachers.\n\nI am\n\nyours respectfully,\n\nAlice M Collison\nTeacher.\nOttawa, February 17, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant enclosing the medical report on the pupils of the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nAny children requiring the services of a doctor should receive proper medical attention.\n\nThe Department will approve of the purchase of a sufficient quantity of material to give the floor of the school-room two coats of paint. In the purchase of this paint competitive prices should be obtained, if possible, and the labour in having the painting done should be performed as cheaply as possible. When this work is completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the paint and for the labour required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Collison, teacher of the school at Kingslet, I beg leave to say that I think an increase of salary would be quite the right thing. It would be an expression of appreciation of the long and faithful service rendered by Miss Collison.\n\nIf I may be permitted to make a suggestion, I would recommend that she receive an increase of $100.00 per annum from and after the 1st of October.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools of British Columbia.\nOttawa, November 3rd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to inform you that the Department is approving of an increase of $100 per annum in the salary of Miss A. M. Collison, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, from the 1st of October, last. This will make her salary from the above date at the rate of $800 per annum, and she will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law.\n\nMr. Agent Collison is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 42, Post Office Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOTTAWA, November 3rd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to our communication of the 2nd ultimo regarding an increase in salary to Miss A. M. Collison, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, I now beg to inform you that Mr. Inspector Cairns recommends that an increase of $100 per annum be granted from the 1st of October, last.\n\nI have, therefore, to inform you that the Department will approve of an increase at the above rate being granted Miss Collison. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $800 per annum. She will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law. I would be pleased if you would inform her accordingly.\n\nThis increase in salary is being granted as an appreciation of the long and faithful service rendered by Miss Collison.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Miss A.M. Collison has sent in her resignation as teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School and has asked on account of personal matters to be relieved of her duties at the earliest opportunity. In consequence, I have asked Mrs. E.G. Newnham to carry on the school work until a new teacher has been appointed. I would recommend that this be done as soon as possible, and, in this connection, I beg to transmit an application received from Mrs. Newnham for the position.\n\nMrs. Newnham is the wife of Constable Newnham whose headquarters are at Kincolith, and is a capable teacher having been in charge of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School before her marriage to Constable Newnham.\n\nI would highly recommend her application both on account of her fitness for the position, and the fact that Kincolith is a difficult place to fill as it is a purely Indian village, and the appointment of an outsider would necessitate the building of a teacher's residence\u2014an added expense which the Department may not wish to incur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWEC/NJ.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLincoln,\nNass River, B.C.\nJan. 22nd 1925.\n\nMr. W.

There is however, still room for improvement in the Kincolith Indian Day school. The Indians were informed during my last visit to this reserve that unless improvement takes place the Department might consider closing the school.\n\nW. H. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 29th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, recommending the appointment of Miss Ada Martin for the position as teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School for the coming school year. In this connection, I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of yesterday's date:-\n\n\"Appointment Miss Ada Martin as teacher Kincolith Indian Day School approved for next school year STOP Salary allowed one hundred dollars per teaching month.\"\n\nThe qualifications which Miss Martin possesses have been noted and it is hoped that she will meet with every success in her work at this school. I have to request that you will give her any assistance you can. It is also hoped that there will be a more regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Her testimonials and Inspector's reports are satisfactory. She has been engaged at the rate of $1,000.00 per annum, for ten teaching months, the same as Miss Young, the previous teacher. Miss Martin was recommended by the Department of Education at Victoria, and has been communicated with. I shall be glad to receive the Department's confirmation at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st inst. relative to Constable Newnham's report regarding non-attendance at the Kincolith Indian Day School, I would state that so far as I am aware there has been no refusal on the part of the parents to send their children to school.\n\nI would not recommend prosecution of parents until a proper investigation has been made. Constable Newnham is rather inclined to magnify conditions which at Kincolith are no different than at other villages where attendance is usually erratic owing to the movements of the Indians.\n\nConstable Newnham was appointed by me as Truant Officer, and the attendance at Kincolith should therefore have been even better than at other schools in the agency where there are no truant officers. However, I am in correspondence with Constable Newnham concerning the matter and shall obtain further particulars from him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIn the report of E.

Persuasive measures with the parents, guardians or persons with whom children are residing are of no use whatever.\"\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views regarding the suggestion of the constable, stating whether you would advise that action be taken under Section 10 (4) against the Indian parents who refuse to send their children regularly to school. For the purpose of enforcing the Section of the Act referred to, the Dominion Constable could serve the required notice to the parents. You might state whether or not if action were taken in the case of one or two of the parents it would lead to a more regular attendance at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The qualifications which Miss Young possesses are satisfactory, and the Department will approve of her appointment for the coming school year, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month. Please advise Miss Young of her appointment, and arrange with her to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays. It is hoped that she will meet with success in the work, and I shall be pleased if you will give her every assistance you can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

She has had one year's teaching experience in the Hulatt white public school, and I enclose copy of her last inspector's report which is very satisfactory. Miss Young is familiar with life in an Indian village and is qualified for the work. In view of the fact that the school is a large one with an attendance of over 50 during the winter months I would recommend that she be allowed $100.00 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nInspector's Report.\n\nCharacter of teaching - Good.\nSchool management and control, Good\nGrading and standing of pupils.

I would recommend that the teacher's salary be paid to the end of the quarter.\n\nA requisition for school material is also enclosed, and I would be glad if the material asked for is forwarded in due course.\n\nI regret to state that Miss Green has resigned from this school. Steps will be taken to find a new teacher in time for the September quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC, JJ\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit my report for the months of October and November.\n\nKincolith:\n\nArriving at Kincolith on Saturday evening, October 13th, I remained there until the arrival of the weekly steamer on the following Monday. Visits were made to the Kincolith Indian Day School which is in charge of Miss Helen Green. As many of the Indian families are still away at their fishing camps, attendance was smaller than usual. Miss Green is giving good service and notwithstanding the drawback of an irregular attendance which most discouraging to the teacher, a fair progress is maintained.\n\nArrangements were made for the construction of a new wooden boarding in front of the school and other repairs.\n\nW. G. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Miss S.

Miss Green holds a second class B.C. certificate and has had previous experience. The Department is approving of her appointment, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month. Miss Green began duties on the 16th of September, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 602, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, October 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, informing the Department of the resignation of Miss S. Shopland, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, and nominating the services of Miss Helen Green to succeed her. It is considered that you should have informed the Department at an early date of the resignation of Miss Shopland. It is presumed that she gave up duties at the beginning of the summer holidays.\n\nThe qualifications which Miss Green possesses have been noted and are satisfactory. The Department will approve of her appointment from the 16th of September, last. The full amount of salary we can allow is at the rate of $100 per teaching month. Miss Shopland was allowed salary at the rate of $105 per teaching month after two years' service. This is the maximum salary we allow at this school, and we are not prepared, on the appointment of a new teacher, to allow the maximum salary. A cheque to the amount of $50, being salary for one-half month, will be forwarded to Miss Green for her services from the 16th of September, last. Please inform Miss Green of her appointment and the salary allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. F.

Her Inspector's report regarding her work at Squilax Day School where she taught six months, and references as to her character and ability are satisfactory.\n\nI would recommend that she receive $108.00 per month as was paid to Miss Shopland.\n\nMiss Green arrived at Kincolith September 16th although school was not opened until the 24th on account of most of the children being still away from the village, and the prevalence of whooping cough.\n\nHer report for the September quarter is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC JJ.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to an application which you have received for an increase in the salary of Miss S. Shopland, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that it has been decided to increase her salary to $105 a teaching month, this increase to date from April first next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Shopland, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, I find that she began duties at this school on September 16th, 1925. She has a second class B.C. teacher's certificate but had no teaching experience previous to entering our employ. Mr. Cairns visited this school on September 26th, 1925, just after the teacher began duties, and reported that she appeared enthusiastic about her work. He has not reported on this school since that date.\n\nIn his letter, the Agent refers to Gitladamix and Lakalsap Schools, and the following gives a comparison of the work at the three schools:\n\n| Name of School | Average enrolment Jan. 1 to Dec. 31/26 | Aver. Attendance Jan. 1 to Dec. 31/26 | Salary |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Kincolith      | 41                                     | 22                                   | $950   |\n| Lakalsap       | 31                                     | 22                                   | $1050  |\n| Gitladamix     | 33                                     | 20                                   | $500   |\n\nAt Lakalsap, there is a residence for the teacher, but no such accommodation is provided at Kincolith.\n\nThe last named school was only open for part of the year.\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Miss S. Shopland, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, asking for an increase in her salary.\n\nAt the present time she is receiving $950.00 per annum without any allowances which is $10.00 per month less than that paid to teachers of the Citlakdamix and Greenville schools besides allowances, although the enrolment at each of the schools mentioned, and the nature of the work, is much the same.\n\nMiss Shopland has been in charge of the Kincolith school for two years, during which time she has given every satisfaction.\n\nI would, therefore, suggest that her salary be raised to $1050.00 per annum as paid to the teachers of the previously mentioned schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss S. Shorland as teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nWe understand that you interviewed Miss Shorland before she proceeded north to take up duties. The salary allowed her is at the rate of $950.00 per annum based on ten teaching months in the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H.

Shorland as teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School and stating the qualifications which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Shorland. The full salary we can allow her is at the rate of $950.00 per annum based on ten teaching months in the year. This is the full salary allowed her predecessor, Mrs. Newnham. I may say that the bonus was discontinued from April 1st last and the same has from date been included in the salary. Please state the date upon which Miss Shorland began duty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.,\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to request the Department's approval and confirmation of the appointment of Miss S. Shopland to take charge of the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Shopland was engaged after consultation with Mr. Inspector Cairns who with myself interviewed her in Vancouver before she came north. Miss Shopland has a second class B.C. teacher's certificate, has had no previous teaching experience, but is capable and should be well able to carry out the requirements of her work.\n\nSalary was arranged at $900.00 per annum and bonus, if allowed. This is subject to the Department's approval.\n\nThere was some difficulty in obtaining accommodation for the teacher, and it may be necessary to put up a small three-roomed teacher's house on the school lot next year. Fortunately, as Miss Shopland is a cousin of Constable Newnham's Mr. Newnham was able to provide temporary accommodation only--their own quarters being very small.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEG, JJ.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report the resignation of Mrs. E.G. Newnham, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, which took effect on the 30th of June last.\n\nAs it will be necessary to appoint a new teacher as soon as one can be found suitable for the position I shall be glad to receive the necessary authority to proceed in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 14th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nAs Mrs. Newnham, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, has formally submitted notice of her intention to resign, it will be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher for the next school year to begin duties when the school reopens. I would, therefore, request that you will endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher at an early date. It would be advisable to consult Mr. Inspector Cairns, who may be able to assist you in obtaining the services of a teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicant received should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. The salary allowed will depend upon the qualifications which the teacher possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E.

COLLISON, INDIAN AGENT, PRINCE RUPERT, FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, ON THE KINCOLITH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nMrs. Newnham, the teacher, has formally submitted notice of her intention to resign. This is to be regretted as she was a very capable teacher. The question of appointing a new teacher will be taken up with the Department.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nFeb. 25th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report as follows for the month of January.\n\nOn account of the resignation of Miss Collison from the Kincolith Day School which took effect on the first of the month, Mrs. Mabel Newnham has been appointed to take her place.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, February 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 8 F of the 28th ultimo, informing the Department of the resignation of Miss A. M. Collison, the teacher of the Lincolith Indian Day School. I have noted that Mrs. E. G. Newnham is, at your request, undertaking the duties temporarily until there is an official appointment. When the March quarter return for this school is being forwarded, it should clearly indicate the number of days taught by each teacher, so that the salary can be adjusted properly.\n\nI note that there is no residence available for a teacher at this day school and that the appointment of Mrs. Newnham will result in the conduct of the school at a minimum expense. This teacher has been successful in her former services for this Department and your action is approved. She will be allowed a total salary at the rate of $950 for the ten teaching months, which will include any bonus which may be provided. If, at any time, she is unable to give the full time that is required of a teacher, you should make a report and her services will be discontinued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., March 24, 1931\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report as follows for the month of February.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe day schools have been operating successfully with the exception of the Kincolith Indian Day School at which the attendance is poor. This place needs a particularly capable and energetic teacher, which is difficult to obtain. The work is discouraging to a young and inexperienced teacher, and as Miss Hartin, the present teacher has asked for an exchange, I hope it will be possible to appoint someone able to handle the situation, to ensure a better attendance.\n\nW.

Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nKincolith, Nass River, B.C.,\nJuly 2nd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward my Monthly Report for June 1931.\n\nReplying to the letter addressed to me by the Indian Commissioner for B.C. dated June 22nd, 1931, file number 11/21632 in regard to the third paragraph of my report for May 1931, which deals with school attendance at Kincolith, I would state that this matter is one of great difficulty and was the subject of a report by me dated March 11th, 1930, Indian Agent's file S-E-1446. This report was not replied to and no authority was given in connection with a suggestion made in the last paragraph of the said report, consequently I am quite powerless to adequately deal with the matter.\n\nThe matter of rounding up children, playing truant on their own volition for which the parents are in no way to blame, is a simple one and has no connection with the difficulty referred to which is entirely to do with the neglect and indifference on many of the parents and guardians. Some complication was caused by the present teacher at Kincolith reporting for the month of April 1931, that the attendance was satisfactory, while I had reported that it was not. This difference of opinion was probably due to the fact, that the lady was inside the school, marking pupils present, whenever they arrived\u2014sometime during the day while I was on the outside resorting to many different methods in order to get them there.\n\nIn regard to cases of absence where the children are not found on the streets during school hours or not readily located, although not absent from the village, I have to depend to some extent on information supplied by the teacher and owing to the fact that the lady is compelled to reside in my house, I have heard more of this than, probably, I would have done otherwise. From October 1930 to March 1931, the lady took every opportunity of complaining of the poor attendance and other matters to me, but evidently not to the Indian Agent. I have advised the lady, that her best policy is to officially report on matters affecting her duties, accurately and that I have gone to the limit of my powers in order to assist her. The Kincolith Day school has now been closed two weeks and it would of course, be premature to state whether this problem will arise next session, or not.\n\nE. G. Newnham.\nDominion Constable.\nKincolith, Nass River B.C., Sept. 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit my monthly report for September 1931.\n\nThe Kincolith Day school re-opened on September 1st, and making all due allowance for the fact that the Indians are not generally settled in yet, conditions as applied to those who are in the village are exactly the same in regard to school matters as those referred to in my report for May last. I have informed the teacher that I can do no more than I have done in the matter and advised her to lay the whole case before the Indian agent and the Inspector of Indian schools when they visit here shortly. I am preparing a number of prosecutions under Section 10, Indian Act, as the situation calls for drastic action.\n\nX X X\n\nT. G. Newnham,\nDominion Constable.\nEXTRACT from Report of Mr. Indian Agent Collison for the month of January, 1932 regarding the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 168-37-7.\n\nThe report for January shows an average attendance of 28.75; this is not satisfactory considering the number of pupils on the roll.\n\nFive pupils were reported during the month as delinquent in their attendance; those attending have made fair progress in their studies.\n\nConditions at this school are not very satisfactory, whilst Miss Hartin is very conscientious and is doing the best she can under somewhat discouraging conditions, she does not seem to have been able to get hold of the children. This has been made more difficult by the fact that the parents are inclined to be indifferent regarding the attendance of their children at school.\nEXTRACT from Indian Agent Collison's Report for the Month of March, 1932, regarding the KINCOLITH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on file 168-37-7.\n\nWhilst Miss Martin, the present teacher, is doing the best she can, I believe the school would make better progress under a male teacher.\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nADVISABLE TO DISPENSE SERVICES MISS ADA HARTIN TEACHER KINCOLITH DAYSCHOOL UNABLE MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS AS INDIANS HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN TEACHER STOP AM ARRANGING INSPECTION WITH CAPTAIN BARRY THIS WEEK AND REQUEST AUTHORITY BY WIRE TO TERMINATE SERVICES SHOULD INSPECTOR CONCUR STOP MORE SATISFACTORY TEACHERS AVAILABLE\n\nW E COLLISON.\nOttawa, June 1, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your telegram of the 31st ultimo, recommending that the services of Miss Ada Martin, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, be dispensed with, as she is unable to maintain satisfactory attendance and the Indians have lost confidence in her.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department considers it inadvisable to make a change in teacher for the balance of the present school year. If, however, Inspector Barry and yourself consider that her services should terminate immediately, you may so inform her and the school can remain closed during the balance of the present month and also during the regular summer holiday period. In any case, she should be notified that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year, viz., the 30th instant. You should see that Miss Martin prepares the quarterly return of attendance and forwards same to the Department, through your office, in order that payment of salary due her can be made.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher to succeed Miss Martin, I would request that you take this matter up with Mr. Inspector Barry, and nominate the services of a fully qualified teacher. Full particulars should be forwarded recording the qualifications, experience and address of the teacher nominated by you. It is noted from your telegram that the services of satisfactory teachers are available. In your report on this school for the month of March, last, you stated you were of opinion that better progress would be made if a male teacher were appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI shall be glad to know if the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Edith Aylwin to the Kincolith Indian Day School, in place of Miss Ada Martin who has resigned.\n\nMiss Aylwin's transfer from the Massett school has been recommended by Inspector Barry as he states it is uncertain as to whether her former classroom at the Massett school is to be reopened.\n\nAs the time is short and it is necessary to notify Miss Aylwin in good time, I shall be glad to receive a wire confirming this appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWEC, JJ\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, July 31, 1933.\n\nW.

In this connection I have to confirm the following night telegram of today's date:\n\n\"Appointment Miss Edith Aylwin, teacher Kincolith Day School approved. Salary one hundred dollars per teaching month, less ten per cent.\"\n\nYou should inform Miss Aylwin of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on September 5th, next. I would request that you give this teacher every possible assistance in her work at the Kincolith School, where it is hoped she will meet with success.\n\nI may add that Mr. C. C.

Reports of my work have been sent you by Inspector Barry.\nBefore coming here I was at the Massett Day School. I have also taught five and a half years in Indian Residential\nSchools and two and a half in public schools. I have a Second Class Certificate for this province and several Summer School Diplomas.\n\nMy reason for desiring a change is that I would like a place where my mother could keep house for me.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdith M.

I regret, therefore, being unable at the present time to arrange for a transfer or to offer any assurance that we will be able to comply with your request. Should you be aware of any vacancy that may occur at a school to which you would like to be transferred, you might again write the Department. There might be some difficulty, however, with regard to salary rating and suitable living quarters.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Edith M. Aylwin,\nKincolith,\nB. C.\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\nThe Anglican Synod\nof the\nDIOCESE OF CALEDONIA\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nNovember 21st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to remind you of much that you probably already know. I am more than ordinarily pleased with the staff of teachers in charge of the Native Day Schools in the Diocese of Caledonia. I have had the privilege of visiting nearly all of them recently and everyone of them seems to be doing well.\n\nMiss Aylwin of Kincolith has a most satisfactory school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nKincolith, B.C.\nMay 10, 1937.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Holy,\n\nThank you for your letter. I gathered from it that you are a link between officialdom and the scattered teachers on the reserve. It is nearly eleven years since I began teaching Indian children so perhaps if I still have a few of my ideas on the subject you may find a grain or two of wisdom in this letter which is not written as a report or criticism but as one worker to another in the same field.\n\nTo begin with I entirely agree with your idea that\nmore time ought to be devoted to manual occupations. I feel convinced that vocational, practical training is more important to our Indians (and to most white children too) than purely academic work. Of course I believe everyone ought to be able to read and perhaps write a simple letter (or order to Eaton's), but I mean beyond that.\n\nActing on this idea I have spent one afternoon a week teaching the girls sewing and kindred arts. We have a sewing machine and several pupils have turned out wearable garments. No child is allowed to use the machine until her hand sewing passes muster. Some artistic and colorful embroideries have been done too and some knitting.\n\nAs there seemed no official means of obtaining materials I used some petty money to buy the first lot.\nthen we had a sale and bought more material which has been made up ready for another sale next week.\n\nFor some reason there are not many school age boys in this village so I just taught them such things as sewing on buttons and simple basketry. There are quite a number of little boys who will soon be going to school and some provisions will have to be made for them.\n\nAbout the follow-up system I have no comprehensive plans. Many of the young married couples here are pupils I once taught, now at Alert Bay Residential School and very friendly relations exist between them and me.\n\nNow for a couple of suggestions for this particular school. I do hope there will soon be a playground for the children. The school lot\nis 200 feet long but it is covered all over by trees, bushes, and dead brush. The children and I did as much towards cleaning it up as our strength would allow but it was a hopeless task.\n\nA board walk runs through the grounds to a little platform in front of the door. This walk, in places three feet or more from the ground, is all the school playground for my 52 pupils unless they cross the creek or go off in front of the church. The \"lardy\" problem is ever present. If the grounds were cleared we could have a flagpole and a flag.\n\nAs my classroom is used for Sunday School, a small organ has been lent to us. I suggest that every school needs one.\n\nThen there is the problem of the school wood. Could not this item be included in the\nyearly estimate and same provision made for it? It is hard to ask a man to wait months for his pay and often most inconvenient for the teacher to advance the money and wait months for a refund.\n\nTaken all round though, this is not a bad little school. I feared much worse in my last white school. In many ways I shall be sorry to leave it but I hope to go to one near Merritt, B.C. (in Mr. Barber's agency) next September.\n\nI hope this letter is not too long and that it is what you wanted me to do.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Miss) Edith M. Sylvain.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of June.\n\nMr. Norman Green, teacher of the Kincolith Indian day school is, I am informed, being nominated by Bishop Rix, for the position of teacher in the new day school at Kitwancool, Babine agency.

The Representative of the Treasury was immediately requested to issue cheque at the end of November in favour of Miss Saunders for her salary for the months of September, October and November. Cheque 41636 for $300.00 was forwarded to Miss Saunders on December 1, 1939. This cheque should have, and no doubt did reach her early in December. In addition cheque 4621 for $100.00 in payment of her salary for the month of December was mailed from here in time to reach Kincolith before the school closed for the Christmas holidays on December 21.\n\nYou will note from the above that as soon as the Department had definite information regarding the date on which Miss Saunders began duties arrangements\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nwere made to pay her for her services.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAt your request I have given considerable thought to the question of the necessity for a second teacher at the Kincolith Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency, as outlined in Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter S-E-13076 of the 11th of July.\n\nMiss Anne Saunders, an exceptionally fine teacher with many years experience, has explained the need for a second teacher for the months October to March inclusive during her visit to me this afternoon. There will be some sixty pupils in attendance and all Grades from 1 to 8 will be represented this next year. There is no doubt that for much of the six months mentioned above there will be some 50 pupils on the average in the schoolroom, and this is too much for any teacher when all Grades are represented.\n\nI believe that it would be well to have a second teacher at Kincolith for the six months October 1st to March 31st and consider that such a teacher could take the older pupils in the council hall mentioned by Miss Saunders and Mr. Gillett. A suitable salary would be $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nI do not consider that it would be necessary to provide desks or blackboard, and I consider that Mr. Gillett's estimate of $50.00 for fuel and $50.00 for janitor service might each be halved. I agree to his suggestion of $10.00 for stovepipe and sundry expenses and $60.00 for rent of the council hall.\n\nThe total expenses would therefore come to $650.00 for the present Fiscal Year, and I would ask that this sum be authorized if it can be found anywhere, though I must point out that there is no provision for it in the estimates.\n\nMay I ask that this matter be dealt with by air mail and telegram as Miss Saunders feels I believe unable to attempt the instruction of so many pupils by herself. She has carried out the wishes of the Department through a number of years and has herself increased the attendance at Kincolith by constant visits to the parents. I may say that the Kincolith parents are progressive and would much resent the idea of having the children attend on the Half Day System, which is my only alternative suggestion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 188-27-1 drawing attention to an entry in my diary for the month of December regarding a visit from Miss Saunders, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency, I would submit the following explanation.\n\nMail is taken to Kincolith from Vancouver and Prince Rupert twice a month only. In December 1938 the Union S.S. Catala leaving Vancouver on December 15th, in which no doubt cheque #186C for $300.00 went north, went aground off the Skeena River before reaching even Prince Rupert. After a delay this S.S. Catala did get as far as Prince Rupert but did not go on to Kincolith some sixty five or seventy miles further north.\n\nMail for Kincolith, the Nass River in general and for further north was taken by a special and additional sailing of the Union C.S. Cordona leaving Vancouver on December 22nd. The cheques for Miss Saunders for the $300.00 and also $100.00 would have reached Kincolith on Monday December 26th by the Union C.S. Cordona.\n\nAs Miss Saunders explained it to me she did not appear to be able to obtain satisfaction from Indian Agent Collison by letters and so leaving Kincolith on December 21st on land by tug boat in a storm and then transferring to a tug boat at sea and at night arrived in Prince Rupert in time to see Mr Collison and take the C.N.R.S. Prince Rupert sailing for Vancouver on the evening of December 22nd.\n\nMiss Saunders in her explanation to me said that Mr Collison had taken the matter of the non receipt of her salary up with the Department by telegram.\n\nMy advice to Miss Saunders was to the effect that if the matter had been taken up by telegram I was certain that the Department would rectify any mistake, and that she would probably find some $100.00 waiting for her on her return to Kincolith. I explained that it was not necessary for me to take the matter up with you. It was however mentioned in my diary to allow Mr Phelan to check up on the matter should he so desire.\n\nOfficials in Ottawa would not be aware of the accident to Union S.S. Catala the mail boat for Kincolith and as I wish to clear Miss Saunders of any unprofessional conduct, I have inquired into the matter with some care. I am not able to explain Indian Affairs' delay in forwarding the required information to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nPRINCE RUPERT, B. C.,\nFebruary 8th, 1945.\n\nYour File 168-37-1.\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 31st, I would suggest that if the attendance at the Kincolith School should drop below six in May, that I be authorized to close the school for June.\n\nThe school functioned in June of the academic year 1943-1944, and the average attendance then was 8.29.\n\nJ.

Gillett, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing new I.D.I form, forwarded by the teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School. This has been handed to the Treasury Branch.\n\nIn your letter of August 11, 1942, addressed to Indian Commissioner MacKay, you recommended that this school be in operation for a nine month period only, namely from September 1 to May 31. I presume that this arrangement was in effect for both the academic years 1942-43 and 1943-44. Do you consider that the same term should apply for the academic year 1944-45? As you are aware, funds are available for the payment of the teacher's salary for a 10 month term. Do you believe it advisable to keep the school open that length of time?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B. C.,\nJanuary 23, 1945.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReverend Norman Green, teacher at Kincolith Indian Day School, has recently had an increase in his family, hence the reason for the attached forms.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 168-37-1\n\nI am enclosing herewith Form T.D. 1, in duplicate, duly completed by Rev. Norman Green, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency, B.C.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI would refer to my letter of June 21, 1944, regarding Inspector Thorsteinsson's report on Kincolith Indian Day School and enclose herewith copy of my letter of the same date addressed to Indian Agent Gillett and his reply of the 24th instant.\n\nWhen Protestant teachers become more available than they are at the present time, I would suggest that consideration might be given to replacement of the Rev. Green by a qualified teacher. The writer visited this school three or four years ago and was impressed with the fact that the children had a very cowed attitude. Discussing manual training and domestic science with the teacher, it was noted that his attitude to this work was somewhat hostile. He stated that if he was required to undertake this he should be given an increase in salary.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncls.\nJune 21, 1944.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B. C.\n\nI enclose herewith Inspector H. Thorsteinsson's report on Kincolith Indian Day School and would call your attention to the low attendance reported, need for lumber for manual training and the position of the flag. It is felt that the teacher of this school should be able to keep the school surroundings in good shape, possibly a school garden project might keep them interested.\n\nThe Inspector's classification of the teacher's initiative management, teaching skill and preparation leaves very much to be desired, and it would be appreciated if you would advise me if any improvement can be expected, as it is not likely that we can expect any increase in pupil interest under the conditions outlined by the Inspector.\n\nYour observations in connection with this report will be appreciated.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nAugust 24, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe:- Kincolith School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 21st relative to Inspector B. Thorsteinsson's report of the above school, I doubt that much improvement can be expected so long as the teacher is also the clergyman.\n\nReferring to the low attendance, this matter was taken up with Reverend Norman Green when he called at the office recently, and every time I visited the school. He states emphatically that the children were not at the village but either at the canneries or elsewhere with their parents. It is true that since the Japanese left the Coast a number of Indians have been acting as watchmen at the various canneries, and a great number go to the canneries much earlier for repair work, sometimes as early as March, whereas before very few migrated until June.\n\nThere are forty-eight children at Kincolith who are of school age. According to Mr. Green's monthly reports, the highest number that were enrolled is 38. The average for the various months is listed hereunder:\n\n| Month    | On the Roll | Average attendance |\n|----------|-------------|--------------------|\n| September| 24          | 10.72              |\n| October  | 30          | 13.                |\n| November | 37          | 23.6               |\n| December | 36          | 22.75              |\n| January  | 32          | 26.14              |\n| February | 35          | 25.71              |\n| March    | 38          | 21.65              |\n| April    | 38          | 16.14              |\n| May      | 38          | 11.                |\n| June     | 38          | 8.29               |\nOttawa,\nAugust 20, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Kincolith Indian Day School No. 817\n\nFor the academic year 1942-43 this school will be in operation for the nine-month period September 1, 1942, to May 31, 1943, and payment of salary should be made to the teacher accordingly.\n\nR.A.

I would not recommend closing in April, as the conditions in the villages change from year to year. If, however, the attendance next fall is low, notice could be given that the school will have to close at the end of the month instead of May, unless there was some guarantee of a good average attendance of at least fifteen pupils.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

As a matter of fact we do not consider this as an \"Allowance\". The proper answer to the word \"Allowances\" on this form is \"Nil\". I attach new forms which you should have him complete and return as soon as possible.

This is the first intimation that the Department has received of this teacher's resignation. Please let me know definitely if her resignation has been received. If not, it is considered that in view of the information contained in the Inspector's report she should be advised that her services will not be required for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nPlease consult Rt. Rev. C. A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, with a view to having him nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Kincolith Indian Day School inspected on May 13, 1940.\n\nThe present teacher, Miss Bartle, has been a complete failure here, and has now resigned of her own will. The Indians have for some time been very anxious to get rid of her. She was nominated by the Right Reverend Bishop Rix in the first place and had previous Provincial experience.\n\nThe question of Miss Bartle's loyalty to the British Crown was brought to my attention in Prince Rupert by those outside the Department. Questioned by me Miss Bartle admitted she was a Christian Socialist, but stated she was loyal to the Government of Canada. She admitted she had perhaps talked too much. One of her grandparents was a German and she was believed by a number of Prince Rupert people to have strong German sympathy. I explained to her that while the Department does not question the right of teachers to support any particular party in the House of Commons it does expect its servants to be loyal to Canada and the Crown.\n\nMiss Bartle without any particular advice from me informed me that she had no intention of returning as she could not do the work here alone. I asked her to inform the Indian Agent of her decision, which she has now done.\n\nAs Miss Bartle has resigned there is little use making any further report on the unsatisfactory work done during the year. I hope that she will never again receive an appointment in any sort of Indian school. She had been most thoroughly informed by me of the work to be done in each Grade before she took up her appointment here, but she quite failed to carry out my wishes, mainly because she could not maintain control among either the older or younger pupils.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in which you advise that Mrs. Oliver Thorne who was appointed as teacher of the second class room at the Kincolith Indian Day School only remained on duty from February 7 to March 21 inclusive.\n\nIt has been decided to allow her salary at the rate of $800.00 a year and a cheque for the period she taught the second class room will go forward under separate cover.\n\nAs the present academic year will soon be completed the Department considers it undesirable to appoint another teacher at the present time as it is felt that Miss Bartle can handle the school until the end of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 2, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nOwing to increased attendance it was found necessary to employ a second teacher at the Kincolith Indian Day School. Mrs. Oliver Thorne was appointed teacher and she was in charge of the second class room from February 7 to March 31, both days inclusive. It has been decided to allow her salary at the rate of $800.00 a year.\n\nI enclose copy of official letter regarding her employment. A staff questionnaire is also being sent to you. Please issue cheque for the amount due Mrs. Thorne and forward it to Kincolith, B.

My records will show that letters, as per the attached copies, were sent from here on that date. It is probably that my letter No. 15/8/4524 of March 12th, containing the completed Form 502-563 for Gertrude May Thorne, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, was also included. If this letter has not been received, would you please forward to me some of these forms, when I will have them completed again by Mrs. Thorne.\n\nVoucher No. 1052 dated March 5th of the Cowichan Agency is also supposed to have been destroyed. This was a Voucher for $316.88 covering lumber for a house on the Nanaimo Reserve purchased from Inkster and Thompson of that place.

Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, nominating Mrs. Oliver Thorne as second teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware the regulations direct that married women whose husbands are physically capable of supporting them are not to be employed. Mrs. Thorne comes in this category and under these circumstances it is regretted that His Lordship Bishop Rix did not apparently consider it advisable to nominate another teacher for this vacancy.\n\nHowever, as a special concession it has been decided to allow Mrs. Thorne to take charge of the second class room until the end of June, 1940, but her employment after that date cannot be approved. You should so inform Bishop Rix in order that he may nominate another teacher to take charge of the second class room at the beginning of the 1940-41 academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It will be noted that Mr. Green has shown some improvement in his attitude toward the children and an increased interest in the work.\n\nIt is recommended that Mr. Green be retained as teacher until the end of the current academic year providing his services continue to be satisfactory, but I agree with Mr. Gillett that it would be advisable to appoint someone to replace Mr. Green in September.\n\nD.

They are not ready to start work on a Pre-primer. The only pupil in Grade I who shows any development of 'reading readiness' is a boy who is repeating the year's work.\n\n\"Pupils in the other grades are not able to attempt work of their grade level.\n\n\"The pupils were not clean on the day of my visit.\n\n\"This teacher finds the teaching too heavy with his Church and Post Office work. He is apparently trying hard but lacks the training and personality to be effective.\"\n\nMajor MacKay has further informed the Department that the work of Mr. Johnston at Kincolith is very unsatisfactory. Apparently, Mr. Johnson does not like teaching and finds the work too difficult with his other duties in connection with the Church and the Post Office.\n\nYou will probably recall that this is a repetition of our experience with the Reverend Mr. Green,\n\nRt. Rev. J.B. Gibson, D.D.,\nSee House,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nwho was Mr. Johnston's predecessor. Therefore, the Department recommends that Mr. Johnston's services be terminated at the end of the present academic year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nJuly 7th, 1947,\n\nEducation: In common with other isolated areas, this Agency is facing a serious problem in staffing the day schools this coming fall. The Anglican nominating body has stated they are unable to do anything about securing teachers for the Gitlakdamix (2) Greenville (1) Kincolith(1) and Kitkatla (2) Day Schools this fall. In addition there are vacancies at the Hartley Bay (1) and Port Simpson (2) schools under United church auspices. Port Essington is also vacant, but negotiations are proceeding with a view to having these pupils attend the white school on a contract basis. Metlakatla, Port Edward (2) and Gwaiha (1) Day Schools have teachers returning this fall.(retiring or returning)\n\nF. E.

If he cannot be secured it may be possible to get another person from Prince Rupert or Port Simpson.\n\nThe rapid growth of the cities of the North make it rather difficult to get a thoroughly competent man for outside work, as provisions are expensive and wages no higher than in the city.\n\nThe site has been carefully chosen. If you will refer to the map of the Kinkolith village you will see that a large school reserve is allowed for in the same, which will be cleared by Statute labor this season, under the direction of the Venerable Archdeacon Collison.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nA-268.Ra.

He also states that the toilets, one of which is off the woodshed, are in very poor condition and recommends the immediate construction of a large double toilet, with a partition in the centre, to be attached to the end of the present woodshed. He recommends that the toilets now in use be taken down and burned and the ground filled in. He also states that the interior of the schoolroom will require to be painted next year.\n\nIn connection with the Inspector's recommendations, I have to say that we will have no funds this year to carry out any of the above work. I shall be pleased, however, to have a report from you stating, in detail, the work required to the foundation, in the erection of new toilets and in painting the interior of the school. Please state the total cost involved, when consideration will be given to providing funds for the purpose in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nThe Inspector also states that there is a small leak in the roof of the school, but that this matter was pointed out to you at the time of his inspection. You may arrange to have the necessary repairs made, in order to prevent leakage, keeping the cost for the purpose as low as possible. When the work is completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nW. H.

I would recommend the immediate construction of a large double toilet with a partition in the centre. This building should be attached to the end of the present woodshed. The toilets now in use should be taken down, and burned, and the ground filled in. The inside of the schoolroom will need to be painted next year at a cost of about $75.00.\n\nThere is a small leak in the roof of the school. This matter was pointed out to the Indian Agent, who was with me during part of the inspection.\n\nThe nearest water supply to the school is about 100 yards away. There is no water supply at the school.\nFRASER & PAYNE\nGENERAL DRY GOODS\nMEN'S AND BOYS' CLOTHING AND FURNISHINGS\nCHILDREN'S WEAR LADIES' READY-TO-WEAR\n\nSOLD TO Kin colth Indian Day School\n\nP.O.

As the lumber will have to be shipped from Prince Rupert it will add somewhat to the cost of freight and handling charges.\n\nI suggested to Inspector Barry during his last visit to the school that when funds are available it would be advisable to have the whole interior of the school painted. The floor and wainscoting were painted two years ago. As the schoolroom is a large one measuring thirty feet by twenty-five feet, with ten foot walls and ceiling to be painted, it will cost approximately $75.00. This figure includes painting of two porches and bookroom.\n\nNecessary repairs to the roof of the coal and woodshed which is attached to the main building and was damaged by the weight of snow last winter will cost $20.00 including material and I would recommend that this be done before the coming winter, making a total expenditure of $220.00 for repairs and painting.\n\nWith regard to the foundation of the school, there is no immediate necessity for repairs. The building is settling a little, but there is no structural weakness. The leak of the roof which was only a small matter has already been attended to. If the painting is authorized I shall be glad to hear from the Department as the work should be carried out before school opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 817-5, part 2)\nOttawa, August 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, giving an estimate of the cost of a new double toilet with board walk approach and of pulling down the old ones, at the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the erection of a double toilet, with partition in the centre, to be attached to the end of the present woodshed, or, if you consider this site not satisfactory, you may erect the toilet on a site convenient to the school. You should arrange for the purchase of all materials required from a firm on the list to receive consideration, and for forwarding same from Prince Rupert to the school. You should also arrange for the labour in the erection of the toilet. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible. Please give the necessary instructions regarding the size and type of the building, having in view the keeping down of the costs to the lowest possible point. The total amount for material, labour and freight on materials should not exceed your estimate of $125.\n\nYou may arrange to have the repairs absolutely required made to the roof of the coal and wood shed. It is noted you estimate the cost, including material, to be $20.\n\nThe Department has no funds this year to authorize the painting of the interior of the school, and this work will have to stand over until a later date.\n\nAfter the work in the erection of the toilet and the repairing of the roof of the coal and wood shed has been completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all materials and also accounts, in triplicate, in favour of the individual labourers employed, covering the amount due them. Details should be given as to the days or hours employed and the rate of payment. Please have the above authorized work carried out at an early date.\n\nWith reference to the foundation of the school, it is noted that it is not in need of immediate repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(report dated March 7, 1894)\n\nA distinct improvement was noted in the school attendance which of late years had considerably fallen off. The new teacher seems to be well liked and is getting good results.\n\nThe school building with 48 pupils present - 58 on the roll - was overcrowded. I would recommend that the partition at the end of the room be removed to give additional accommodation in the main classroom. There being only one teacher, the extra small classroom is unnecessary.\n\nThe building also needs reshingling, for which a sum has been included in the estimates.

A reply has recently been received from Miss Edith M. Aylwin, teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School, in which she writes, in part, as follows:-\n\n\"I do hope there will soon be a playground for the children. The school lot is 200 feet long but it is covered all over by trees, bushes and dead brush. The children and I did as much towards cleaning it as our strength would allow but it was a hopeless task. A board walk runs through the grounds to a little platform in front of the door. This walk, in places three feet or more from the ground, is all the school playground for my 52 pupils unless they cross the creek or go off in front of the church.\n\n\"Then there is the problem of school wood. Could not this item be included in the yearly estimates and some provision made for it? It is hard to ask a man to wait months for his pay and often most inconvenient for the teacher to advance the money and wait months for a refund.\"\n\nYou might let me have an estimate of the cost of clearing sufficient ground at this school to make room for the children's playground.\n\nThe Department cannot understand the teacher's remarks regarding the wood. We are quite prepared to pay for the wood required at this school as soon as it is delivered. There is no reason why the teacher should have to pay for it and wait for a refund.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 6th relative to the Kingolith Indian Day School, with particular reference to Miss Aylwin's remarks concerning the school playground, and school firewood.\n\nWith regard to playground facilities, the pupils at present play on an open space about 100 yards from the school. It would improve the appearance of the school grounds, as well as provide a playground which can be supervised from the school, if the land in front of the building was cleared.\n\nFor this purpose, I placed a sum of $50.00 in the estimates for the present fiscal year.\n\nThe cost of clearing the land all round the school will be approximately $300.00. A further grant could be made next year.\n\nI would recommend that an expenditure of $50.00 be authorized immediately so that a start might be made during the summer months.\n\nRegarding Miss Aylwin's remarks about payment for the school wood, I would state that all accounts are forwarded to the Department for payment as soon as they are received at this office from all teachers. The trouble is that as soon as wood is delivered the Indians want payment, sometimes asking for an advance. Owing to the fact that there was only a monthly mail service to Kingolith during the past winter there has been added delay which is unavoidable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, June 14, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, you may expend an amount not exceeding $50 in clearing land at the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Leite.\nOttawa, 7 December 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, the Department approves the purchase of a new heater for the Kincolith Indian Day School at a cost of $70.95.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letters of October 29th and November 27th in connection with the proposed supply of a new heater for the Kincolith Indian Day School.\n\nI may say that the necessity for the supply of a new heater for this school was questioned inasmuch as a new McClary Furnacette was provided in August, 1944, on the recommendation of the Indian Agent who apparently considered this model sufficiently large to heat the cubic capacity of the classroom, contrary to the statement made by Mr. Anfield. The information now provided by the Agent indicates, however, that a replacement is necessary and it is recommended that authority be granted for the purchase of a new heater at a cost of $69.50 and new stove pipes at a cost of $1.45.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nNovember 27th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe yours of November 5th, file 215-8-5650, it is confirmed that a No. 17 McClary Furnacette was installed in 1944 at the Kincolith Indian Day School. It is considered that the reason this stove has deteriorated so rapidly is partly that it is a wartime model and also that it was too small to heat the cubic capacity of this classroom without being forced with consequent distortion of plates and walls.\n\nTo emphasize the need of this stove, I quote from a letter received this morning from Rev. George Johnston, teacher at this school which states \"just a note re the school heater, which I hope will soon arrive because the old one is in very bad shape and very dangerous during this severe weather, which has greatly depleted our fuel supply.\" I am now informed that the oil burners previously procurable at War Assets have been sold and will not, therefore, be available. Gordon & Anderson of Prince Rupert have a much larger brick lined heater available for immediate purchase at $69.50. They have agreed to hold this heater for acceptance by return mail.\n\nIt is recommended that this be purchased for shipment on December 8th, the last boat to Kincolith before Christmas. In addition to the stove, authority is requested to purchase 10 lengths of 6\" stove pipe @ 20\u00a2 and 1-6\" damper @ 25\u00a2. In view of Mr. Johnston's further statement it is considered that this purchase is urgent and your instructions by return mail will be appreciated.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOctober 29th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nThe stove at the Kincolith Indian Day School must be replaced immediately as it is in an unsafe condition. The sides are cracked from top to bottom and the grates are pretty well gone.\n\nIt is recommended that an oil burner be installed in this School immediately. A suitable oil burner can be purchased from the War Assets Corporation for $48.00 delivered at Kincolith. In addition to this 10 lengths of 6\" stove pipe @ 20\u00a2 and 1/6\" damper @ 25\u00a2 will be required. Authority to make these purchases is requested. Other repairs recommended at this School will form the subject of another communication. The installation of this stove is, however, urgent.\n\nF.

Green has taught some manual training. So that he may continue to give better service, I recommend that the tools asked for on Form 37 be supplied.\n\nThe attendance at Kincolith School has been low due to the fact that the children have been away from the village with their parents to the various places of industry.\n\nWith reference to the re-decorating of the school, I would recommend that the floors be given a coat of paint. The walls and ceiling are in fair condition. As for the toilets, I see no need for renovation other than a general cleaning which Rev. Green promised he would have done before school opened. It is advisable to have several trees cut down which would allow more light in the school.\n\nSome repairs are needed on the sidewalks to the school and to the toilets. The planks need re-nailing and two new stringers are needed. The material for these improvements are listed on Form 37 enclosed herewith.\n\nJ.

Anfield following his letter of October 25th attached and the information secured indicates that the condition of the above-mentioned school building is such that we may continue to use it for the balance of the academic year without undue danger of it collapsing providing minor repairs are carried out.\n\nMr. Anfield estimates that an expenditure of $100 for material and labour will be sufficient to meet the cost of these minor repairs and I would ask that an accountable advance be forwarded to him.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nThis school was visited on October 16th and 21st, 1948. There are 38 pupils enrolled and attendance has been excellent since the people returned from the Canneries early this month. There is a new teacher at this School, Miss Kathleen Howe, B.A. She is doing very good work and there is every indication that the school will be filled to overcrowding within a month.\n\nA careful inspection of the school building was made, particularly of the foundations, which are more than one fourth submerged in water. There are 28 posts supporting the building, which is well over 40 years old. Nine of these posts (12 x 12's) are rotted right through at the ground and are held up only by spikes in the upper joints. Rot in varying stages was noticed in about ten other posts. There is a dangerous lean on 16 posts at the rear of the building, at least 3 complete bents at a 10\u00b0 angle. Actually, the building is being supported by an old lean-to woodshed on the lee side of the building, the roof of which has jammed under the eave of the main school roof, which is one-half pitch. It is my considered opinion that the building is unsafe for further occupancy without immediate bracing. I called the Council into session and they inspected the building with me and agreed to cut six trees and wedge them as braces against the lee or sheltered wall of the school at once.\n\nThe Council was asked if they would give us a building for use as a temporary school. They offered the Department the Council Hall rent free, if we would do the repairs required to make it usable as a school. The Hall is panelled and in good shape; inside measurements are 22 x 28 x 12 ft. with two small rooms suitable for cloakroom and supplies. The roof is in good shape, but without ridge boards.\nOutside porch and steps are rotted off. With the following repairs, this could be a most suitable temporary classroom. It is, therefore, recommended that the following be purchased immediately, and the children moved into this building:\n\n- Shingles, 1 sq. @ $12.50 for porch roof $12.50\n- Flashings, aluminum, 40' x 24 inches $12.00\n- Yukon chimney to fit 1/3 pitch roof $18.00\n\n**Lumber**\n\n- 12 pcs. 2 x 12 - 10 steps\n- 3 pcs. 2 x 12 - 14 risers Delivered at\n- 12 pcs. 2 x 12 - 8 porch floor Kincolith - 1160 $108.00\n- 15 pcs. 2 x 12 - 12 (sidewalk to) ft. B.M. @ $90 M\n- 12 pcs. 2 x 6 - 12 (toilets and)\n- 100' lineal ft. 4 x 14 (to road)\n- Shelving for stock cupboards, 100 lin. ft. 2 x 12\n\n2 only single sash, glazed 24 x 30 @ 3.40 $6.80\n\n**Nails**\n\n- 5 lbs. shingle nails\n- 50 lbs. \u00bc\" common nails @ 20\u00a2 lb. delivered $11.00\n- 50 lbs. 2\u00bd\" common nails\n\n**Heating**\n\n- Stove (coal or oil) to heat 7500 cut. ft. space $95.00\n- One door, outside, 5 panel 36\" x 84\" x 1\u00be with hdl. $8.75\n- Stove pipes and wire, 1 roll each $3.00\n- Coat hooks, 4 dozen, 4 dozen, brushed brass $8.00\n\n**Labor**\n\nIncluding emergency bracing of present building, moving of school desks and equipment; all repairs and construction of sidewalks to road and toilets; also placing of blackboards and erection of cupbds.\nand shelving for stock and material - putting in new steps, porch, yukon chimney and flashing and ridge boards\n\n3 carpenters, 40 hrs. a piece @ 95\u00a2 an hr. 114.00\n\nTotal cost of conversion of the building as a classroom $397.05\n\nIt is recommended that this work proceed immediately and a signal to start is requested, as I would like to have it underway before I go on statutory leave next month.\n\nA survey of the children due back at this village was made and I am convinced there will be in excess of 50 pupils at Kincolith by the end of the month, or as soon as the fall seining is over and the families now at canneries return. This will call for a two room school, and I believe that once we get the children out of the present building and brace the walls, temporary posts could be put under the structure and the front half of it used as a senior classroom for the balance of the school year. It is with this in mind that I would like a new stove put in the Council Hall. I am also prepared to move the blackboard from the Crosby Home at Port Simpson and save the cost of ripping out the present boards. I believe that it would take two weeks work for 4 men to put in mud sills, new posts and jack the building back into line for continued safe use on a limited basis.\n\nI should also mention that the Missionary, Rev. George Johnston, and family, are leaving Kincolith in November. It is likely that the Bishop will handle ministrations at Kincolith by using the Mission boat and its travelling Clergyman for fortnightly calls for services. This would leave the Mission House available for rent by the Department. We could put two teachers in there comfortably. It would be unfurnished but perhaps furniture could be bought and later moved into the inevitable new school when constructed.\n\nTo sum up:\n\n1. We have a building which must be vacated at once for safety's sake, but which could be made safe for a limited number of children at an estimated cost of $750.00 for labour and materials.\n2. We have a building immediately available for conversion to a classroom so that classes may continue without hindrance.\n\n3. We have approximately 40 children in attendance with a likelihood of 50 within a month and consequent need of two classrooms and teachers.\n\n4. We have a certainty that accommodation for 2 teachers can be made available by the end of November.\n\nIt is, therefore, recommended:\n\n(a) That the Council Hall be accepted and converted at once.\n\n(b) That if the school population reaches 50, the present building be re-posted and jacked back into line and used as a second classroom.\n\n(c) That an additional teacher be secured when the roll reaches 50.\n\n(d) That arrangements be concluded to rent the Mission House as a teacherage and that it be furnished by the Department having in mind the needs of a new school in any case.\n\n(e) That Kincolith be given priority for new construction of a two room school and teacherage.\n\n(f) That if the second classroom is opened, primary tables and chairs be purchased for 36 children, instead of desks. These would be available for moving into the new school.\n\nF.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Electric Power - Kincolith, Hartley Bay, and Greenville\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's Army Signals message of July 22, Supt. Anfield's letter attached contains complete information with regard to the electric plants of the above-mentioned villages. I should like to point out that in all three villages, the existing plant is overloaded, and further that, as a rule, these plants are not in operation when electricity is required during school hours.\n\nI agree with Mr. Anfield that it would be preferable at all three points to provide separate lighting plants for school use as was done at Anaham and Pemberton.\n\nW.S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nJuly 30th, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Box 70,\nVancouver.\n\nRe your letter of July 27th, 1949, file 12-11-3, I would advise as follows:\n\nKINGOLITH - has a 80 H.P. Vivian diesel engine serial No. 2947, belt connected to 25 K.W. D.C. generator, 125 volts, 200 amps. 1700 R.P.M. Estimated power load at this village is 42 K.W. Full information on this plant is on file at Mr. Webb's office as engine was purchased in 1948. The generator is from the original installation; condition of engine and generator good.\n\nHARTLEY BAY - has a Petters diesel serial No. 200558 of 12 - 1\u00bc H.P., 525 R.P.M. direct connected to a Fletcher generator No. 7785, 125 volt - 64 Amp. 525 R.P.M., both installed in 1928; condition only fair. Approximate power demand in this village is estimated at 15 K.W. The present generator is not more than 6 K.W. at the outside, and the plant is due for replacement.\n\nGREENVILLE - this village has a lighting plant which is a 50 H.P. Cummins, full diesel, serial no. unknown. It was purchased in 1943 by the Army and turned over to the Department in 1946 by the C.A.A.C. and transferred to Greenville. It is direct connected to a 20 K.W. 110 A.C. generator. Condition good. Estimated load in this village is 40 K.W. at least.\n\nIn general, the Department is strongly advised to wire these schools and to make provision for the installation of 1000 Watt A.C. 110 Volt manually operated gasoline lighting plants in each school. In Indian villages, the community plants are only turned on in the late afternoon and run approximately to midnight. They are never operated in the mornings. During the winter months in our northern villages, even with school opening at 9:30 a.m., light is essential for at least an hour in the classrooms in the mornings and for at least the last hour in\nthe afternoons. With furnace heating, light would be required by the janitor as early as 7:00 A.M. in the winter months.\n\nIn Greenville and Hartley Bay, these plants could also provide power for radiophones which it is hoped may be installed in both villages to provide better communications for medical emergencies. Both these villages are pretty well isolated for three months each winter; Hartley Bay by storms and Greenville by freeze-up of the Naam River.\n\nIt is, therefore, recommended that the use of village plants for power for these schools be not considered, but that they be wired and equipped with their own lighting units. For your information, we have Oman lighting plants at Kincolith Nursing Station, Port Simpson Nursing Station, Kitkatla Nursing Station and Kitamaat Nursing Station; all operated successfully by women.\n\nF.

Copy of this letter is acknowledged only to state that your action with regard to the construction of these schools is appreciated and understood.\n\nIt is obviously aware that you have done everything possible to implement the commencement of construction and it can only be hoped that the Department will see fit to get this work in hand without delay.\n\nFor your information, we are ready to run concrete at Greenville if the Department will give us the go ahead signal and I am convinced that if the delivery of the billing could be made within a month, we could have a roof over this school by New Years. In view of the indecision, with regard to this work, I am holding operations at Kincolith and Hartley Bay strictly to excavation only. I am afraid I have interpreted your wording of \"clearing of school sites\" to include excavation, however, this will not hinder any program of building arrangements of the plan used. I cannot emphasize too strongly that we have competent men and adequate labor anxious and willing to proceed with this work. There is also a dire need for this type of work in these villages, as, following a disastrous fishing season, the Indians have flocked to their home villages in such numbers as to indicate immediate two teachers at all our large schools and three at Port Simpson.\n\nF.

I presume that this cement mixer will be used for welfare purposes after it has served its purpose in the building of these schools.\n\nThe draft Submission to Council for the purchase of these three schools from Prefabricated Structures Limited, has been sent to the Minister's office, and we will send an army message immediately the necessary authority is obtained.\n\n......2\nNo doubt you have been in touch with the company and advised them that we expect to order these three buildings in due course.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, November 7, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nHartley Bay, Kiscolith and Lekalap Indian Day Schools.\n\nIncluded in our Main Estimates for 1949-50 is the sum of $30,000.00 each for the erection of two-room schools and teacherages on each of the above reserves, in the Skeena River Agency, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nWhereas our day school building program has met with considerable success in the other provinces, we have encountered many difficulties in British Columbia. At Ucluelet, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teachers' residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $2,612.00. This same school, we are having built in Saskatchewan for $29,000.00. As you are aware, we finally decided to erect a cement school at Ucluelet.\n\nAt Cape Mudge, we advertised for a one-room school with attached teacher's residence complete with electricity, plumbing, etc., we are having two such schools erected in Ontario for about $17,000.00. The one and only tender received for the erection of the Cape Mudge School was $29,744.75.\n\nAt Fort Babine, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room Indian day school and teacherage but received one tender only, in the amount of $67,391.00.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices tendered by them, our officials in British Columbia have come to the decision that prefabricated\nschools should be erected on each of the above three reserves. Their decision in this regard has been aided by the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected the two-room school and teachers' quarters at Pemberton Meadows in the New Westminster Agency and the one-room school at Metlakatla in the Skeena River Agency. This company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., and I attach both the previous Order-in-Council covering the provision of the Pemberton Meadows School and photographs taken by Inspector Davy of the completed building.\n\nOur officials are perfectly satisfied with these buildings and Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield, who knows how to supervise the erection of this type of school from his experience at Metlakatla, makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Shell, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teachers' quarters attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nWith regard to advertising for tenders, not only have we our previous disappointments as a guide, but Mr. Anfield makes the following statement:\n\n\"I have approached Messrs. Mitchell and Currie, Groer and Bridgen, both contracting firms of Prince Rupert and they refuse to bid on the construction of new schools at these three points, giving isolation of location and risk re transportation as the main reasons. These and other contractors in Prince Rupert have so much other work on hand that they are just not interested.\"\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Arnell concurs in these recommendations and points out that these buildings can be erected at a cost to the Department considerably less than we could get a quotation from a contractor. In this regard he makes the following statement:\n\"You will note Mr. Amfield's reference to the need for employment at these Indian villages. Erection of these schools will provide some of that much-needed employment and in addition will ensure most urgently required classroom accommodation and, as previously pointed out, at a saving of several thousand dollars in each case.\"\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produces pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are not recommended by our field officials.\n\nTherefore, I have no hesitation in recommending to you for presentation to the Minister, the attached submission to Council covering the purchase of three prefabricated schools from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., for erection on these three reserves in the Skeena River Agency. We have foremen-carpenters in mind and can employ the Indians who are fairly competent mechanics and carpenters, under white supervision, for the erection of these prefabricated buildings.\n\nDirector.\n\nK.M.\nNovember 23, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nHartley Bay, Kiscolith and Lakeland Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe attached requisitions cover the issuance of purchase orders for three prefabricated schools from Prefabricated Structures Limited, P.O.

Our experience with the product of this company has been entirely satisfactory and we feel that these buildings can be erected much cheaper than standard type construction.

The third building is ready for shipment from Vancouver.\n\nThere is some doubt as to whether or not we will be able to get to Greenville before the end of the fiscal year. You will be advised when work on these projects is resumed.\n\n(sgd) W.S.

The Saanich Plumbing and Heating bid of $3,277.30 for each school is recommended for acceptance.\n\n-W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 13, 1950.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nYour file 168/6-1\n\nAs requested in your letter 11 March 1950, the bids for plumbing installation in the three schools under construction in the Skeena River Agency at Hartley Bay, Kincolith, and Greenville have been reviewed.\n\nThe Saanich Plumbing and Heating bid of $3,277.30 would appear to be the best of the two offers received.\n\nIt should be noted that neither firm will do any electrical work in connection with the pump and it may be assumed that the switches, etc., required for this pressure system will have to be supplied as a separate item.\n\nEnc. (Bids)\n\nNorman P. Robinson\nP.O. Box 187  \nPrince Rupert, B.C.  \nFebruary 23, 1950.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached please find the following bids on plumbing installations on the three Indian Day Schools, this Agency, now under construction at Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Greenville.\n\n1. Smith & Elkins Ltd., P.O. Box 274, City  \n2. Saanich Plumbing and Heating Ltd., Box 1158 B, City\n\nAn analysis of these bids indicates as follows:\n\n(a) Smith & Elkins' bid is for $1092.00 per school. It is presumed that the piping would be standard water pipe either black or galvanized. It is also noted that they bid on the supplying of a shallow well pump complete with motor and tank but do not indicate if their bid includes installation.\n\n(b) Saanich Plumbing & Heating bid works out to $1092.42 per school, only 4\u00a2 above the bid of Smith & Elkins. This firm however, plan to install all copper piping and joints. This is a decided asset as in all three of these schools, we will be inevitably faced with freeze-up conditions. Copper piping, which expands, will take care of a considerable lot of frost without splitting. This should be given due weight in apportioning these contracts. It is also noted that this firm will supply both the pressure tanks and pumps as well as the installation. From the above, it would appear that the Saanich Plumbing and Heating would give greater value for money received although it should be said that Smith & Elkins, which had the contract at our Metlakatla School, did a very nice job.\n\nThe Department's instructions as to these contracts will be appreciated. It is recommended that if possible, they may be let without delay so that material can be assembled and the rough work run in as soon as construction reaches a suitable point.\n\nF.

A crew of 4 men was hired to run the boat\nand scow and were responsible for loading, transit and unloading.\nThe men were hired at $10.00 a day per man.\n\nThe total earnings were $2081.50 for the boat hire, scow\ncharter and wages. Against this, the sum of $900.00 was paid\nout in advances and $125.25 for grub.\n\nThe scow got jammed in the ice on the Nass River and as\nwe needed the scow in a rush to move the school building up the\nNass River, repairs were undertaken on an overtime basis. The\naccount for these repairs came to $928.44 of which sum $628.44\nwas charged against the charter account of M.J. Stewart, it\nbeing agreed that the sum of $300.00 would be placed before the\nDepartment for consideration as to payment. Correspondence\nis going on with Commissioner Arneil in this connection at\npresent.\n\nAdvances, food, and the Charterer's share of the cost of\nscow repairs total $1653.72 leaving a balance of $427.78 due\nMr. Stewart, which was paid to him by agency cheque K 2106.\n\nIt is regretted that this information was not given with\nthe voucher No. 83 and it is hoped that this explanation will\nprovide the information required by the Department to approve\nCredit voucher which is returned herewith\n\nsgd.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Kincolith Indian Day School\n\nWe have received your letter of February 28th with attached correspondence from Superintendent Anfield with regard to the expenditure that was incurred to repair the scow which was used on the Nass River to transport school material to the above school.\n\nWe have consulted the Treasury Branch and it is found that present regulations do not permit us paying the amount of $300.00. As a matter of fact, Superintendent Anfield had no right to even promise the amount without first receiving the Department's authority. Under these circumstances, we are returning unpaid Voucher 106.\n\nMr. Anfield's letter of February 27th reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The boat and scow were both chartered at $25.00 and $7.50 a day respectively. A crew of 4 men was hired to run the boat and scow, and were responsible for loading, transit and unloading. The men were hired at $10.00 a day per man.\"\n\nThe above is the first information we have received regarding the rate at which the boat and scow were chartered, and there is no mention of supplying gasoline, etc., for the operation of the boat. Mr. Anfield has submitted the following Vouchers for gasoline, grease, fuel oil and stove oil supplied the boat.\nVoucher 214, $54.01. This account has been paid, although we should have had further information before doing so.\n\nWe have the following Vouchers for a similar expenditure which we have not paid:\n\n- Voucher 317, $26.59\n- Voucher 295, $35.67\n- Voucher 333, $20.95\n\nAs there is nothing to show in Mr. Anfield's letter of February 27th that the Department was expected to supply the items mentioned on the Vouchers shown above, we cannot understand why he has submitted them to us. It would appear that these charges should be paid by the owner of the boat.\n\nWe would also like an explanation regarding the rate that the workmen are being paid. It appears from Credit Voucher 206 that they are receiving $1.00 an hour, and yet Mr. Anfield's Vouchers 305, 306, 313 and 329, amounting to $178.26 cover food supplies for the men. We would like Mr. Anfield's explanation why these Vouchers were forwarded for payment.\n\nWe also find it necessary to return Credit Voucher 206. On the first page of the labour return for the week ended January 7th, 1950, Henry Watts is shown to have worked 8 hours on January 4th and 3 hours on January 5th for a total of $11.00. On the second page of the labour return for the same week his name appears at the end of the list, and is again allowed wages for 8 hours for Wednesday, January 4th. It would appear that there was an $8.00 overcharge made to him.\n\nBernard F.

Anfield's letters of January 25th. and February 8th., together with voucher #106 in the amount of $300.00 covering part of the cost of repairs to the scow which was used on the Nass River to transport school building materials to Kincolith.\n\nIt was our view that if we were paying rental for the scow the owner should assume responsibility for its maintenance, but in view of Mr. Anfield's statement to the effect that repairs to the scow were rushed at excessive cost for our convenience and to avoid loading, unloading and storage charges, it may be that we could reasonably be expected to pay $300.00 of the total cost of $928.44.\n\nThe scow is the property of Matthew J. Stewart, Kincolith Indian, and in view of all the circumstances I am recommending payment of the enclosed voucher.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFebruary 8th, 1950.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70, Vancouver.\n\nRe: Scow Repairs.\n\nYour letter of February 1st, 1950, file 12-11-3, pertaining to the above-named subject. The scow in question was rented from Matthew J. Stewart, Kincolith Indian, on a daily rate of $7.50. It was impossible to obtain insurance on the scow for use on the Nass River without a Marine survey and without the transfer or registration on this particular scow from the original owners. It is understood that Stewart purchased the scow from the Georgetown Lumber and Box Co. Ltd., but that the original scow registration was in the name of the original company which was later replaced by the present corporation, Georgetown Lumber and Box Co. Ltd., who had failed to re-register the scow in their own name. The transfer and any question of insurance was impossible - there being no Marine surveyor available in Prince Rupert.\n\nThere was urgency with regard to getting material up the Nass River in view of indicated weather conditions and I requested Stewart to proceed to the Nass River with building materials and gravel for delivery to Greenville. On this trip he ran into heavy icing conditions resulting in leakage to the scow to such an extent that on its return to Prince Rupert, immediate action was necessary to keep the scow afloat.\n\nOn the day that he returned to Prince Rupert, we were advised that the freighter carrying the Greenville school building was due here that week-end. The shipment required two large scows. We were able to procure a second scow through the courtesy of Armour Salvage & Towing Co. Ltd. and rather than unload half the school building and put it in storage resulting in consequent heavy charges for storage and reloading I rushed the Stewart scow on to the Drydock and had it put in usable condition at a cost of $928.44, $628.44 of which Mr. Stewart gladly consented to meet.\nIt is considered that in view of all these circumstances and the urgent need of getting this building from the freighter to the scow and up to the seas that that sum of $300.00 should be a charge on the Department rather than on Mr. Stewart. This statement is made having in mind that we requested additional work crews and over-time on the required repairs for our own use. Under normal circumstances, the scow could have been repaired for much less than the cost incurred for this particular work. It would, therefore, seem that the $300.00 could be charged as an additional charter on the scow and action along this line is recommended. It is considered that Mr. Stewart has more than paid the cost of repairs required for the scow under normal working conditions. I accept full responsibility for the extraordinary conditions that brought about the excess of cost over that met by Mr. Stewart for these repairs and consider that the Department is definitely responsible for the same.\n\nYour further instructions will be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. Earl Amfield\nIndian Superintendent.\nReference voucher no. 106 attached. The Department is advised that following the delivery of building materials and gravel to Greenville, the scow developed serious leaks necessitating immediate drydocking and repairs. The scow was rented by this Department from Mr. Matthew Stewart and after consultation with him it was agreed that he would pay $625.44 of the total amount and the Department would assume responsibility for the $300.00.\n\nIt was admitted by Mr. Stewart that the scow had been leaking prior to the initial charter but it is agreed that on the trip to Greenville with the heavy load of gravel the scow ran into heavy icing conditions which contributed to increased leakage. When the scow reached Prince Rupert, its condition was such as to render it unusable. In view of the fact that a freighter was due that week-end with the school for Greenville from Prefab Structures Ltd., the scow was immediately placed on the Drydock, repaired and relocated. There was no other scow available in Prince Rupert other than that of Mr. Stewart and another one chartered from Armor Salvage. We had to get the prefab building off the freighter on its arrival, without fail.\n\nIt is, therefore, recommended that this charge be met by the Department charged to the Kincolith School at which point the building finally had to be unloaded as by the time the scow reached there ice conditions in the Neas made it impossible to proceed further. Will you, therefore, issue a Purchase Order against the Prince Rupert Drydock and Shipyard and pass this account for payment.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nW.S.

The increased cost at Lakalsap can be attributed largely to the late start made on the project and the extreme winter which was experienced.\n\nYou will note that for the completion of these three projects an amount of $47,000.00 will be required. We would like to be advised as soon as possible of the amounts specifically provided this year for school construction so that unless it is intended to secure additional funds through supplementary estimates, transfers can be recommended.\n\nW.

C.\nApril 18, 1950.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: School Construction Projects\n\nRe yours of April 12, 1950 herewith please find estimated further financial requirements for the Kincolith school under construction in this Agency.\n\nHeating contract estimate - $2500.00\nPlumbing contract estimate (including room and board of men employed) - 1500.00\nPurchase and installation of lighting plant - 1000.00\nFreighting and incidentals - 500.00\nLabour, 250 man days @ 15.00 per day, including bd. and room as from April 1/50 to end of job. - 3750.00\n\nTotal estimated amount to complete job: $9250.00\n\nOf the estimated labour cost of $4250.00 including freighting and incidentals, we have expended from April 1, 1950 to date the sum of $2403.93 by debit on Indian Agency Trust Account. This sum is repayable to Agency Trust and is therefore included in the labour requirements to complete the job at the School.\n\nAn accountable advance in the sum of $4000.00 has already been requested for labour and freighting on the project. This is urgently needed as we are compelled to pay wages two weeks and I am not happy about debiting Agency Trust for these sums. Will you please endeavour to have this advance and those requested for the other schools sent forward immediately and most\ncertainly not later than the end of the present month.\n\nFor your information the labour cost on the Kincolith job to March 31st was $9250.00. With the $4250 now requested, this should indicate a total labour cost, including all boat and scow hire, and freighting paid from Indian Agency Trust Account, of $14,500.00.\n\nThe voucher cost of materials to April 15, 1950 is $17,835.56 which includes cost of the building, freight thereon to Prince Rupert, all material, including cement, gravel, lumber etc., and all food supplies and camp equipment. This sum plus $5000.00 additional for subcontracts on heating, plumbing and lighting plants gives a total voucher cost of $22,835.56, making with labour added a gross cost on the job complete of $37,335.56.\n\nAs you may wish to send this breakdown in duplicate to Ottawa, I am attaching two carbon copies of this letter. My estimate on the job complete was $35,000.00\n\nB. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\n\nfeaym\nRe: School Construction Projects\n\nHartley Bay\n\nRe yours of April 12, 1950, herewith please find estimated financial requirements for the Hartley Bay Indian Day School now under construction in this Agency:\n\nHeating contract, estimated cost - $2500.00\nPlumbing contract estimated cost - 1500.00\n(including cost of room and board for men employed)\nPurchase & Installation of lighting - plant - including wiring of building by contract 2000.00\nFreighting and boat hire - 1000.00\nLabour, 600 man days @ 15.00 per day, including board and room, as from April 1, 1950.\n\nTotal estimated cost to complete job. $16,000.00\n\nOf the estimated labour cost of $10,000.00 including freighting and incidentals we have expended $2543.87 from April 1, 1950 to date, by debit on the Indian Agency Trust Account.\n\nThe labour cost on the Hartley Bay job to March 31, was $2160.91. With the $10,000.00 now requested, this should indicate a total labour cost on the job, including all boat and scow hire and freighting paid from Agency trust advances, of $12,160.91.\nThe voucher cost of materials on this job to April 15, 1950 is $15,349.89, which includes cost of the building, freight theron to Prince Rupert, all material, cement, gravel, lumber also all food supplies and camp equipment. This sum, plus $6,000.00 additional for subcontractors for heating, plumbing and wiring given a total indicated voucher cost of $21,349.89 making, with total labour added a gross cost on the job complete of $33,510.80. My estimate on the cost of this school was $35,000.00.\n\nF. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\n\nfeaym\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nApril 19, 1950.\n\nW.S.

With the $10,550.00 now requested, this indicates a total labour cost on the job of $16,899.46, including all boat and scow hire, freighting paid from Agency trust account.\nThe voucher cost of materials on this job to April 15, 1950 is $23,159.92, which includes cost of building, all material, cement, gravel, lumber etc., also all food supplies and camp equipment. This sum plus the $7200.00 additional required for subcontracts indicates a total voucher cost of $30,359.92, which amount plus total labour, indicates a gross cost on this job of $47,259.38, or $12,000.00 over and above my estimate on this school of $35,000.00.\n\nThis is accounted for by the fact that a crew was put into Greenville and due to an unexpected freeze-up, we were unable to get the building in behind them. The river became impossible and the crew were stranded there for a month. It took a major operation to get them out. I also failed in estimating to give due weight to the difficulty in freighting up this river. The Greenville job was the first one we tackled using a white foreman and Indian labour. It proved a costly experiment. We then put the white crew in and got caught with the worst winter on record.\n\nThe crew is now on the way back in to complete this job. It is still hoped that we may make up part, at least, of this deficit over the estimated cost; every effort will be made to do so.\n\nIn the meantime, it is requested that the accountable advance required to pay wages on this school may be speedily forthcoming.\n\nF.

It is noted that the Indian Council have agreed to remove the old school building at Hartley Bay and rebuild it as a Council Hall, and that there will be no expenditure in this connection as far as the Department is concerned.\n\nWith reference to the old buildings at Kincolith and Lakelsap, it is noted that the amount of $600.00 will be required at the former school and $400.00 at the latter in order to tear the buildings down. It is presumed that Indian labour will be used, and consequently, the expenditure is approved.\n\nWe also note that you recommend transfer of an additional $1,000.00 from the appropriation for the Joint School at Port Harrison, to meet the cost of the work authorized in this letter.\n\nBernard F.

Group requisitions for equipment, supplies, and material according to commodity, i.e., books stationery, printing, electrical goods, hardware, machinery, provisions, transportation equipment, etc.\n2. Avoid issuing requisitions for one item, only, except in cases of emergent necessity.\n3. Furnish exact details of product required.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Lekalnap Indian Day Schools.\n\nAttached are three requisitions for storm sash, etc., required for each of these schools. The materials on these requisitions were not included when we purchased the prefabricated buildings. A similar type of school is being built at each place, and consequently, each school requires the same storm windows, combination doors and screen windows.\n\nMr. Arnell has obtained a quotation on the items requested on each requisition from Prefabricated Structures Limited, and I attach this for your information. However, some of the items on which this firm quotes are not included on the requisitions. Mr. Arnell's office states that we should only supply the items shown on the requisitions.\n\nAs the construction of these buildings is now nearing completion, it is most important that the items on these three requisitions should be ordered immediately.\n\nPP/S.T.\nAttchd.\n\nBernard F.

J. Hall of Alert Bay, the local representative of the Church Missionary Society of London, England, requesting permission for a Mr. Pearson, who is en route to Quace and Gwayandums, to reside on these reserves for the purpose of teaching the Indian day schools there. As there is every reason to believe that Mr. Hall's choice of a teacher is the best from all points of view I would ask that the necessary permission be given.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant; and in reply I beg to say that in view of the statements contained in the correspondence, copies of which are enclosed by you, permission may be given Rev. Mr Pearson to reside on the Qu'Appelle and Gwayamskum reserves for the purpose of teaching the Indian schools there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th Inst enclosing cheque for \u00a346.50 for which I thank you.\n\nI should like to ask the Department through you for an explanation the amount being so small. I am aware that it is required that the school should be open 216 days at least in the year. That however is not always possible here as the year 1906 shows.\n\nIn the first place there are two reserves which are some 30 miles apart. Considerable time is lost in moving for one cannot leave at will there being only one monthly steamer. Then again last year these people spent the fairly long periods at Alert Bay. I followed them and held school there but there was time lost however in moving. Then there are away at the canneries in the fishing season for the greater part of two months and in the fall they are away fishing for their fall salmon three weeks. Thus it will be seen that under these conditions that it is impossible to keep school open for the stipulated time.\n\nTrusting this will receive your attention\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\nHerbert Pearson\n\nW.H. Holliday Head.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose a copy of a letter from Mr Herbert Pearson who teaches the Day School at Gwayasdums.\n\nIn this letter he takes exception to the fact that for the last quarter in the year 1906 the Department only allowed him $46.58 for his services as teacher instead of the usual sum of $75.00.\n\nI am writing him to the effect that in his quarterly report for that quarter that he did not give any reason for the short time in the term in which the school was opened, and in future he must be very careful to state any cause which may shew a poor report for the quarter. In the matter of the last report I drew his attention to the fact that his report was very incomplete as he had put nothing at all in the column under progress etc., but unfortunately he omitted to make it right.\n\nI respectfully suggest to the Department that the remainder of the quarterly allowance be sent to Mr Pearson.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.Vowell Esq.\nSup't Indian Affairs for B.C.\nVictoria.\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that at the beginning of the present quarter, Rev A.J Hall, of Church Missionary Society, made two changes in the teaching staff of the Indian Schools, in the part of this Agency over which his vicarage extends.\n\nMr Frank S. Ford, has retired from the work in B.C. and Mr Hall for some time could not get anyone to take the position. Finally he thought best to appoint Frank Nelsen, a native, to the position. Before doing so he came to this office and talked the matter over. This is for the Alert Bay Day School. I informed him that the Department on the whole was opposed to native teachers but that unless the Department objected that he might try and see what he could do. Since then I have called at the school every few days and have watched closely, but have been unable to find any fault. He has a much better attendance than the school has had since my tenure of office here, and the children are learning quickly. So far they are in the primary classes, but Nelsen should be able to bring them on at least to the fourth standard.\n\nMr Fred HENRY Gemley, has succeeded Mr Herbert Pearson at the Gwayasdums Day School. Mr Gemley is a young Englishman with a missionary spirit, and a splendid worker. I have not been able to visit his school yet as during my visit to Kingcome Inlet, it was Saturday, and school was not in session.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.W.

Mr Pearson's name has been mentioned as a likely appointee to the position but nothing can be done by the diocese until after the Bishop assumes office.\n\nShould Mr Pearson not receive the nomination I will take up the matter of the Gwayasduws school as soon as the result is known.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

For the time being the only charge on the Department will be for school material and for desks and as the building is small and the ordinary type of school desk would not accommodate enough pupils to make it worth while I am arranging to have four cheap desks built here for her.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition from Miss Westbury for school material which I would ask should be forwarded direct to her. If they are addressed Miss E. G. Westbury, Kingcome Inlet School, Via Charles Creek Cannery, to be shipped by Union Steamship Company they will reach their destination safely and I would recommend that this be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Halliday\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 23rd, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, and in reply beg to inform you that there are no funds available during the present fiscal year to assist in providing a building for school purposes for the Indian children at Mamalilikulla (Village Island).\n\nWe regret also that funds are not available to provide for the salary of a teacher at Kingcome Inlet and the erection of a suitable building.\n\nBoth of the above requirements will be noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year, but, in the meantime, we will be unable to provide any assistance towards conducting schools at the above named points.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nExtract from letter of W. M. Hulliday, Esq., Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C., dated August 11th, 1926.\n\nMr. Comley also states that the Diocese of New Westminster is willing to provide a teacher for Kingcome Inlet if the Government is willing to give a grant and provide a building. At Kingcome Inlet there are a large number of children who are not receiving any education and although there was a school at this village in former years it was closed on account of the lack of interest of the Indians themselves but conditions are changing and the majority of them now wish their children to go to school. I would be glad to know whether the Department is prepared to do anything with regard to providing a new school and a grant for the teacher.\nOttawa, 2nd September, 1904.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant; and in reply I beg to say that in view of the statements contained in the correspondence, copies of which are enclosed by you, permission may be given Rev. Mr. Pearson to reside on the Qu'Appelle and Gwayamsiuns reserves for the purpose of teaching the Indian schools there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSgd. J. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, March 6, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the change in staff at the Kingcome Indian Village in October, last. It is noted that Miss Ethel H. Adams, who is performing the teaching duties, has no professional qualifications, but is a Deaconess graduate, is well educated and capable of teaching the school. The Department will allow grant towards her salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month from the middle of October, last. It is also noted that Miss Margaret Solomon, graduate nurse and Deaconess, has been appointed to Kingcome Village. It is hoped that both these ladies will meet with every success in the work at this point.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

WEST\nVANCOUVER B.C.\nFebruary 27th 1931\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was under the impression that I had informed you of the change in staff at the Kingcome Indian Village. I apparently overlooked it and must ask your pardon for the oversight.\n\nMiss Eva Dyer retired on account of bad health when the season closed last Spring, and a new staff was appointed beginning their work in October. Miss Margaret Solomon, Graduate Nurse of Toronto General Hospital and Deaconess, and Miss Ethel H. Adams, Deaconess graduate of Deaconess' House Toronto. Miss Adams is the teacher. She is a well educated girl and quite capable of teaching the school in Kingcome, though she has no certificate as a school teacher.\n\nThese two women make an excellent team, and being friends of long standing are better able to combat the isolation and loneliness which their predecessors found so trying.\n\nThe new school is now complete and is a great help in the work among the Indians of this largest village in the Quatsino Agency.\n\nI am more than pleased with the work and anyone visiting the Village can see the great improvement in the school.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt.: C.C.M., Inc.\nOttawa, February 21st, 1951.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the return for the quarter ended December 31st, last, from the Kinsmen Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nThe last previous return received from this school was for the quarter ended June 30th, last, and at that time, the school was in charge of Miss Ava I. Dyer.\n\nThe December quarter return gives the teacher's name as Miss Ethel H. Adams. I should be grateful if you would let me know her qualifications.\n\nMiss Adams states on the return that the school re-opened on October 30th and I presume that it will be in order to allow salary from that date to the end of December.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission Ins.,\n198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOctober 9, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Antle:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the new school building at Kingcome Village. I am favourably considering your request for assistance; but, before giving a decision, I should like to know more concerning the financing of the scheme. You should also indicate if the building is being erected by contract or by day labour. It might be advisable for you to know that the Department would prefer to assist by the payment of accounts for materials and you might keep this in mind when you are repeating your request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\nRoom 603,\n198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B. C.\nCOLUMBIA COAST MISSION, INC.\nROOM 603 - 198 HASTINGS ST. WEST\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nSept. 27, 1929\n\nDr. Duncan Scott\nSup't Indian Affairs\nIndian Office,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have been intending to write to you for some time on various matters concerning the Indians of the district in which I am working.\n\nWe are building a school in the Kingcome Indian Village. It is quite a good building, capable of holding all the children of the village, and also, on occasion, the Indians at their gatherings.\n\nThe Diocese of New Westminster gave us $500.00 towards it, the Indians are going to raise $300.00, and the balance I have to get elsewhere. It will cost about $250.00. I am writing to you to ask you if you will help us out in this respect.\n\nThe schools in the village, I am more convinced than ever, are absolutely necessary in order that the new school may have its proper quota of children from those villages. Already it is very evident that the work of these school has added a large number of pupils to the Alert Bay Boarding School, and in the future I think their work will be necessary, as I said, to keep the big school going.\n\nLast year you were kind enough to help us start the school at Fort Rupert by a grant of $40.00 per month. We obtained a teacher who knew the language and who did very good and important work in starting the school, but $40.00 a month is not quite enough when she is supplying the school house as well, and\nDr. Duncan Scott\n\nSept. 27, 1929\n\nI would like you, if you can possibly do it, to add to that salary. I think that it is quite as well worth $75.00 as either of the other two schools, and you will see by reports that, for a start, she has made a good record.\n\nI regret that the salmon fishing has proven more or less a failure, and as this is the third year in which the Indians have not made good wages, I am afraid that the winter will be a hard one.\n\nHowever, we will have to do our best, and as far as we are concerned, we will try to give them all that is possible in the way of medical, social, and religious attention.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt Columbia Coast Mission.\nFebruary 16, 1929.\n\nI visited the following schools on the above date:\n\nKINGCOME INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nA small missionary school is carried on here under the control of the Diocese of New Westminster.\n\nThe teacher in charge is Miss Dyer, assisted by Miss Birch, both of whom are doing good work; Salary - $75.00.\n\nMuch work is done among the young men and women, and adult classes are also carried on in the evening. The average attendance during the three or four winter months would be about 30 pupils, practically all of whom would be primary children.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS:\n\nThe work done in these schools has been under the supervision of the Anglican Church in co-operation with the Indian Department. This work is greatly appreciated by the Department of Indian Affairs, as these children are receiving religious training from the Columbian Mission.\n\n(Sgd.) R. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, December 21, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that you have secured the services of Miss Eva I. Dyer, a qualified teacher, for the Indian Day School at Kingcome Inlet also that Miss M. Dixon will continue the work at Mmamlilikulla. It is hoped that both these ladies will meet with every success at their respective schools.\n\nIt is noted that arrangements have not yet been completed for a teacher at Fort Rupert but that, likely, Miss Cadwallader will take up teaching duties at this school. We note that she has no professional qualifications but has an intimate knowledge of the Indians at this point and has also the ability to speak their language. Her services will, no doubt, prove satisfactory.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed definitely as to whether Miss Cadwallader takes charge at Fort Rupert and, if so, the date when this school is opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John Anglin,\nRoom 605,\n198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, December 21, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of November 14th, last, concerning the Indian Day School at Kingcome Inlet, I have to advise you the Superintendent, Columbia Coast Mission, informs the Department that he has appointed Miss Eva I Dyer as teacher. Miss Dyer is a qualified teacher. You should see that she receives the necessary forms for the preparation of returns. She should prepare these at the end of each quarter and forward them through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nCOLUMBIA COAST MISSION, INC.\nROOM 603 - 188 HASTINGS ST. WEST\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nDec. 15, 1928.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just arrived from my trip to Eastern Canada, and find your letters of Nov. 14th, Nos. 156-17-5, 156-17-1, 156-13-1, together with a copy of your letter to Mr. Halliday re desks. Thank you very much for them.\n\nThe teacher at the Indian School, Kingcome Inlet, is Miss Eva L. Dyer. The teacher at Mama-Itlikulla, Village Island, is Miss M. Nixon. The teacher at Fort Rupert is to be Miss Cadwallader; but arrangements have not yet been completed, and I will inform you very shortly as to what is being done at that Village.\n\nMiss Dyer is a qualified Public School Teacher both in Canada and the United States. Miss Nixon has taught for many years at Alert Bay in the Indian Girls Boarding School, and Miss Cadwallader has attended Normal School, and has no teaching qualifications other than the ordinary school education, plus an intimate knowledge of the Indians at Fort Rupert and the ability to speak their language.\n\nWe are getting her to start in to see just how matters come out after the first school year. I am of the opinion that she will do good work amongst those Indians, as she and her family are looked up to by all the Indians of the tribe. At the present time there is a doubt of being able to obtain her services, but I shall know shortly when I visit the place, and will inform you.\nDec. 15, 1928.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\n\nI am very much obliged to the Indian Department for their courteous backing of my plans for the advancement of the Indians.\n\nThanking you again, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent,\nCOLUMBIA COAST MISSION.\n\nJA/FE\nSir:\n\nWhile Captain Barry, Department School Inspector and myself were paying an official visit to the Indian Day School at Kingcome village, it was made known to us that the teacher, Miss L.K. Solomon, would be leaving at the end of the present term as her sister who is the missionary-nurse there has accepted a position elsewhere.\n\nThe matter was discussed as to future arrangements being made, and Captain Barry and myself are of the opinion this being an isolated place, a man teacher would be more acceptable if this could be arranged as we both feel his presence in this isolated spot would be more in the interests of the Department and all concerned. Miss Solomon has not as yet actually forwarded her resignation, but it is understood she will be doing so in the course of a short time, and my reason for writing the Department at this time is that our views on the matter may be on record and when the time comes if at all possible we would like to see a man appointed to this position. If possible, a married man would be most suitable, especially if his wife could act as Field Matron to do the required nursing in the village. I might also add this matter was taken up with Archbishop De Fencier who paid me a visit yesterday, and he is thoroughly in accord with the suggestion.\n\nAt the present time the arrangements are the Department pays the school teacher a salary of $65.00 per month for ten months together with supplying the fuel for the school and teacher's residence. The Church pays the Field Matron $65.00 per month plus living allowance. It appears to me if we could obtain the services of a married couple at a joint salary of $130.00 to be paid as under present arrangements, plus living allowance and fuel, this would be very suitable for the work in this location, and would solve some of the difficulties which we have had in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMST/T\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, informing the Department of the resignation of Miss Ethel H. Adams, teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, and enclosing copies of communications from Mr. School Inspector Barry and His Grace the Archbishop of New Westminster, recommending the appointment of Miss Lily Selmon for the position.\n\nIt is noted that Miss Selmon holds a First Class Provincial Teacher's Certificate. The Department is pleased to approve of her appointment, with salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. Please inform Miss Selmon of her appointment and arrange that she take up duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Miss Ethel H. Adams who has been teaching at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, has resigned.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter from His Lordship the Archbishop of New Westminster in which he recommends the appointment of Miss Lily Solomon, a sister of the other lady worker at Kingcome Inlet, and who holds a first-class Provincial Teacher's Certificate. Miss Adams will remain at the village but working directly under the Diocese of New Westminster as a lay worker.\n\nThere is also enclosed a copy of a letter from Mr. School Inspector Barry in this connection, and I would recommend the appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

Solomon with regard to this matter, and that my advice to Miss Adams was to put the whole matter of her resignation as teacher of the Indian Day School at Kingcome Inlet in favour of the appointment of Miss L. Solomon before her Church authorities for their approval. I informed her that when the Archbishop of New Westminster approved of this change of teachers, she should write to you informing you of her wishes.\n\nI am prepared to recommend the appointment of Miss L. Solomon as teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School in place of Miss Adams, if the latter has resigned as teacher there.\n\nPlease forward this letter with your own recommendation to the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa. You should at the same time inform the Secretary of the Department that you have received Miss Adams' resignation. I should be glad if you would state Miss L. Solomon's address when you write to the Department, as no doubt they will wish to inform her of her appointment or otherwise, direct, in order to save time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Gerald H.

May I ask you to recommend that my salary be raised from $750.00 to $900.00 per annum?\n\nI am just completing my fourth year as teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, and have had no complaints either from the Department or from the Inspector, whose reports will have spoken for themselves.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) \"Phyllis M. Arrowsmith\"\nREPORT ON KWAWKWEWLTH AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MARCH 1937.\n\nThe day schools at Campbell River, Cape Mudge, and Alert Bay are in splendid shape and a real credit to the Department, while the Missionary schools at Village Island, Kingcome Inlet, Quatsino and Smiths Inlet which were built by various Missions with assistance from the Department are in fair state of repair, they are difficult to administrate. I feel the Department should own these schools and have full administrative powers as the buildings are on reserves. I would recommend if and when funds are available the Department should purchase any equity the Missions may have in these buildings to avoid any future complications which may arise between the Indians and interested parties.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Kingcome Inlet Day School is also a Mission School built by the Church of England. It serves the four Kingcome tribes. The progress made here is very satisfactory, our main difficulty being in keeping the children at school. There are 40 pupils on the roll who should attend regularly. I would draw the Department's attention to the average for the quarter ending December 31st, 1936, which is 15.88. The quarterly return for March 31st has not as yet been received but the average undoubtedly will be lower still. This location for a village is against the best interests of the Indians and has been reported to the Department on several occasions. The poor average is caused through the Indians leaving the village and wintering at Gwayasdums Reserve where there is no school. It is a modern, up-to-date school.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nDecember 18, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nOn previous occasions I have reported to the Department the undesirability of the Kingcome village becoming a permanent village owing to annual floods during the freshet.\n\nRecently I have been advised by the teacher at Kingcome they had six feet of water all around the village and that it was necessary for them to use a rowboat when going from place to place. I am informed no damage was done, and I can only account for this through the fact that the houses are built on posts sufficiently high for the water not to enter and destroy all their effects. I understand, however, quite a lot of food was destroyed during the flood.\n\nThis letter is being written with the specific purpose of my views being on record as to the unsuitability of this location for a village. I have suggested to the Indians that a more suitable location should be found as I am afraid sooner or later serious damage will result.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) M. S.

TODD, INDIAN AGENT, ALERT BAY, B.C., DATED SEPTEMBER 10, 1936 REGARDING THE SALARY OF THE TEACHER OF THE KINGCOME INLET INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOn Page 10-1 which we have inserted in the Estimates, I would like to draw the Department's attention to the salary paid the teacher at the Kingcome Inlet Day School. At present this teacher is paid at the rate of $75 per month, and other schools with the exception of Smith's Inlet are being paid at the rate of $90 per month. As Kingcome Day School has a considerably larger attendance than some of the other schools, we feel this teacher should receive the same salary as the others and thus avoid any discrimination and possible ill-feelings.\nOttawa, August 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves the appointment of Miss Phyllis Muriel Arrowsmith as teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School for the academic year 1934-35.

John Antle of the Columbia Coast Mission as well as His Grace, Archbishop of New Westminster, and approved by Capt. G.H. Barry, Department School Inspector, I would request the Department to confirm these appointments and notify them accordingly.\n\nIt will be noted we endeavoured to obtain the services of a married man and his wife to act as teacher and nurse at this isolated village, but were unable to find anyone in time to undertake the work this year. We feel this position should be occupied by a married man and we are going to try during the coming year to locate someone who would undertake this work permanently, and in view of this I would ask the Department to confirm the appointments for a period of one year only. Under date of July 28 we wired the Department as follows:\n\n\"Defer approval Anglican Church nominations to Kingcome Indian Day School.\"\n\nThis was sent on receiving information there was a possibility of obtaining the services of a married couple, but after their applications had been received we did not feel their qualifications were sufficient to recommend their appointment.\n\nWe are not feeling very happy about these two ladies going to this isolated village, but as the Church has seen fit to recommend their appointment, we feel the responsibility will more or less rest on them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Ms. S.

This resignation to be effective at the end of the present school term.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) \"(Miss) L.K. Solomon\"\nMiss L. Solomon tells me that she wishes to obtain an appointment away from the B.C. Coast, and where it is dry. I asked her to inform the Department as soon as she made up her mind to resign, and to send this resignation through the Indian Agent at Alert Bay. I have not asked her to resign; but indicated that it is only fair to inform the Indian Agent in good time, should she decide to leave this school. The other missionaries are also leaving Kingcome this year, I understand, which means that there will be a new staff here in September.\n\n---\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, VICTORIA, B.C., submitting his report on his inspection of Kingcome Inlet. Letter dated May 4, 1934. Original on 156-17-6.\n\nI have every reason to believe that the Missionaries and teacher do not intend to return to Kingcome Inlet. You will note that I consider that a married man and his wife, if she be qualified as a nurse, would be the ideal solution of the difficult situation here.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMay 26, 1938.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read a letter from Mr. Todd, Indian Agent, Kwawkewlth Agency, with regard to the salary being paid to Miss P.M. Arrowsmith, the teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School in his Agency.\n\nWhile I am not able to say as Mr. Todd does that Miss Arrowsmith is \"a very wonderful person and a splendid teacher\" I do consider that she has made a success of her work at the Kingcome Inlet School.\n\nOwing to the fact that Miss Arrowsmith was herself educated in a private school, and for some years taught in such schools, she had great difficulty in adapting herself to conditions in the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School. Her technique has improved greatly during the past two years.\n\nMiss Arrowsmith has arranged for a Kindergarten Class for pupils between the ages of four years and six years. These children are taught for a shorter time daily than the older pupils.\n\nAs Miss Arrowsmith only holds a Second Class B.C. Certificate I do not consider that she should be given the same status as that given to our teachers holding a First Class Certificate. The facts relating to the nature of the certificate held are ignored by Mr. Indian Agent Todd, who bases his argument on the number of pupils taught. In general the teachers in Indian Day Schools holding a First Class Certificate receive either $90.00 $95.00 or $100.00 per teaching month.\n\nMiss Arrowsmith shares the Mission House with the Missionary Nurse. During January and February 1938 no classes were held as the children were out of the village as reported on April 8th, 1938 in my last report on the school. From March 2nd to the end of March 1938 the Kingcome Inlet Day School was only open for seventy-six days in all.\n\nMiss Arrowsmith mentioned the subject of increased salary when I saw her last but I discouraged her making a definite application at that time, pointing out that she had a share of the Mission House, in addition to her pay, which was certainly worth something. I stated that in most cases teachers receiving a greater salary had to pay for house accommodation.\n\nI do not however wish to negative Mr. Todd's recommendation that Miss Arrowsmith be given $900.00 per annum and shall content myself by recommending that not more than $90.00 be paid Miss Arrowsmith per teaching month in future. This will make it possible to run the school on an eight month year should such a course be found necessary later.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 818-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMay 17th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed copy of letter from Miss P.M. Arrowsmith, teacher of the Kingcome Indian Day School, has just been received and will be self-explanatory.\n\nFor the Department's information, I have felt for some time that Miss Arrowsmith's salary should be increased to $900.00 per annum which is the amount received by all other Indian Day School teachers in my Agency with the exception of Smith's Inlet School which of course is not considered in the same category.\n\nMiss Arrowsmith has been four years as teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Day School, which is one of the largest and hardest schools we have in the Agency. She is a very wonderful person and a splendid teacher, and the results of her work amongst the Kingcome Indian people are now beginning to show in many ways. We have schools in this Agency where there are only half the pupilage of the Kingcome School, where the teacher receives $900.00 per annum, and I feel the Department should increase Miss Arrowsmith's salary so that it will be in line with that of the other teachers.\n\nI have just returned from attending the Sports celebration at this Indian village, and spent some six days there. Miss Arrowsmith mentioned this matter to me before I left, and asked if I would place the matter before the Department and I told her I would be pleased to do so if she would write me to this effect. I consider with the years of service Miss Arrowsmith has given the Department and the splendid work she has done, consideration should be shown her request, and I would therefore recommend that beginning with the next school term her salary be increased to $900.00 per annum.\n\nWould the Department please give this matter their serious consideration and advise me in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor D.M.

C.\nJuly 24th, 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter reading School Inspector Barry report of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, as well as from information I have over matters which has taken place during the past six months, I do feel it is in the best interest of the Indians and all concerned the present teacher be transferred to another school forthwith.\n\nI therefor recommend this be done, and if possible an older person be appointed to this position, preferably a married man if this can be arranged.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nSecy.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the\nKingsome Inlet Indian day school inspected on\nJune 12, 1939:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the\nKingsome Inlet Indian day school, Anglican Church,\nKwawkewlth Agency, which I inspected on June 12th.\n\nI regret to inform you that the progress of\nthe school does not appear to me to have been as\nsatisfactory during the past year as has been the\ncase formerly. The teacher would appear from the\nrecords to have been ill at least twice, involving\na loss of five school days on each occasion.\n\nFrom various sources I understand that it is\nthe practice of the teacher to attend Indian dances\non the local Indian Reserve, some of which dances\nmay in fact be open to objection on the ground that\nIndians from other Indian Reserves attend without\npermission and take part in tribal dances. May I\nrefer you to matter appearing in a recent issue of\nThe Log of The Columbia.\n\nIn general I am of the opinion that the\nteacher should be warned by the Department that the\nlast report on the Kingsome Inlet Indian day school\nis not altogether satisfactory, that under no circum-\nstances should she attend Indian dances while teacher\nof the school, and that if her work is not more satis-\nfactory when next reported on her future services will\nnot be required.\n\nWhile it would be better to have a change of\nteachers at this school next September, Miss Arrowsmith's\nprevious work makes it impossible for me to ask for her\ndismissal at the present time. I did suggest to her that\nshe had perhaps been long enough at Kingsome Inlet, five\nyears, and that she might perhaps seek nomination to another position through the Right Rev. G.A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia or attempt to obtain a position in a Provincial school.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nExtract from Major MacKay's letter dated July 20, 1939:\n\nI enclose herewith report of Mr. Inspector Barry on Kingcome Inlet Indian day school in the Kwawkewlth Agency, and would recommend that Mr. Indian Agent Todd be requested to advise Miss Arrowsmith, the teacher, that more satisfactory progress is required during the coming term.\n\n(Sgd.) James Coleman,\nfor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your report for the month of February in which you recommend an increase in salary for Miss Arrowsmith, teacher of the Kingcome Inlet day school.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to this matter and it has been decided to allow Miss Arrowsmith an increase in salary of $10.00 a teaching month, effective from September 1, 1939. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $850.00 a year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOn February 19th I proceeded to Vancouver on Departmental business which occupied the following week.\n\nI should like to mention the splendid work being carried on at Kingcome by Miss Arrowsmith, teacher, and Miss Vivash, Nurse. This mission is very isolated and these two ladies are rendering services to the Indians and the Department of untold value. They are both very much liked by the Indians themselves, and I should like to particularly mention the good work being done by Miss Arrowsmith. She is a music teacher and has taught the Indian boys and girls sufficient so that they now have a very good orchestra and band in the village. It is hardly believable that one could accomplish so much in a short space of time; it has meant a lot of hard work on her part in addition to her regular school duties and she deserves great credit for her efforts. In my opinion Miss Arrowsmith is one of the best teachers we have in this agency and is receiving less remuneration than any of the others. I have brought this to the department's attention before, and I feel unless the department are prepared to increase her salary to Ninety Dollars a month in line with the other teachers, we will be losing her services and that I would regret very much. I should like to recommend now that beginning April 1st Miss Arrowsmith's salary be increased to Ninety dollars a month.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 13, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing letters received from Inspector Barry and Indian Agent Todd with reference to the salary of Miss Arrowsmith, teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the present set up of our appropriation it is not possible to increase the salary of a teacher of an Indian Day School unless special provision was made for this purpose. In preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year we only provided salary for Miss Arrowsmith at the same rate as she has been paid previously. Consequently, it will not be possible to increase her salary at the present time.\n\nWhen preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 consideration will be given to the provision of an additional amount to enable us to increase her salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose copy of a communication from Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, in the matter of salary paid to Miss P.M. Arrowsmith, the teacher of the Kingsome Inlet Indian Day School in the Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Todd apparently recommends the increase in salary for this lady. As you will see, in general, Inspector Barry agrees with this increase. Taking into consideration the fact that this school at Kingcome Inlet is situated in an extremely out-of-the-way spot and that Miss Arrowsmith, whether she holds a first class certificate or not, has admittedly made quite a success of the school and therefore accomplished what we require, and this over a period of four years, I recommend that Miss Arrowsmith be paid at the rate of $90.00 per month. I mention a monthly payment because apparently most of our teachers are so paid.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur Secretary, Mr. Drew, has handed me your letter file 156-17-1 of Nov 20th last, regarding Miss Phyllis Arrowsmith.\n\nIf it is in order, I would like a copy of the report made upon Miss Arrowsmith's work as a teacher at Kingcome Inlet, by Capt. Barry, with anything in it that actually suggests inefficiency in her work.\n\nMiss Arrowsmith is engaged upon her fifth year as a teacher there, and throughout that period has shown an interest in the work she is doing there among the Indians far above that of the average teacher. She spends considerable sums out of her own pocket in the teaching of handicrafts to the children, and is indefatigable in her efforts to develop the youngsters in and out of school.\n\nI have reason to believe that the source of the criticism may be the Indian Agent at Alert Bay, and I am most anxious to know exactly on what grounds they have turned in an adverse report. If I had Capt. Barry's official report, I could then deal more satisfactorily with Miss Arrowsmith, as she is the appointee of this Mission in conjunction with the Archbishop of this Ecclesiastical Province, Archbishop de Pencier.\n\nTrusting you will co-operate with me by giving me the reports as submitted by the Indian School Inspector,\n\nI remain,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 20,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in connection with the salary of the teacher at the Kingcome Inlet day school.\n\nSome months ago the Department gave careful consideration to the desirability of increasing her salary but in view of reports received that her work was by no means satisfactory it was decided that no increase could be granted to her during the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nMiss Phyllis Arrowsmith, the teacher at Kingcome Mission, Kingcome Inlet, in a letter to this office writes as follows:\n\n\"When I returned here there was a letter waiting for me from Mr. Todd saying that the Dept. had decided not to give me my rise. Did you know? It has upset me a lot because it is far from being just but I don't know what to do about it until I see Mr. Greene and Capt. Barry.\"\n\nMr. Greene has asked me to take the matter up with you as he is under the impression that Miss Arrowsmith should be receiving $900.00 per annum, this we understand being the wage paid to teachers in the Indian Villages. At present Miss Arrowsmith is only receiving $750.00 per annum.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you in this connection at your earliest convenience. Thanking you in anticipation of your favor.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, December 8, 1939.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter directed to Reverend Alan D. Greene, Superintendent, Columbia Coast Mission, Inc., Vancouver, B.C., with respect to the work of Miss Phyllis Arrowsmith, teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, December 6, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Greene:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 1, in which you seek information with respect to reports received by this Department on the work of Miss Phyllis Arrowsmith, teacher at the Kincome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nReports received from school inspectors and field officials become part of the public records and it has not been the policy or practice of governments at any time to supply copies of these, to parties who may seek to secure copies. All such reports, of course, are liable to be tabled in the House of Commons but only after a formal motion for their tabling has been passed in the House of Commons.\n\nIt is just possible that Miss Arrowsmith's health has been to some extent responsible for the adverse reports that have reached this Branch in respect to her work. The Inspector in his report intimates that Arithmetic in Grade 1 is weak. He states that he explained to the teacher that much more thorough teaching was needed and that he taught a lesson in Arithmetic to prove to her that a very good knowledge of the subject matter could easily be obtained with greater care in the presentation of the lessons. The Inspector states that in general the pupils are very backward. Grade 2, for example, he states, made a Mid Score of only 3 in the B.C. Achievement Test, the Norm being in this case 19. It is noted that the\n\nReverend Alan D. Greene,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission, Inc.,\n502 Province Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nteacher was ill twice for five days each time during the school year and that the school was closed during these periods.\n\nIt has been reported also to the Department that it has been the practice of this teacher to attend Indian dances on the reserve. You are probably aware that it has been the policy of the Department in recent years to discourage a great many of these tribal dances. The officials here have learned from experience that these dances are in no sense uplifting and often lead to a number of abuses.\n\nI have today written to Major D. W. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, and suggested to him that he interview you in connection with this matter. It is altogether likely, therefore, that Major MacKay or Inspector Barry, or both of them, may call upon you in the immediate future. In the meantime, I may state that it is not possible for the Department to seriously consider the advisability of increasing this teacher's salary, in view of the reports on file relating to her work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nDecember 6, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Miss Phyllis Arrowsmith, teacher of the Kingcome Inlet day school, I enclose copies of recent correspondence with the Secretary of the Columbia Coast Mission. Before writing my letter of the 20th ultimo I had reviewed Inspector Barry's report on this school of June 12, 1939. This report was forwarded to this Branch under cover of your 15-6-407 of July 20 last.\n\nIn replying to Mr. Greene's letter of the 1st instant I am suggesting to him that he interview Inspector Barry and yourself. Following this interview you will no doubt report further to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

As a consequence Miss Arrowsmith's cheque for June was forwarded before the Agent's letter arrived. Consequently no deduction was made on account of her early closing of the school. I am not certain if it is the intention to nominate Miss Arrowsmith for any other Indian school but her action in leaving before the school should have been closed is not such as would recommend her for another appointment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

I hope to take up a similar position elsewhere.\n\nyours very truly,\n\nPhyllis M. Arrowsmith.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letters of May 25th, file 156-17-1, and June 13th, file C 150-48, with enclosures, regarding the operation of Indian Bay schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency. In this connection, I beg to forward a copy of a letter received from Inspector Barry following a careful review of the subject with him.\n\nBriefly, Inspector Barry makes the following recommendations:\n\nA. That the Namalilikulla and Kingcome Inlet Indian Bay schools be operated as seasonal schools for a term of five months each year from January 1st to May 31st.\n\nB. That the Quatsino, Cape Mudge and Campbell River Indian Bay schools be operated each year on an eight month basis from October 1st to May 31st.\n\nC. That a special summer school be operated at Alert Bay for the months of August and September to take care of the children from Kingcome Inlet, Namalilikulla and Alert Bay schools who will be living with their parents in the villages from July 1st to October 1st.\n\nThe Alert Bay, Namalilikulla, Kingcome Inlet and Quatsino schools are dealt with in a separate report on the Indian Bay schools working under the auspices of the Anglican Church in B.C., going forward to the Department within the next few days. A separate letter is also being dispatched covering certain schools operated under the auspices of the United Church, not covered in my report of May 1st and regarding which recent inquiries have been made.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nJuly 3, 1940.\n\nIt is understood of course that under the present regulations the previous ten month academic year has been reduced to one of nine months.\n\nThe Inspector's recommendations covering the schools referred to in the attached letter are embodied in the report and letter hereinbefore mentioned. These recommendations are concurred in. In order to avoid any misunderstanding or confusion, it is suggested that the reports on the schools operated under the auspices of the various churches should be considered in preference to this and other letters dealing only partially with the subject.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAt your request I have considered with some care Departmental letter 156-17-1 of May 25th and attached correspondence.\n\nAs Mr. Indian Agent Todd has submitted his recommendations with regard to the future operation of certain Indian Day Schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency direct to the Department and as the Department has seen fit to reply directly to Mr. Todd, I cannot help but feel that I have been placed in an awkward position. However, as you request my suggestions, I would recommend as follows:\n\nAs the Indians do not return to Village Island until quite late in the year, I would recommend that Mamalilikulla Indian Day School be operated from January 1st to May 31st yearly. This would place the school definitely in the category of a part-time school and would, incidentally, save the Department the teacher's salary for three months for at present authorization has been given for an academic term lasting from November 1st, 1940, to June 30th, 1941.\n\nA report on the conditions at this school is given on page 6 of my Survey Report On Small Indian Day Schools, dated January 6, 1940. My main reason for recommending that this school be put on a part-time basis is that there is a very small average attendance except, perhaps, between January 1st and May 31st yearly.\n\nOwing to the small attendance in September and June, I consider that the Quatsino Indian Day School should only be operated from October 1st to May 31st yearly. Authority is at present given by the Department for this school to operate from October 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941. Should my suggestion be followed, you would save the salary of the teacher for one month at this school.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOn page 7 of my Survey On Small Indian Day Schools I pointed out that in June last all the Indians had moved away from the village.\n\nWith regard to the Kingcome Indian Day School, the present decision to operate the school on a six months basis from January 1st to June 30th is, in my opinion, quite satisfactory, though even here it might have been better to operate from January 1st to May 31st yearly as has been recommended in the case of the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School.\n\nThe Campbell River and the Cape Mudge Indian Day Schools are located quite near to one another and might well be treated in the same way. At present authorization has been given for the Campbell River school to be opened from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941. The attendance during the month of June at these schools is, in most years, quite low and I would recommend that in the case of both the Campbell River and the Cape Mudge Indian Day Schools the authorized academic term be from October 1st to May 31st yearly.\n\nShould my suggestions as outlined above be followed, a considerable saving in teachers' salaries could be effected. The case of the Alert Bay Indian Day School is, however, in an entirely different category. The B.C. Packers Ltd. intend to operate their cannery at Alert Bay this year. This cannery has been closed for a number of years. The result will be that during the months of July, August and September a very large number of children, pupils of the Kingcome Inlet and Mamalilikulla included, will be at Alert Bay.\n\nAt Alert Bay Indian Day School the present authorized term is from October 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941. While this is a perfectly satisfactory arrangement, I would strongly recommend that during the months of August and September 1940, Alert Bay Indian Day School be operated as a two Division Summer School, the teachers being paid their usual monthly salary. If the Department follows my suggestions with regard to the other schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency, there will no doubt be more than sufficient funds saved on their operation to finance the suggested Alert Bay Summer School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn replying to circular letter of May 10, 1940, regarding the operation of Indian day schools for the academic year 1940-41 Indian Agent Todd writes as following in connection with the Kingcome Inlet School:\n\n\"The Kingcome Indian Day School has always been one of our problems and worries. When the Indians are at home, the school has always had a good attendance and been successful, but on account of there being no means of livelihood for the Indians at Kingcome, they must leave there and go on their traplines or dig clams from the time the fishing season is over until the New Year and has resulted in very poor attendance, in fact two years ago there were very few children in the village until after the New Year. Quite a number of these children will be in Alert Bay living with their parents and will be going to the Alert Bay Day School, and I do not believe it would affect the children's education very much if this school was not opened until January 1st of each year. I would therefore recommend that the Kingcome School open on the 1st of January and remain open until June 30th.\"\n\nIn view of this information we are advising him that the Department approves the school operating from January 1 to June 30, 1941. If, however, you are aware of any reason why we should change this decision please let me know.\n\nI enclose copy of Departmental letter to Indian Agent Todd.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M.

A.D. Greene recently interviewed you with reference to Miss Phyllis Arrowsmith, teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Greene was satisfied with the information he received from you and that he did not press for an increase in Miss Arrowsmith's salary. It is further noted that Inspector Barry will visit this school before Easter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 156-17-1.\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 6th with enclosure, I beg to advise that by arrangement Rev. A.D. Greene visited this office today when the subject matter of the above referred to correspondence was discussed. Inspector Barry was present during the entire interview.\n\nAs a result of an examination of all the circumstances involved Mr. Greene, Capt. Barry and I agreed that it would be best to permit Miss Arrowsmith to complete the current school year at Kingcome and that if at all possible arrangements be made during the summer recess to secure her transfer, preferably as second or third teacher, to another Day School.\n\nMr. Greene did not press the question of a salary increase for Miss Arrowsmith.\n\nThe annual inspection of the Kingcome School will be made before Easter when a further report on Miss Arrowsmith's work will be submitted by Capt. Barry.\n\nPerhaps I should add that Rev. Mr. Green expressed the opinion that Miss Arrowsmith had been somewhat indiscreet in her associations with the young men of the Reserve and also that she had undertaken too many activities of a missionary character and thus limited the time available for the preparation of her school work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. Eric Cole of Clandeboye, Manitoba, has been recommended to me for work in Kingcome Indian Village.\n\nHe was for some time on the staff of one of the Indian Residential Schools, and then went to Emmanuel College, Saskatoon, and read for Holy Orders. His wife, Mrs. Cole, was for some time Head Matron of the MacKay Indian School, and later of Elkhorn School. She is a trained nurse, and the Rev. Dr. Westgate, of our Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, speaks very highly of them.\n\nIf the Department would pay part of the salary I would be responsible for the other portion, and, instead of having two women,\u2014a nurse and a teacher,\u2014as we have had at Kingcome for several years past, we could have this clergyman and his wife. His Testament from his college, and his knowledge of Indian School work, should qualify him to do the necessary teaching at Kingcome.\n\nIf this nomination meets with the Department's approval I suggest that he should begin his work there by the middle of October, for, from the experience of previous years, there will be quite a number of Indians and their families returning to Kingcome by that time.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArchbishop of New Westminster.\nKwawkewlth Agency\n\nMonthly Report of M.S. Todd, Indian Agent,\nfor the month of\nFEBRUARY, 1941.\n\nThe following schools were visited and inspected during the\nmonth: Kingscome Inlet, Village Island, Cape Mudge and Campbell\nRiver. I found everything satisfactory at all schools with the\nexception of Kingscome, which was closed on account of no parents\nbeing in the village. The teacher informed me there were only\ntwo children in the village, and she did not think it was suffi-\ncient to hold school. I have however since visiting there\nreceived a letter from her stating that she opened school on\nMonday, February 17th, and that there were three children in\nschool. I checked up with the parents to find out when they\nwould be sometime in March, but that they were not certain as\nyet. A separate report is being forwarded in connection with\nthis school. I might state I was very favourably impressed\nwith the new teachers at Kingscome, Mrs. Massey, and regret that\nshe has not had a more worth-while term as yet.\n\nM.S. Todd,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nThe schools in the agency opened on time after the Christmas holidays, with the exception of the Junior room of the Alert Bay Indian Day School owing to the illness of the teacher, Miss Flick but this room reopened on January 10th. Owing to considerable illness amongst the Indians the attendance is not very good up to the present. In connection with the Kingcome School, I am just informed by Mrs. Massey, the newly appointed teacher, that up to the time of her writing no Indians had returned to Kingcome from Gilford Island. This school will receive particular attention and will be reported upon from time to time; I expect to be there sometime about the middle of February and will make a report immediately thereafter.\n\nM.S. TODD\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 818-1, part 1)\nAugust 13, 1940.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to Departmental letter 156-17-1, dated August 7th, I am returning herewith letter of explanation addressed to Mr. F. Phelan by Miss Phyllis Arrowsmith, formerly teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nIn my letter 15/6/7029 of the 2nd instant, the explanation made by Miss Arrowsmith was referred to. Since then I am in receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Todd, addressed to the Department and dated August 5th, in which complaint is made that Miss Arrowsmith delayed forwarding her Quarterly Return in connection with the attendance at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nI have discussed with Inspector Barry the early closing of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School and the delay in forwarding Quarterly Returns. I find that he has inquired into the whole matter with considerable care.\n\nIt would appear that Miss Arrowsmith closed the Kingcome Inlet Day School when all the Indians had left that village. Her explanation that owing to the absence of Indians, she was unable to hire a boat to take her to Alert Bay would appear to be valid. It was, therefore, impossible for her to communicate with Mr. Indian Agent Todd at that time. She returned to Vancouver direct in the regular way, by Union Steamship, and not via Alert Bay and informs Inspector Barry that she mailed the Quarterly Return of her school as soon as she could.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\npossibly do so, which was soon after her arrival in Vancouver.\n\nInspector Barry considers that Miss Arrowsmith's explanations, both verbally and in her letter of August 2nd addressed to Mr. Phelan, are, under the circumstances, quite satisfactory and he suggests that approval be given for Miss Arrowsmith's appointment as teacher at the Lakalsap Indian Day School. I would recommend that she be so appointed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n4506 West 9th Ave.\nPoint Grey\nVancouver, B.C.\nAugust 2, 1940\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that the Department's notice has been called to the fact that I closed the Kingcome Indian Day School ten days before the expiring of the term in June 1940 and I deemed it advisable to place you in possession of the facts of the case, particularly in view of the proposal that I be transferred to the Lakelsep Indian Day School.\nPrior to my closing the Ringcome school every Indian of the village had left there and proceeded to their fishing grounds and the nurse and myself were left alone. Consequently there was no point in carrying on the formality of opening and closing the school for the remaining ten days. It was impossible to inform the Indian Agent to secure his permission as, owing to lack of mail connection, it would have taken five weeks to receive a reply, by which time the term would have expired. I could not call on him on my way out as the S.S. \"Venture\" calling at Ringcome does not touch at Alert Bay. Consequently I could only inform him in the usual way by my Quarterly Report and reference to this will show that I did so. My explanation has been made, in person, to both Captain Barry and Inspector Cotman.\nIt is very much regretted that this incident has reflected on my attention to my teaching duties but it will no doubt be obvious that I have no control over the movements of the Indians and the seasonal run of fish and the futility of my remaining in a deserted Indian village would be quite apparent.\n\nI trust this explanation is satisfactory and that I will receive an appointment to the Lekaleap Indian Day School in the near future.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise the Indian Commissioner for B.C. by air mail.\n\nTrusting you will give me the opportunity to continue to teach the Indians,\n\nI am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhyllis H. Arrowsmith.\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the recommendation contained in your letter of the 9th instant the Department will allow salary of $90.00 a month for a five-month period at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nI may say that a mistake was made in official letter of July 18 as the salary rate mentioned in letter of July 24 was the monthly amount allowed in previous years.\n\nI presume that you will later forward the name and qualifications of the person nominated to be in charge of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay has been kind enough to forward me copy of Departmental letter No.156-17-1 of July 22nd last in connection with Miss Arrowsmith closing the Kingcome Inlet Day School ten days before the regular closing date.\n\nIt is regretted that the returns were not forwarded before the cheques were issued, but in this connection I wish to advise the Department Miss Arrowsmith did not forward her quarterly return to this office until considerable time after she had arrived in Vancouver during the month of July, and it was therefore impossible for me to officially report the school being closed previous to receiving this report. The school return went forward on the next mail after it was received at this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a teacher at Kingcome Inlet Day School, I would call attention to a discrepancy, in that your letter of the 18th ultimo states that the salary to be paid would be at the rate of $90 a teaching month, while your letter of the 24th ultimo states that it would be at the rate of $75 a month.\n\nI am of the opinion that as the term has been reduced to five months the higher rate of $90 per month should prevail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 17th instant enclosing a nomination of His Grace Archbishop de Pencier of the Rev. E. Cole as teacher for the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, I would advise that I am now informed by His Grace that as this gentleman has enlisted, he will not now be available for the appointment. I have requested a further nomination.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJuly 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant enclosing a letter from the Archbishop of New Westminster nominating Rev. E. Cole as teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nThe last paragraph of the Archbishop's letter reads as follows:\n\n\"If this nomination meets with the Department's approval I suggest that he should begin his work there by the middle of October for, from the experience of previous years, there will be quite a number of Indians and their families returning to Kingcome by that time.\"\n\nIf you refer to official letter of May 25 which referred to a letter received from Indian Agent Todd it is evident that very few children returned to Kingcome before the first of the year and consequently the Indian Agent suggested a six-month term from January to June. When this was submitted to Inspector Barry he recommended reducing the term by one month but he also mentioned January 1 as the opening date. In this connection I refer to your letter of July 3.\n\nAs far as this Branch is concerned our officials in the field, who should be conversant with local conditions, appear to be unanimous that there is not much advantage in operating a day school at Kingcome Inlet before January 1. I, therefore, consider that you should advise the Archbishop of New Westminster that very careful consideration has been given to the situation at Kingcome Inlet and as a consequence it is\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nfelt that we would not be justified in operating\nthe school for a period longer than five months;\nnamely, from January 1 to May 31.\n\nThere is no objection whatever to Rev. Mr.\nCole's appointment and in the event of his deciding\nto go to Kingcome Inlet salary will be allowed him\nfor teaching the day school at the rate of $75.00\na teaching month for the period mentioned above.\nYou should let me know later if Mr. Cole is at\nKingcome.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith nomination of His Grace Archbishop de Pencier of the Rev. E. Cole of Clandebaye, Manitoba, as teacher at the Kingcome Indian Day School, from which it will be observed that his wife is a graduate nurse and able to take care of the nursing services on this Reserve, which were formerly carried out by Miss Vivash, the services of this nurse having been paid for by the church authorities.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Inspector Barry and he informed me that he had no objection to the appointment of Rev. Cole as he had recommended that the school at Kingcome Inlet be reduced to five months, but it will be observed that the Archbishop contemplates a term of eight and a half months. If the church are to continue paying the salary for the nursing services at this point it may be necessary to make a compromise in the arrangement regarding the term, otherwise the unpaid period for the teacher would scarcely justify his remaining on the Reserve during the vacation period although for probably three months of this time the Indians are largely absent on their fishing grounds.\n\nYour advice would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n5th March, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn February 16th last, I visited Kingcome Inlet Mission, and as requested in your letter of January 30th, file 15-6-68, I beg to make the following report.\n\nI was informed by Mrs. Massey, the teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Day School who arrived at Kingcome on January 1st that there were only two children in the village, who had only recently arrived, and that she had not thought it worth while holding school. On February 17th she wrote me stating she had started school and had three pupils.\n\nSince then I have visited Gwayamsdums Reserve where the Kingcome Indians are now living, and upon making enquiries was informed it would be near the end of March before all the people would have returned to Kingcome. They stated the odd family might return previous to this but that the band would not all be there until the end of March. This will give us only a little over two full teaching months at this school as it closes on May 31st.\n\nIt is difficult to make recommendations in respect to this problem at Kingcome. As the Department is aware, I have previously recommended that the Kingcome village should be located at Gwayamsdums Reserve, and from our experience this year it would appear that eventually this will have to be done. Each year the Indians go to Gwayamsdums and locate there while they are digging clams and on their traplines, and I can see no change from this procedure in years to come.\n\nIn my opinion, a conference should be held between the Indians concerned, the Columbia Coast Mission and the Department sometime this spring with a view to definitely arriving at a decision as to the future. To move them from Kingcome to Gilford Island will cost considerable, but I think it is the only solution to this problem. I should like to see the Tsawataineuk, Ahwaniam and Kwicksutainseuk Band all located at Gilford Island, Gwayamsdums Reserve, and a proper village established there. They have a good water supply, a splendid townsite, native food, plenty of fuel, and a good harbour for their boats, but before anything could be done it would be necessary as stated above to hold a conference as suggested. I believe the Columbia Coast Mission would look favourably upon this, although it would mean the Mission being transferred from the Diocese of New Westminster to the Diocese of British Columbia, which in my opinion, would be a good thing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

You might, therefore, let me have at your earliest convenience a nomination of a qualified teacher to take charge of the school early in the new year, when the whole subject will be submitted to the Department for consideration.\n\nIt is not known whether funds have been provided in the current year's Estimates for a seasonal school at Kingcome Inlet nor can any assurance be given that the Department will provide the necessary funds, in view of what occurred last year. I might also add that should the Department approve of the re-opening of the school, it would be definitely a seasonal school of not more than a five month term. The Department will also reserve the right to close the school without previous notice once the attendance does not justify its continuance.\n\nWith special reference to your letter of December 17th, I may say that the establishment of a school for Indian children at Kingcome Inlet to be operated purely under the Anglican Church auspices would require previous Departmental approval and I cannot give any assurance at the moment that this would be forthcoming.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nRev. Alan D. Greene,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\n603 Province Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70-\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nReplying to your letter 15/6/5671 dated December 19th and addressed to Mr. Greene, I am glad to read that you and Inspector Barry, as well as Mr. Todd, the Indian Agent, are prepared to recommend to Ottawa that the Indian Day School at Kingcome Inlet be reopened for this coming term ending May 30th or thereabouts.\n\nMr. Greene has informed me that every effort he has made to date, both in the Province and in Eastern Canada, has failed so far as securing a certified teacher is concerned, and he also informs me that in his considered opinion we might well nominate Mr. E.W. Christmas of \"Mink Lake Farm\", Margo, Sask., for the position, in spite of the fact that Mr. Christmas is not, nor never has been, a teacher. Mr. Greene, from correspondence with Mr. Christmas and references he has secured regarding him, ventures to offer the following comments in support of his recommending to me that as an alternative, Mr. Christmas be nominated as the teacher.\n\n\"First of all, everything in the correspondence goes to show that Mr. Christmas is a man of excellent moral character, judging from his reputation in Moose Jaw, Sask., up to the year 1930, and his subsequent career as a farmer near Margo, Sask.\n\nSecondly as to his general ability. The correspondence again suggests a man of culture and good education, but as far as we at present know, his schooling ended in the Gravesend County School, Kent, England, but his gifts are varied in that he is a keen agriculturist, and is eager to encourage the development of self-supporting Indians at the Kingcome Indian Reserve along the lines of intensive gardening. He is a carpenter and wood-carver,\"\nand apparently a very capable craftsman in that direction. He has also considerable musical talent, being the organist in his parish church at Moose Jaw for some three years. He served also as Choir Master and Vestry Clerk, and was very keen about work amongst young people. He was fifty years of age on June 23rd 1941, and would be taking his wife with him to the Mission. She again is keenly interested in Social Welfare work and practical nursing, and between the two of them I believe they would make a very fine contribution to the general well-being of the Indians at Kingcome.\"\n\nI have written him, subject to your readiness to accept a non-certified teacher, asking him if he would be prepared to undertake the teaching in the Kingcome Day School, advising him that the attendance would range anywhere from ten to twenty-five and possibly more at its peak, with the lower grades predominating.\"\n\nMr. Christmas, in one letter to Mr. Greene, wrote - \"I have not of course trained for teaching school (but) I know, from frequently having been told so, that I have some gift as to clarity, patience and so on, as a tutor, practical and theoretical, in such widely differing subjects as agriculture, carpentry, and elementary orchestral work. I have always been keen on cricket and football, as well as indoor gymnastics\".\n\nMr. Greene and I have given the matter careful thought, and in view of the seeming impossibility of getting a certified teacher, I recommend Mr. Christmas as the nominee for the position of teacher, trusting that his letter or telegram, which should arrive by Saturday noon of this week, will confirm his readiness to tackle this important work.\n\nI might add that Mr. Christmas is prepared in the summer months to move with the Indians to cannery centres such as Glendale, Knights Inlet, and to carry on with social, educational and evangelistic work there, so as not to lose contact or continuity in his work with the Indians during their long three month's absence every summer.\n\nTrusting you will give this nomination your favourable consideration, I remain,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nADG/VS.\n\n\"Francis C. O. Heathcote\".\nBishop of New Westminster.\nEKAWKELTH AGENCY\n\nMonthly Report of M.S. Todd, Indian Agent\nfor the month of\nJUNE, 1941.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nWe were pleased to learn during the month that\nthe Department have approved of the establishment of a\nSummer School at Alert Bay during August and September;\nthis will be given special attention so that the best\nresults possible can be obtained. Mrs. Massey, formerly\nof Kingcome Inlet, has been appointed senior teacher of the\nAlert Bay Indian Day School, and has advised us that she\nwill be ready to commence her duties on August 1st; Miss\nFlick will be returning as Junior Teacher to commence her\nduties on the same date.\n\nM.S.

JANE MASSEY, TEACHER OF THE KINGCOME INLET\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nSchool opened February 17th with three pupils. Parents and children were at Gilford Island for clam digging. The majority came in March 24th.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Day School Return submitted by Mrs. J. Massey for the Kingcome Inlet Day School for the quarter ended March 31st last.\n\nI would particularly ask the Department to note the date on which school was open and the date when the majority of pupils arrived at the village for reference in deciding the future of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMarch 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that the attendance at the Kingcome Indian Day School has been very unsatisfactory due to the absence of the Indians from the Reserve. Consequently, a report was requested from Mr. Indian Agent Todd and I enclose same herewith.\n\nIn my opinion, if the school can find pupils sufficient for only two months of the year, it would be advisable to close it entirely until such time as the Indians locate their village at a point where their work will not interfere with school attendance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 18, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFurther to my letter of May 26th last, I now wish to make a further report on the Kingcome Inlet Day School, dealing with the period January 19th to May 31st 1942 during which this school was open, and making recommendations as to its future.\n\nOn March 31st the quarterly return was submitted, showing the following information:\n\nNumber of pupils on Register - 28\nAverage attendance - 19.4\n\nA return has now been received for the months of April and May, as follows:\n\nNumber of pupils on Register - 35\nAverage attendance - 22.75\n\nUnder the circumstances, I consider the average attendance as fair, although there is much room for improvement.\n\nOn March 16th last I visited this school, and was favourably impressed with Mr. Christmas, the teacher in charge. He has a son fourteen years old who was assisting him in the classroom. The pupils appeared happy and contented; they were clean and responsive, and the discipline was good. I was of the opinion progress was being made, and that even though Mr. Christmas is not a qualified teacher, the opening of the school was worthwhile.\n\nMr. Christmas' presence in the village no doubt is an asset to the Department, and although I am opposed to unqualified teachers being employed, nevertheless when it is impossible to get teachers, I feel under the circumstances this school should be continued under its present arrangement provided the Indians agree to return to school on the date set for the opening. Some time ago a petition was forwarded to your office from the Indians requesting that the school be reopened on October 1st next. I feel, however, that this date is too early, as the families will not be able to leave the canneries by that time. I would therefore recommend that the Kingcome Day School be reopened on November 16th next, to continue until May 31st, 1943.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M.

Todd, Indian Agent\nfor the month of\nNovember, 1942\n\nSir:\n\nEDUCATION: The Kingcome Inlet Day School opened officially on November 15th, as reported by the teacher, Mr. E.W. Christmas. Mrs. J. Massey is still carrying on in charge of the junior and senior rooms of the Albert Bay School; it is hoped a junior teacher will be procured at the beginning of the new term after the Christmas vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. TODD)\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KWAWKWEWLTH INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1943.\n\nEDUCATION - There are four Day Schools in session in the Agency, all of which are considered satisfactory with the exception of the Kingcome School, on which a report has recently been submitted to Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner. Two Day Schools are closed owing to the inability of the Church to provide teachers. The Residential School is being carried on satisfactorily under the Principalship of Mr. F.E. Anfield; here too, difficulty has been experienced by the Commission in obtaining staff, but even with this difficulty the school is making good progress.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KHAWEWLTH AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nEducation\n\nDuring my visit to Kingcome I inspected the Day School there, and regret that I cannot report favourable on same. A special report is being made in respect to this school.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMarch 23, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nReplying to the first paragraph of your letter of March 16th last, file 318-6-3097, I beg to submit herewith the following report on the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nI inspected this school on February 26th and again on March 1st, and regret very much that I cannot make a favourable report, particularly when every effort has been made to keep the school open under adverse conditions.\n\nI found the classroom dirty, with paper and refuse lying all over the floor; the children were untidy, and there was no discipline whatever in the school. Insofar as an academic inspection is concerned, I have no comments to make as we have a School Inspector who will, I hope, be visiting this school in the near future and this phase of the work is left entirely to him.\n\nThe children looked very tired, their eyes bloodshot, with the appearance of having very little sleep. This no doubt was due to them sitting up all hours of the night attending the Indian Custom dances which were going on at the time of my arrival. A separate report in respect to these activities is being made, so I will not make any further mention of this in this report.\n\nI found that the teacher, Mr. E.W. Christmas, had been having difficulty with the parents as well as with the children. Some pupils were absent from school through this. I interviewed the parents, and had no difficulty in getting matters adjusted, and the children are now back in school, but I believe the Indians themselves realize that Mr. Christmas is not an experienced teacher, and therefore he is not getting the support from the Indian people that he otherwise might.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Christmas has not got what it takes to be a teacher; he is tactless, and forever scolding and nagging until the children have reached the point where they pay no attention to what he says. It is possible that the discipline at the school may improve, as I made it very clear as to what was expected both from the teacher and the pupils.\n\nThe attendance at the school has been generally fair, although the register showed children present when I learned they had attended only a portion of the day; this was explained and adjusted so that the register shows the two half-day periods and attendance at each.\n\nApart from the fact that the carryings on of the Custom this winter has made it awkward and difficult for the teacher, nevertheless I must recommend that a change be made not later than the end of this term; had it been possible to obtain the services of another teacher at once I would have recommended that a change be made immediately, as I felt the situation was so serious.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 156-17-1\n\nI enclose herewith copy of Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of the 23rd ultimo advising that conditions at Kingcome Indian Day School under Mr. E.W. Christmas are not very satisfactory. As you are no doubt aware, Mr. Christmas is not a professional teacher.\n\nOn receipt of this letter, I communicated with Rt. Rev. Sir F.C.C. Heathcote of New Westminster, under whose diocese the school is situate, advising that according to the Indian Agent Mr. Christmas was not making the success of his work that was expected and that it was suggested that he be replaced at the end of the present term but before referring the matter to you his comments would be appreciated. I have since received a call from the Bishop who objected to the release of Mr. Christmas at the expiry of the present term on the grounds that a poor teacher was better than none at all, a view with which I do not agree, as amongst other reasons, it prevents the employment of a more qualified teacher for the school in question.\n\nFollowing the receipt of this letter, I endeavoured to have the school visited by the Provincial School Inspector for the district, but as Kingcome Inlet is not on the regular course of travel by the coastal boats, it will be impossible for him to get in to the school until the fall. Meanwhile, the only recommendation that I am prepared to make in the matter, apart from discontinuance of Mr. Christmas' services, is that his re-employment be contingent on his taking a course of summer school training at Victoria during the present year and subsequent evidence of more satisfactory handling of the Kingcome School.\n\nFor D.M.

Christmas, teacher\nof the Kingscome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nOn reviewing the letter from Rt. Rev.\nF.C.C. Heathcote forwarded to the Department\nunder cover of your letter of January 3, 1942,\nI am under the impression that Mr. Christmas\nmight be more useful as a member of the staff\nof a residential school than as teacher of an\nIndian day school. Would the Alert Bay Resi-\ndential School be willing to employ him? If\nnot, I feel that your suggestion should be\nadopted; namely, that we will be obliged to\ndiscontinue Mr. Christmas' services at the\nend of June but that we would consider his\nre-employment provided he takes a course of\nsummer school training at Victoria during the\nsummer of 1943.\n\nR.A.

However, as no payment of salary has been made to the teacher for the month of October, she is entitled to two months' salary on the November paylist, as follows:\n\n818 - Kingcome Inlet - Phyllis M. Arrowsmith - Kingcome - $750 - $250.\n\nInlet, B.C.\nOttawa, November 5th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Kingcome Inlet and Quatsino Indian Day Schools will be placed on the paylist and the salaries of the teachers will be paid monthly beginning with the month of November.\n\nAs soon as you inform me regarding the exact date on which the teacher of the Campbell River Indian Day School begins duties, her name will also be placed on the monthly paylist.\n\nThe paylist has to be prepared early in the month. For instance, officers of the Schools Branch have to give authority about the 7th of November in order to have the name of a teacher included on the November paylist. It is, therefore, necessary for us to know definitely early in the month whether or not any school will be in operation for that month. From the information contained in your letter, it is doubtful if you can give us such assurance regarding the Namaliklikulla Indian Day School and, consequently, the Department is not prepared to place this school on the regular monthly paylist. I feel that it would be preferable to only pay this teacher when returns are received. By this method, all chances of making a mistake will be avoided. The same applies to the Smith's Inlet School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nPP/O'M.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant the Department approves the reopening of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School. As you suggest, it should be operated on a seasonal basis; namely, from January to May.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. E. W. Christmas as teacher for the current term is approved and he will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a month plus bonus. Indian Agent Todd should keep you informed regarding the attendance at this school as its continuance next year will depend upon the attendance secured this year. I attach the necessary forms which Mr. Christmas should complete and return as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. H.

A.J. Hall at Gwayi Kingcome Inlet.\n\nI found the building finished with the exception of one coat of paint inside and the front door.\n\nThe work has been well done, and the contract carried out exactly.\n\nThe only thing to be regretted is that the foundation was not placed upon mud sills instead of posts, as I found that the building had settled quite four inches, and as the ground upon which it is built, is liable to overflow from the river once each year, it is quite possible that the building will settle more, as the ground is of a very sandy nature, as is all the soil in the vicinity of the Village.\n\nP.H.

The length of the rafters to be sixteen feet 6 inches. There shall be a collar tie of 1 x 6 in well fastened which shall allow a run of three feet from the plate. These collar ties shall act as ceiling joists.\n\nWindows and doors:\nThere shall be six windows and one door in all. Three of these windows to be facing the\nriver two on the end facing the Indian Village and one on the other end. The door shall be on the end near the Village and shall be protected by a small porch 6 feet square.\n\nA small bell tower is to be erected on this side of the roof on the end near the Village to be at least 3 feet above the ridge of the building.\n\nThe building shall be covered in with 178 rustic.\n\nThe roof shall be covered with cedar shingles laid 5 inches to the weather with ridge boards 175 and 176 respectively.\n\nCorner Plankers 1x12.

I beg to report as follows.\n\nThe condition of the building is anything but good; it never was anything but a shell about 50 feet long by about 15 wide, with shake roof. There are two rooms partitioned off at one end used by the Teacher as a residence and which is fairly comfortable; the other half of the building is used for a School room and when I visited it on Jan 25th, it presented anything but an inviting appearance; with a good large heating stove and plenty of fuel, the room could be kept warm in moderately cold weather, but as there was no stove and the pipe hole through the roof let in the rain & fresh air the children certainly needed lots of exercise to enable them to keep warm. I saw Mr Pearson this morning and asked him would the Society under which he teaches agree to insure the use of the building for School purposes for any length of time?, his answer was that he did not know but he supposed so; as a matter of fact Mr Hall who is at the head of the Missionary work here is at present absent in England, and Mr Pearson who has only been here does not know or understand.\n\nI would suggest that instead of spending money on this old rattletrap which can never be made a good building, that a new School house be built costing in the neighborhood of $450.00, part of the old building could be then be torn down and the material used in making the balance of it into a comfortable residence for the teacher.\n\nMr Pearson seems to be an earnest and painstaking young man who is doing good work considering the way he is handicapped.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nA.

L. J. Hall, for material and labour expended in the erection of this building, a cheque for which was sent you on June 5, of last year.\n\nFrom this correspondence the Department does not see why there should be any doubt about the building being used\n\nA.

I immediately went up to investigate and found that the high water during last winter had undermined the posts and the whole building had moved over sideways and was now sitting flat on the ground. It is surprising that no worse damage was done to it as it will not be a very expensive matter to raise it up again. The ground there is sandy and when the river is in freshet it overflows its banks and the current runs swiftly past the building and under it.\n\nI propose to get men to raise it up with jackscrews and under each post put a platform about 3 feet square which platform will be sunk into the ground so that the top of it will be at least six inches under the surface level.\n\nI fear if I wait for the usual authority that the summer freshets will have completely wrecked the building, and the expense more than trebled.

W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nLast week while at Kingcome Inlet I examined the old school building which was built there 26 years ago. Some years ago a very high river washed it off its foundations and racked it very much. I had it raised at that time and put new foundation posts under it and while it was able to be used for some time after it could not be made very much of as the walls could not be plumbed, since then it has gradually got worse and in addition dry rot has set in on the end of the posts and the end of rafters, and it would cost more to put the building right than to build a new one. One of the Indians, George Scow asked me if the Department would be willing to sell him the lumber and he would tear it down and cut it up into various lengths for a small house he intended building. He said he was willing to pay $75.00 for it which I think it is all it is worth and I would recommend it be sold. The nails are rusted nearly off and another storm would demolish it entirely;\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS BRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nAGENCY.\n\nTO: S.

For the time being the only charge on the Department will be for school material and for desks and as the building is small and the ordinary type of school desk would not accommodate enough pupils to make it worth while I am arranging to have four cheap desks built here for her.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition from Miss Westbury for school material which I would ask should be forwarded direct to her. If they are addressed Miss E. G.

At Kingcome Inlet there are a large number of children who are not receiving any education and although there was a school at this village in former years it was closed on account of the lack of interest of the Indians themselves but conditions are changing and the majority of them now wish their children to go to school. I would be glad to know whether the Department is prepared to do anything with regard to providing a new school and a grant for the teacher.\n| ARTICLES          | Firms Asked To Quote | REMARKS |\n|------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| Chairs           |                      |         |\n| Kindergarten     |                      |         |\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDate: [Date]\n\nCity or town: [City]\n\nProvince: [Province]\n| ARTICLES | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------------|---------|\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: ____________________________\nDept. of: _________________________\n\nDate: ______________ City or town: ___________________ Province: _______\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am favourably considering your request for assistance; but, before giving a decision, I should like to know more concerning the financing of the scheme. You should also indicate if the building is being erected by contract or by day labour. It might be advisable for you to know that the Department would prefer to assist by the payment of accounts for materials and you might keep this in mind when you are repeating your request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

John Antle,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\nRoom 603,\n198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOffice of the Kawkewlth Indian Agency,\n\nJanuary 12, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 225, amounting to $149.69 in favour of Columbia Coast Mission for Seats for Kingcome Inlet Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 156-17-5 dated November 14, 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nOttawa, December 13, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing receipted accounts in duplicate in connection with the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School. The Deputy Superintendent General has directed that the cost of the materials be met by the Department, and I am pleased to inform you that, under separate cover, there is being directed to you a cheque for $1241.02.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\n198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDecember 12, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIn letter of October 9th, last, you promised the Reverend John Antle some assistance with a new day school building, which he has erected at Kingscome Inlet. The building was erected by day labour, the materials costing \u00a31,241.02 and the labour, \u00a31,266.30 - a total of \u00a32,507.32. Mr. Antle received \u00a3500 from the Diocesan authorities, a \u00a350 subscription and is collecting \u00a3300 which was promised by the Indians of the village.\n\nThe New England Company are interested in this school, but Mr. Antle has apparently not collected anything from them towards the cost of the new building. Receipted accounts are now to hand, and I should be glad to know the amount of the grant to be paid.\n\nRussell Kerrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nCOLUMBIA COAST MISSION, INC.\nROOM 603 - 185 HASTINGS ST.

The accounts you forwarded are hardly satisfactory for the purpose of supporting payment by the Department. The Auditor General demands receipts. I am returning the papers, with the suggestion that you have McLeanman, McFeely & Prior prepare a brief account, recapitulating the business you have had with them, and have it receipted. This should be in duplicate. The other accounts should also be receipted and forwarded to the Department in duplicate, if convenient. Upon receipt of these papers, if in order, the matter will be brought to the attention of Dr. Scott.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThank you very much for your letters of October the 9th, 156-11-1, and 156-17-1.\n\nWith regard to the latter, I may say that the school has cost us \u00a3250.00, much more than I anticipated owing to the fact that the Kingcome River has been acting up for a long time, and made it difficult and expensive to get the materials up the river. However it is all completed now except finishing the interior upper part of the wall, and ceiling.\n\nThis I have left in order that the Indians may not feel that the whole is completed, and neglect to give the amount promised, namely \u00a3600.00.\n\nWe have received from the Bishop of the Diocese, \u00a3600.00, and \u00a350.00 as a subscription, and expect to get \u00a350.00 from the Indians. Outside of that we still owe a balance on the building as it stands, of \u00a3170.00, and we have also to put heating apparatus and other fittings in.\n\nI am sure you will do your best for us, and I shall be very grateful indeed, as I am in hopes that this school will tend to cure some of the evils that are going on in that village.\n\nLast year there was a death, believed by the Indians to be caused by witchcraft, which has caused a great deal of trouble. I am trying to combat these things, and hope by getting them together in the new school, I'll be able to persuade them of the foolishness of such ideas.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Steele\nSupt Columbia Coast Mission.\n\"Cure the Sick . . . and say unto them, the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you\"\u2014St. Luke X. 9\n\nREV.

The teacher or yourself should, in due time, forward a request for the quantity and kind of fuel required to the local Indian Agent, Mr. Wm. Halliday, Alert Bay, B.C. We are informing Mr. Halliday accordingly, and requesting him to submit these requests for fuel to the Department, when he will be given authority to arrange for the purchase. The Department prefers that this arrangement be carried out in the supplying of fuel to Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

John Antle, Columbia Coast Mission, relative to the payment of an account covering the cost of fuel supplied for last winter's use at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School. The Department will, in future, favourably consider the supplying of fuel for this school, and you should forward the requests for same to the Department in due time and receive the necessary authority before making the purchase. In requisitioning for the fuel, you should state the type and quantity required, and, if possible, the approximate cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Asst.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr Scott,\n\nI am enclosing two small pictures of the new school at Kingcome. It has been completed inside and out, with comfortable quarters overlooking the River. The Indians helped remarkably well and would have done better but were not allowed. The Wakeman Band voted $200.00 towards the building specially for the finishing of the interior of the school. The Columbia Coast Mission was finishing the nurses' quarters, and supplied the Indians with material with the understanding that they would meet the bill with their $200.00. But tho' they sent in letters signed by all the members of the Band and later I was told, Mr Halliday visited the village and vetoed the gift. Said it was contrary to department rules to allow Indians to vote the \"interest\" for such purposes. I do not know about this, but you will, and I know you will set it right if possible.\n\nI am enclosing fuel bills which we have paid, and which last year you were good enough to say the Department would meet. This probably ought to be sent through Mr Halliday but I find it difficult to deal with him and much more satisfactory to deal direct with the Department.\n\nTrusting you are well,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I am glad to report that the Staff of this school, Miss Solomon, Graduate Nurse, and Miss Adams, Deaconess, are doing remarkably fine work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6395, File 818-5, part 1)\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the KINGCOME INLET INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on February 26, 1938.\n\nOriginal on File 156-17-6.\n\nSchool Desks:\n\nThere are at present in this school 9 Number 4; and 11 Number 3 Crown School Desk Sections. There are no front or rear sections. As arranged at present with a form at the back of the desks seating is available for 20 out of the 35 children. This is for other educational reasons a very bad system. Many of the children are too far from the light. The remaining 15 children are working around a table near the centre of the room, which is very large. They have so little light here that their eyes will no doubt be damaged if this practice is kept up for long. I have no other option but to request the Department to provide the detail of school desks and parts as listed at the bottom of this page. This has all been worked out at the school so as to give the best accommodation at the least cost.\n\nThe supply of the following Crown School Desks is very strongly recommended:- 2 Front Sections No. 3 - 2 Rear Sections No. 3. 1 Front Section No. 4 - 1 Rear Section No. 4. 1 Front Section No. 5 - 6 Desk Sections No. 5. 1 Rear Section No. 5; These sections will provide accommodation for 10 children. The estimated cost F.O.B. Vancouver if supplied by the Tait Pipe and Foundry Co. of Vancouver will be about $77.50.\nApril 2, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Antle:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with enclosures, concerning the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to learn that the new school is so comfortable and has now been completed. Mr. Halliday was right: we do not allow the Band to use any of their funds for school purposes. With reference to the fuel payments, a cheque will be directed to you, in reimbursement, in a few days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\nRoom 603, 198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOffice of Inspector of Schools,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nC.C.Perry,Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nOctober 31st 1932.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have received a letter dated September 18, 1932, from Miss Lily K. Solomon with regard to the lack of desks at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School. As I was away from my office here till nearly the end of October my answer is dated October 29th. Copies of Miss Solomon's letter and my reply are attached for the information of the Department.\n\nReference is suggested to my report on the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School forwarded to your office on April 8th, and which was sent to The Secretary of the Department in Ottawa, under your 15/24605, on that date.\n\nYou will note that I reported an attendance of 30 children on the day of my inspection, while there were 35 on the roll of the school, and only 9 Number 4 and 11 Number 3 Crown School Desk Sections giving seating for 20 children.\n\nTo overcome this very unsatisfactory condition of affairs, I recommended (Very strongly) the supply of the following:\n\n- 2 Front Sections No.2.\n- 2 Rear Sections No.3.\n- 1 Front Section No.4.\n- 1 Rear Section No.4.\n- 1 Front Section No.5.\n- 6 Desk Sections No.5.\n- and 1 Rear Section No.5.\n\nIn my report I showed how these would provide seating for 10 extra children, bringing up the number of available seats to 30 the number of children actually present during the inspection.\n\nThe lack of proper seating accommodation near the light may lead to serious eye trouble. The schoolroom which is only a few years old is very badly designed for a schoolroom, as it is intended for use as a church. At the best the system of lighting is very poor.\n\nI beg to recommend that in addition to those Front, Rear, and Desk Sections recommended in my previous report, the following be now supplied to the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School:\n\n- 1 Front Section No.2.\n- 6 Desk Sections No.2.\n- 1 Rear Section No.2.\n\nThese should be Crown Single School Desks, as manufactured by the Tait Pipe Co. of Vancouver, as the previous desks supplied to this school were of this kind.\n\nIf the attendance continues to grow above 40 it will be necessary for some of the children to be sent to a Residential School. The present schoolroom will not accommodate such a number, even if the teacher could handle them.\n\nThe above is now a very urgent matter, and my recommendations are placed at a minimum. A Blackboard 12ft. by at least 3\u00bd ft. would also seem to be required to increase the space available for seat work exercises.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGHB\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nThe school term opened on September 6th with thirteen children present. Many of the Indians have come back since, and last Friday we had twenty-one present. Tomorrow we expect to have at least thirty, as we have now thirty-nine rolls on the roll. I suppose a few will be here in April after the fishing up the river closes. We have all grades up to and including Grade five. We need desks very badly as we have only sixteen at present. The pupils cannot do good work unless they have satisfactory desks. Last week I sent a requisition to Mr. Halliday asking for a dozen desks, but with the number of pupils now enrolled we should have at least two dozen.\n\nI find the blackboard space very limited also. With so many grades it is necessary to put a great deal of seatwork on the blackboards. If one could be placed at the back of the room or between the windows it would help a great deal.\n\nI think that the pupils are doing well & we hope to pass them into higher grades as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\nLily K. Solomon.\n\nMiss Lily K. Solomon,\nIndian Day School,\nKingcome Inlet, B.C.\n\nDear Miss Solomon;\n\nOn my return from a long inspection tour I was handed your letter of the 18th September. As you state that you have requisitioned for a dozen desks through the Indian Agent at Alert Bay, and now find that two dozen will be necessary, I can do nothing in the matter till I have communicated with Mr. Halliday.\n\nIn my last report on your school I recommended the supply of 2 Front Sections No. 3, & Rear Sections No. 3, 1 Front Section No. 4, & 1 Rear Section No. 4, 1 Front Section No. 5, 6 Desk Sections No. 5 and 1 Rear Section No. 5, All Crown Single School Desks. If my report had been acted on at the time the above mentioned desks and sections would have provided accommodation for 10 children in addition to those provided for by the 20 Desk Sections now in the room.\n\nYou may rest assured that the matter of the provision of new desks and more Blackboard space is now being considered by the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Perry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSir:\n\nKindly find herewith a letter dated October 31st, ultimo, received at this office from G.H. Barry, Esq., District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., in regard to desks required for the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C., which will be self-explanatory. Please note in the copy of letter dated September 15th, received from the teacher by Inspector Barry, as attached to his report, that she states she asked Mr. Agent Halliday for \"a dozen desks.\" Possibly this requisition was duly received at the Department.\n\nThe cost of the desks, teacher's chair and desk and asbestos slate blackboard as recommended by Inspector Barry would be approximately \u00a3199.46.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Ferry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 15/6/26940 of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Inspector Barry regarding extra seating accommodation and blackboard required at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, we will be unable to authorize supplying this equipment at the present time. The matter might again be drawn to the attention of the Department at the beginning of the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI would request authority to expend the sum of approximately thirty dollars for lumber and the necessary labour for the construction of two toilets for the Indian Day School at Kingcome Inlet. If the necessary authority is obtained, it is desired that this work be proceeded with and completed before the school session commences on September 1st next.\n\nTwo dozen school desks are urgently needed at this school, and if possible I would recommend that the necessary authority be given for this purchase.\n\nRecommendations made by the Inspector of Indian Schools to the effect that the school building at this place should be provided with extra windows, cannot be proceeded with until permission has been received from Church authorities, as the building used for school purposes was erected by and is the property of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster. The agreement at this place is that the Department supplies the fuel and makes provision for all repair work so long as the building is used for Day School purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\nA/Indian Agent\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a letter received in duplicate from Acting Indian Agent E.G. Newnham, of the Kwawkewlth Agency, dated June 19th, in which a request is made for the sum of \u00a330.00 to cover the cost of lumber and labour for the construction of two toilets for the Indian Day School at Kingcome Inlet.\n\nIt will further be noted in this letter that Mr. Newnham asks for two dozen school desks which are urgently needed for this school and also suggests that certain repairs to the windows should be carried out although the work cannot be done until permission has been received from the Church Authorities.\n\nIn view of the fact that the late Indian Agent, Mr. Halliday, in presenting his estimates for the current fiscal year, failed to make provision for any of the above-mentioned services and in view of very strong recommendation by the Inspector of Indian Schools to myself that it is most desirable that the first mentioned service should be authorized I would recommend that authority be granted if possible to Mr. Newnham to expend the sum of \u00a330.00 for the construction of the toilets and should the Department approve, the Indian Agent could be instructed to include in his 1934-35 estimates the school desks and other repairs required, that is, if the Department has no funds from which expenditure of new desks can be made at present. I understand from Inspector Barry that a considerable number of the children are now sitting on boxes at this school and he considers that the late Indian Agent should have made requisition at the proper time last Fall when submitting the estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/KD.\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 197/6/2985 of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Acting Indian Agent, Alert Bay, requesting authority to expend the sum of $30 for lumber and the necessary labour in the construction of two toilets at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School and to supply two dozen desks.\n\nRegarding the desks, I have to say that the Department will have no funds this year to provide the cost. The school will have to carry on under the present arrangements for seating the pupils.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $30 in constructing two toilets. You should arrange with the Agent to have this work performed. The material required should be purchased from indicated sources and Indian labour used, if possible. I enclose encumbrance certificate authorizing the expenditure for the purpose of supplying the material and labour in the erection of the toilets. After the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and also for the labour. Please state on each copy of the account that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 744.\n\nThe Agent should be instructed to include, in his 1934-35 Estimates the expenditure required in supplying the number of desks needed at this school, and, when our Estimates are being prepared, consideration will be given as to whether the amount can be included.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

No. 744 with respect to expenditure at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C.\n\nIn reply thereto I beg to say that the Acting Indian Agent has today been advised of the contents of the Department's communication as well as given instructions in regard thereto.\n\nP/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. Q. Ferry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Kincome Inlet Day School. It is noted you state in your letter that the erection of two toilets at this school has been requested through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nWith regard to these toilets, I would refer you to your letter of June 27th and official reply of July 26th, also your letter of July 13th. The Department has not yet received any account covering the cost of these toilets. Possibly you have not yet notified the Indian Agent regarding the authority which you received. If you have not done so, the matter should receive immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental letter dated September 12th, instant, No.156-17-5, in regard to the report of Inspector Barry concerning his visit to the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School in the Kwakwewlth Agency. In reply thereto I regret very much to have inadvertently overlooked the fact that on July 13th, last, Mr. Acting Indian Agent Newnham was furnished with copy of the Department's letter dated July 6th, last, and was instructed to include in his 1934-35 Estimates the amount required in supplying the number of desks needed at the above-mentioned school so that consideration would be given thereto by the Department. Under R.R.744 Mr. Newnham was further instructed to expend the sum not exceeding $30.00 in the construction of two toilets for the school. Mr. Newnham recently went to Kingcome to supervise the above-mentioned work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOctober 10, 1933.\n\nFile No. 182\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI request authority for a further expenditure of Thirty Dollars to cover the cost of erection of toilets for use at Kingcome Inlet Day School. This work has not been completed and is still in progress.\n\nOne unforeseen contingency in connection with this work is the fact that two weeks ago a somewhat serious flood occurred at Kingcome village, which not only delayed the work, but rendered it necessary to change the type of construction originally decided upon with a view to the possibility of these buildings being carried away in the event of future floods, being obviated. This necessitated additional lumber being obtained and more labour, which includes a certain amount of difficulty encountered in conveying this lumber from the mouth of the Kingcome River to the village by canoe, a distance of four miles. I am informed by long residents in that district that a flood of this magnitude has not occurred in the Kingcome valley within their knowledge, and this is a situation which I will watch and report on later if occasion requires.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, October 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, requesting authority to incur a further expenditure of $30 in erecting two toilets at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School and stating the reason for the additional outlay.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your incurring the further expenditure required, viz., $30, and I enclose herewith an Encumbrance Requisition authorizing the funds.

Solomon, teacher of the Indian Day School at Kingcome Inlet, in regard to the teacher's residence at that point:\n\n\"During the present rain and formerly we have noticed several quite bad leaks in the roof of the mission building. It would be well to have these repaired as soon as possible as I am afraid the beaver board on the ceiling may swell and split.\n\nHoping this will receive your immediate attention,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"L.K.

Newnham]\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, embodying an extract from a communication which you received from the teacher of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, regarding the repairs required to the roof of the mission building, used as a teacher's residence.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, if this building is the property of the church authorities, it is considered that they should be responsible for the carrying out of any repairs required. However, we are not definitely aware as to the ownership of the building, and I shall be pleased if you will advise the Department whether the building used as a residence for the teacher is the property of this Department. If it is our property, further consideration will be given to authorizing an expenditure for the amount required in repairing the roof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nNovember 18, 1933.\n\nSir-\n\nReplying to your letter dated November 10 re the above, I have to report that the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School is conducted in a building which was erected and is owned by the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster. The teacher's residence is also included in the same building.\n\nOn my arrival here I found there was a certain amount of confusion in connection with this school. Vouchers for fuel supplies for the school were being submitted to the Columbia Coast Mission and after some delay eventually reached this office, being transmitted by me to the Department in the usual manner for payment. In view of the fact that some payments were outstanding at the close of the fiscal year, this system had to be abandoned and I instructed the teacher to forward these vouchers direct to me.\n\nDuring his inspection of this school in May last, Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., instructed that windows were to be provided for two sides of the school instead of on the one side, the regulations of the Provincial Department of Education now calling for daylight to be shown from both sides of a schoolroom. By this time I had ascertained that the building was the property of the Church, and I therefore approached His Lordship Archbishop DePencier for the necessary permission to have these other windows provided before writing the Department for authority. However on applying to the Secretary of the Columbia Coast Mission for the dimensions of the building so that the new windows could be uniform with those already fixed, he informed me that he could do nothing in the matter until the return from England of the Rev. John Antis, the Superintendent of the Columbia Coast Mission. Consequently, I have done nothing further in this matter.\n\nThere is very definite authority that so long as this building is used for Day School purposes, the Department will supply the fuel, and it is understood that the Department also undertakes the necessary repair work so long as the building is used as a Day School and is the teacher's residence. The situation at present is that the building is not the property of the Department, but of the Church and the only expenditure required for repairing the roof is the cost of one bundle of shingles and the necessary labour. At the present time I cannot quote the price of the shingles as this fluctuates considerably, but the whole cost would not amount to more than a few dollars whereas if this leakage is not repaired as soon as possible, it is probable that the cost of repairing the roof at a future date would be considerably higher. This building is somewhat \"jerry-built\" but at present it is the only one on the Kingcome Inlet reserve which can be used for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\n(A/Indian Agent)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the repairs required to the roof of the mission building, used for school purposes and teacher's residence at Kingcome Inlet.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of the information contained in your letter, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the one bundle of shingles and for the necessary labour in installing same on the roof of the building. It is noted that the whole cost will not amount to more than a few dollars. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWith reference to payment of the fuel for the use of this school, I have to say that the Department will provide the cost. Please forward a properly certified voucher, stating in detail the quantities of fuel supplied for use during the present winter. Vouchers for all wood supplied for the present winter should reach the Department before the close of the present fiscal year.\n\nRegarding the instructions of the Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, that windows should be provided for two sides of the school instead of on the one side, as at present, I have to say it is not considered necessary that these windows be installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In view of this, I would recommend that the Department purchase one black Hyloplate blackboard size 6 x 4'.\n\nI note you also advise that owing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to purchase twenty-four desks for this school at the present time. This I am very sorry indeed to learn, because I feel if the Department could see the difficulties under which these children have to be accommodated, I am sure an effort would be made to supply seating facilities. This matter has been reported according to our files, on and off for the past two years; in 1932 the Department requested we bring the matter before them after the end of the fiscal year, and last year this item was put in the Estimates with a strong recommendation that they be supplied.\n\nSince taking over the Agency, my policy has been to curtail all unnecessary expenditure, but this is one case where I feel I must appeal to the Department if it is at all possible to furnish this school with the desks requested. At the present time the children are sitting on packing boxes of all shapes and sizes and the same are being used for desks. I might also point out there are Indian children in this village who are not attending school and it is difficult for me to insist upon them going when they must sit on packing boxes.\n\nI therefore again appeal to you to have these desks furnished this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMST/T\n\nIndian Affairs.

This combined one classroom and one teacher residence can be dismantled and made ready to ship for an estimated cost of $500. If desired all new material could be delivered to Alert Bay by March 31 for a further $1500.

The matter of the school building required for these Indians will likewise be brought to the attention of Mr. Agent Loring that\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nhe may report fully thereon for the Department's information.\n\nHe is also being asked to furnish the Department with a report in the matter of the parents' request to the Inspector for the establishment of a boarding school in their midst.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

(RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-1, part 1)\nBRITISH COLUMBIA,\n\nBABINE AGENCY,\n\nHazelton, July 21st 1906.\n\nSIR,-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 743, X-4, dated the 8th ultimo., stating that in a letter, dated the 1st ibid., received from the Department, attention had been directed to some remarks made by Mr. School Inspector Green, in a recent report of inspection of the Kispiox Indian Day School, and that the remarks were,\n\nto wit:-\n\n\"An heathen potlatch and dancing this winter made the attendance smaller than usual. The school would be far better attended if the potlatch was given up.\"\n\n\"No school house. School is held in an Indian house rented by the teacher who pays the rent from his own pocket. A school house is urgently needed in this large village.\"\n\n\"The parents invited me to meet them in council, where they spoke very strongly in favor of a boarding school, etc., etc.\"\n\nAs to the heathen potlatch and dancing, referred to, having made the attendance of children small at that school, I have the honour to state that Mr. Inspector Green was not rightly informed. The Indians of Kispiox, whose children make up the attendance were during last winter chiefly in the woods logging.\n\nIn so far as the socalled potlatch is concerned, it was merely a memory feast attended by the old heathens of Kuldoe, Kisgegas and Kitwankool. Really, no objectionable feature is, in my opinion, connected therewith. There is no dancing practised amongst the Indians of this district in any shape, unless the crow-like hopping about of an old Indian, in ancient costume,\n\nA. W. VOWELL, ESQUIRE\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs, B.C., &c.\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-1, part 1)\ncan so be termed. If more than one engaged therein, it can be likened to a pantomime not unlike the movements in a minuet performed by ptarmigans, plus the grotesque in array and accompaniment of grunts.\n\nThe Indians attending a feast - and I do not think that there will be another for want of patronage - are the old Indians that spend all the year on the hunting ground, and, so far, it remains their sole diversion for about two weeks during the long winter. They are law-abiding and loyal, and seldom ever give evidence of their existence unless when meekly coming in to trade, whereas the precocious, of the paper-collar kind, have constantly their little fires kindled for something to fry.\n\nRegarding the Indian day school building, said by the inspector to be required at Kispiax, I will report upon the same as soon as a plan, in duplicate, can carefully be prepared and properly laid before the Department inclusive concerning incidentals.\n\nIn respect to a boarding school, for the same locality, a report from me will likewise be somewhat deferred for the reason stated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 12, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector Green in his report on the Kishpiax Indian Day School, dated May 11th, last, states that Mr. Lee's duties as missionary take up a great deal of his time and that Mrs. Lee is so encumbered that she cannot give very much assistance in the school work.\n\nAs this is a school at which there is abundant work for a teacher who can give his or her whole time to the duties, I would ask you to consider the nomination of a competent teacher whose whole time would be given to the class-room work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Original on File 139209/6\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nMr. Lee's many duties take a great deal of his time and Mrs. Lee with two little children (one a baby) cannot be expected to give more than the practical lessons.\n\nI would suggest a well qualified teacher be secured, as there is ample work for one to do.\n\nWhere the church gives an extra grant over the salary to the missionary to teach the school, there is an inclination to try and do without a teacher and sometimes the school suffers.\n\nMr. Lee is doing the best he can, but he has not sufficient time for school teaching.\n\nSgd. A.E. Green,\nInspector.\nExtract of letter received from R.E. Loring, Indian Agent, Babine and Upper Skeena River Agency, Dated December 9, 1911. Original on File 184711-1.\n\nBy a letter of Revd. A.E. Price, the former principal of this school, becoming miscarried, the then prospective teacher did not arrive till about several weeks later. That teacher, Miss F.B. Kemp has been at work there since about the beginning of the present quarter. She is fully qualified, and a most efficient teacher, and left the Kispiax school to take over this school. And Miss Kemp's school, at Kispiax, was taken over by Revd. Robert W. Lee, fully qualified, and who also is the resident Missionary there.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSIR\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd.) R.E. Loring,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo embodying some remarks made by the teacher of the Kishpiax school on her return for the December quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that the regularity of the attendance was interfered with during that quarter and trusts that normal conditions are now restored. It is also pleasing to learn that Miss Kemp finds her work at this place congenial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nA letter has recently come to hand from the Indian School teacher at Kispiz on the Upper Skeena, B.C., accompanying duplicate of school returns for the December quarter. In view of the disturbed condition among the Indians in that part of the country the following extract from the teacher's letter may be of some interest:\n\n\"The disturbances, also the continued feasting during the closing weeks of December, reduced the attendances and was disappointing. On the whole the attendances were good considering the very great disadvantages this winter; for some time every eligible child was attending school. The people are very friendly to me personally. I have always had great happiness in the Indian work, and look forward to a continuance.\n\n(Signed) Yours cordially, F.B.

Richardson, the former Field Matron of the Kispiax No.1 reserve (Kispik Village) for the month ended with the 30th of April, last.\n\nIn connection therewith, and explanation thereof, I beg to state that on having had occasion to call at the local drug-store, I was told by its Manager, Mr. Fulton;-\n\n\"By the way, there has been a letter lying here for some time that should have been handed you some while ago, but must have been overlooked.\"\n\nOn opening the same, found the said, and herewith contained report.\n\nThis fact may recall a similar instance, whereat these reports were transmitted by me in an inverted order by no fault of mine, since such of May last preceded that of April, under present consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Old Chief Paul's house has been cleaned.\n\nThe illnesses in the village this month have included, besides those of recipient or suspected tuberculosis:\n\n8 chronic cases\n4 cases sore eyes\n3 cases tonsillitis\n3 \" malnutrition or overstrain\n1 \" skin disease\n1 \" rheumatism\n2 births and 1 death\nThe tubercular cases are doing well, finding it easy to be out of doors at this season of the year. Also the women have improved a little regarding the quality of nourishment they give their children. This is shown among heathen and Christian alike in the better nourished bodies of the little ones.\n\nOur accident was that of a girl of ten years playing beside the river. One of the boys, son of a \"medicine man,\" is noted for his roughness and playing there at the same time with others of the village children. The other children had started home, and at last Ellen began to go up the bank also but the boy seizing her arm from behind dragged her down the bank. She did not complain when at home for about a week afterwards when swelling and immobility could hardly be hidden. She was then taken to the...\nIt was a younger sister of Ellen's who was injured two years ago in an accident which we could never get an account but which was supposed to have been the result of a drunken brawl. From this she never recovered and this month ended a long illness resembling tuberculosis when the little sufferer died.\n\nAn Indian Constable came and reported three places where the native liquor was being made after most of it had been drunk. However, the discovery was much to our satisfaction as we had known the\nintoxicant was in the village, but not\nwhence it had been obtained. We\nhave taken the opportunity & have\nsome very practical talks since\nthen with some of the offenders:\nrealizing the while that moral\nreason is not wholly sufficient\nto suppress evil\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\nJ.J. Richardson\n\nKispisa\nMay 27, 1913\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that a delegation composed of some of the leading Indians of Kishpiax waited on me at Port Essington, when I was there this month. They requested me to state their wishes to the Department regarding the Day School at Kishpiax, Babine Agency. They wish a teacher to teach the Day School separate from the missionary.\n\nThey stated that the Rev. R.W. Lee, Missionary and teacher for the past two years has now left the village and Agency, and Miss. Richardson, the nurse, who did a good work has gone to Alberta, so they are without anyone. They claim that when it is left with the missionary to teach the school, the school is not properly cared for.\n\nI consider the Indians have ample cause to complain of the way the school has been conducted of late. If a missionary does his work properly he will be a busy man in this large village. And if a teacher does his work well, with fifty-nine children of school age in the village and forty-three enrolled, there is sufficient work in the school for nine months of the year for any one person however well qualified.\n\nThese people are very anxious for their children to be taught and when a suitable teacher, like Miss. Klippert (now at Metlakatla) and Miss. Kemp (now teacher at Kitwanga), who formerly taught this school, were the teachers, the children attended well, made progress and the parents were satisfied.\n\nThe Rev. R.W. Lee received a salary of $800.00, $500.00 of this being the grant from the Department to the Methodist Missionary Society for the school, this being supplemented by $300.00 from the Missionary Society. Mr. Lee was expected to do and did, missionary\namong the whites, and was often away from the Indian village.\n\nThe school has not received fair treatment the past year, and the Indians are afraid the same may happen again.\n\nI would respectfully but strongly recommend that the church authorities be commissioned with an order that a suitable teacher be secured for the coming September, who shall give proper attention to the school. It would be more satisfactory, with a good teacher giving full time to the school, to increase the salary a hundred dollars, than to give the present grant, and the work for it not being properly done, hence the salary unearned.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your favor of the 15th.\n\n#139209/1 re teacher for Kiskpian, I fully concur in the report of Mr. Green, your Inspector, regarding the work at Kiskpian, believing that Mr. Lee could not do the two-fold work satisfactorily, and in harmony with this I have been trying to secure a teacher. I think I can get the services of Mrs. Fakley, a bright young woman who is the widow of one of our missionaries, to go there and take up the work of teacher. Would the Department sanction this appointment? I think the salary should be at least $500.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Richardson (late Nurse-Deaconess, Kispiax reserve) taking charge of her work, and to inform, if possible, the Department in respect thereto, so that any balance of salary due for her services can be paid. Also remarking that it would seem that she was only conducting that work for nine (9) months, I have the honour to state the following:\n\nAfter some questioning on that subject, I was only successful enough to elicit that, primarily, Miss Richardson came, during May 1913, as an old time friend as guest to Mrs. J. P. Thorkildson to the latter's then abode, a ranch on the Kispiax river, some few miles removed from the Kispiax village. There, Revd. R.W. Lee interviewed Miss Richardson, and promised, if taking hold at Kispiax, that he (Mr. Lee) would see her paid from the 1st of May of that year, and, if need be, part out of his own means. Thereafter, Miss Richardson had gone to work some time in June, following; and it appears that the Department did not authorize a grant in that respect till the beginning of the following September.\n\nHere, lately, Revd. Geo.H. Haley, former president of the B.C. Methodist conference, personally, interviewed me on that subject whereupon the latter appeared satisfied, and advised him, additionally to interview Mrs. Thorkildson, now here, and, no doubt, this will set things to rights in so far as the Department's obligations are concerned in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nMrs. Fakeley has accepted of the position of teacher at Kishpiar, B.

You will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Lorins, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOttawa, February 6, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Miss Gertrude Martin, teacher of the Kispiox Indian Day School, has made application to the Department through Mr. Agent Ioring of the Babine Agency for an increase in her salary from $500.00 to $600.00 per annum.\n\nWith reference to this request I beg to say that the Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, submitted a schedule of salaries for the Methodist Indian day schools and in this schedule requested that a salary of $600.00 per annum be provided for the Kispiox Day School and cheques in payment of the quarterly salary at this rate have been sent since July 1st, 1914.\n\nIf you have been furnished with a copy of this schedule you will see that the teacher of this school is entitled to payment at the rate of $600.00 per annum from that date and no doubt it is through an oversight that she has been paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum instead of $600.00, which is due her from the 1st of July, 1914.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

No. 139209/1 re salary of Miss Gertrude Martin, teacher of the Kishpian Indian day school, would say that as intimated in my letter of the 9th, I wrote to the Chairman of the Fort Simpson District, Rev. J. F. Dimmick, in regard to the matter and have his reply today, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nAs already stated, we are sending the Chairman each quarter sufficient to pay the full salary of $600.00 and Mr. Dimmick's letter states that this is the amount she has been receiving.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Shannon,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Brother:\n\nI have just received your letter of enquiry re Miss Gertrude Martin, teacher at Kishpias. Certainly some mistake has occurred in the information you have received from the Govt. Dept. In looking up my records I find I have paid Miss G. Martin $600 for last year and on this year's account I paid her $150 each quarter, in Sept. 1916, Nov., and Feb. 1917, which is on the basis of three quarter salary. So she is receiving regularly $150 per quarter and has but one more payment due her in this school year. I have the returned cheques for these amounts.\n\nHoping this will clear the matter up from our side,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) J. F. DIMMICK.\nFebruary 9th, 1917.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 8th inst. No. 139209/1, re salary of Miss Gertrude Martin, teacher of the Kishpiax Indian day school. In reply would say that shortly after the Annual Meeting of the General Board of Missions in October last, a statement under date of October 19th, giving the salaries of all employees, missionaries and teachers, for the financial year, was sent to the Chairman of what we call the Fort Simpson District, in which Kishpiax is located, and the salary of the teacher there is given as $600.00. It is therefore a surprise to learn that that amount is not being paid to Miss Martin. I shall at once draw the attention of the Chairman to the matter.\n\nJHS-RT.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe Notice to resign - Teacher -\n\nIn compliance with the concluding paragraph of the INDIAN DAY SCHOOL REGULATIONS - for guidance of Inspectors, Indian Agents and Teachers, namely, in that all teachers be required to give at least one month's notice of their intention to resign, I have the honour to report herewith that Miss Gertrude Martin, the teacher of the Kispiox Indian Day School, because of illness of her mother, feels herself impelled to relinquish her duties with that school on the current quarter to be ended with the 30th proximo.\n\nRelative taking this step, Miss Martin is loath to leave, and myself much regret to lose such efficient and diligent a teacher, but since circumstances will not otherwise permit, I respectfully recommend that the action in the premises about to be taken by Miss Martin may, by the Department, not be considered otherwise than one solely prompted by urgent necessity, and in the sense of being mindful of having been treated by the Department with the utmost kindness and consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 22, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to previous correspondence regarding the amount of salary paid Miss Gertrude Martin, teacher of the Kishpiax Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Loring regarding this matter. The Agent states that in making the application for an increase in Miss Martin's salary he was under the impression that she was only receiving $500.00 per annum and that in requesting that her salary be increased to $600.00 per annum he did so \"entirely upon his own initiative on the merits of the services rendered by Miss Martin, and without consulting her as intended beneficiary, in order to afford her a pleasant surprise\".\n\nThe Department regrets that through a misunderstanding of the Agent's letter in applying for this increase you were put to any inconvenience in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The British Columbia Conference at its recent session nominated Rev. J. T. Burchill, M.A., who has been supplying at Port Essington during the past year, for that position.\n\nMr. Burchill is a Master of Arts of Dublin University and was for a number of years a missionary in Honduras. He has been in British Columbia for five or six years and has taught successfully in Columbian College, New Westminster, and a private school for boys. I do not know whether his certificate would be accepted by the British Columbia Department of Education or not. There is a letter from him today in which he expresses himself as willing to spend July and August mastering the curriculum of the public schools in British Columbia. The fact that he conducted a very successful night school in Port Essington last year would seem to indicate that he has the ability to teach elementary subjects. He has a wife and three children and is desirous of moving to Kispiox on the 1st July, if his nomination as teacher of the day school is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI have not met Mr. Burchill personally, but Dr. Barner, our Superintendent of Indian Missions, visited him in Port Essington and was very favorably impressed.\n\nI sincerely trust that this nomination will meet with the favor of the Department and that the salary allowed will at least be as much as Miss Earl was receiving.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nOttawa, May 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, the Department understands that Rev. J. T. Burchill, teacher of the Kispiox Indian Day School, will be absent from the school, through illness, for the balance of the academic year, and that Miss Westman will take over his duties without cost to the Department.\n\nIn view of Rev. Mr. Burchill's condition, this arrangement is approved, but you should point out to him on his return, as well as to the teachers of the other Indian day schools in your Agency, that the schools should not be kept open during holidays or Saturdays without the express permission of the Department. The instructions contained in the circular issued yearly regarding the dates of opening and closing of Indian day schools should be adhered to strictly, unless special permission has been obtained from the Department to deviate from the regulations that are contained in the circular.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Burchill, Teacher of the Kispiox Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the above named gentleman who, apparently, is suffering from a near nervous break-down in health. I am also enclosing a report from Dr. H. C. Wrinch dealing with the matter. Both letters are self explanatory.\n\nIf the Department approves of the wishes of Mr. Burchill, arrangements have been made by Mr. Burchill for Miss Westman, Field Matron, to take over his duties for a period of twenty days with no cost to the Department.\n\nI am of opinion that Miss Westman is quite capable of carrying on during the absence of Mr. Burchill.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

J. W. A. Stinson as teacher of the Kispiox Indian Day School. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have Mr. Stinson complete and return to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRE KISPIOX\n\nYou will know that for some time we have been trying to get this position filled in a way that will be satisfactory both to your Department and to our Board.\n\nI beg to advise that Mr. Burchill is leaving and in his place we are nominating Rev. J. W. A. Stinson, B.A., B.D. Mr. Stinson is a recent graduate of the University of Toronto and Emmanuel College, and was actually on his way to serve our Mission in West China when the trouble out there caused the Foreign Mission Board to hold him over in Vancouver. It is quite unlikely that he will be proceeding to China this year, and consequently the Board of Foreign Missions is willing to release him for service in Canada for one year. I know Mr. Stinson personally, and can assure you that he would be in every way a fit person to take charge of the work at Kispiox, including the teaching.\n\nIn addition, Mrs. Stinson is a teacher, and would, no doubt, be of assistance to her husband.\n\nI hope that you will find it possible to agree to this nomination in spite of the fact that Mr. Stinson is, perhaps, not exactly qualified from a pedagogical point of view. I feel sure that one who has a missionary spirit and, in addition, personal and academic qualifications far beyond the average, will make a success of this work. I shall be glad to hear if your Department approves of the nomination.\n\nWith best regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 6, 1937.\n\n- Rev. J. T. Burchill -\n\nDear Mr. Hansen:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 30th and also certain correspondence relating to the dismissal of Reverend J. T. Burchill from the Kispiox Indian Day School, enclosed therewith.\n\nThe records here indicate that Mr. Burchill was appointed teacher at the Kispiox Day School on June 25th, 1934, and was nominated for the position by the then Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada. The appointment was made for the academic year 1934-35.\n\nIt was noted by the Department at that time that Mr. Burchill had no professional certificate recognized as valid in Canada, nor had he any previous experience in teaching at an Indian day or residential school.\n\nInspector Barry's first report on his work at the Kispiox School is dated September 18th, 1935. Mr. Barry, in this report, expresses the opinion that Mr. Burchill was rather erratic in a temperamental sense and very severe in his discipline. Mr. Burchill admitted to the Inspector at that time that he used the strap frequently. The Inspector, however, was anxious that this teacher should be given an opportunity to make good, and his specific recommendation to the Department was that a close check be kept on the actions of the teacher during the year.\n\nThe next report of the Inspector on this school is dated September 15th, 1936. The Inspector, at that time,\n\nwas profoundly\n\nOlof Hansen, Esq., M.P.,\nSmithers,\nB.C.\nwas profoundly dissatisfied with the progress of the pupils and expressed the opinion that Mr. Burchill was in a very nervous condition and, in his judgment, on the verge of a physical breakdown. In view of these facts, the Inspector recommended that the United Church authorities be asked to replace Mr. Burchill at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe Acting Superintendent of Indian Education wrote at that time to the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, sending forward to him a copy of Captain Barry's report. The Secretary's reply is dated October 15th, 1936, and, in this letter, the Secretary states:\n\n\"I appreciate the trouble which you have taken to copy Inspector Barry's report concerning the recent inspection of the Kispiox Indian Day School. I am inclined to think that, for once, Mr. Barry is absolutely right; but you are well aware of the great difficulty we have in securing men of the right type for that particular school. I do not believe that anything can be done about it before June 30th.\"\n\nInspector Barry's next report is dated May 25th, 1937. In this report, the Inspector states:\n\n\"The teacher was ill with nerves in May and June, 1936, and was granted sick leave. He was absent from the school at the time of this inspection and I did not see him.\n\nThere is nothing on record here to indicate that Mr. Burchill obtained permission to leave his school at that time, from the Department, the local Indian Agent or the office at Victoria.\n\nIn his recommendations, the Inspector takes a strong stand that, in the interests of the school and in the interests of Mr. Burchill, himself, a change of teacher at Kispiox should be given careful consideration by the Department.\n\nThe subject\nThe subject matter of the Inspector's reports has been discussed, by letter and personally, with the United Church authorities. The Associate Secretary of the Home Mission Board took the position very definitely, when the matter was last discussed with him, that so far as he was personally concerned, he was prepared to abide by the recommendations contained in the Inspector's report. He had in mind at that time not only the Inspector's report on the Kispox School but other reports, the subject matter of which had been brought to his attention at that time.\n\nIt is just possible that a great deal of the difficulty has arisen as the result of Mr. Burchill's physical condition. In a letter addressed to him dated April 25th, 1936, Dr. H. C. Winch, of Hazelton, states:\n\n\"I am of the opinion that, in order to avoid what might be a very serious nervous breakdown, it is advisable that you arrange with as little delay as possible to take from six to eight weeks of rest and entire relaxation.\"\n\nMr. Burchill objects, as I understand it, not so much to his dismissal but rather to the procedure followed by the departmental officials with respect to his dismissal. I may state, by way of comment, that it has never been the policy or practice of the Department to supply teachers in charge of our Indian day or residential schools with copies of Inspectors' reports. These reports are very carefully prepared candid documents, and have always been looked upon by the Department as strictly confidential. Provincial Departments of Education have learned from experience that an adverse or critical Inspector's report supplied to a teacher frequently militates against, rather than contributes to, his or her success in a school. British Columbia may be an exception, but the Departments of Education in most of the Provinces do not supply teachers with copies of Inspectors' reports. Copies, however, are sent to Secretaries of Trustee Boards. Inspector Barry is one of our senior officials, particularly well qualified to pass judgment.\njudgment on the work of a teacher. He occupies a very exacting position and is called upon to work in close cooperation with the church authorities, the teachers in charge of schools, the Indian population and the general public. I am convinced that, in his recommendations from year to year, he is actuated by no motives other than a desire to see capable, fully qualified and successful teachers in charge of the schools for the progress of which he is responsible.\n\nMr. Burchill, in paragraph 11 of his reply to Mr. Oostehout's letter of October 26th, 1936, refers to Indian Agent Mortimer and to his alleged hostility to the teacher from the time of his first arrival at the school, and states:\n\n\"It is clear that Captain Mortimer wants a lady teacher at Kispiox and has gone so far as to offer the school to Miss Tretiak several times lately.\"\n\nMr. Burchill should know that the Department has never at any time permitted Indian agents to nominate teachers for Indian day schools, and this also applies to Captain Barry. These appointments are made at all times by the Department and the Department accepts full responsibility for the appointments when they are made. In the case of the Kispiox and a number of other schools, we extend to the United Church an opportunity to nominate teachers for any positions that may be vacant, but the Department has never felt itself bound to accept such nominations. We frequently insist that two or three names be submitted in the case of a vacancy, so that the officials may have an opportunity to pass judgment on the qualifications and fitness of the applicants.\n\nI do not know that there is much that I can add to the views I have already expressed. Reference has been made to Mr. Burchill's health. In addition to this, he appears to be a very highly strung, temperamental and somewhat erratic individual. It is just possible that while he may be eminently qualified for educational work\nin an advanced school, he did not find the work at Kispiox sufficiently challenging. It is significant and worthy of note that we have experienced a great deal of difficulty the last two or three years with male teachers who have been given positions at elementary Indian day schools. The average male teacher seems to lack the necessary powers of adaptability for this work. On the other hand, female teachers, with the same or lower qualifications, are, with very rare exceptions, outstandingly successful.\n\nI want to thank you very heartily for the courtesy that prompted you to bring this matter to my personal attention.\n\nI am returning herewith the correspondence enclosed with your communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nSmithers, B.C.\nJuly 30th, 1937.\n\nDr. McGill,\nDirector General Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nRe Rev. J.T. Burchill, Hazelton.\n\nI enclose you herewith original letter and three enclosures which I have received from the above mentioned party.\n\nRev. Burchill called on me a few days ago and explained that in his opinion he had been unfairly treated by the Indian Department and asked me to bring the matter to your attention. I told him he would have to give me all the details in connection with his complaint and assured him that his case would be investigated and that he would be given an opportunity to defend himself.\n\nThe enclosures state his case and I would appreciate you having the thing looked into and advise me of your findings so that I can advise him accordingly. I would also ask that you kindly return the enclosures for my files.\n\nAppreciating your assistance and cooperation at all times, I am\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nOH/W\nOlof Hanson, M.P., Skeena.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. T. Burchill B.A., from his position as teacher of the Indian Day School at Kispiox, B.C., owing to an unfavorable report by the inspector;\n\nAnd, whereas the services of Mr. Burchill, as a teacher, are entirely satisfactory to the people and pupils of Kispiox with whom he is deservedly popular;\n\nAnd, whereas we consider that such an unfavorable report does not give a fair estimate of his work as a school teacher;\n\nAnd whereas, under similar circumstances, a teacher under a provincial inspector in B.C. has the right to appeal for an independent investigation;\n\nAnd, whereas he is a university graduate with previous successful teaching experience;\n\nAnd, whereas we believe that the services of Mr. Burchill are an immeasurable value to the Kispiox school;\n\nAnd, whereas men of such high qualifications cannot be attracted to such work unless they are assured of protection under similar circumstances;\n\nBe it resolved that this presbytery of Prince Rupert in the United Church of Canada request the Department of Indian Affairs to have T. W. Hall of Prince Rupert, Provincial Inspector of Schools, inspect the school at Kispiox and make an independent report;\n\nFurther be it resolved that no dismissal be made until this report is received and duly considered.\n\nFurther be it resolved that copies of this resolution be sent to the Home Mission Board of the United Church of Canada, the Department of Indian Affairs, and the Member of the Dominion Parliament for Skeena.\n\nYours\u2014truly,\n\nH.

Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Sir,-\n\nMonthly report for April - Babine Agency.\n\nI also inspected the Kispiox Day School where there were forty-five children present, all looking healthy, well dressed and clean. Miss Bews, the teacher, has had many years of training and knows her work. She has sixty-five pupils enrolled on her register and often has well over fifty in attendance which, I consider, is too many for one teacher.\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\n298 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nThere is a strong feeling on the part of our workers on the Upper Skeena that there should be two teachers at Kispiox and I believe that is felt by others who are related to the education of the Indians in the North.\n\nMiss Doris Bews as you know has been supplying there for a few months and has given excellent service. Mr. More has volunteered as a teacher for that school in conjunction with the work of the Mission and at my request he visited the field recently. While he is not endeavouring to escape any of the work involved in the school teaching he feels that to do justice to 66 students with a prospective addition of a dozen more in September that he should have an assistant, otherwise he says it will be quite impossible to retain the interest of the more advanced grades.\n\nIn order to do this, it will be necessary for the Department to add another room to the present building and I believe the Indian Agent has suggested that the wood-shed might be utilized with some alterations for that purpose. Would you be good enough to take the matter up with the Department at Ottawa, to see if as an emergency case they could provide the small amount necessary for this added accommodation.\n\nI am sure it will give fine results if both Miss Bews and Mr. More can be retained as teachers in Kispiox where there is already awakened a keener interest on the part of the children and also on the part of their parents than has been manifested for many years.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation in this matter at an early date and with warm regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned - S. S. Osterhout.\n\nCopied: FMW\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJune 28th,\n1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a letter which has come from Dr. Osterhout regarding the need of a second teacher at Kispiox. I may say that I was there at the beginning of May and would strongly recommend that, if at all possible, a second teacher be appointed. This village is making some progress, but the school is not the best part of the village.\n\nI gathered that the Agent, Captain Mortimer, had strongly recommended the appointment of a second teacher, and that it would be possible to divide the school itself into two parts, without much expense. In any case, you will soon need a better school building at this point. It is not at all the same kind of building as you have at Fort Simpson and Campbell River.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-1, part 2)\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 6, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada in which he states that it would be advisable to appoint a second teacher at the Kispiox Indian Day School. We are advised that there will likely be at least 65 pupils for the next academic year, and possibly 75. Do you consider that there will be this number who will attend the school regularly during the academic year 1938-39?\n\nWe have also been informed that if a second teacher is appointed, the present wood shed might be utilized for a classroom. Of course, some alterations would have to be made.\n\nIn preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year, no provision was made for a second teacher at this point and it will be difficult to secure the necessary funds. However, I would appreciate your advising me as soon as possible regarding your views in the matter, and in the event of your recommending a second teacher for the coming academic year, you might let me know the approximate cost of making the alterations to the wood shed. In the event of a second teacher being authorized, will it be necessary to purchase new desks? Any information that you might have available should also be forwarded for our consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nG. C.

It has been our policy recently, however, to provide living quarters when constructing schools on isolated reserves or on reserves where teachers may find it impossible to secure board and lodging. In a number of cases the teacher acts as missionary and in such cases living accommodation is invariably provided by the church. As a rule salaries are not influenced by living accommodation or lack of living accommodation. The experience of the teacher, the enrolment at the school, its accessibility, etc., are all factors that are usually reviewed by the Department before the salary of the teacher is decided upon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

We have had a request from that point to spend some money in fixing up the missionary's residence, so that accommodation can be found for the teacher. Is it the policy of the Department to provide quarters for teachers in such circumstances? Or is the salary which you pay on the same basis as that of other teachers who provide their own living quarters out of it? I should be glad to know just what the rule of the Department is.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.D.M.T.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKay,\nOffice of Indian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nLast evening I was in Hazelton taking part in a Thanksgiving service, following which strong and urgent representations were made regarding the school. It is too bad that so many children are running around without any teaching being done.\n\nOur minister at Hazelton, and his wife, have made an offer which is worth serious consideration. They are prepared to move out to Kispiox right away and to open one room as soon as arrangements can be made to do so. If there seems need of the second room being opened, they would also undertake that at the beginning of either December or January. It is to be understood that teaching is to be on the basis of four days a week, Tuesday to Friday, inclusive, and that when our annual Conference meets in May, they will be free to attend. For this they would expect to be paid four-fifths of the usual salary, plus bonus and whatever else may have gone with the salary at that school.\n\nI discussed the plan with Mr. Boys, Indian Agent, and he will be writing you giving his approval.\n\nOur minister's name is Rev. R.C.B. Morris. He is about 25 years of age and a graduate of U.B.C. Mrs. Morris is a few years younger, a Vancouver girl with Grade 12 standing. Both of them have had wide experience in Vacation School work and Young People's Leadership, are musical and greatly devoted to making a contribution to our Indian mission work. I have no hesitation in recommending the appointment, on a temporary basis, of Mrs. Morris to the school, and if necessary, later on would make a similar recommendation re Mr. Morris. If the proposal meets with your approval, would you communicate direct with your Department and with Dr. Dorsey, as I may not reach my office before Early November.\n\nI want to repeat, that I am not asking the Department to change its policy re employment of only certificated teachers. I am merely passing on to you what I consider a splendid offer for help in an emergency, and will abide by your decision.\n\nW.P.B.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-1, part 2)\nD.M. McKay Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe. Kispiox Indian Day School\n\nI have been approached today by the Rev. R. Morris, minister of the United Church, Hazelton, B.C., who offers to open the Kispiox Indian Day School for four days each week until next June, or until a permanent teacher can be found. The Rev. Mr. Morris would move out to Kispiox with his wife and occupy the United Church residence. He would be prepared if necessary to open a two roomed school but I suggest that at first one room be opened until we can ascertain what enrolment might be expected. This first room would be taught by Mrs. Morris, who, though not a qualified teacher, has full high school education. Mr. Morris would later teach a second room if necessary, also on a basis of four days a week.\n\nThe School room last used is in need of re-decoration and repair and I suggest that this be re-painted, floor oiled and the outside toilets re-located and repaired. I propose to visit Kispiox today to organize this work and will submit an estimate of cost for your approval by the next mail.\n\nI recommend employment of Mrs. Morris.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJB/cf.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of October 23rd and a letter dated October 22nd from Rev. W. P. Bunt, in connection with the proposed employment of Mrs. R.J.D. Morris, the wife of the local United Church minister, at the Kispiox Indian Day School.\n\nI may say that we have found it impossible to secure teachers for this two-room school and even though Mrs. Morris is able to keep the school open for four days a week only, it is considered that we should take advantage of her offer and that we should, if necessary, open the second classroom with Rev. Morris as teacher until such time as qualified teachers become available. I would recommend approval of Mrs. Morris' appointment at an all inclusive salary of $60.00 a teaching month for her services four days a week.\n\nThe question of repair and redecoration of the classrooms will be the subject of a separate communication.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 5 November 1946.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nWe have just received a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay enclosing a letter which he has received from the Reverend Mr. Bunt.\n\nOwing to the difficulty in obtaining a teacher for the Kispiox Day School, Mr. Bunt recommends that we employ Mrs. Morris, wife of the Missionary, Rev. R.J.D. Morris. Mrs. Morris is prepared to teach on the basis of four days a week, Tuesday to Friday inclusive.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay approves of this arrangement and suggests that we allow Mrs. Morris salary at the rate of $90. a teaching month.

It was arranged that if the class became too large for her to handle her husband, a splendid young fellow of outstanding ability in his field, would assist her. However, Miss Currie of the Port Simpson School, long recognized as an inferior teacher, fell out with her colleague and she was loaded on to this unfortunate agency, a blow that would have been softened somewhat if she had been sent to the vacant Kitsegukla. I met her the morning of her arrival and I think the time was something less than five minutes before she started off with a series of ultimatums.\n\n(Signed) James Coleman\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 7 January 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Kispiox Indian Day School - No. 819\n\nMrs. C.M. Morris was in charge of this school for the month of December at a salary of $90.00 a teaching month. Please issue cheque in her favour and forward same to Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nThis is the only payment that will be made to Mrs. Morris as another teacher will be available from Jan. 1, 1947.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence, we are arranging to forward a cheque for $90.00 in favour of Mrs. Morris for her services as teacher of the Kispiox School.\n\nWe have no definite information on our file regarding the exact date on which she began duties but from the Staff Questionnaire it is presumed that she taught at the school during December.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n8. Dependents. Taxpayers may claim as dependents only:\n\n(1) A person wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support and of whom the taxpayer has, or immediately before such person attained the age of twenty-one years had, in law or in fact, the custody and control.\n\n(2) Sons and daughters (including illegitimate sons and daughters) or sons-in-law or daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters or brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, and grandchildren, if under eighteen years of age, or under twenty-one and attending school, or over eighteen years of age and incapable of self-support.\n\n(3) Parents of grandparents, parents-in-law, or grandparents-in-law, incapable of self-support.\n\n(4) A daughter or sister under twenty-one years of age, training as a nurse in a public or provincially operated hospital.\n\n9. If Child under 16 and not Registrable for Family Allowances. A taxpayer may claim an exemption of only $100 for each child dependent child that was not yet have been registered under The Family Allowances Act, 1944, so that an allowance under the said Act was or might be claimed paid in respect of the last year of the taxation year. With a few exceptions, every child under 16 years of age may be registered and receive payments under The Family Allowances Act. Therefore, Form T.D.I. provides for the $100 exemption claimed for each dependent shown in Item 5 as having been born after November 1931.\n\nThere are isolated cases, however, of children under 16 years of age who are not registrable for family allowances. An employee supporting such a dependent child is entitled to claim the $300 exemption for tax deduction purposes. Therefore, an employee receiving a T.D.I. form in which the employee claims the $300 exemption of a child under 16 years of age may make deductions accordingly but he must immediately refer the T.D.I. form to the District Inspector of Income Tax for confirmation, accompanied by a declaration signed by the employee outlining the facts which substantiate his claim that he is the sole supporter of a child who is not eligible for registration under The Family Allowances Act.\n\n10. If Income of Spouse in Excess of $250. A taxpayer is not entitled to claim married status if his (her) spouse will have an income of more than $750 during the calendar year. If the spouse will have an income of more than $250 but not more than $750, the exemption permitted for marital status may be reduced by the amount by which the income of the spouse exceeds $250 (e.g., if the spouse's income will be\u2014say $600, then $350 should be entered in Item 6(B) (2) (i.e., $600 less $250). If the spouse's own income is less than $250, Item 6(B) (2) will be left blank and the full marital exemption of $750 entered in Item 6(B) (3).\n\n11. \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" means a dwelling house, apartment or other similar place of residence, containing at least two bedrooms, in which residence amongst other things the taxpayer as a general rule lives and has his meals prepared and served. See Item 10.\n\n12. Change in Status or Dependents. If during the year any change occurs in the status or dependents of an employee, the employee must report and file with his return an amended Form T.D.I.\n\n13. Effect of Failure to File Form T.D.I. In cases where Form T.D.I. (Revised for Jan. 1947) is not completed and filed with the employer, deductions from the employee's wages and salary after January 1st, 1947 must be treated as if the employee were a single person without dependents even though the employee may have filed a previous Form T.D.I. Single persons without dependents need not file.\n\n14. Filing of Income Tax Return. In addition to filing this form you must file your income Tax Return Form T.T. Special or T.T. General for the calendar year on or before 30th April of the following year.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE EMPLOYER\n\n15. If Form T.D.I Not Filed By Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.I. (Revised for Jan. 1947) must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents and deductions made as per column 1 in the Table of Income Tax Deductions (1947).\n\n16. Employer to Scrutinize Claim by Single Person for Married Status. The term \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" contained in Item 11 indicates clearly that a taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status by reason of supporting a dependent within which the dependent actually resides with the taxpayer. Therefore, employers are instructed to check the address shown under Item 4(B) or 4(D) with the taxpayer's own address in Item 5 (which should show where he is actually living at the time of making the declaration) and in every case where the addresses are not the same the employer must make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n17. Employer's Responsibility Regarding Form T.D.I. The employer will have regard to the instructions contained in Item 11 and will check the employee's completion of the total exemptions in Item 6 and will otherwise make certain that the form is fully completed. He will also delete as a dependent under Item 5 the name of any person whose employment has already been listed in Item 4 unless the claim for Married status came within paragraph (B) thereof. If the employer has reason to believe that any of the information on the form is incorrect or incomplete he must make the necessary correction until the employee has made the appropriate confirmation or correction. In case of doubt the matter should be referred to the District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n18. Action upon Receipt of Amended Form T.D.I. During Currency of Year. Employers are required to file an amended Form T.D.I. if any change occurs in status or dependents. The employer should give immediate effect to a change from \"Single\" status to \"Married\" status as a result of marriage in the number of dependents. A change from \"Married\" status to \"Single\" status (e.g., where the employee becomes a widower) should not be made effective until the employee pays the tax due for the year because the employee will still be entitled to claim \"Married\" status for the whole of the calendar year in which the change took place. Similarly, a decrease in the number of dependents should not generally result in a change in the deductions until the following calendar year with one important exception due to the provision that a taxpayer may not claim as a dependent any person who has an income in excess of $400 during the calendar year. If, for example, a son who was previously supported by an employee and was claimed as a dependent on Form T.D.I. takes employment from which he will earn over $400 during the calendar year immediate effect should be given to the amended form T.D.I. as otherwise the employee will be left with a substantial balance of tax to pay with his return on Form T.T. Special or T.T. General.\n\n19. Further Information or Forms with respect to deduction of tax may be obtained from any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\nCompleted Forms T.D.I must be Kept on File by the employer in order that they may be available at all times for payroll inspection by officers of the Taxation Division.\nCLAIM FOR MARRIED STATUS OR DEPENDENTS\n\n(Effective in respect of all Salaries and Wages paid on or after 1st January, 1947)\n\nFile this revised form with your employer prior to 31st December, 1946, as otherwise your employer must make tax deductions as if you were a single person without dependents (See Item 8) or you must file a new Form T.D. I\u2014(a) with each new employee when there is a change in marital status; (c) each time there is a change in the number of your dependents (See Items 5 and 8) or (d) any other changes take place that would increase or decrease the total exemptions to which you are entitled by $100 or more.\n\n1.

I HEREBY CERTIFY that all the information given by me on this Form, and in particular the information concerning the number of dependents and marital status is correct in every respect.\n\nFurther, I undertake, in accordance with the law, to immediately notify my employer by the filing of a new declaration on Form T.D.1 as soon as any change takes place in the facts above given.\n\nDate: Signature\n\nEmployer must retain this completed form for inspection by officers of the department.\n\nThere are penalties for making a false declaration.\n\nForm prescribed and authorized by the Minister of National Revenue (See Reverse Side)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-1, part 2)\n8. Dependents. Taxpayers may claim as dependents only:\n\n(A) A person wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support and of whom the taxpayer has, or immediately before such person attained the age of twenty-one years did have, in law or in fact, the care, custody, and control.\n\n(B) Sons and daughters (including illegitimate sons and daughters) or sons-in-law or daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters or brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, or children under eighteen years of age, or under twenty-one and attending school, or over eighteen years of age and incapable of self-support.\n\n(C) Parents, grandparents, parents-in-law, or grandparents-in-law, incapable of self-support.\n\n(D) A daughter or sister under twenty-one years of age training as a nurse in a public or provincially licensed private hospital.\n\n9. If Child Under 16 and Not Registrable for Family Allowances. A taxpayer may claim an exemption of only $100 for a wholly dependent child who must be brought up under The Family Allowances Act, 1944, so that an allowance under the said Act was or might have been paid in respect of the last year of the taxation year. Under certain exceptions, even children under 16 years of age may be registered and receive payments under The Family Allowances Act. Therefore, Form T.D.1 provides that only the $100 exemption shall be claimed for a child entered in Item 5 as having been born after November 1931.\n\nThere are isolated cases, however, of children under 16 years of age who are not registrable for family allowances. An employer supporting such a dependent child is entitled to claim the $250 exemption for tax deduction purposes. Therefore, an employer receiving a T.D.1 form in which an employee claims the $300 exemption for a child under 16 years of age may make deductions accordingly but he must immediately refer the T.D.1 form to the District Inspector of Income Tax for confirmation, accompanied by a declaration signed by the employee outlining the facts which substantiate his claim that he is the father, mother, or child who is not eligible for registration under The Family Allowances Act.\n\n10. If Income of Spouse in Excess of $250. A taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status if his (her) spouse will have an income of more than $750 during the calendar year. If the spouse will have an income of more than $250 but not more than $750, the exemption permitted for married status must be reduced by the amount by which the spouse's income will exceed $250 (e.g., if the spouse's income will be\u2014say\u2014$600, then $350 should be entered in Item (B) (2) (i.e., $600 less $250). If the spouse's own income for the calendar year will be not more than $250, Item (B) (2) will be left blank and the full marital exemption of $750 entered in Item (B) (3).\n\n11. \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" means a dwelling house, apartment or other similar place of residence, containing at least two bedrooms, in which residence amongst other things the taxpayer has his general rule of sleep and has his meals prepared and served. See Item 16.\n\n12. Change in Status or Dependents. If during the year any change occurs in the status or dependents of an employee, the employee must complete and file with his employer an amended Form T.D.1.\n\n13. Effect of Failure to File Form T.D.1. In cases where Form T.D.1 (Revised for Jan. 1947) is not completed and filed with the employer, deductions from all claims made on or after January 1st, 1947 must be made as if the employee were a single person without dependents even though the employee may have filed a previous Form T.D.1. Single persons without dependents need not file this form.\n\n14. Filing of Income Tax Return. In addition to filing this form you must file your Income Tax Return Form T.I. Special or T.I. General for the calendar year on or before 30th April following the following year.\n\n15. If Form T.D.1 Not Filed by Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.1 (Revised for Jan. 1947) must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents and therefore as per column 1 in the Table of Income Tax Deductions (1947).\n\n16. Employer to Scrutinize Claims by Single Persons for Married Status. The definition of a \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" contained in Item 11 must be clearly stated if a taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status by reason of supporting a dependent therein unless the dependent actually resides with the taxpayer. Therefore, employers are directed to scrutinize the addresses under Item (E) (a) or (d), with the taxpayer's own address in Item 2 (which should show where he is actually living at the time of making the declaration) to see whether there is any indication that the same the employer must make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n17. Employer's Responsibility Regarding Form T.D.1. The employer will have regard to the instructions contained in Item 16 above, will check the employee's computation of the total exemptions in Item 6 and will otherwise make certain that the form is fully completed. He will also delete as a dependent under Item 5 the name of any person whom the employee has already listed in Item 4 unless the claim for married status is within paragraph (B) (ii). If the employer has reason to believe that any of the information on this form is incorrect or false, he will not act upon the declaration until the employee has made the necessary corrections thereto. In case of doubt, the matter should be referred to the District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n18. Action upon Receipt of Amended Form T.D.1 during Currency of Year. Employees are required to file an amended Form T.D.1 if any change occurs in status or dependents. The employer should give immediate effect to a change from \"Single\" status to \"Married\" status and to an increase in the number of dependents. A change from \"Married\" status to \"Single\" status (e.g., where an employee becomes a divorc\u00e9) should not be made effective until the first pay period in the next calendar year because the employee will still be entitled to claim \"Married\" status for the whole of the calendar year in which the change took place. Similarly, a decrease in the number of dependents should not generally require a change in the deductions until the following calendar year with one important exception, namely, to avoid providing that a taxpayer may not claim as a dependent any person who has an income in excess of $400 during the calendar year. If, for example, a son who was previously supported as a dependent and has continued as a dependent on Form T.D.1 takes up employment from which he will earn over $400 during the calendar year, immediate effect should be given to the amended form T.D.1 so that the employer will be left with a substantial balance of tax to pay with his return on Form T.I Special or T.I General.\n\n19. Further Information or Forms with respect to deduction of tax may be obtained from any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n20.

The pupils show little respect for the teacher and this has reduced considerably whatever progress the pupils might have made during the five months this teacher has been in charge. These problems in discipline arise from the failure of the teacher to supply the pupils with sufficient work to keep their time fully occupied, from her personality which fails to command the respect of the pupils, and from her unsuitable methods of punishment.\n\n\"There is a considerable lack of books, particularly reading material. This is due to the same reasons that are to be found in the other class of this school; poor mail service, non-receipt of the first copy of the Bulletin, and the fact that this teacher did not take over this class until January of this year.\n\n\"The reading of most of the pupils is poor and many of them are attempting material which is too difficult for them. A more varied and more extensive language programme is greatly needed in this school. This teacher lacks initiative in developing the language work.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Mrs. Robert Morris who is teaching in the other room on a five day per week basis is doing a satisfactory job and Inspector Davey is pleased with her efforts.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On thinking it over I am greatly worried and hope you will not mind me explaining my position more fully.\n\nI came on to Kootenay as soon as possible after receiving the appointment. The journey was quite an expense ($140), but with the understanding that my salary was to be $578. I borrowed the amount from a friend hoping to refund it within the year. Then I thought it best to send something home to my mother, as things are very slack because of the war. But should I loose this quarter, I shall have very little when my board is paid.\n\nPlease forgive me if I am wrong in expecting it, but it seems hard to lose all for the absence of fourteen school days, when the delay was unavoidable.\n\nThanking you for kindly attention already shown,\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nGertrude Martin\nProvince of British Columbia,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED September 30, 1914.\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Miss Gertrude Martin | Kispiox Indian Day School | $500.00 | $16.20 |\n\nNo. of School days present: 66,\nNo. days absent: 7,\nNo. holidays: 59,\nGrant asked for: $16.20\n\nRemarks:\nRegarding the foregoing, I beg to state that the above school did not open till the 22nd of September of this quarter through the inability of the teacher (Miss Gertrude Martin) sooner to get to her post, which was vacated by Mrs. A.L.

It is my opinion that Miss Earl would make a good field matron or social worker on an Indian reserve; but her qualifications for the classroom exercises are such, that I would urge you to transfer her to other work at the first opportunity. The Kispiox School is a fairly important activity, with a good enrolment, and I consider a strong teacher should be named for the post. The Department approves of the temporary appointment of Miss Earl, at a salary of $90 per teaching month - her duties to commence on September first, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Since its commencement you know how the children and young people have made good progress in studies, and yet the work has not been nearly as efficient as it ought to have been through lack of a proper school house. We therefore ask the Indian Department through you to give us a grant toward in erecting a suitable building. Kispiox is the largest Village on the Skeena and is more deserving of help than some other smaller places where a grant for a School building has been obtained. The size of the building should be 26 x 15 and the sum of $500 would cover expenses. During the past two years I have paid out of my own pocket the sum of $100 as rent for the schoolhouse.

There are no funds available wherewith to make the grant of $500.00 asked for to erect a school building. On the 2nd ultimo, Mr Superintendent Vowell forwarded vouchers for rent of a school building from the 1st October last at the rate of $18.00 per annum. Mr Vowell had no authority for submitting these vouchers for payment.\n\nI may add that the Department makes a yearly grant to a large number of day schools in British Columbia (the grant in almost every case being $300.00 per annum) but day schools buildings have not been erected by the Department. The church authorities under whose auspices the different schools are conducted have in each case provided the necessary school building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\n\n5th January, 1903.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th ultimo, with enclosures, I beg to inform you that the Department can not accede to the request of the Revd W.H.

All that the Department can do is to continue the grant hitherto paid of $300.00 per annum for the payment of the salary of a teacher.\n\nAnd in this connection I may say that the church authorities under whose auspices the different school buildings are conducted have in the past each case provided the necessary Day School building.\n\nI observe that you forwarded with your letter of the 22nd ultimo, No 44 D /4 vouchers Nos 576 and 579, for rental of a building in which to conduct the above mentioned school.

The dimensions of the proposed board are not given, but it must be small to admit of being removed from place to place in the school-room, and it is considered that it would be more advisable to have a larger and stationary board.\n\nThese remarks apply to the case of the request for a similar outfit for the Kitseguala school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I have strong hopes that both these petitions will recommend these grants to your favorable consideration and that to this my application I shall soon receive a favorable reply.\n\nThe need at both points is great; especially at Kislapax, the village is large, and the church has taught for years at this point, the Govt. has allowed the rent but made allowances for a school building. For some time the missionary paid the rent of a house for school purposes himself and later the church has done so. Similarly although the house at Kittegwa is not so large as at Kislapax the missionary has been teaching children in a house hired by the church.\n\nWe earnestly desire to give to these villages the best educational facilities possible and so we hope that both these applications will meet with your approval.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nR.

Our people are clearing more land and starting gardening, but no one to teach them how to work the ground, the land is very good in this Reserve. Two years ago, I try to teach one family how to milk cows and one morning I went over to see what they are doing. To my great surprise to see the nice cream all over the wood pile, they have taken it off and they thought it is a dirty stuff just because they did not know any better. Will you kindly use your influence with the Department to get a suitable man to teach these people how to farm and school them how to garden.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nW.H. Pierr\nSir,\n\nI wrote you two years ago respecting the propriety of the use of God in this mission, and also for great need of a good school house. I embrace another opportunity of addressing you a few lines this year also. Last year at your request through Mr. Loring the Indian Agent a plan for school house was made and sent on to you. We have been waiting to hear from the Department ever since our need for a good school house is urgent. School attendance is now better than it has ever been, but the teaching is done under difficulties. We are cramped for room. In fact if all the children come to school who ought to, we could not accommodate them. We teach school in the best Indian house that I can secure, but we have to move from one house to another very often. The visit of Rev. A. B. Green School Inspector this spring made a deep impression upon all the inhabitants in this Village. All the chiefs and people have written to him, also to Mr. Loring Indian Agent, telling the of the urgent need of a Boarding School for Kiskissix Reserve.\n\nTwo weeks half of our people moving down to the coast to work to the Salmon Canneries, they took their children away over twenty of them all school age, they will be away all summer. It is no wonder that they are crying for a Boarding School so that their children should stay all year round & learn like white.

(RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI had the honour & pleasure of meeting you on board the \"Princess Beatrice\" in August last. Since that time I have had it on my mind to write you a few facts regarding these Kiskissick Indians. They are a hard working & industrious people very anxious to improve and learn anything that will help them in living a civilized life. I have been their missionary here for ten years and know what I speak. During these ten years we have carried on a day school and have received a grant from the government each year. But this school has been carried on under great difficulties. We have had no school house and have had to rent an Indian house from time to time changing about. For this I have had to pay rent out of my own pocket. The children have attended well & studied hard, but you can readily see that it is impossible to make any progress that should be made if taught under present conditions. There are somewhere about sixty children.\nof school age. All of these have not attended owing to their heathen life & potlatch. Since the attendance has been good - the highest average for any quarter being 29-45. Now the potlatch has died a natural death & we expect no more trouble from that source. In fact the heathen are anxious that their children should learn.\n\nA few years ago we asked the government for a grant towards building a school house & they refused. Later I asked the government through Mr. Soring, Indian agent to pay school rent & refund what I had already paid out. That too was refused. Just one year ago asked, grant for a school house was again asked. So far no word has been received either for or against while the government has been so liberal in building school house for other tribes we have been left without all these years, and our people are beginning to feel it keenly. My purpose in writing these to you Sir, is to let you know just exactly how we stand. Wishing you every success in your important & responsible position.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour Respectfully,\n\nW.H. [signature]\nOttawa, April 7, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIn compliance with your directions that I should look carefully into the correspondence relating to the Kishpian school to see what can or ought to be done there, I beg to say that, from Mr. Inspector Green's last report on this school, which was made on May 6, 1907, it would appear that a new building is urgently needed. The Indians are anxious to have a boarding school and are willing to give a site on the reserve and all the assistance they can to make a success of it. There are said to be 50 children of school age and Mr. Green gives it as his opinion that a boarding school at this large village would be very beneficial.\n\nThe day school at this point has been in operation for a number of years under the auspices of the Methodist Church and is in receipt of the usual salary grant of $300. It has been carried on under difficulties, owing to their never having been provided with a school building, and it was to obtain a grant for this purpose that the Rev. Mr. Pearce, the resident Missionary, applied to the Department two years ago, when he was told that, until the report which Mr. Agent Loring had been\nasked to furnish was received, no action could be taken by the Department. After that Mr. Losing sent in a plan of a proposed building with a specification of the material required, which showed that it would cost about $600 to complete a building suitable for the purpose.\n\nA note was made for this year's estimates but, as there has been no additional provision made for British Columbia.\n\nThey have an enrolment at this school of 53, with an attendance for December quarter, last, of 31.\n\nIt seems to me that the school is entitled to encouragement and that a building should be provided, if possible, and that there is no necessity for a boarding school at that point, and Mr. Inspector Conroy, who travelled through this part of British Columbia last fall, agreed with me in this.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMemoandum for Mr. Benson\n\nThese letters from Dr. Pierce may be filed. Mr. Pedley would like you to look carefully into them to see what can or ought to be done re this school.\n\nH.O.D.\n\nOttawa, 135205\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to take the liberty of replying to your letter of July 5th received in due time and in which you state that my application for a school building for Kispiox will be considered this present year. I thought that it would not be out of place to write a few more words to you regarding that important matter. If you examine our School Report ending December 1907 you will see how urgent our need is. And during this present quarter the total number of names of school age numbers 65. They all attend regularly, and are pushing ahead, but their progress is greatly hampered through lack of proper facilities. The Attache has now come to an end in this Village. All the leading heathen Chiefs & their families who have long been left behind have this winter forsaken their heathen rites & become Christians. The attendance at school will continue to increase. We have been fortunate too in securing the services of a good certificated teacher. She says that white pupils could not take greater interest in their studies.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-5, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, July 14, 1906.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nWith reference to the letter from Rev. Mr. Pierce, addressed to the Minister, on the subject of the Indian school at Kispiox, B.C., I beg to say that two years ago Mr. Pierce asked to be allowed to incur an expenditure of $30 for six months' rental for a building in which to carry on the school. In reply to this application the Indian Superintendent at Victoria was informed that it should have come through the proper channel (The Superintendent of Methodist Missions in British Columbia), it being an exceptional case, as the Department was not in the habit of paying rent for schools or putting up shacks buildings for day schools conducted by religious denominations in British Columbia.\n\nNothing more was heard from Mr. Pierce on this subject nor was any application made by the Superintendent of Methodist Missions, but Mr. School Inspector Green in his report on this school stated that a school-house was urgently needed, as there was none at Kispiox, the school being held in an Indian house rented by the teacher at his own expense. On receipt of this report the Superintendent was asked to make enquiries into this and other matters referred to by the Inspector, and on June 8, last, the Superintendent wrote the Department stating that the matter of the school building required for the Kispiox Indians will be brought to the attention of Mr. Agent Letting, so that he may report fully thereon for the Department's information. There has been no time to receive a reply from Mr. Letting, and the matter is still in abeyance.\n\nMartin Benson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10. Volume 6396.

We carry on our School work under great difficulties and it is impossible for the pupils to make any great progress. There are about Seventy children of school age in the Village. The attendance is good and all are anxious to learn. We have now secured a good teacher, but the inconvenience she will have to put with is so great that I am afraid she may not care to stay long. Twice before the people have asked the Department and estimates were sent in, the promise from Ottawa was that it would be considered. Nothing more has been heard. The people are much disappointed.
