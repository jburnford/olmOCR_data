This last spring the water came in the cellar, about three inches, as long as frost been in ground, moistening the fire wood, furnace, and every articles in this cellar.\n\nAfter having examined all around I came to the conclusion that the drainage is obstructed somewhere around the school. So I want to ask the permission of the Department to excavate few places to find out the trouble and to clean the drainage.\n\nTo do this work I want to ask the permission to pay small wages to the Indians making this work. This payment will give me the chance to have good men and good work, otherwise I cannot control the work of men working only for relief.\n\nUnknowing how many days be necessary for these repairs I cannot give you the evaluation of money needed, but I can guarantee to the Department that a great discretion will be observed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nAugust 31, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, advising the Department of the repairs required to a drain at the Indian School at Restigouche, and in reply to advise that you may expend an amount not exceeding $50.00 to put this drain in a serviceable condition, the work to be carried out by Indians under your supervision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Last year we only...\nreceived $35. But owing to the present financial crisis we would be fully satisfied should the Department furnish but $25 for the coming year.\n\nWe have also received $25 a month for the giving of lessons in culinary art and for the dinner of pupils going home from school. Last January that sum was reduced to $15.\n\nWould the Department be generous enough to furnish us with the amount just mentioned $25 beginning with the month of September as we have nothing on hand for the cooking lessons which should begin with the first month of the school year. That grant will also permit us to have a little provision of food.\nahead as potatoes, butter etc. for the pupils' dinner, which will be given only in November, as usual.\n\nGrateful witness of the never failing generosity of the Department towards our little Indians, I sincerely hope that my request will be taken in consideration. With my long experience, I can assure that the lessons of household science, and the relish of a good dinner are the chief means of attracting our little Micmacs to school.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer,\n\nI beg to remain\n\nD'Alt. Richard\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nKind Sir\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nG. M. of St. Joseph's Teacher.\nOttawa, September 5, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, and the Department has given very careful consideration to your requests. Owing to the decrease in our Appropriation, it is found that the best we can do is to authorize $15 a month from October first to March 31st for the teaching of domestic science and the supplying of midday lunch to the pupils at the Restigouche School. The sum of $26 can be allowed for the purchase of sewing material. The Indian Agent is being so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. St. Joseph,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche,\nQue.\nOttawa, September 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIt has been decided to allow the sum of $15 a month from October first, 1933, to March 31, 1934, for the teaching of domestic science and the supplying of a midday lunch at the Restigouche Indian Day School. You may also purchase sewing material to the value of $25 for use at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department that according to your letter No 26-15 of the 31st ultimo the repairs required to a drain at the Indian School at Restigouche have been performed, and the drain is in a serviceable condition.\n\nAfter having took the advice of the man who built this drain and the advice of some others I have started the work and found the right place at once where it was block. Having the good men very much in need of clothing this work was well made and it is of my opinion that this drain will stand for some while yet. But to prevent the floor of cellar from wet it would be necessary to take off all the cement floor and place drain pipes all around and in the center of cellar and build a new cement floor.\n\nPlease find enclosed the return of labour for this done, and for which work have been already paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6101, file 326-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDr. Richard,\nSt. Anne De Restigouche.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you, we examined the furnace in the school at St. Anne De Restigouche, and find same in very bad condition. The top section of firepot is cracked on both sides, and opened up about \u00bd inch.\n\nThis section, together with the mason and tinsmith work, and perhaps other parts we would find that needed to be renewed, would cost nearly the price of a new furnace.\n\nWe would therefore recommend a new furnace with a galvanized iron casing instead of brick, as it is less expensive to repair furnace at any time with the galvanized casing.\n\nAs you only asked for a price on repairing furnace, we are quoting you a price on temporary repair to furnace that would last the winter, and some new pipe that is needed, --a price of Fifteen Dollars\u2014$15.00.\n\nTrusting this is the information you require, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBradley & Walsh.\n\nPer...

You should advise the Department, also, if you could not arrange to have the work carried out by Indian labour, provided you were given authority to purchase any materials, such as shingles and nails that may be required.\n\nRegarding the request for a new furnace, the Department has no particulars as to the type, heating capacity and the cost of the furnace and installing same. Our funds this year are so limited that unless a new furnace is absolutely urgent we would not be prepared to authorize the expenditure required. When we have your estimate of the cost involved in the supplying and installing of a new furnace, further consideration will be given, and you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This man reported to me the shingles were all rotten all over the roof. This roof will take around 22 thousands of shingles, and with the nails, boards to cover the top of roof and for the scaffoldings, to take off the old shingles and the labour for the whole work will come for all the repair to amount of about $140.00.\n\nIt is very hard to give the right amount for such a repair, but the Department can be sure I will look well after the work and if some money can be save, I will do it.

In the second one are 29 pupils, whilst the room is of a size to contain 40. In the third-room where there is place for 32 pupils, we have 44, the seats and desks in this room, intended for children of 10 to 12 years old, are not adapted to the pupils mostly all of 5 to 6 years.\n\nStill more boys and girls from whom should come to school if there were sufficient space and some authority.\nto force them to do so rather than face\nthe day running short in advance\nand mischief.\n\nI pray you to inform the Honorable\nStaff of Indian Affairs of our situation\nand urge, if you please, your influence\nto obtain a special help to enlarge\nthe school rooms, or better still, to have\ntwo new rooms built, because the\nneeds are urgent.\n\nIn hopes of a favorable reply\nI beg to remain,\n\nKind Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nS.

P. Place\n\nMembre de la Mission\n\nRistigouche\nTranslation\n\nRestigouche, May 20th 1935\n\nReport of the requirements of the Indian Reserve at Restigouche, supplied by the missionary of the locality.\n\n1st - Our school is no longer sufficient to contain the pupils of school age. It will be necessary to have two new class rooms in the fall. It may be possible to rent two classes in the white school adjoining the sisters' convent next autumn.\n\n2nd - On such a large reserve as Restigouche, in proximity of Campbellton, on account of the easy access by water and land to the reserve, especially during this time of unemployment and forced inactivity, it is urgent to have a strong local police force.\n\nThat police would be useful to watch the attendance at school and overcome the insubordination of the strong heads who are conspiring. For a year past, it is the charity of the missionary that prevented riots among certain hasty individuals who were drawn to extremes.\n\nI spent more than $100. To keep peace among your Indians. Among those who could fill the position of constable there are James Savigne, if he is not too old, and George Isaac, and Albert Martin.\n\n3rd - The Cemetery\n\nIt would be necessary to renew the fence posts for the wire fence and raise the upper part by buying earth instead of buying a new piece of ground.\n\nI hope gentlemen that you will consider these requests carefully and that you will give me a favorable reply soon.\nand that we will have a police officer,\ntwo new class rooms in the fall and\nthat the question of the cemetery will\nbe finally settled.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Placier\nMissionary\nRed River P.L.\nRestigouche, 21st May, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose one letter received this morning from the XXXXX Priest of the Restigouche Indian Reserve, Reverend Father Placide, complaining on few questions.\n\nI have written many times about all these questions, and I want to ask again to the Department to give authorisation to Mr Inspector to look over these matters when come on Restigouche this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 6, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, enclosing a communication from Rev. F. Placide, missionary on the Restigouche reserve, requesting that additional classroom accommodation be provided in connection with the present school.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of the 23rd ultimo, in reply to a similar request from the Rev. Sister Superior of the School, the Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to provide the cost in erecting an additional classroom or in renting accommodation in the white school adjoining the Sisters' Convent and there are no funds available to pay the salary of extra teachers. Our appropriation for the present fiscal year has been completely assigned, and it will therefore be impossible to provide funds for the above mentioned purpose.\n\nAs you have been informed, the need for extra classroom accommodation for the children of the Restigouche reserve will be kept in mind and an effort made to include the amount necessary for an addition to the present building and to provide the salary of extra teachers when our Estimates are being prepared for submission to Parliament for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nDuring my recent visit to the Restigouche agency the agent Dr. Richard requested me to make inquiry into the question of insufficient school accommodation.\n\nThe present school has accommodation for 35 children whereas there are 120 children of school age on the reserve. Many of the desks are of such small size as to cramp the older children into positions which is very detrimental to their health, especially as many of them are consumptive.\n\nA new building for the reception of no less than 60 older children is a prime necessity on this reserve, and I would recommend that provision be made in next year's estimates for the construction of a modern school house separate to but in the vicinity of the present school building.\n\nThe present building does not permit of it being enlarged, and the agent should be authorised to have the outside steps repaired, which are in a dangerous and dilapidated condition, and to see that the roof around one of the disused chimneys, which is in a leaky condition should also be re-shingled and the chimney removed.\nOttawa, June 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Bury, of this Department, who recently visited the Restigouche Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the need of providing more classroom accommodation.\n\nYou have been written regarding this matter - see official letter of the 6th instant. This need has been noted and will receive consideration when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nMr. Bury has drawn attention to the condition of the outside steps and he states that the roof around one of the disused chimneys leaks. I would request that you arrange to have the steps repaired and placed in good condition. You should also have the disused chimney removed and that part of the roof repaired. All expense in this connection should be kept as low as possible. When the work has been completed, to your satisfaction, an account, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred. Full particulars should be given on the account, regarding the time employed and the rate paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. A.

The said convent having undergone severe deterioration, very costly improvements are required, the charges of which neither the Reverend Fathers nor the Sisters can afford to assume. Consequently, I deem the Department will kindly do its utmost to be of some help to us in the present occurrence and I very respectfully beg that in the sketches defining the new buildings, rooms be put aside for the teachers' and nurses' accommodations.\n\nI trust the Department will kindly take this request in efficient consideration and comply with it as best it can.\n\nIn this hope and thanking you sincerely for past favors I remain respectfully and gratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Placide, the Parish Priest; and the Sister Superior of the School.\n\nThe school building and a separate residence, attached by a covered passage, are located on property owned by the Capucins. There are three small classrooms in the school building - two on the ground floor and one on the floor above, at the rear of the building. There is also a room fitted up with a stove, for domestic science purposes. The classrooms are small and inadequate to provide accommodation for the Indian children of school age on the reserve. The residence of the Sisters is in very poor condition. The drainage from the basement of both the school and the residence is inadequate. Owing to the nature of the ground, water is continually seeping in. These are both frame buildings and, while not the property of the Department, yet considerable expense has been incurred from time to time, in repairs. It will be necessary in the very near future to carry out extensive repairs and alterations in both buildings, or they should be demolished and a new combined school and teacher's residence erected containing two classrooms, each for 36 children, and living accommodation for three or four Sisters, with a room for a chapel. This would meet the needs for this part of the reserve. The lot on which these buildings are erected comprises a small area. There is very little space for playgrounds.\n\nThis brings up the matter of providing adequate school accommodation for the children of this large reserve. There are approximately 140 to 150 children of school age, nearly half of whom live at too great a distance to attend the present school. These children could be better served by the erection of a school, with two classrooms and living accommodation for two teachers, at a central locality on the west end of the reserve.\n\nFunds are provided under the Special Building Programme this year to erect a two-roomed school with teacher's living quarters. I would suggest that, if the work is proceeded with, this building be erected on a site central to meet the needs of the Indian children at the west end of the reserve. No site has been selected, but this could be, no doubt, arranged by the local Agent. There would likely be objection, on the part of the church authorities, to having a school erected on the west end of the reserve, as it would be a considerable distance from the present church property. If this school is erected, I would suggest that lay teachers be employed. I was not favourably impressed with the teaching Order who are conducting the three classrooms in the present school building, near the church.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOttawa, August 27, 1936\n\nSHIP TO: DR.

Sister Mary of St. Leo,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche, Que.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Miller.\n\nRE: INSPECTION OF DAY SCHOOLS AT RESTIGOUCHE AND CAUGHNAWAGA, QUEBEC.\n\nThe present Day School at Restigouche, Que., consists of two buildings both being two storey frame construction.\n\nThe school building has three classrooms, a kitchen and a small general purpose room. The three classrooms are very small and inadequate for the number of students enrolled. The kitchen room has been used for both the preparation and serving of meals and is entirely too small for such use. The sewing room is satisfactory only for small classes. This building is in fair condition and can be used in connection with any new buildings with a few minor repairs to the roof and ceilings.\n\nThe second building, used as a residence for the teachers, is in a very dilapidated condition and would be best removed.\n\nIn connection with these two buildings is a very dilapidated frame building which is used as a school for the French children in the village.\n\nThe removal of these last two buildings would provide a suitable site for a new classroom unit, large enough to accommodate 105 to 120 students.\n\nIf a new school unit comprising three classrooms, a partial basement for the heating system and fuel storage, and additional rooms in the rear for vocational classes is erected then the present school building could be used for a teachers' residence and for the kitchen and dining room for teachers and students.\n\nIn consideration of the condition of the buildings and the requirements for the day school it would be advisable to remove the existing French School and the teachers' residence buildings, erect a new three classroom school on the site of the removed buildings and remodel the existing school house to provide a residence for the teachers and kitchen and dining facilities for the teachers and students.\n\nThe United Church Day School at Caughnawaga, Que., at present is comprised of a one room school building. In providing an addition to this school of one classroom and living quarters for two teachers two courses are possible. 1st. A direct addition to the northern end of the existing building and 2nd. a separate building in the rear of the present building.\nThe Welfare and Training Division are considering the site situation at this school and will advise as to which course should be followed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey, Supt, of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Hoey,\n\nMr Phelan and the architect have been most welcomed here last week. We regret though, they could not stay with us any longer, for many questions about the new building are not definitely settled.\n\nI respectfully beg to be allowed a few questions and suggestions.... After many deliberations about the lodging of the sisters, it was decided that the old Indian Day School should be our residence. Will the Department have the repairs of same done at the same time the new school be built? The roof, the foundation, and a few windows require particular attention. Inside, we expect that the partitions be modified so as to facilitate the observances.\n\nAs the actual Indian School cannot supply us with bed-rooms, I shall respectfully ask that provisions be made on the new plan to provide the attic with seven bed-rooms for the sisters affected to the service of the Indians:\n\n1o- The Principal and teacher of Domestic Science\n2o- Four teachers\n3o- One lay sister, cook for the sisters\n4o- One lay sister, cook for the Indian children.\nI would suggest also that an office or room for the Principal, nearby the school rooms would be very advantageous.\n\nAs Mr Phelan suggested that we should adopt the rotative system in our new school, we shall be pleased to comply with his wishes; but let us together foresee the means to facilitate the rotation. So, would it be possible to have sliding or swinging doors between two classes, so as to transmute them into a main room when necessary?\n\nWhat would you think of the idea of giving up serving mid-day meal with the first of June and allow us to get material from Atlantic Trading Co., for the approximate amount spent monthly for food, to begin modifying two of the upper rooms. Then we can move a part of our furniture therein and have our residence torn down, so that the ground be ready when you begin building the new school.\n\nYou would appreciate, I am sure, knowing that if you allow us a certain amount to be spent, let us say $400.00, for the inside repairs and modifications, we shall save money for you; because we often obtain favors as to the price of material or workmanship owing to our well-known poverty; whilst when people know that it is to be paid by the Government they charge full cost.\n\nPardon me for keeping you so long reading my requests. In the meantime, I am fully confident that you will approve them as they are but fair, and in accordance with the promises made by different officials sent here those last years.\n\nWith sentiments of esteem and sincerest best wishes\n\nI remain,\n\nVery gratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of St Leo, Principal.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of today's date to Rev. Sister M. of St. Leo, Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nOne paragraph of her letter reads, as follows:\n\n\"What would you think of the idea of giving up serving midday meal on the first of June and allow us to get material from Atlantic Trading Co. for the approximate amount spent monthly for food, to begin modifying two of the upper rooms? Then we can move part of our furniture therein and have our residence torn down, so that the ground be ready when you begin building the new school.\"\n\nUnder separate cover, you are being written with reference to the midday meal. The Department infers from the above-mentioned paragraph in the Reverend Sister's letter that an expenditure not exceeding $150.00 would permit certain alterations to be made in the upstairs of the present school building which would enable the Reverend Sisters to reside there and thus vacate their present residence, which is to be torn down. If these alterations can be made for an amount not exceeding $150.00, the Department approves such action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc. 1.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P. Q.\nDear Madam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Departmental Architect is now preparing plans for the building at Restigouche and I can assure you that we will give you as much accommodation as the funds at our disposal will permit. As Mr. Phelan informed you, there is only a certain amount of money available and the size of the building will depend on what we can secure for this sum.\n\nWhen erecting the new building, repairs will be made to the present building which it is intended to use as a residence.\n\nWhen we are ready to proceed with the work, you will be further advised.\n\nIndian Agent Richard is being informed that the serving of the midday meal should be discontinued on May 31st and that milk only may be served to the children during the month of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This money was available early in the season and the understanding was that the work would be undertaken at once. The local Indian residents, working under the direction of Father Placide, demolished the old residence formerly occupied by the members of the teaching staff, cleared a certain amount of land and left the site ready for the construction of the new building. This work was undertaken and accomplished without cost to the Department.\n\nMay I point out that there are approximately 130 pupils at Restigouche, all of whom should be in attendance at school on September first. You can readily appreciate that the absence from school of a group of boys and girls as large as this will cause a great deal of dissatisfaction locally and is apt to contribute to waywardness on the part of the pupils, themselves. I am not in a position to state just why the Department has not proceeded with the construction of this building.

Art Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nDear Doctor,\n\nI arrived at Campbellton this A.M. and proceeded to the Reserve accompanied by Constable Murphy, R.C.M.P., where we met Dr. Richard, (Indian Agent). Excavating for the new school has started today, and I found Mr. Ross, of the Engineering Dept., in charge. The work is being done by Indians, who receive 25\u00a2 per hour and are pleased to be employed.\n\nMr. Ross states that he is faced with difficulty because the plan provides for a cellar ten feet deep, of which seven or eight feet must be below the surface of the ground, whereas rock is met at four feet or a little less below the surface. Furthermore, the drain is on the surface of the rock for the cellar. He will write his superiors about this matter and submit his report to them, as to how the problem might be solved. He desired however to let us know the situation, so that we would understand the possibility of changes, to fit the building to the site.\n\nMr. Ross is negotiating for a white carpenter foreman; it is understood that no qualified Indian is available.\n\nI visited the Principal and teacher's residence at the request of Sister Mary of Ste. Leo. There I met in addition to the principal and her assistant two sisters from Rimouski, who had come to enquire about the School, representing the Provincial Head of the order. The plans provided for three class rooms instead of four. They understood from Mr. Maclean when he visited in May that four would be provided. They pointed out that the three rooms are designed to accommodate 100 pupils whereas there are actually 130, exclusive of the number of young children coming up. They suggested that the necessary additional class room be substituted for the boys' work room as shown on the plan, as the class room is the more essential. They urgently request that the stair plan be changed so that the pupils may enter the room directly for class purposes, instead of through the sewing room, as they would do if the present plans which have been in mind were a work shop are carried out.\n\nThey also state that further repairs are needed in the old building before it can be used as a residence, as there is water in the basement. This is additional to repairs authorized in Mr. Hoey's letter of May 21st last, which were for the upstairs.\n\nThey also ask for the connecting passage between the residence and the school, such as was formerly provided.\n\nTo the best of my observation and judgment, their requests are reasonable and well founded, particularly regarding the additional class room, this would regard immediate attention at Ottawa, as it is understood that the purchasing agent is proceeding with the purchase of the materials, which may have to be varied. I have been desired to bring all these matters to your attention forthwith, for consideration by yourself and the various officials concerned in our own and Engineering Branch.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nSgd.

MacInnes\n\nIndian Affairs (RC 10, Volume 6101, File 326-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, October 23, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter dated the 20th of October from Mr. T.R.L. MacInnes, Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, with reference to his recent visit to the Restigouche Indian Day School. Apparently the Sister Superior requested some changes in the plans prepared for the new school.\n\nThe plans provide for three classrooms, sewing room and workshop. If any changes were made in the plans at the present time it would probably delay construction to such an extent that nothing could be done this fall. The building will be constructed in such a way that an addition can be added at any time and, in the meantime, if a fourth class room is absolutely necessary, the room intended for a workshop can be used as a class room. However, the Department considers that by rotating classes there is no reason why three class rooms should not be sufficient; in addition, sewing room and workshop were provided in order that adequate facilities would be available for giving to the pupils practical instruction that should be useful to them in their future life.\n\nWith the above in mind, the Department is not prepared to make any changes in the present plans and it is hoped that construction of the building will proceed as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the latter part of his letter, Mr. MacInnes refers to some further repairs required to the building now used as a teacher's residence. In this regard I might mention that you have already submitted an account for $100.00 for repairs and official letter of September 20th authorized a further (expenditure of $140.00)\nexpenditure of $140.00. I presume that this expenditure of $240.00 will be sufficient to place the building in good condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. D.

Little by little our residence is being made inhabitable. One more class-room remains to be divided for a parlor and an office for the Principal.\n\nRelying upon what you have allowed us to spend so far we shall expect a last permission that of spending $127.00 to finish these rooms for Christmas. We had planned to have same finished when the new school is being built, but Mr. Ross says he has not received any instructions regard-\n\nIndian Affairs.

You readily fancy all the inconveniences of going out three times a day by all kinds of weather.\n\nNow be patient dear Mr. Grey, and suffer another accident. The underground main pipe having been found defective Mr. Ross decided with the builder to have it replaced. The enclosed invoice shows the articles bought by an Indian, and sent to Campbellton, for the said repairs. I presume you do not expect that we pay for same, as these pipes feed the school as well as our residence and two Indian houses.

The children are running in the road since the end of last June. This reopening of classes will be a great thing for those young pupils.\n\nNow I would like to know if it would be possible for the Department to do something again this year as last year for food at school. This extra meal given last year gave so good results regarding the health of them assisting regularly, that I will be very pleased if food could be given again this winter.\n\nAs the new school building is not arranged to make any cooking, either having no other building around to install a stove and cook the food, I would suggest, and it is the opinion of the Principal of the school, that a cold meal could be served to the children. Cod Liver Oil and milk with bead and butter, peanut butter, preserves, or anything else ordered by Department.\n\nThis our suggestion but I will be very glad to receive from the Department the orders for what you believe is the best, if anything can be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Roy,\nDept. of Welfare and Training\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Roy,\n\nAfter a careful examination of our Indian Day School equipment we find that every one of the pupils' desks needs repair before being placed in the new classrooms. Will you please authorize Dr. Richard to hire a man to make the required repairs together with a little scraping and varnishing the table tops and seats, for it would be very unbecoming to have so many impaired desks in our beautiful new school.\n\nIn the meantime, respectfully bring to your knowledge that the following are required:\n\n1 desk and 1 chair for teacher, in woodwork room\n20 new desks for pupils, Senior Class.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our girls are always interested in different kinds of \"hand made\".\n\nNow what about our boys having a beautiful work room? Shall we buy tools and lumber, or will the Department lend us all that is required to keep 16 boys (alternating) working an average of 3\u00bd hours per day?\n\nI shall expect your answer before taking any further steps being confident that everything will come in time thus assuring the regular functioning of our school and if possible making up for time lost.\n\nWith sentiments of religious esteem,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nMiss Mary J. Lee\nPrincipal\nRestigouche, January 14th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to ask the Department if it would not be prudent before the school starts next month, to give a coat of floor wax on the floors to protect the wood and the fresh varnish over it.\n\nIt is of my opinion that in waxing the floors it will be a good protection and will keep the surface of same in better and longer condition. One can of five pounds floor wax be enough for good work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, January 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, you may purchase five pounds of floor wax and have the new floors at the Restigouche Indian Day School waxed.\n\nI am also in receipt of a letter from the Sister Superior regarding repairs required to the desks. You may have the desks scraped and varnished. It is understood, of course, that no unnecessary expense will be incurred.\n\nYou may also authorize the Principal to purchase sewing material for an amount not exceeding $25.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that decision regarding the employment of an additional teacher will not be made until the end of June, the Department does not see any necessity for purchasing new desks, tools, or lumber, at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Art Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nRestigouche, January 20th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of your letter No 26-1-5 of the 17th instant regarding a mid-day meal at the Restigouche Indian Day School. It was specified that the cost each month must not exceed the amount allowed last year for the same purpose, but there is one thing I forgot, and I am sorry to bother you again for this question, it is the labour, the remuneration of this labour as last year, to prepare and serve the meal, to clean all the dishes, disinfect them.\n\nLast year a Sister was paid $15.00 and an Indian girl at $6.00, both of them per month.\n\nHaving no special local as last year I believe it will be, even if it is cold lunch, some work to prepare this, and look after all those provisions. But it is of my opinion that the cost of the whole thing will be less than last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. Placide, in the presence of the Chief and Councillors, few members of the Band and Indian Agent.\n\nAll the pupils were at their place the school having started this morning. 114 pupils were present and I believe this number will increase every day.\n\nIt was very nice to see those new class rooms so clean everywhere, our seats were looking very well also. In the class room for the young, they were fifty four, about three on every seat. I hope the classes will continue in good order till the end of this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, paint was left in storage at the site for two coats for the exterior of the building, including the roof.\n\nThe outside concrete steps leading to the basement were damaged by frost during a severe cold spell and will need to be replaced. The estimated cost of these two small items of work is as follows:\n\nLabour for painting .....$150.\nReplacement of steps ..... 25.\n\nIt is suggested that your Indian Agent should undertake this work early in the Spring.\n\nOur Engineer on this work recommends that the following extras be supplied for the School and which were not provided for in the specifications:\n\n3 storm doors for the first floor classrooms.\n2 sets of steps to the terrace around the building.\nA platform at each of the four outside doors.\nThe cost of these extra items is estimated at $75.00, making a total of $250.00 for painting, steps and extras. This amount together with that of $9,250 expended to date would give a total cost of $9,500 for the building.\n\nAs you are aware, calls for tenders on this building were issued and after a long delay, the only tender received amounted to $12,700. This tender, which covered the same plans and specifications under which the building was constructed by day labour, was not accepted and, while day labour work was largely undertaken under winter conditions, a substantial saving was effected.\n\nBy this memorandum a formal transfer of the completed building is being made to your Branch.\n\nAttached herewith for your files is a set of five photographs showing exterior and interior views of the completed building.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 22, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nRestigouche, April 5th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre lettre du 5 de ce mois je dois vous dire que ma surprise a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien grande d'apprendre le d\u00e9saveu des d\u00e9penses encourues pour le repas du midi donn\u00e9 aux enfants Indiens,\n\nJe dois dire sinc\u00e8rement que les Institutrices et moi avons agi sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de votre lettre du 17 Janvier, 1938, en nous basant que les d\u00e9penses ne d\u00e9passeraient pas celles de l'an dernier. Or l'an dernier les d\u00e9penses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames que celles de cette ann\u00e9e. Les groceries cette ann\u00e9e \u00e9tant plus ch\u00e8res nous en avons donn\u00e9 beaucoup moins que l'an dernier, mais le compte est aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 parce que le nombre de l'assistance en classe est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que l'an dernier. Il ya deux ans et plus nous n'avions que $20.00 par mois pour un petit repas aux enfants \u00e9loign\u00e9s, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s une dizaine, les autres ne venaient pas.\n\nApr\u00e8s avoir commis cette erreur de d\u00e9penses trop fortes en f\u00e9vrier j'aurais beaucoup mieux aim\u00e9 en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 averti imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 mon premier compte. Mais puisque le coup est fait et que le D\u00e9partement est assez bon de payer ces comptes, je dois vous avertir qu'en recevant votre lettre hier je suis all\u00e9 au magasin et ai fait fermer ce compte, alors dans une journ\u00e9e ou deux il n'y aura plus de repas. Le montant de $10.00 allou\u00e9 pour le mois d'avril \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pens\u00e9 quand votre lettre est arriv\u00e9e.\n\nLes comptes de lait et de groceries vous parviendront sous peu.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant I may say that I was greatly surprised to learn that the Department disapproved of the expense incurred for the meals given to the Indian children every noon.\n\nI must say that the teachers and myself acted in good faith according to our interpretation of your letter of January 17th, 1936, basing ourselves on the fact that expenses should not be higher than they were last year. Now, last year's expenditures are about the same as this year's. The price of groceries having gone up this year, we gave the children much less than last year but the account is no smaller due to the fact that there are more children attending school than there were last year. Two years ago and more, we had only $20.00 per month to give a very frugal meal to the children who live far from the school, there were about ten of them, and the others did not come.\n\nAfter having made the mistake of spending too much in February, I would have preferred being advised of the fact immediately after I sent in my first account, but since the thing is done and the Department was kind enough to pay these accounts, I beg to advise you that, upon receipt of your letter yesterday, I went to the store and closed this account so that in a day or two no more meals will be given. The amount of $10.00 allowed for the month of April had already been spent when your letter arrived.\n\nYou will receive shortly the accounts for milk and groceries.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) D. Arthur Richard\nMr. J.A. Henry\nSuperintendent\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Henry,\n\nWhen Mr. Red Shuttell visited here we talked over the necessity of having hatches and double doors for the new building. But, since then, the late snowstorm, the doctor and I have noticed many more serious inconveniences, particularly during the rainy seasons.\n\nTherefore, we respectfully submit to your benevolent consideration a petition of the closed gas and platform windows. We think it is the best thing to attend to the present. While pending the final decision, it would be very convenient and protect the whole building from being damaged. The ladies, having a covered place where they can put the wet oil tins, but the difference in cleaning the floors will be reduced, and the terrace will retain its proper appearance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On stormy and rainy days, the teachers standing therein will save the girl while overlooking the boys playing in the yard.\n\nBe sure dear Sir, that my sincerity and a willingness of heart with humble submission and great confidence resting upon your most kindness by which I remain\n\nVery gratefully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI recommend this above, because I believe it is very important.\n\nP. A. T. Richard\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated April 14 from Sister Mary of St. Leo with reference to placing porches and double doors on the new Restigouche School.\n\nWhile this would no doubt be a convenience at the same time I must point out that we have no funds specially provided in our current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements to this building.\n\nIn official letter of the 8th instant you were requested to let me have an estimate of the cost of the labour for painting the Restigouche School. When we have this work completed we will again consider the request of the Principal for porches, etc., but, as pointed out in the first paragraph of this letter, it is very doubtful if we can provide funds for the purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

By the Report of Mr Inspector J. Thibault some grass should be placed to cover this kind of clay ground. This have to be completed with more earth at some places for about six inches.\n\nIt is of my opinion the work labour can be done with the Indians, it is a kind of rough work which don't take specialist for to do it.

It would appear that some of the paint which was left must have been stolen as the report from the Agent indicates there is no paint suitable for outside work.\n\nDirector.\nRestigouche, April 22nd, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant regarding the fence at Indian School at the back of the grounds, I beg to inform the Department that there is practically no fence at all. Some old wires are down on ground, many old pickets broken and the others are no good. In summer time the cattles go in the school yard, cannot cultivate without to be destroyed and eaten by cattles. With good fence a good recreation yard, or garden to be made by children, this can be organized easy in making nice yard.\n\nThe fence in front of the old school have to be removed, the new school taking larger ground, from this fence going to back line, and fix the back line all together make about 400 ft, about 350 feet of new fence. To save expenses we can make this back fence with wood. I have figured that pickets and boards will cost about $40.00, and the labour to about $60.00 to 75.00. The labour, the time to make the fence depends on the time to fix up the pickets, if not too much rocks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant you may arrange for the fencing around the school lot at the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the material will not cost more than $40.00 and that the labour will not exceed $75.00. In forwarding vouchers one voucher should be forwarded for the material and the other for the labour. The Department desires it distinctly understood that the amounts mentioned above must not be exceeded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA.

The accounts which you forwarded in her favour for $21.00 have been submitted to Mr. Ross with a view to ascertaining whether or not they had been previously paid. If not the amount expended by the Sister will be refunded to her.\n\nThe Reverend Sister mentions that the platform and steps of the teachers' residence should be renewed and she estimates the cost at $31.09. You may incur an expenditure not exceeding this amount.\n\nPlease point out to the Reverend Sister that the Department has expended a very large amount of money at the Restigouche School within the past year. In addition we intend to arrange for the painting of the building.\n\nIt will not be possible to consider any further expenditures for repairs and improvements at the Restigouche School during the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

If we have to paint it white the building would not keep white very long with the dust and red earth around the building. A good painter can easily make a good colour like dark gray or brown and the trimmings in white. We have no painter among the Indians and I thought it would be better to have a painter to look after the work. I heard that last fall some prices were asked for this painting and were around $130.00--it might cost less or a little more.\"\n\nPossibly Mr. Ross, who supervised the construction of this building, would be in a position to advise us regarding the best course to take in arranging for this painting. Does Mr. Ross know any painter in the vicinity of the Restigouche School and who is on the approved list from whom a quotation could be obtained.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | ARTICLES                                      | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n|      | 40 feet 1200 ft. wood lumber                 |       |               |              | 1150  |\n|      | 10 feet 1100 ft. wood lumber                 |       |               |              | 1100  |\n|      | 30 pieces 10 ft. nails                      |       |               |              | 75    |\n|      | 100 lbs. nails                               |       |               |              | 100   |\n|      | 100 lbs. nails                               |       |               |              | 100   |\n|      |                                              |       |               |              | 3215  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. Hoey, Supt of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Hoey,\n\nShould you see the school yard you would not hesitate, I am sure, giving credit to our pupils' request. They have really shown good will to remove stones, pieces of wood and every \"left-overs\" after the building of the new school; but now, a man with horses is needed to make a suitable play-ground.\n\nAn appropriate play-ground would give us the advantage of supervising our pupils' amusements even during vacation; for, they will be invited to come and play ball in their yard. So, there will be less complaints about their mischiefs here and there.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSister Mary of St. Leo, Principal\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to include a petition from the Indian School pupils, and a letter of the Principal of the School asking for little of money to level the school yard behind the building, where is the larger ground for the pupils to play ball. I am just finishing the fence around this yard occupied before by old buildings.\n\nIn ploughing little this ground and with gravel there is a good place for ball ground. This part of land belongs to the school and is inside the fence behind the school.\n\nTen dollars is not much for this kind of work with a team but it is better than nothing and they can make a good part of the work. If it is possible to the Department to allow money for this yard I will be very glad for the school children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa. Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant you may expend an amount not exceeding $10.00 in levelling the yard behind the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.

So being across a little road going to few Indian houses I been in the obligation to take men and horses to cut and haul it away. The stump was so big and so heavy that I used dynamite to have it out the deep and large hole. In dynamiting a stone broke a large glass in the neighbour's door. After this the men fixed the fence and leveled the ground, the yard is clean and in good condition. There is still an other old tree about in the same condition, but if can stand the summer I expect to take it down next winter.\n\nI have done the best for less expenses and I expect the Department will approve the accounts included.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAtlantic Trading Company, Limited\nWHOLESALE AND RETAIL MERCHANTS\nMARCHANDS GROS ET DETAIL\n\nRESTIGOUCHE, QUE., Jan. 47 193\n\nSold to\n\nTERMS NET\n\nOverdue accounts subject to ten per cent. interest.\n\n| DATE | ARTICLES | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|------|----------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n|      |          |       |               |              |       |\n|      |          |       |               |              |       |\n|      |          |       |               |              |       |\n\nIndian Affairs.

The embankment around the building having been made last winter with blocks of frozen ground came down this spring over one foot by places after the thaw was done. Having no foundation, the building is on posts, the wind runs free under the floor of the three class-rooms making very cold for the teacher and the pupils.\n\nAlso at the three doors of the classes there are no boards or platform for the pupils to pass on before go in the school taking in all the mud around their shoes.\n\nI suppose Mr Inspector J. Thibault took this matter before you and have explained the situation.\n\nI cannot tell you exactly the cost of this work to level the embankment, to build platform and good stormy doors, but I believe this will be around $125.00. I promise to the Department to make this work as cheap as possible. If this cannot be done it is of my opinion that the Department will have to pay more for the Janitor to make fire all day and all night to prevent the frost in the toilet rooms and also to purchase double more firewood. Please send the invoice for labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nRestigouche, September 10th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to ask the Department if there is money available for the pupils at the school to give a lunch every day as years before.\n\nWe used to have an average of 40 pupils taking the lunch every day at the school from November to April; the children living too far from the school to go home on account of bad weather or very cold days. They bring a crust of bread and eat it with cold water. We cannot give good meal as before having no local to serve it and no kitchen to cook the meal.\n\nThe Sister Superior told me she can give the meal every day for 0.06 per day making $64.00 per month. If the Department desires to give milk every day and to every child this will take about 7 gallons of milk per day at 0.39 per gallon for the average assistance of 120 pupils on the list.\n\nI would be very pleased if the Department could do something for those young children coming to school. The food given in the past to them at the school has given so good result that I recommend again for this year that the Department make the best to help those children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6101, file 326-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReport re Restigouche Agency.\n\nThe outside painting of the school house is now completed and the work was well done.\n\nUpon my first inspection in March, 1938, of this Agency, I had suggested building porches and steps for each classroom entrance as well as for the main entrance, but so far nothing was done. The terrace around the building is in bad shape. The water from the roof all around the building falls on this terrace and has soaked in near the foundation. If the water remains under the building, it will surely cause damage to the floors if nothing is done to remedy this situation. The centre of the building only has cement foundation and cellar which is for the furnace. The rest of the building is on posts and single boarded all around with discolored against the boards, forming a terrace about three feet high and five to six feet wide. I could find no ventilation whatever going under the building and, therefore, the water going under the building should be prevented.\n\nA roofed verandah in front with a shorter one for entrance of pupils at the back of the building would help quite a bit in stopping the water gathering under the building. This verandah with steps to the bottom of the terrace could be useful for the pupils on rainy days and would help to keep the classroom cleaner as now the children are entering the school room directly from outside and mud and snow are carted in on their shoes. As for the other part of the terrace, it should be so changed as to let the water run away from the building.\n\nSix double desks for juniors, seven to eight years of age, are needed at once.\n\nI was sorry to hear that the mid-day lunch to children living far from school had been cancelled. The milk distribution should also be kept up.\n\nPhotographs will help to explain more clearly regarding the terrace and verandah suggested in above report. I shall take this matter up when I return.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRestigouche, September 20th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant regarding the lunch for the children of the Restigouche Indian Day School, I beg to inform the Department that the only thing we can do is a cold lunch as last year. An average of 40 pupils are taking the dinner at the school from November to April, when a regular meal is not allowed to all the children. 40 lunches per day 20 days of school make $64.00 per month. It will be better to start from October 15 to April 15.\n\nThere is no kitchen in the present Restigouche School. There are three class rooms on the first floor, and on the second floor is a sewing room and a woodwork room, not one of them is accommodated for the installation of kitchen stove to learn cookery to the Indian girls. The Teacher's cookery is in another building, is too small to have something cooked for children.\n\nWe have this year 140 children listed giving an average of 120 every day at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If anything remains to be done in respect to the cold lunch for them, this will be your authority to do it and to make any reasonable expenditure for this purpose, such as that stated in your letter of September 20. The Department will appreciate any suggestion you may have as to how this might be improved at any time through the winter.\n\nThere is not much that can be done immediately in the way of segregation of tuberculous Indians at your Agency and until the new sanatorium opens at Mont Joli, it is advisable that the children have as good food as the school organization can reasonably provide them with.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Why was it necessary to incur this expenditure? Peter Sewell is paid a salary of $125.00 as janitor of this school and it is considered that washing the class rooms should be a part of his duties.

Since this Janitor, Peter Sewell started his duty on the 15th of October he was working at the school every day and all along the days work on the repairs at the school, because many little things were neglected last winter. When we figure the time spent at the school for the Janitor we did not mark the washing of the class rooms, there are so many little jobs around the school and inside that the salary comes small. Peter Sewell is willing to look after the washing in future on the condition he don't pay for the one done in October by women.\n\nThis is the first time this work is refused for payment, last year the Department paid for the washing to women. Please pay this last one and we will try to manage in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant it has been decided to pay voucher No. 216 for $5.46.\n\nPrevious accounts of a similar nature that have been paid covered costs of cleaning incidental to the erection of the new building.

Teacher's chair.\n3. 20 pupils' desk-chairs, which could be removed more easily than desks.\n4. Blackboard, 20 ft. in length.\n5. Wood work Apprentice benches. A large wood work bench will also be needed for the centre of the class, but that one could be made here.\nAllow me, dear Sir, to state that I already asked the Department to have the Baby Class supplied with six pupils' desks No. 6, and, due to my own forgetfulness in mentioning that these desk and seats were double, we are yet short of six similar ones, in order to place forty pupils in that class. Just now, we are using a long rough bench borrowed from a neighbor. We could wait for them, till the Department sends the equipments for the Manual Training Class.\n\nIf you judge it wise, dear Mr. Roy, to modify any of my suggestions, I accept them in advance, as I know they will contribute to improve our situation, having years of experience in such organizations.\n\nRemain\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTruly yours,\n\nMrs. R. A. Roy\nDept. of Welfare & Training\nOttawa\n\nSister Mary of St. Leo\nPrincipal\nRestigouche, April 11th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find included letter from Teacher of Indian School for the disposition of the new class room to be opened this next September.\n\nI believe the Teacher knows better than myself what is necessary for this school class, and also your experience on this question is great enough to allow me the favour to depend on your own judgement on this question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD'Art.

It is a simple matter to make suitable work benches and in view of the fact that there are so many Indians on relief in your Agency it is felt that you should be able to arrange with some of those on relief to make suitable benches in return for the relief which they are receiving.

Hargrove, Asst. of Welfare & Training\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hargrove:\n\nAs the number of pupils staying for midday lunches increases daily, I make it my duty to respectfully ask the Department to kindly permit me to spend the same amount of $64.80 monthly to cover the expenses of midday meals served at the Estigouche Indian Day School. This amount would not be sufficient to answer to our needs during the coldest months, but I generally store up cases of canned goods during the early months, which we serve.\nonly when the number of pupils rises from 55 to 60. This foreseeing permits me to provide them a fairly good midday meal.\n\nAt present, I observe that most of the children remaining here for dinner, bring only bread and molasses. At first, I thought they wanted to draw my pity by bringing such a scanty quantity; but the fact that they persist in their small diet convinces me that necessity forces them to such short allowance.\n\nI am ever ready to approve your final decision,\n\nI remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist.\nRestigouche, September 14th, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to include a letter from Sister Mary of Eucharist requesting again for this new school year the permission for a lunch to pupils during the fall bad weather and winter cold weather. The amount of $64.20 was allowed last year and I believe we can do the same this new year with the same amount.\n\nIf any possibility I would be very pleased if this allowance is permitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSecond copy returned approved on same terms as last year.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Richard\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the request of the principal of the Restigouche Indian day school for a new oil stove in order to permit teaching of domestic science.\n\nDue to present conditions funds at our disposal are quite limited and consequently it is not possible to consider new expenditures. Besides the use of an oil stove in the Restigouche school would constitute a fire hazard.\n\nThe Department feels that the Reverend Sisters wish to co-operate with us and it is difficult to understand why the room used for sewing is considered too small. Possibly all the girls learning sewing cannot be accommodated in the room at the same time but there would appear to be no reason why the sewing class could not be taken in groups.\n\nThe teachers' residence is comparatively close to the school and it should be possible to have the girls go into the kitchen of this residence in groups and receive instruction in the culinary arts.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant if you consider a storm door absolutely necessary you may incur an expenditure of $8.50 in installing it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. A.

The first part was for the placing of ventilators in the class rooms at a total cost of $22.00. The second part was for the installation of new registers in the class rooms, and for which installation the price cost should not be excessive. The plumber could not give estimate of the cost on account of the price of registers.\n\nThe plumber has installed the furnace, pipes and registers according to the plans and the registers could not be closed, the heat was going in only one room, now with the registers with a door the heat is distributed where necessary according to the wind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa.

This year these materials being more costly, he would need \u00a325.00 more than last fall, to cover the expenses. Thus amounting to \u00a3120.00 instead of \u00a395.00 which Dr. Richard asked for in 1939.

It is noted that an amount of $320.00 would be required for a new roof. In preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year it was only found possible to include an amount of $100.00 for repairs and improvements at the Restigouche School during the current fiscal year. Due to existing conditions it is impossible for the Department to consider spending a larger sum. Consequently if you can repair the roof for $100.00 you may proceed with the necessary work but if this amount is insufficient the question of repairing the roof will have to stand over until next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This Janitor, Peter Sewell, took sick this spring and his son finished the month of May, and died two weeks ago. Anyhow a man of this kind is not the right person to make a good general cleaning of a house, specially a large building like this Indian school.\n\nWith those explanations I am returning the vouchers and the receipts hoping this will be approved. In saving 3 months of salary to the Janitor with the profit this cleaning bill can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir;-\n\nAt the re-opening of the school year, I regret to have, especially at such a critical period, to expose to the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs a defect in the floor, of the Restigouche Indian Day School which makes the teachers suffer from constant cold feet during the winter season.\n\nFor this reason, I humbly ask the Department if it would not be possible to have a platform made for the three teacher's desks on the first floor, of about 9 inches high. The said work has been examined by a carpenter of this Reserve and he claims to be able to furnish wood, nails, paint, and do the work for $45.00.\n\nThe Agent being absent he will not be able to sign my demand, although he is aware of the trouble in the floor and has approved verbally my suggestion.\n\nIf the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs judges my demand a reasonable one I would highly appreciate the care you deign take of the health of the teachers at your service.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch.,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 13, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Restigouche School in which he states that platforms are needed near the teachers' desks due to the fact that the floors are very cold in the winter season. She estimates the cost of material and labour at $45.00 and it is understood that the work will be done by Indians. You may incur the expenditure mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nBonaventure County, P.Q.\nOct. 1, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the number of pupils staying for midday lunches increases daily, I make it my duty to ask the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs, to kindly allow me to spend the same amount of $64.00 monthly to cover the expenses of midday meals served at the Restigouche Indian School, from the grave November month to the last of April, abstraction be made of January, as school will then be closed. This sum would not be sufficient to answer our needs during the coldest months, but I generally store up cases of \"canned goods\" in the early part of the season, which we serve only until the price of potatoes raise from 55 to 60 daily. This foreseeing permits me to provide them a fairly good midday meal.\n\nAt present I observed that most of the children remaining for dinner bring only bread and molasses. At first, I thought they wanted to draw my pity, by bringing such a scanty quantity, but the fact that they persist in their small diet, convinces me that necessity forces them to such short allowance.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6101, file 326-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nRestigouche, October 2nd, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Manager of Atlantic Trading Co Ltd complains here today that the voucher No 16 of the 23rd of April last is not paid yet, $40.65.\n\nHaving not received any correspondence concerning this voucher I believe the cheque is lost.\n\nWill you please give me some information concerning this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOctober 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn checking over the accounts of the Atlantic Trading Company, Restigouche, we note there is an account for the Indian School for April of $40.66.\n\nThis account shows that on April 15 there were two issues of biscuits and two of butter.

McGill\n\nRE: INDIAN AGENCY\n\nI beg to submit a report of an inspection of the above Agency, made during the last part of June.\n\nSCHOOL:\n\nOn June 19th, I visited the Indian Day School and found 150 children present, out of 174 registrations during the current school year. Children were neatly dressed and clean; the class rooms as well as other rooms were spotless.\n\nI took much interest in looking over the exhibit of pupils' work and handcraft, the result of long continuous work on the part of the sisters in charge; sewing, knitting, etc., done by the girls showed me the teaching of the sisters was not fruitless; amongst the collection I found baby-crib and cradle-shirts, pants, dresses and windbreakers, all cut and sewn by the girls; girls' winter coats made from the materials authorized by the Department were most useful and the best practical mean to teach the girls how to make up their own clothing later on; boys' shirts and pants, all made at the school, were to be seen on many of the boys present, and all this made up at a much lower cost than is could purchased ready-made.\n\nThe idea of supplying the materials to be made up by the pupils is most practical, providing we have such an interested person to supervise and direct the children, as Sister Mary of the Eucharist, actually in charge.\n\nThe boys have made many practical and useful articles, such as chairs and tables, plain, but solid; other fancy things were also made by the boys.\n\nThe pupils also took an interest in Red Cross work in its war effort. Fine woolen mittened articles were made from the wool supplied by the Red Cross Society.\n\nUpon my recommendation last year, the amount of twenty-five dollars was allowed for a school garden, and it was a pleasure to see the success achieved so far; the sister told me how the older boys and girls were pleased when garden work began this year; every one has a task to accomplish and the work is changed around, weeding, cultivating, watering; at the centre of the garden, a large clay barrel was sunk half in the ground and kept filled, so that water is at the proper temperature at watering time, rather than using cold water from the well.\n\nThe following requests were made by the sister in charge:\n\nRepairs to the sewing machine not to exceed five dollars.\n\nTen (10) single desks No. 4 for the young ones (actually, many have to sit three on a desk for two)\n\nI recommend that the above requests be granted, providing funds permit.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe last time Mr. Thibault honoured me of his agreeable visit, the Principal of the Festigwache Indian Day School asked our kind Inspector for the addition of ten single pupil desks for the Baby Class. My request was approved, on seeing the pupils sitting on ordinary straight chairs.\n\nI failed to give the necessary details. To avoid deception on their arrival, I want to mention that the desks we would like to match were obtained at Vilas, Montreal; they were walnut in shade, size 22\" long, 14\" high, and 14\" wide. We have pupils of nine years of age, or over.\n\nAssuring my own sincerest thanks, to those of your grateful scholars.\n\nRemain,\n\nTruly yours,\n[Signature]\n[Name]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6101, file 326-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Sir,\n\nDue to the huge quantity of heavy flannel sewed last year by the pupils of the Restigouche Indian Day School, one \"feed dog,\" and one \"upper tension spring\" of our sewing machines would need to be replaced. Such replacement can not exceed $5.00. Would the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs authorize our Indian Agent to have that amount sent, for the said purpose.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n[Signature]\n\nPater M. of the Holy Eucharist.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAugust 6, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Restigouche Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-415\n\nSHIP TO Dr. A.

I regret to have to expose especially at such a critical period, to the Honorable Staff of Indian Affairs, such a defect which makes the Sisters suffer from a constant cold during the winter season in spite of the good system of heating which we possess. I trust you will kindly judge my demand a reasonable one since you have always taken a serious care of the health of the teachers at your service. Such benevolence is highly appreciated.\n\nThe above work has been examined by a carpenter of the Reserve and he claims to be able to make the three windows for $15; this would be cheaper than buying them already made at the Factory.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nD'Arcy Richard,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.,\nOttawa\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant you may expend an amount of $15.00 in securing 3 storm windows for the teachers' residence at the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Will the honorable Staff sanction our undertaking? We willingly do it for the welfare of the children and for our own \"War Effort\" but free of charge to the Honorable Department.\n\nBeing in daily contact with the pupils we still notice this year the necessity of serving the midday lunches to the needy ones.\n\nLast fall the grant was reduced to $20.00 monthly. Could I ask for the same this year? I will do my utmost to reckon my expenses so as not to exceed the amount above mentioned.\n\nThanking you for past favors, I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to serving midday meals at the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nAs there is no lack of work at the present time it is felt that the parents should be in a position to supply their children with the food required for their midday lunch. However, in order to assist in this regard it has been decided to allow an amount of $90.00 for the academic year 1941-42. It should be completely understood that this is the total amount that will be allowed for midday meal purposes during the current academic year.\n\nIn most schools it is the custom to serve a midday lunch during the winter months only and if the same practice is followed at the Restigouche School the amount authorized in this letter should be sufficient to supplement what the children bring with them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It is the untidiness of unreasonable long hair on boys' head, especially when pediculi have to be controled at school.\n\nI have thought of a mean which would relief many. It would be to equip ourselves with few essential things for hair cutting. The eldest boys of the class could that trade. Meanwhile it would be a practical object lesson on hygiene which is sometimes hard to inculcate in their daily habits.\n\nIf the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs approves my requisition, you will be able to see what the expenses would be by the list below.

Having no kitchen stove to make the canning, I was forced to give them away during the summer season.

The step that you are taking in our behalf proves once again that you wish, not only to help and encourage us, but to sustain those who endeavour to improve the present conditions of the Indians trusted to their care. Yes, it is with all the physical, moral and temporal means put in our power, that we struggle to render life more pleasant to that poor mental destituted class of people. If we seem to gain ground in this subject, it is solely due to the generous cooperation that we constantly receive from our Head Quarters, to whom we owe sincere feelings of gratitude.\n\nThese new apartments will permit us to proceed further, and with more accommodation, our present formation and education of ex-pupils in matter of Home Economy and moral conduct. By kind Mr. Thibault's official report of what he has seen in our midst, you will notice that we are reaping real consolation with our Indians mothers and their children, at a very low cost.\n\nNext year in the west basement wing we could temporary place the Manual Training Class of boys and give their present classroom for a sewing room both for pupils and ex-pupils.\nSince the new basement rooms will have to be used for classes, at least during war time, do you think the teachers and the pupils would have the proper air space, if the rooms were but seven feet in height? It would be possible to make them higher but the excavation would be more costly, as they would have to dig in the rock and set a drainage system which would lead the waters outside the school yard. If the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs are not ready to meet the expense of finishing the two rooms of at least nine or ten feet high; could you not finish for this year, one room of nine or ten feet high, with a safe drainage? Thus all would have the satisfaction of a perfect work accomplished and quite safe for classroom purposes.\n\nBy such construction, the class floors of the first story will be kept at a normal temperature by the rooms of the basement.\n\nThanking you for past favors and trusting in a present one,\n\nI remain,\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, r.h.r.\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nTotal Cost\nof the two Apartments to be made in the\nBasement of the Restigouche Indian\nDay School, P.Q.\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| 2900 ft. of spruce boards 1\" by 5\" at $60.00 M. | $174.00 |\n| 1200 \" \" scantling 2\" by 4\" at $60.

They are particularly anxious for accommodation suitable for the promotion of domestic science and manual training. The Sisters feel that this additional accommodation would enable them to go in more extensively for the remodelling of discarded military clothing, in which they have been outstandingly successful despite their limited classroom space.\n\nMr. Thibault has made an inspection of this school on more than one occasion. The school has also been visited by Mr. Doucet. Mr. Thibault has recently discussed with me the advisability of excavating under the present building a basement which would provide at least two classrooms and thus relieve the congestion in the regular classrooms. We have been assured by a local contractor, with whom this matter has been discussed, that this excavation work could be undertaken largely by Indian labour, under proper supervision. It is somewhat difficult to state definitely, however, that the construction of the basement is the best and most economical method of providing additional accommodation. It is just possible that an additional classroom might be built adjoining the present school or attached to the present building, at a cost that would not greatly exceed the excavation of the basement. I should add that this is an Indian day school and our educational...\ncosts per pupil in recent years have been very reasonable. In view of the fact that we may have in this year's Training Appropriation a sum sufficient to buy at least enough supplies for alterations at this school, I would recommend that Mr. Doucet be asked to again visit the Restigouche school and discuss with local contractors familiar with excavation work the desirability of providing a classroom basement at the school and also the approximate cost of the work. It is not anticipated that any difficulty would be experienced in securing the materials necessary for such alterations. These materials would consist in the main of cement.\n\nDirector.\nAtlantic Trading Company, Limited\nWHOLESALE AND RETAIL MERCHANTS\nMARCHANDS GROS ET DETAIL\nRESTIGOUCHE, QUE., Jan 30th 1943\n\nSold to: Dept.

In this connection I am sending forward herewith a report on the Restigouche School, submitted to the Superintendent of Welfare and Training by Mr. A. J. Doucet, who made an inspection of the building last week. The subject matter of Mr. Doucet's memorandum is self-explanatory. He estimates that the cost of the materials necessary to provide three additional rooms at this school would amount to approximately $2,000. These materials would consist in the main of cement, lumber, windows, ten-pan, etc. Mr. Doucet finds it somewhat difficult to estimate the actual labour costs involved. He is of the opinion that these are not likely to exceed $2,500.\n\nIn view of the urgent need for accommodation at this school and in view of the fact that the foundations of the school itself are rapidly deteriorating, I would recommend that the school be reconstructed along the lines suggested in Mr. Doucet's memorandum. These alterations, when completed, will give us three well equipped classrooms, particularly well adapted for manual training for boys and vocational instruction for girls.\n\nWhile no provision is made in either the estimates of this year or next year for this work, the officials of the Welfare and Training Service inform me that they are likely to have sufficient funds to buy the materials out of this year's appropriations and they feel that the costs of labour might be secured from\n\np.t.o.\nnext year's appropriations. This work, in our judgment, should be undertaken at the earliest possible date in the spring. It can be undertaken without interruption in any serious sense of the work of the classrooms. It would be appreciated if I could have your decision in respect to this matter in due course.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOBY\n\nRe: Visit to Restigouche Day School\n\nAs directed, I have studied the various solutions in regard to increasing the accommodation of the Restigouche Indian Day School. I studied:\n\n1. The possibility of adding a wing to the present building;\n2. The possibility of finding a temporary locality;\n3. The possibility of building a basement under the present building.\n\nAs far as building an extension to the present building, it appears that the plan of the school does not lend itself very easily to such a procedure. Building a symmetrical wing at the North of the building would require hallways in order that there might be communication between the two buildings; these hallways would necessarily break up two classrooms so that this plan would, I believe, not increase the accommodation of the school. Furthermore, there would still remain to correct certain errors made in the construction of the present building. There is no foundation; the floors are exceedingly cold, being composed of the sub-flooring, paper, and the finished floor. This cannot keep warm enough so that the occupants and the teachers complain of cold feet. The complaint is justified. Moreover, joists and beam which are surrounded by dirt have greatly decayed, in fact some of them should be replaced immediately. This decay will continue to the walls, in fact in some parts the floor has already turned black. The walls which are covered with earth must necessarily be decaying. A few more years and complete change of the base of the building will be necessary. This would entail a considerable expense without remedying the situation.\n\nThe possibility of finding a temporary locality was investigated. There are but few buildings, such as the old teachers' residence and possibly the old school of the white population, but these buildings would require considerable repair, the payment of rent and would still prove to be very unsatisfactory.\n\nTo my mind there is but one solution which would give more room and at the same time remedy the cause of decay in the present building. That is to build a complete foundation beneath the present building. I would, therefore, recommend that the present building be raised approximately 2\u00bd feet and excavated to give a space of 9 feet, thus providing for a boys' workshop and two classrooms. This is not a very difficult proposition as the building\nis but a frame building and of one story except for the small classroom which is of two stories. I have required two men to dig below this building a four-foot hole to ascertain the condition of the sub-soil. We struck rock, but rock of a nature that is more like partly frozen soil. It can be broken fairly easily with picks. I have checked this as thoroughly as possible with Mr. Beaulieu who has considerable experience with this kind of work in the surrounding communities. We are convinced that this can fairly easily be done, especially with the hydraulic drill. Mr. Beaulieu, who has impressed me as being very reliable, is willing to use the equipment that he has and take full responsibility for raising building the foundation, putting in the drainage and finishing the concrete columns at the salary of $10.00 a day. It is difficult to estimate the time that it would take but with the help of four or five men the work could be done in six or eight weeks. I, therefore, would strongly recommend this solution.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J.

I should appreciate your confirming this arrangement. At the same time you should advise Mr. Beaulieu that it is our intention to proceed with this work as soon as weather conditions will permit.

May they spare you a few of your well-employed moments, by helping you to solve problems that inevitably occur in such undertakings.\n\nYou will kindly notice that we have thought of a bath room and toilets in the five feet space, where we had spoken to place the hall. Such an apartment is almost indispensable.\n\nThe stair leading to the work shop had to be placed in the class room, (although separated by a wall) as the pipes of the toilets prevent to pass the stair in the cellar on the north side. Besides the porch-like (13) could be used to enter wood in the cellar.\n\nWhat do you think, Mr. Doucet, of the annexed hall marked (2) which could be used for a gallery? For our part we would highly appreciate such benevolence on your part if you would kindly grant it to us. After a close examination, you will also notice all the advantages derived from it.\n\nThe actual cellar stair (No.19) would answer well for a meat store-room. Would it not? The space marked (20) could be kept for a vegetable store-room. Thus the kitchen would organized as a permanent one.\nIf we would have the basement doors at each end, with a porch it would be easier to clear the snow off and maintain the classes in a warmer temperature.\n\nWe are ever ready to sanction your final decision,\n\nI remain,\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, r.h.r.\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, r.h.r.\n\nMr. Alp. Doucet, Inspector,\nTraining Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nRestigouche, March 9th, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the repairs at the Restigouche Indian Day School, I beg to inform the Department Mr Beaulieu accepts to supervise the work at the rate of $10.00 a day, it being understood that he would use his own equipment, except, as understood with Mr Doucet, for the rent of 25 to 30 jacks at the cost of about $60.00 to $75.00 to raise up the building. This work should take 36 to 38 jacks, but has himself only 5 jacks.\n\nMr Beaulieu and I don't expect the ground to be in good condition to start the work before about the first week of June, if ground is good before that period I will inform you at once.\n\nMr Beaulieu promised to be at the job when weather conditions will permits, and I am of the opinion this man can make good work; I recommend him to the Department as well as I recommended him to Mr Doucet.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sister:\n\nYour letter of the 3rd instant, addressed to Mr. A.J. Doucet, has been brought to my attention. The contents of this letter have been very carefully considered, but I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to the many new requests contained in your letter. The funds at our disposal and other causes over which we have no control will not permit more extensive improvements at the Restigouche School than those already indicated to you verbally by Mr. Doucet when he last visited the reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

But for the few white men working on this job I believe the only way for me not to make any mistake will be to send the pay list to Ottawa every week, and to make the pay when the cheques come from your office.

En creusant pour placer ces formes nous avons trouv\u00e9 des vases en ciment de 8x8 pieds qui devaient aider \u00e0 supporter les colonnes de pierres lourdes \u00e0 interier, ensuite en arrivant dans le coin nord ouest, on \u00e9tait le bras pour basculer le mur de cinquante avant que le deux joueux dans les formes et \u00e0 partir tout couper cela, le mur d\u00e9passait les formes en l'air, sans cela nos formes auraient avanc\u00e9es, la plate pour arriver les coursives depuis un an nous est avanc\u00e9e pour le croisement.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que vous nous \u00eates bien rendu, et que nous \u00e0 la maison ne vous ont pas trouv\u00e9 trop maigre, je demandais toutes nouvelles de chacun pendant le beau temps continu\u00e9.\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Nous manquons de bois pour nos formes pour finir la fondation de cette \u00c9cole. Mr Beaulieu dit que les dimensions de cette fondation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup \u00e9tir\u00e9es depuis que les estim\u00e9s pour le bois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, mais que le bois n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9. En plus plus il en faut pour les fondations du corridor reliant le couvent \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait des calculs il a trouv\u00e9 qu'il faudrait encore 2000 fts de planche polies et 1500 fts de 2 X 4 pour les poteaux de ces formes. Nous avions d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 de cela et vous aviez dit de commencer et nous verrons ensuite. Il y a encore tout le bout de la partie est et le corridor \u00e0 faire, ensuite une coul\u00e9e de pieds de haut pour finir quelques autres c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Il faut faire le deuxi\u00e8me mur du dehors avant de commencer de couler le ciment. Ce mur ne prendra pas autant de temps parce qu'il y a moins d'ajustage, nous pensions de commencer cette semaine ce coulage mais je crois que ce manque de bois va nous retarder. Le creusement est est tr\u00e8s difficile et dur surtout pour le corridor. Il faudra aussi creuser le centre, la pluie nous retarde beaucoup dans toutes ces op\u00e9rations, la boue emp\u00eache les hommes de aller vite.\n\nPour moins retarder envoyer-moi donc un message si accept\u00e9 afin de faire polir ce bois et l'avoir dans le plus court temps. Les hommes font de la bonne ouvrage et ne perdent pas de temps.\n\nAgent.\nRestigouche, June 30, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRE: School\n\nI regret to inform you that we are again experiencing difficulty. We are short of lumber to finish the forms for the foundation of the school. Mr. Beaulieu claims that the dimensions of the foundation have been enlarged since the estimates for lumber were prepared while the latter have not been enlarged. Further, lumber is required for the foundations of the hall connecting the convent to the school. Mr. Beaulieu figures that an additional quantity of 2000' of dressed board and 1500' of 2 X 4 will be required for these forms. We had mentioned this to you, but you advised us to start the work and that you would consider the matter later on. There still remain the end of the easterly section and the hall to be done as well as a couple of feet in height to be finished on some of the other sides. The second outside wall must be built before the cement can be poured. This wall will not require so much time to build as it will require fewer adjustments. We expected to start pouring this week, but this shortage of lumber will delay matters. Digging is very difficult especially for the hall. It will be necessary also to dig in the center; rain also delays operations.\n\nTo expedite matters, will you kindly send me a message (telegram?) if you accept, in order that the lumber may be dressed as soon as possible. The workmanship is good and the men do not waste any time.\n\n(Sgd) J. Art. Richard\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 5, 1943.\n\nDr. A. Richard, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\n\nYour letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to additional lumber required in connection with repairs at the Restigouche Indian Day School, reached me this morning. I note that you require 2,000 ft. of dressed board and 1,500 ft. of 2 x 4. Mr. Doucet states that this can be secured at a very reasonable cost from C. H. Nadeau, Pt. Daniel Station. You are authorized to make the purchase from this man.\n\nR. A.

I feel that there must be a mistake in this matter, as one of our officials was at the Restigouche School on the date mentioned and none of your inspectors visited it that day.\n\nIn a letter dated October 3, 1942, from your office you stated that fire fighting apparatus should be supplied to the Restigouche School.

You should have each one of them fill out I.D.I form, in duplicate, and on referring to the table you will then be in a position to decide how much income tax is to be deducted from them. The tax deducted should then be forwarded to the Income Tax Inspector for your district.\n\nAs regards unemployment insurance, you should consult the nearest office of the Unemployment Insurance Commission. I presume there is a branch in Campbellton. You will be able to obtain full instructions from them regarding the amount to be deducted and the amount that the Department allows. When you obtain the information and the books, you will then purchase the necessary stamps and place them in the book. A special paylist should be prepared in the case of any or all the above mentioned who may be obliged to pay either income tax or unemployment insurance. A special paylist should be prepared covering the period for which each of them has already worked and deductions, if any, should be made on the occasion of the next pay for any amount that should have been deducted previously.\n\nMr. Doucet will be at Restigouche early next\n\np.t.o.\nweek and will assist you in preparing these paylists.\n\nR.

When the said room was examined by the carpenters here at work, we observed that the defect could easily be corrected by pushing a Gyproc wall.

You might look over this building and decide what should be done and, provided the cost does not exceed the amount she states, you may authorize it.\n\nI also enclose, for your information, a requisition which she has forwarded. It would be appreciated if you would discuss this requisition with her and return it to me as soon as possible.\n\nIt is not our intention to authorize an amount of $200.00 for material for clothes. We intend to send additional supplies of discarded military clothing, but you should point out to the Rev. Principal that it is not our intention to supply every child attending the school with clothing. The parents who are physically fit can obtain work and consequently should be able to supply clothing for their children. We do not want the Indians of Restigouche to obtain the idea that the Department is going to supply all clothing for children attending school.\n\nYou will also note that the Principal requests $190.00 for midday meal supplies. What has been said regarding the clothing applies also in the case of\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nc/o Dr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nthis request. Many of the children attending the Restigouche School reside very close to it and there is no reason in the world why they should not go home for their midday lunch.\n\nYou should also review the other requests contained on the requisition and let me have your recommendations regarding the amount that should be supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The agent waited till I returned to notify him of the Dept's decision.\n\nAs regards the basic rate of each class of employee on August 1, 1939, it is impossible to obtain this. You will recall when I discussed the income tax with you, that these men are men that have been employed by farmers in their constructions and hence no system was followed, different arrangements being made by each individual. I have however interviewed the companies in order to ascertain their methods used in paying their rent. Here is their statement:\n\nIndian Affairs.

Single men get a bonus of 7.4\u00a2 of their wages.\" This is the method they use when taking on new men.\n\nDoes your telegram mean to say that these men's bonuses will be retroactive as was the tax collection. Not to do so will bring about the same difficulty we have been experiencing. As soon as this is settled I intend to get a few more men, if possible, in order to progress more rapidly. At the rate they are now going, it will take a month to complete the work.\n\nPlease send me two reference money.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

An agent was in to see me so I picked out the material needed for the new rooms. I would like to insist on the black board 'Dollard'. If we can not obtain this we will have to take Hyloplate. They will also need a dozen common chairs, these for the sewing room. As far as the tables go I intend to get a price for having them made according to a plan I think will be more efficient than those we can buy today and at a greatly reduced cost.\n\nAs I mentioned to you while in Ottawa the roof of the school needs repair. It is a question of replacing shingles broken and others that were wrongly placed. I will have this done as it leaks at several places. The school would need painting; we have replaced parts that will need to be done for it is new wood but the whole school needs it badly. For about fifteen (15) dollars I can have the roof done. The rest will take about 30 gallons of paint. I could have this done on the same plan as the rest of the work if you think that would be satisfactory.\n\nI am having the Eel River School prepared for painting the interior. Do you wish to have the exterior done also. It certainly needs it badly. I could use the same plan as at the Restigouche School. The foundation should also need repairs. It is breaking away at a few places. \"A stitch in time saves nine\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. S. If I could have the blackboard soon enough I could have them placed while I am here. Please check on the Plastic rock for the floors, I have heard nothing about it since we ordered it at the beginning of July.\nOttawa,\nAugust 12, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, it is noted that the repairs required to the roof of the Restigouche School will cost approximately $15.00. You may also have the school painted, but it is regretted that you did not state the colour of paint you wish, so that the order for 30 gallons could have been placed through our Purchasing Branch. However, if you secure competitive prices you may purchase it from the firm quoting the lowest price, but you should forward all quotations with the account. The order for the rock wool was sent to the Storrar Manufacturing Company on July 10 and should have been delivered before this. I am writing to the firm today.\n\nYou may arrange for the exterior painting of the Eel River School, as well as the interior painting. You may also have the foundation repaired. I will try to have the blackboard shipped as soon as possible. So far this morning I have been unable to get in touch with the Stationery Office.\n\nI presume you can purchase the 12 common chairs locally.\n\nI am enclosing an additional supply of cost-of-living bonus forms. You only forwarded these for the following:\n\nAlfred Beaulieu\nElzear Mailloux\nElzear Beaulieu\nEdouard Frigon\n\nPaul Caissy\nPete Leclerc\nOvila Beaulieu\nRoland Quellon\nIt will be necessary to have one of these forms for each of those who have been employed, as it is our intention to pay the bonus to all of them, both Indians and whites.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No. 26-1-5\n\nAugust 18, 1943.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Restigouche Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-415\n\nSHIP TO Dr. A.

The number of hours are less than in 1942 but the wages had to be raised to $.20 an hour. This is what the indian women get in town for ordinary house cleaning.\n\nI submitted this case to Mr. A.J. Doucet, Inspector, and my proposal was considered reasonable.\n\nDr. A.

I expect to obtain a few retired men in a few days, to adjust the windows and doors. The men are very uneasy. In fact for a few hours yesterday I had but two left. At times for certain work I have to pitch in myself, at times I feel like taking up carpentry work myself in order to get finished with the job. I feel that the treasury department have been very unfair and have put an unnecessary load on my shoulders. Six weeks and still no bonus so wonder the men are uneasy. If I do not get the bonus before Saturday I am just as well to pack up and leave. As far as the Indians go I thought you were following the regulation no tax no bonus as for the teachers. However I am sending the forms completed; some could not be signed by the Indian himself as they have left for the States, the information is verified by the agent ans is therefore accurate. I cannot see any reason why the bonus for the forms sent in has not been sent in the meantime, this would have allowed me to progress more satisfactorily with the work.\n\nIn their requisition for school material the teachers have $150 for sewing tables, I can have these made here by the manufacturing Co.s for less than a $100. A table 2'6\" X 4'0\" for $7.50 a piece. I will also have the cupboards for domestic science made by the carpenters. I will also get a quotation on a kitchen range. If the teacher's desk on the quotation I sent you has not been purchased it should be cancelled and a secretary with a few drawers be substituted. It should cost about $12. I will return this requisition in a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPlease order 5 ten lb. packages (50 lbs.) of Bondex 109 stone gray from Reardon's Montreal.

Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\n\nI am enclosing herewith accountable advance cheque No. B 023220 in favour of the Restigouche Indian Agency Trust Account for $306.06 for the purpose of paying cost of living bonus to the employees engaged on the reconstruction of the Indian School.\n\nThe enclosed paylist, calculated according to the Cost of Living Bonus Regulations, covers the period from June 4 to August 14, inclusive, and payments to the employees should be made as shown on the paylist. If payment is made by agency cheques, the cheque number must be entered on the paylist; if payment is made in cash, the employee must sign the paylist as having received payment. When the payments have been made the paylists should be signed in the space provided and returned to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, as a credit voucher.\n\nWhen paylists are received for services performed subsequent to August 14th a further cost of living bonus paylist will be prepared and a further advance forwarded to cover. An examination of the paylists already submitted shows for the week ending July 31, 1943, you have credited the employer's share of unemployment insurance on account of Paul Malisey with two amounts of 25\u00a2 and 27\u00a2 and have totalled this column at $2.87; only 27\u00a2 should have been credited on account of unemployment insurance and the total of the column should read $1.62. The total of your credit vouchers has been reduced accordingly and should be taken account of when the final statement is made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nAtlantic Trading Company, Limited\nWHOLESALE AND RETAIL MERCHANTS\nMARCHANDS GROS ET DETAIL\nRESTIGOUCHE, QUE.\n\nSold to: Dept Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nTerms Net\n\n| DATE | ARTICLES                        | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|------|---------------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n| Aug 20 | Roll Heavy Coated Paper        |       |               |              | 250   |\n|       | 2                               |       |               |              | 500   |\n|       | 13 ds.

I have just received 4 blackboards. I have spread the ground that banked the school before it was raised on the school grounds and approaches making them level so that the spring water will not gather. This ground is a sticky clay and should be covered with gravel. It would take about 25 truck loads to cover it, possibly less. I can have this hauled for $4.00 a load. If this should be approved please wire me the answer.\n\nI went over and examined the Eel River school Sunday and I find that it is not worth painting the East side the siding and the roof are in a very bad condition. The extensive rains that we have been having has caused the plaster to fall from the walls of the cloak rooms. To repair this school adequately would cost between 4 and 5 hundred dollars. If the Department intends to centralize these reserves as in P.S., this would be a useless expense. To preserve this school the following should be done: Repair the roof, replace all the siding on the east side and replace broken siding on the others, repair the foundation, repair the windows placing storm windows, repair the cloak rooms. Please let me know what I should do. The foundation and windows should be done.\n\nI hope to be home in the course of next week.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

And it is a delight for the members of this residence to express to the honorable Staff of Indian Affairs their sincere gratitude for the beautiful work accomplished. Deign accept our heartfelt thanks for such a favor and for having sent in our midst kind Mr. Doucet Inspector, to direct and control this laborious undertaking. Sincere congratulations are due him, for the cleverness with which he has overcome all the difficulties, so as to lead this arduous task, to such a successful end. He acted as a conscientious man, owing to your benevolent cooperation and the steadfast solicitude of your devoted Inspector, our school has not only been enlarged, made more comfortable but embellished. You can be proud of it, as I may say; it has become the admiration of all. You have put at our disposal, roomy and well-equipped apartments where we hope that our Indian pupils will receive manual training and vocational instruction which will permit them to confront the tasks awaiting them on their departure from school. Each one of us will do our utmost to prove to you that you have not collaborated with us in vain.\n\nOn January 13, 1947, Mr. M. A. Hoey, sent a circular letter to the teaching staff of the Dominion stating that few improvements should be made in the educational programme. Immediately, we have tried, slowly but surely to annex more manual work in our teaching, so as not\nto make it so abstract and academic. The attempt has proved that the advice given by our kind Superintendent of Welfare and Training was worthy of efforts.\n\nWe will now be in the position to realize in full your proposed plans, always endeavoring to remain in the just limits.\n\nOnce again sincere thanks for all what you have so kindly done, to promote the general welfare of our Indians.\n\nYours gratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, P.M.\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, Prin;\n\nD.M.

Q.\nSept. 30, 1948.\n\nEXD.\n\nHead Quarters of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen Mr. Alphonse J. Doucet Inspector of Ottawa, left me the work at the Indian school to finish, he thanked me for what I had done and said that he was satisfied of the construction! His approbation pleased me and I do not want to quit before thanking the Head quarters of the Federal Department for having trusted me this preparation. I also want to thank you very sincerely for having sacrificed one of your learned employers to inspect the daily work. In spite of my fifteen years' experience on heavy construction, I admit frankly that having Mr. Inspector Doucet at my side all summer, I have learned many new things which I had no notion of before.\n\nI am,\n\nYour thankful and humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred Beaulieu, Carpenter of Restigouche.\n**Invoice**\n\n_Campbellton, N.

You may have an idea of the exterior by comparing the enlarged photographs which I made before and after the alterations.\n\nThe classroom desks came in just before I left, the blackboard was already on the wall and the floor had received a coat of plastic composition over the cement, which makes it more sanitary, noiseless to walk on and so much easier to clean; there is plenty of light from the south side and the walls and ceiling are painted in light soft color, contributing to make it an ideal classroom.\n\nThe room at the back is to be used for manual training has much better lighting than the one used up-stairs in the east, the floor has also received a coating of plastic and the walls painted in light color give the room a cheerful look.\n\nThe furnace is the same one but has been put on new foundation with additional pipes to supply heat to the new addition; large space is allowed for fuel wood storage with convenient entrance from back of the building.\n\nThe third room is quite large and is to be used for domestic science, sewing room, etc. The lighting is very good, there is a good sink with hot and cold running water, each side of the sink there are cupboards, the top of which are covered with masonite as well as the wall, cupboards are also built above the sink, as well as along part of the south wall; a new white enamelled wood burning cook stove was also installed. There are also eleven work tables, with drawers, made locally strongly built of hard wood, ten of them having a masonite top; the plain top one intended to be used for the knitting machines.\n\nThe basement of the passage between the school and the teachers' residence has been arranged for a root cellar.\n\nAll the lumber used for the cement forms was used in making dividing walls, ceilings, and cupboards.\n| DATE   | ARTICLES                        | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|--------|---------------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n| Sept 27 | Shirts, 4\u00bd ft. length           |       |               |              | 278   |\n|        | 2 Card sets, 25\u00bd x 24           |       |               |              | 320   |\n|        | 2 U.

There would be 30 lessons a week, which would give us $14.00 a month for 10 months = $140.00. I would, therefore, recommend that we allow a grant of $150.00 for the teaching of Domestic Science. The disposal of this prepared material may, with advantage, be supplied to the needy children at the school.\n\nAs regards the grant of $200.00 for clothing, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that clothing for the aged and destitute is supplied by the Restigouche Sewing Club. This would come under \"Welfare\" rather than \"Education\". I think it is advisable to have these needy people provided for in this manner rather than furnishing them directly.

Doucet\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCher Monsieur Doucet:\n\nUn mot de nos travaux pour vous dire que Beaulieu n'a pas pu aller sous l'\u00e9cole de Eel River pour placer des poteaux de fer. Les soupiraux de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 ne sont que des dalots bois\u00e9s en c\u00e8dre qui vont \u00e0 une grille dans le plancher de l'\u00e9cole, il lui aurait fallu faire un grand trou dans la fondation ou le plancher, alors il a laisser faire. Il a fait une bonne ouvrage, il a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 plus de lambris de planche que pr\u00e9vu parce que le vieux \u00e9tait avec une rainure et le neuf comme celui de Restigouche. Presque toute la fa\u00e7ade est en neuf et beaucoup des autres c\u00f4t\u00e9s.\n\nJ'ai a vous annoncer que les tableaux noirs de l'\u00e9cole des petits du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest viennent mouill\u00e9s par l'eau des murs. Fred dit qu'il va falloir mettre des baguettes de bois en arri\u00e8re pour l'air. Que pensez vous de cela. Aussi il fait plus froid dans cette classe qu'ailleurs, m\u00eame en fermant les autres conduits d'air chaud. Nous avons pens\u00e9 \u00eatre de l'Eucharistie et moi de mettre des pentures au ch\u00e2ssis en avant de la fournaise dans l'escalier pour l'ouvrir et envoyer la chaleur dans l'\u00e9cole. Autrement il va falloir mettre un petit po\u00eale. L'autre classe du c\u00f4t\u00e9 est est chaude par le po\u00eale de cuisine.\n\nSi vous pensez qu'autre chose pourrait \u00eatre fait s'il vous pla\u00eet de le dire de suite. J'en- graisse maintenant que je ne travaille plus aux taxes le samedi apr\u00e8s-midi. Je N'ai pas encore re\u00e7u l'argent du bonus pour le mois de septembre, les gens s'informent souvent. J'esp\u00e8re que Madame ne m'en veut plus.\n\nBien \u00e0 vous,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J'y suis all\u00e9 hier matin et r\u00e9ellement cela m'a fait piti\u00e9 pour ces enfants. Les murs sont tremp\u00e9s, on y voit l'eau couler, surtout au bout du ouest, le tuyau d'air chaud \u00e9tant seulement \u00e0 l'autre bout ne peut envoyer assez de chaleur pour s\u00e9cher et r\u00e9chauffer l'autre bout. J'ai fait examiner cela par Fred Beaulieu, qui en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il faut y installer un petit po\u00eale tout \u00e0 fait le long du mur ouest avec un long tuyau qui irait rejoindre la chemin\u00e9e en passant le long des tuyaux d'air chaud, et en y per\u00e7ant un trou, les autres trous sont trop bas.\n\nJe comprends que cela va encore co\u00fbter quelqu'argent, mais nous ne voyons aucun autre moyen d'y rem\u00e9dier. Nous avons ouvert le ch\u00e2ssis en face de la fournaise, mais c'est trop loin pour s\u00e9cher et r\u00e9chauffer tout l'appartement. Fred est beaucoup occup\u00e9, ne pourra venir avant la semaine prochaine. Nous avons pens\u00e9 que si nous pouvions trouver un petit po\u00eale \u00e0 acheter cela irait mieux que de prendre le petit qui chauffe l'eau l'\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00f4ter toutes les connections, y mettre des plugs, un petit po\u00eale carr\u00e9 chaufferait mieux que le petit de la fournaise.\n\nSi vous pouviez me donner votre opinion imm\u00e9diatement comment rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cet inconv\u00e9nient, je serais bien content, cela se ferait pendant que je puis avoir Fred, car si je ne le prends pas au commencement de la semaine, je ne sais quand je l'aurai.

Un tuyau tr\u00e8s long qui traverse la cloison, dans un bon gros bloc de ciment, en arri\u00e8re de l'escalier, tourne vers la fournaise de quelques pieds et s'en va \u00e0 travers les tuyaux d'air chaud dans la chemin\u00e9e, o\u00f9 un trou creus\u00e9 dans la brique y re\u00e7oit le tuyau dans le ciment. Ce tuyau est suspendu \u00e0 deux pieds du plafond par des fils de fer rapproch\u00e9s. Je n'y vois aucun danger pour le feu apr\u00e8s toutes les pr\u00e9cautions prises.\n\nAlfred Beaulieu a travaill\u00e9 seul pour cette installation, ses oiseaux \u00e9taient all\u00e9s \u00e0 Campbellton et quelques jours de repos \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Un homme seul dans ce posage de tuyau ne va pas vite, le ciment a aussi pris beaucoup de temps pour un seul homme.\n\nJe vous assure que petit po\u00eale avec cette longueur de tuyau donne une bonne chaleur et qu'il fait bon dans la classe surtout ces jours-ci avec une temp\u00e9rature au-dessous de z\u00e9ro jour et nuit.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que ces comptes seront accept\u00e9s sans difficult\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e l'urgence d'une telle installation, et les prix des mat\u00e9riaux.\n\nAgent des Indiens.\nRestigouche, Dec. 17, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am sending you the accounts for the installation of a stove in the smaller pupils' class at the Indian school of Restigouche.\n\nAt first, I thought that the price was rather high, but I followed the work closely and on reason thought I believe that everything is in order. There is a long pipe which runs through the partition in a large cement block behind the stairs; it then turns towards the furnace and reaches the chimney between the hot air ducts where it enters in a hole provided in the brick. This pipe is hung two feet from the ceiling by several strands of wire and I believe that every precaution has been taken against fire.\n\nAlfred Beaulieu worked alone on this job, his assistants having gone to Campbellton and a few days rest were necessary. Such work requires a great deal of time when it is done by only one man.\n\nI can assure you that the small stove gives off a good heat thanks to this long pipe, and that it is comfortable in the class, especially these days when the thermometer goes below zero night and day.\n\nI trust that these accounts will be approved in view of the urgency of the work and the prices of material.\n\n(Sgd) Art. Richard,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nI beg to inform you that on the 29th of October, 1943, I sent a cheque of $7.01 to George Levesque, Campbellton, N.B., as requested by himself, for his part of bonus for work done at Restigouche Indian School during this last summer.\n\nThis cheque and the letter just came back to me last night from the Dead Letter Office. I want to know what to do with this cheque, if I will send it to your Office, or cancelled it and make another one to your Office. I suppose this young man is gone outside for work and will come back later on.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 4, 1944.\n\nDr. A. Richard, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to cheque for $7.01 issued in favour of George Levesque. I note that you have been unable to locate this man and you may hold the cheque for the time being.

These poplars are very old, drying and rotten, very dangerous for the pupils in the school yard, while snow storm, and for the other peoples passing on the main road. Already some branches are broken at the top remaining up among the others. At every wind storm some branches brake and fall down.\n\nSo I thought, while men are cutting the trees at the Monastery and in the white school yard, to benefit of the services of these experienced men to cut also ours down and to clean the yard. There are 3 white men and two indian men and one indian horse working at this job. Mr Alfred Beaulieu took by verbal contract the job to cut those two trees and to clean well the yard with the responsibility of the damages to the fence for the amount of twelve ($12.00) dollars having all the necessary riggins.

Last fall, when they have repaired the School, all the ground taken off from around the building, was hauled on this part of the garden, but it is not levelled and a certain quantity of black ground should be hauled and mixed to improve the land.

(RG 10, Volume 6101, file 326-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nMr. Richard, Indian Agent, just told me that the Honourable Department did not see the need of wooden floors in the basement rooms of the Mistigouche Day School.\n\nWhenever I receive a decision from the Honourable Staff, I generally accept it as being the wisest thing to do; but in this present case I feel it my duty to give more explanations regarding the matter, as I see that Mr. M. J. Scott was absent, thus unable to give you the necessary information.\n\nWhen your Inspector visited us in early April, he saw the water streaming down the walls to the floors and noticed how cold and damp these rooms were. He stated, \"At the closing of the school say a word, and we will do something! It is really too cold.\"\n\nOn the first week of May, while I was holding a class of sewing with the Indian mothers, we were suddenly interrupted by a slop running in the apartments. After a week's time, seeing the water found no outlets, and was beginning to smell bad, the Visitor, Mr. John Caplin, with the help of school boys took out over fifty tubs, or twelve gallons each, of foul water. Can you imagine the condition of the clothes in cupboards and the cleaning we had to go there after? There was hardly any snow this winter, nor will it turn out if we undertake another winter in the same conditions. Presently, in spite of the warm weather, the dampness in the cupboards makes the clothes mild. During the winter months, the clothing would stick in the thick frost of the cupboard walls.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6101, file 326-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nAs far as the floors are concerned, I feel unable to undertake another year in the same conditions. I am waiting for the closing of the school to undergo a serious operation due to unhealthy apartment, without mentioning the ramifications connected therein. If school room was not in the basement we would simply ask you to close the women and boys' sewing club, thus only a small part of the time would be spent in the said apartment. But if you provide us with a trained officer next year, we will surely stand in need of all the rooms we presently have. I trust that next year, the pupils will be used to their new teachers and will attend school as regularly as in preceding years. In fact, changes among the teachers always register less attendance for the first year. Rather the teachers understand better how to get the children, or the children themselves, at any rate there is more satisfaction and encouragement.\n\nSince we are presently obliged to remain from eight o'clock in the morning till five o'clock in the evening in such rooms, I dare not ask our other provincial for a substitute in these conditions. I prefer to suffer there myself, although I sincerely feel excessively tired out, so to prevent another one to face the same difficulties and so does the other man. I asked the Indian agent if he found I was exaggerating in any statements which I was forwarding; he said, \"What you say there, Sister, it's the truth. When I go in for only few minutes, I feel it myself.\"\n\nSome pupils in the primary grade could not stand it and the doctor took them to remain home.\n\nI remember of having once said to me, in default, \"I would be in need of certain things sometimes but I dare not ask for them.\" He answered \"Ask and you will receive.\" It is with a sincere confidence that I beg this favor, for my long experience at your service has proved to me many a times that needed favors were ever granted.\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Sacrifice,\n\nSr. M.

Richard, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the request of the Principal of the Restigouche School for a wooden floor in the basement rooms. The contents of this letter have been very carefully considered and the Department feels that the installation of wooden floors would not remedy the condition about which the Principal is complaining. The only way to adequately meet the situation is to stop the water coming into these rooms, if this is possible. Mr. Doucet will be in the vicinity of Restigouche within the next two weeks and will visit the school and ascertain exactly what the trouble is and we will then be in a position to decide what should be done.\n\nR.A.

Richard, Indian of Restigouche band, had granted to the principal of the Indian School, the permission to buy a rug or linoleum for the two basement classrooms. Being unable to settle the question then, I failed to take the necessary informations regarding the conditions of the purchase, doubting very little the sudden departure of our much regretted doctor. Having no written document of the said permission I dare not make such expenses before knowing how to proceed and the amount allowed.\n\nAbout \u00bd a gallon of Stontite would first be required to fill in the cracks in the cement walls, also a layer of Stontite should be placed under the linoleum or rug to prevent it from rotting.\n\nIt is impossible to make an exact estimation. All I can promise is to have a satisfactory work done at the cheapest way possible. As soon as I will receive your approbation the work shall be undertaken.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist, r.s.r.\nSister L. of the holy Eucharist, r.s.r.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 29, 1944.\n\nRev. Sister M. of the Holy Eucharist, Restigouche, Que.,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 19th, we are authorizing the sum of $15.00 for the purchase of cocoa fibre matting. This will enable you to purchase over fifty feet of twenty-seven inch matting as contained in Eaton's catalogue for 1944-45. It is not our intention to have anything cemented to the floor as the entrance of any moisture would make it very undesirable. We rather favour these strips of matting which may be rolled up and placed where they are required. We believe that this will prove more satisfactory than any other method of which we know.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 25th, I am very glad to know that money is authorized for the setting up of chairs in one of the apartments in the basement at the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nA strip of carpeting will surely give a certain protection. Only thirty feet of carpeting is needed enough for one room. Would you be kind enough to authorize the same amount for the other apartment of the same size?\n\nDue to war conditions, the articles illustrated in Eaton's catalogue are not all yet available. As such is the case for the other supplies which are recommended. Would you kindly permit to choose whatever would be available, as long as it would stay in the limits of the sum allowed.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, c.s.p.\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, c.s.p.\n\nP.

This permit was made by Mr. Macnaught of Ottawa.\n\nLast spring Mr. Macnaught informed me that the basement apartment was too cold and he suggested that we use heat instead of wood for fuel. I did not turn off the wood stove during the winter because Mr. Macnaught had promised to help pay my mortgage and he said to keep a new job.

I wish I could exactly say... May be a wooden floor put on?... A clapboard of \"ten test\" over the walls?... I wonder!\n\nMr. J. Thibault, Inspector from your Department has seen by himself how insalubrious are the rooms of the lower story of the house and could tell you that I am in no way amplifying; he would be able\u2014at the same time\u2014to suggest what improvement would practically be possible.\n\nSo, I should be very much obliged to you, Honorable Sir, if you kindly consider this over and have the needed repairs made as soon as you possibly can. The children's health\u2014and the Sisters' also\u2014owing to severe colds ensuing from the state of the building are being dangerously exposed.\n\nIn trustful hopes, and with respectful regards,\n\nI am, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSister Mary of the Annunciation, Superior General.\nOttawa, April 21, 1945.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the Restigouche School.\n\nI understand that the condition to which you refer only occurs during the winter months.

However, the two rooms in the basement will require more finishing if they are intended to be used for the next school year. I was informed that the Superior General of the Community will not allow any Sister to remain in the actual rooms, on account of the continuous cold cement floor and the dampness of the walls. The improvement would consist in a wooden floor and covering of the walls on three sides in each room, as the walls on the side of the furnace room are not affected by dampness. I recommend that an estimate of the cost of the suggested improvements be requested from the Agent for the consideration of our Branch.\nRe: Floors and walls in basement of Restigouche School.\n\nI enclose herewith the estimates given by Mr. Alfred Beaulieu, for the floors and walls in the basement of the Restigouche Indian Day School, as recommended by Inspector Thibault.\n\n1830 ft. flooring for the two classes, $120.00 ........... $120.00\n100 lbs. cutter nails ........................................ $12.00\n500 ft. of 1\" by 4\" at $0.60 .................................. $30.00\n2 boxes of screws .............................................. $3.00\n\n1650 ft.

Arsenault, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Quebec.\n\nI have studied the bill that you have given me from the Harquail Company and I have come to the following conclusion. The problem is to see whether or not we have received this material. There has certainly been a great deal of negligence on their part for this bill has never been submitted as far as our records show.\n\nWhile checking these items, I am wondering if the first \"the door sets\" would not have been for the new doors that were placed in the school. If I remember well five doors were obtained, one double door at the back for wood and two in the workshop and two outside doors on the veranda. The four pair of hinges would have been required for these doors and the other pair probably was taken from the broken door which was discarded. The flush bolts must have been used in the double doors. The two and a half inch b.b. bolts must have been used in the toilet. The same with the screen door pulls and the light strap hinges. Check this over very carefully with Mr. Beaulieu and I think you will find that my assumption is correct. When you are satisfied with this submit the bill with the voucher explaining that it has just been received from the Company. I will then see what can be done about the payment.\n\nA.J.

Oct. 22, 1945.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen the carpenters made the walls and floor to the basement rooms of the Restigouche Indian Day School, they were forced to undo the 21' by 14' cupboard, as they were unable in spite of their endeavouring to remove it in one block. I have asked them to remake it but they affirmed that it was not on their contract.\n\nI am humbly asking the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs to kindly permit our Indian Agent, Mr. E. Arsenault, to have it made in the nearest future possible as I have no place to protect the sewing supplies. It is impossible to pile things on the floor and kindly remember that I am using that apartment for dining-room, kitchen, sewing-room, etc., occupation. Besides we have over fifty different seniors attending these courses in a week so I absolutely need a part of the cupboard to separate everybody's work, may it be crocheting, sewing or knitting.\n\nNot more than $43.00 worth of lumber paint and nails would be required. For the labour it would depend what salary would be given. I am positive that it took three days to two men to make it the last time, and I find that it is a too heavy work to undertake it myself with the boys of the Senior class.\n\nTrusting on your well-known benevolence,\n\nI remain,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, R.S.F.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nN.B.: The labour for this work would cost about $50.00; I recommend that cupboard as it is absolutely necessary for the domestic science course.\n\nE. Arsenault, Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 61C1, file 326-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nSince the number of teachers has increased at the Restigouche Indian Day School, we have always done our best to find space to room ourselves in the building granted us.\n\nHaving presently at our disposal such a spacious sewing room and having the small sewing room on the second floor of the Indian school left unused, I am asking the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs if you would please permit us to make a wall in that apartment and allow us the use of it for two nuns' cells that is bedrooms. Whenever we have visitors some teachers have to give their beds and sleep on tables in the workroom.\n\nIf you would kindly permit us the use of that apartment, I would have the boys' of the Senior Class make the walls and set in the door. I foresee that the lumber for that purpose would not cost more than $48.00 to $49.00.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nS.M.of the Holy Eucharist, r.s.f.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 16th November, 1945.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Quebec.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo with reference to using the small sewing room on the second floor of the Restigouche Indian Day School. I discussed this request with Mr. Doucet and it appears that he was under the impression the Sisters intended to use this room for a library. In any case, the Department does not think it would be advisable to use the room as a bedroom.\n\nI also received your letter of the 22nd ultimo with regard to the cupboard. I infer from your letter that the cupboard was torn down and was not replaced although I understand that Mr. Doucet gave verbal directions to the contractor regarding the manner in which the cupboard could be removed and also be replaced when the other improvements to the school had been completed. Please let me know what happened to the former cupboard.

I believe it is also by an oversight that Mr Doucet did not mention the fact to Mr Beaulieu, when they talked the matter over at my residence this summer.\n\nWhen Mr Beaulieu had about finished the work, he informed me of the matter; I had not the time to inform the Department because Mr Beaulieu was hired elsewhere few days after, and by doing so the job could not be completed.\n\nI have therefore asked Mr Beaulieu to varnish the floors and paint the walls. I left after for my vacation and it is why I have myself forgotten to inform the Department before now.\n\nPlease refer this note to Mr Doucet.

It is a fact, that they are obliged to sleep on tables of the kitchen, when they receive the visit of other nuns.\n\nLately, the community of the Restigouche Sisters, have received the visit of their Provincial Superior from Rimouski, and no doubt, that again, two nuns have been obliged to sleep on tables to secure rooms for the important visitors.\n\nYou will admit with me, that it is a bed in an emergency...........\n\nAs I may understand, this occurs only when they receive visitors, and the small sewing room of the second floor would be used only occasionally as bedroom.\n\nI believe also, that this space could be used in the meantime as library for the pupils; few shelves on the walls would be sufficient for this purpose.\n\nI beg the Department to study again his decision in order to secure to the teachers of the Indian Day School, a proper accommodation for the night.\n\nHoping my letter will receive your usual kind attention.\n\nE. Arsenault, Agent.\nOttawa, 1st December, 1945.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Quebec.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo replying to my letter of the 16th ultimo regarding the use of the sewing room in the Restigouche School for a bedroom. We have again considered both your letter of November 23rd and October 16th and we do not see any reason for changing our previous decision as conveyed to you in my letter of November 16th.\n\nI also wish to direct your attention to the second paragraph of my letter of the 16th to which you have not yet replied.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCampbellton, N.B., Sept 25-1945\n\nM.

Teacher's residence is also in good repair. There has been some trouble, after heavy rains, of the water backing up in the school basement. I examined the disposal bed which drains the sewage system and discovered that it is filled up completely and will not absorb the sewage as well as the extra rain water running into it. It is my opinion that the sewer pipes from the school should be connected to the sewage system from the Agent's house, which drains directly into the Bay of Chaleur. If this is done it would correct the trouble.\n\nWater Supply: The water pipes leading from the water system are old and corroded and leaking in several places. These pipes should be cut off where they join the main water system and a new connection made. This work, of course, cannot be done this year as pipes are not available. Arrangements, however, should be made in next year's estimates to provide money for this work. It is suggested that Agent Arsenault be requested to have a plumbing expert from Campbellton inspect both the sewer and water system to the school, and submit a tender on the cost of materials and labour so that the sum required can be provided and the work commence early next spring.\n\nNote: Three small storm windows for the cellar in the teacher's residence are authorized to be purchased.\nFORMER TEACHER'S RESIDENCE\n\nThis building was moved back and placed on blocks immediately behind the new teacher's residence. It is a large two-story building approximately 28' x 30' and appears to be in a very good condition. It is now used by the teachers as a store house for trunks, screens, doors, etc. I asked the Sister Superior of the school if they had any great need for the building and what objection would they have if it was moved to some other location and made available for some other service. She stated that there would be no objection on their part if we took the building and a small shed was constructed to provide storage facilities. This old residence is being neglected and if nothing is done to repair the roof then it will become a derelict and will have to be torn down. On my next visit to this Agency, I intend to investigate this building further and will make a definite recommendation as to what should be done with it.\n\nX X X\n\nJ.E.

Note. This school is located on church own property and the sewer pipe from the school connects up with the sewer system to a cess pool, located on church property.\n\nThe stench in the basement with a temperature of 90 degrees, was almost overpowering. You can imagine the work required to clean up this mess, as the water had saturated into the cement floor, partitions and benches. This is the third time that the sewage has backed into the cellar since January 1947, and the Agent reports that this is a regular occurrence, happening several times each year. Mr. Arsenault, had to practically beg a man to clean out the sewer, and the basement, in fact, Mr. Arsenault had to agree to work with him or he would not even attempt to do the job at all.\n\nIt is my opinion that the only way to correct this stoppage in the sewer is to lay a new sewer line, draining the school direct into the Restigouche River. This is the same system that has been in use for the Agent's house and Office and since it was constructed a number of years ago, has not given any trouble.\n\nThe shortest distance from the school to Restigouche River is 920 feet. Therefore, 920 feet of 6 inch Tile Pipe would have to be purchased. The cost of pipe and labour should not exceed $1200.00. This figure, of course, is only a guess. I would suggest that the Purchasing Agent endeavour to obtain the price and quantity of pipe required.\n\nImmediate action must be taken, as this school building is too good a one to permit to be damaged by filthy sewage backing into the basement. It is not necessary for me to go into detail but you can readily realize, the inconvenience to the Sisters and the unsanitary condition which eventually would be a menace to the health of the school children. I would, therefore, recommend, that action be taken at the earliest possible date, so that the work may be completed before school opens up in September.\n\n(OVER)\n(J. E.

Arsenault, Ind. Agent,\nRestigouche, P.E.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI dread to see the winter months coming for our Mission Board, and Dundy pupils, who have such a long distance to face the bitter cold winter storms. Presently the class rooms are full to their capacity daily and it is so encouraging to see how well the pupils do learn when they attend school regularly. Of course some do play truant, but we must be sincere with them, and admit that during the winter months pupils miss, for the most part, due to the impossibility of standing the severe cold climate of the place.\n\nWould it not be possible for you, Mr. Arsenault, to explore this...\nLet to the Honorable Department of Indian Affairs, and if you explain things the way they really exist, I am positive that this favour will be granted them. I would not ask if I were to excuse me for my suggestion for pupils 3/4 of a mile from school, and then would be in need of looking for big boys over 12 years of age, as they are sturdy enough to overcome storms. But I would insist upon the necessity of having a sleigh covered with a heavy canvas, to haul the 23 youngest and farthest pupils of Millers Brook and Sandy Road during Dec., Jan. and Feb.\n\nI'm forwarding you the names of the farthest families with the number of pupils of school age so that you may see for yourself that my demand is legitimate.\n\nMany thanks!\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosed please find letter from Sister M. of the Holy Eucharist, Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School which is self explanatory.\n\nI am fully aware of this fact and admit that absenteeism from school by the children stated on Rev. Sister's list, is due to the distance they have to travel this distance is approximately 1\u00bd mile one way which means 3 miles per day for children of 7 and 8 years of age is no doubt too much to walk in cold and stormy weather.\n\nI highly recommend transportation for the Months of December, January and February. If the Department approves this demand, I would suggest that we ask for Tenders amongst Indians who have horses and sleighs, from my opinion transportation may amount from $40.00 to $50.00 per Month.\n\nKindly give this matter your immediate attention.\n\n(E. Arsenault)\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1947.\n\nMr. L. Arsenault, Indian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\n\nWe have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to driving some of the children to the Restigouche School.\n\nIt has been generally agreed by the officials of the various Departments of Education throughout Canada that children of ten years of age and under can walk two miles each way to school. Over ten years of age it is agreed that children can walk three miles each way to school.\n\nWe note that the children mentioned in your letter have only a mile and a half to walk each way. We are not prepared to provide transportation at Restigouche.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\nAttention Col. N.B.

Arsenault Indian Agent, to undertake this work immediately.\n\nNote the following: Mr. J. English engineer for plumbing and heating of Campbellton, N.B., has delivered approximately 900 feet of 6 inches diameter terra cotta sewer pipe at a cost of $0.60 per foot. Mr. English will supervise the work running levels etc. at a cost of about $125.00.\n\nIndian labourers will be engaged for opening and covering the ditch at an approximate cost of $500.00, incidental transportation of tile etc. should not exceed $75.00. A\"Y\" should be provided so that connection could be made if necessary at future date as well as two traps to make it possible to serve the sewer if necessary.\n\nThe entire cost of this work should not exceed the amount of $1200.00. This sewer is urgently required to be done, I therefore suggest that Mr. Arsenault be authorized by return mail to commence work and an accountable advance of $500.00 be sent to him to pay for labour.\n\n(J.

To place a tin sheet to ceiling above the furnace door.\n2. To make an outside stairs leading to the sisters' dormitory.\n\nWould you please inform if your Department is obliged to comply with Provincial laws or regulations, and advise what action should be done according to their letter, the work must be done at once.\n\nYour immediate answer would be appreciated.\n\nEdgar LeSeneault, Agent.\nDecember 27, 1947.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.E.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant regarding the teacher's residence at the Restigouche school, you may arrange for placing a sheet or tin on the ceiling above the furnace door.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion that outside stairs be erected, please let me know exactly what type of stairs were recommended and you should also advise the approximate cost of installing them. When we have this information the matter will have further consideration.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of December the 27th, your instructions will be followed for what concerns the installment of a sheet of tin on the ceiling above the furnace door of the Sisters residence.\n\nAs to the erection of outside stairs, the principal of the community is against that and do not see any use of it.\n\nI have visited the residence inside and outside, and according to my opinion, it is impossible to erect an outside stairs connecting with the dormitory, on account of the windows and besides there is no place at this story to put a door.\n\nReally speaking the residence is only a story and a half house, and for my part, I have never seen any outside stairs on such buildings in the province of Quebec, and I am not assured that the law demands it.\n\nYour comments would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to John Caplin\nAddress Restigouche, B.C., Que.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Jan. 8 | To.

Material for domestic science class - $90.00\n2. Material for manual training work - $50.00\n3. Sewing machine repairs - $8.00\n4. Knitting machine repairs - $8.00\n5. Provision for serving noon day lunches - $15.00 a month, or $150. for the academic year.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood by the principal and yourself that the above amounts are all that will be allowed for the purposes mentioned during the academic year 1947-48, namely for the period September 1st, 1947 to June 30th, 1948. As previously stated, we are allowing the Restigouche School much more in proportion than we do to other schools and it will not be possible for the Department to increase the amounts mentioned above.\n\nWith reference to the request for $200.00 for the home makers club expenses, this matter has been referred to the welfare Division and you should wait until you hear from them before authorizing any expenditure.\n\n(Signed) Bernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 5, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. GENDRON\n\nWe note from a recent letter received from Indian Superintendent Arsenault that on the occasion of your visit to the Restigouche Agency you authorized purchase of one bag of peas and one bag of beans for noon day lunch purposes.\n\nIn connection with noon day lunch at this school, I wish to direct your attention to official letter of July 28th, copy of which is attached. You will note that the Indian Agent was definitely informed that the amount authorized in that letter was intended to cover the academic year 1947-48 and consequently if application had been made direct to this office we would not have authorized purchase of the additional supplies at the present time.\n\nIn so far as the expenditures from the appropriation for Indian Education are concerned, I would appreciate it if instead of authorizing expenditures when visiting an agency you submit the matter to this office with your recommendation and I can assure you that anything you recommend will receive very careful consideration.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Day School, Restigouche, P.Q.\nMarch 9, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Mr. J. L. Gendron's visit, the Principal of the Restigouche Day School has requested our kind Supervisor to have a Delco engine for lighting plant installed in both school and teachers' residence. Mr. Gendron stated that such would no doubt be possible as there were two Delco engines available just now in few other reserves.\n\nUseless to mention how highly we would appreciate such an improvement since the electric power is not yet given to this reserve. Rumor says that it will be granted in few years to come. Would it not be wiser to wire the building with 110 volt at once?\n\nCould the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs have the school and the teachers' residence wired during the summer vacation for the greatest joy and usefulness of all your humble servants?\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist,\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIndian Day School, Restigouche, P.E.\nMarch 13, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the end of the academic year the janitor of the Restigouche Indian Day School varnishes the floors of the five school rooms, sewing room, halls, toilets and piazza.\n\nLast year the principal of the said school had the floors varnished only in the most needy classes so as to have enough varnish to repair all our school desks which we did.\n\nThis year we would stand in need of six gallons of mahogany varnish stain for the above named apartments. At our local authorized store this mentioned stain costs $5.50 a gallon. We would also need one gallon of gray paint for the piazza and outside stair. This gray paint costs $4.75 a gallon. Such separation cannot exceed $37.00. Would the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs authorize our Indian Agent Mr. E. Arsenault to permit me such expenditure?\n\nThanking you most sincerely,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 19, 1948.\n\nMr. E.

Que.\n\nWith reference to the above and further to previous correspondence I wish to report that this matter was further investigated and enquiries made with respect to the digging and refilling of ditch also as to the place of passage.\n\nUpon examination of ground on which we intended to pass ditch at first, it has been found that it would be more advantageous to change our course and for the following reasons:\n\nThe matter of digging was discussed with Mr. J.E. Gendron, Supervisor for Quebec Agencies and a conclusion was reached that it would cost much more having the digging done by hand than by a Back-Digger which is available in the vicinity. Two hard surface roads would have to be crossed, Mr. J. English engineer would have to be on the spot to supervise the level and by having this hand dugged this would mean weeks for Mr. English at $1.25 per hour, whereas by digging with a back-digger, Mr. English could supervise the level, laying out pipes at the same time and would be a matter of days.\n\nThe new course we have found would decrease the length of about seventy (70) feet, would prevent us to less damage to private property and the lifting of fences, giving a better slant and same accommodation for future necessity.\n\nThe original estimates being $1,200.00 on which $566.00 already spent for purchase of pipes; balance $634.00\nRe: Sewer Restigouche Indian Day School\n\nNow the length of sewer to be dugged would be approximately 850 feet, digging and refilling by back-digger would cost $1.10 per foot, being $935.00 J. English, services approximately $125.00, man holes approximately $75.00.\n\nThis means that this whole expenditure would cost approximately $1,700.00 instead of $1,200.00 as previously stated. A further amount of $500.00 besides the amount of $1,200.00 already approved, would be required in order to execute this project. If the Dept. insist that the digging be done by hand, I cannot guarantee that the cost would average less than $1.00 per foot and as stated above Mr. English's services would cost much more owing to the fact that more time would be taken for the job.\n\nKindly advise the writer as soon as possible as to the decision and intentions of the Dept.\n\n(E.

English, Engineer of the town of Campbellton, we have realized that there was at least six feet difference between the school and where we had to connect with the sewer pipe of the agency.\n\nThe sewer pipe at the School is about 5\u00bd feet in the ground; it means that we would have to dig about 12 feet deep to keep the level; it was absolutely impossible on account of the rock.\n\nIn fact we have found solid rock along the road where we are digging at present and in the school yard for about 150 feet long at a depth of only 5 to six feet.\n\nHoping those explanations will be satisfactory,\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Supt.,\nRestigouche Agency.\nMOA230 35-2 EXTRA VIA CAMPBELLTON NB= RESTIGOUCHE, QUE 6 1216P\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH, DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES=8175.\nOTTAWA=\n\nREFERENCE YOUR LETTER JULY FOURTEENTH FOURTH PARAGRAPH MRS\nJOHN MARTIN THE OWNER OF THE LAND WITH A STICK CHASED THE\nMEN DIGGING DITCH WORK DISCONTINUED PLEASE ADVISE WHAT\nACTION TO BE TAKEN URGENT=1\n\nEDGAR ARSENAULT INDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Gedron and myself to that effect, and I was a new man coming in. Naturally thought that this work had been authorized and accepted this as being alright. I called at Sharp's Garage two or three times when in Campbellton on other business and made inquiries as to when the motor would be ready; most times when I would phone, and also I called in person, I was told that they were waiting for parts, and due to the fact that this type of machine was made in the U.S.A., parts were very difficult to get.\n\nOn November 24th, they brought the motor back and set it up in the basement of the agency office, naturally by this time the batteries were down and the men required to get the machine running properly etc., however the motor did not run as it should and they were advised, their man was again over, and from what I could see he busted himself with the coil for the day.\n\nThe motor continued to work badly, that is it would run for fifteen or twenty minutes at regular speed and would then slow down to the point where the meter would stop discharging and we would then have to shut it off. On December 3rd, I received this bill for $631.52 (amount according to figures shown by $42.52). On December 11th, this charge arrived while I was at dinner and asked me to come and open the office as he was a new coil for the motor (this could be put in a vest pocket without any trouble), etc., in spite of the fact that the small boat was crossing pedestrian traffic, he came around by truck (the other man driving) I told him that he had better return to Campbellton as I would have nothing further to do with the motor until the Department had been advised.\n\nThe engine is now here but is not being used, and I have not contacted Mr. Sharp in regard to this bill.\nTo my knowledge the only time that a 4 ton would have been needed would have been to take the engine to Campbellton and return it to this office.\n\nThis type of machine when new is worth about $300.00 and you will readily see by looking over this statement, that it is nothing short of robbery to submit a bill of this kind.\n\nWhat has been said in regards to Voucher 1027, is also true of 1028 especially items marked Truck rental.\n\nIf further information is required you might ask Mr. J. H. Gendron, Regional Supervisor of Indian agencies for the Province of Quebec.\n\nAwaiting your instructions and comments.\n\n(Sgd) C. H.

The old Convent belonged in 1902 to the Reverend Capuchin Fathers and in 1937 it was handed over to the Sisters in charge of the Restigouche Indian Day School and we have been using same for storage and wood shed. It is no longer safe for a storehouse owing to the broken windows, doors and leaking roof.\n\nWould the Honorable Department of Indian Affairs permit our Indian Agent to have it torn down?\n\nMr. Gendron and Mr. Ross claim there would be all the necessary wood out of it to make a good wood shed and storehouse, 30' by 15' by 10' to store 10 cords of wood, 80 storm windows and doors, 16 trunks, winter meat supplies, etc., etc. All the expenses needed would be the labor by Indian men who are loafing around and relying on the relief granted by the Honorable Department for their living.\n\nI confidently depend on your unlimited generosity and benevolence to have this work done in the nearest future possible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist...\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor the last ten years the Electric Power Co. has always postponed the installation of electricity in our district. They promised the electric current in this vicinity but we are still awaiting in vain. We hold from high positive sources that it will not be available before years.\n\nTherefore we are earnestly begging the most honorable Department of Indian Affairs to kindly authorize the installation of a Delco in the Restigouche Indian Day School and in the Teachers' residence.\n\nKindly refer to Mr. Gendron on the matter as he made all the necessary inquiries concerning electricity in this region.\n\nRelying on your well-known generosity and benevolence.\n\nWe beg to remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Having no electric current then, the wiring was cancelled.\n\nWe humbly beg of the most honorable Department of Indian Affairs to give us a special grant for the wiring of the Restigouche Indian Day School and the Teachers' residence. The amount necessary could no doubt be reckoned from the blue print which the honorable Department of Indian Affairs has on hand.\n\nMr. Gendron understands and highly approves this request on seeing its great necessity. Kindly refer to Mr. Gendron, Indian Agency Inspector, for further informations.\n\nTrusting on a favorable answer.\n\nWe remain, most gratefully yours,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my letter of March 23rd, I, the Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School, asked the Honorable Department of Indian Affairs if I could open a new classroom for the newcomers or refuse them this spring due to lack of space. It was advised to delay the admittance of all the Indian pupils of 7 years of age till September and that Mr. A.W. Doucet would interview the matter as to what could be done. I see that Mr. Doucet did visit part of our province but returned to Ottawa before coming to see the school attendance and the overcrowded classrooms. I am told that our devoted Inspector will return in the fall to decide what should be done.\n\nSince all the teaching staffs of our Convent schools are being definitely named in July, I will have to discuss the present situation by letter. I already spoke to Mrs. J. Gendron, Inspector of Agencies, of what could be done for September since I am informed that the enlargement of the school will take place only in the summer of 1950.\n\nReverend Father Lucien, Parish Priest of Restigouche benevolently offers us one classroom in the French school 100 feet away from the Indian School. Reverend Father intended to open a mixing room for that class for the White Mothers, but seeing our difficulty in lodging the 181 Indian pupils in the present school he would rent it to the Honorable Department of Indian Affairs for one year, at $30.00 a month. The said apartment can accommodate thirty pupils and is all equipped with the necessary desks and blackboards. Six cords of 128 cu. ft. of 16 inch wood would be needed for the classroom stove.\nMr. J. Gendron and Mr. C. R. Nadeau visited the five Indian classes and the French apartment above mentioned and can give to the Honorable Staff of Indian Affairs all the informations which I have failed to give.\n\nI would highly appreciate knowing in the nearest future possible your final decision on this subject as I have to ask my Superior General in June the number of teachers necessary for the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist...\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nJune 8, 1949\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Doucet,\n\nI know that the new construction for the Restigouche Indian pupils will only be started in the summer of 1950, but the plans are made beforehand and as I might not be here then, I think it better for you and us to expose my ideas and fears to you on this subject.\n\nMr. J. Gendron said in between the lines, that it was not the Department's intention to build a new wing to the present 12 year old school but intended to make an entirely new school for boys where manual training could be taught. I highly appreciate such determination. Then, I also understood, that the boys would have men teachers. This absolutely lies in the Honorable Staff's power and choice. But, Mr. Doucet, we are just out of a similar experience made in Gasp\u00e9 by men professors and I dread it in this case also. In Gasp\u00e9, the building had been made to provide for boys; but after two years experience the whole was handed back to the Sisters to the satisfaction of His Excellency Bishop LeBlanc and the population. Here, kind Mr. Doucet, the pupils have to be trained for choir singing, mass, funeral and wedding services, besides the regular course. If men professors are devoted enough to answer to those needs, we would put up no objection and we would be glad to keep only the girls. But if those professors do but their teaching and off they go, do you see the difficulties we would be\nin, to control those boys who would be our pupils any more? Presently we can affirm frankly that the big boys are studious, obedient and can easily be controlled. In a word they give us no trouble. Why not simply have a manual training teacher and leave the boys under our direction?\n\nYou may say: \"It is possible to find men teachers who will be ready to devote themselves for the good cause of Indian boys. Hope you say right but the Mr. A.J. Doucet of old are scarce now-a-days... I know you personally did it, and I hold from sound sources that you accomplished similar apostolate for many years, but you are one out of a hundred and will we fall on the right one?\"\n\nWhat I foresee is that after a few years the whole will be handed back to us, and if the new construction is made far from the present Indian Day School please do not forget the inconveniences.\n\nI do not speak for me personally as I said, for I do not intend to be here next year, but I want to leave you my most humble opinion on the matter knowing that you will consider it wisely before final decision.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist,\nPrincipal\nMr. A.J. Doucet, Supervisor, Vocational Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nJune 16th, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R.

Ltd., Campbellton, N.B. is the only Firm which can supply the wire and their prices are 25 cents per foot, on the other hand, the T. Eaton Co. Ltd., Moncton, N.B. advertises wire, galv. heavy gauge, single scroll style, 42 ins. high at 17\u00bd cents per foot, the amount of $32.50 could be saved by buying from the latter.\n\nThe only way to purchase the wire from the T. Eaton Co. would be through C.O.D. and money would have to be on hand in order to pay for same on delivery. Unless the Department is in a position to supply the wire and the other materials at better prices than quoted on our requisition, I would request that the amount of $300.00 be forwarded and every possible effort will be made to have this fence constructed for this amount.\n\n(C.R.

Doucet on his last visit at this Agency, attached hereto please find estimates submitted by two Firms from Campbellton, N.B.\n\nIn order to supply sufficient heat for both buildings, blower systems would be necessary which would necessarily require the installation of a Power Unit or electrical power of some kind.\n\nThe wood furnace actually in use in the teachers residence is still in good condition and would supply sufficient heat with the aid of a blower.\n\nThe furnace in the School is absolutely worn out and should be replaced and as this matter was discussed with Mr. A.J. Doucet, I would appreciate if this question was again brought before the latter.\n\nIt would also be greatly appreciated if this matter was treated as urgent as possible for the good reason that neither coal nor wood has been purchased as yet and it is doubtful if good and dry wood will be available after the 15th. of this Month.\n\n(C.H. Nedden)  \nSupt.  \nRestigouche Indian Agency\nAugust 10, 1949\n\nMr. C.H. Nadeau,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\n\nWe have received quotations re the new furnace for the Restigouche school. I am afraid these two gentlemen overlooked the real need of the school. As it is constituted at present there is no electricity and although we intend to have the school wired and put in an electrical plant, this is liable to take some time and the heating will be required shortly. Hence we will have to forget the idea of forced air circulation.\n\nWe wish to replace the present furnace by a coal burning furnace of sufficient capacity to heat the school under present conditions. We wish to have a unit to which a fan may be added when electricity is available. Please make sure that the furnace quoted on by Bradley and by English come up to this requirement. Kindly give this your earliest attention as we wish to proceed with the installation at the earliest possible date.\n\nA.J.

Neary, Sup't. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Mr. A.J. Doucet's last visit to the Redgrouse Indian Reserve, the principal of the Redgrouse Indian Day School discussed once again the problem of the overcrowded classrooms and he has asked Mr. Doucet if the young Indian pupils of school age should be refused in September or if a new classroom would be opened either in the French school or elsewhere. Our inspectors asked if the Manual Training Room could not be fitted for that purpose, and stated, \"Accommodation must be provided for all Indian pupils of school age.\" This made me understand that a new class would be opened.\nfor the said accommodation, and I have advised our Superior General of this fact so as to retain seven teachers for the Redpath Indian Day School. I have forwarded on July 27th to the Honorable Department of Indian Affairs the seven names of the teaching staff and requested, in the meantime, the seven application forms for the year 1869-70. I am in receipt today of six forms only. Does this mean that the Honorable Department refuses the opening of the new class or was it simply a secretary's error. I can easily copy a seventh form but what I am eager to know is your final decision on the matter.\n\nI am presently making my retreat at the Mother House at Penobscot and will be leaving on the 15th of this month for Portland Maine. It will thus be useless to notify me. I would highly appreciate your advising Reverend Mother Mary of S. Rose, Superior General of your present necessity, as the missionary Sisters will soon be leaving for their respective missions.\nThrusting to hear from you, kind Mr. Neary, in the nearest future possible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist.\nTEARING DOWN OF THE OLD BUILDING AT THE RESTIGOUCHE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL - $600.00\n\na) Tearing down the old building all finished in plaster work inside.\n\nb) Cleaning the grounds ready for the new construction. This means paying trucks at $3.00 an hour for transporting the old plaster, laths and rotten wood to the river.\n\nc) The longest boards which can be saved between the openings of six doors and sixteen windows are 3\u00bd feet in length on the outside walls only. These aborts boards cannot be easily used in the construction of the new store house and shed being the scantlings two feet apart. I might be able to use some in the roof.\n\nd) The only useful building material which can serve in the new building would be 75 pieces of rough scantling for frames. Thus I could tear down the old building for $600.00.\n\ne) Most of the 18 window frames are rotten and the glass panes are broken.\n\nAlfred Beaulieu, Carpenter.\n\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nJuly 21, 1949.\n\nPLEASE NOTICE:\n\nWould you kindly let me know in the limits of 10 days if the Honourable Department accepts my estimates, otherwise I will undertake a Summer job with the International Paper Company.\n\nThanking you.\n**Department of Mines and Resources**\n\n**Requisition for Supplies**\n\nAugust 10, 1949\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPlease furnish the following supplies for use of Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nVote: 516 Primary 10-691 Object Required\n\nShip to: C.R.

D.\nAug. 12, 1939.\n\nTo Mr. A. H. Gray, Sub. of Welfare & Training\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou would no doubt be interested to know that two teachers from the Pestigouche Indian Day School are now following wood work Manual Training courses at the Technical School Timmins. One of different pieces executed here is a \"work-bench\" for the Pestigouche Indian Day School.\n\nThe screws, cherry and maple wood used in its construction amounts to $7.50. Having five similar work-benches to perform, the total expense\nwould be raised to $6.85. Buying them at the factory, each costs $2.95 freight included. If made by the school boys, $1.50 are saved on every one. Besides the pupils will have instructive lessons, which I hope will help them through life.\n\nYour kind suggestion in the matter, Mr. Grey, was a very practical one, and was highly appreciated. Would the Department grant me the $55.00 thus saved, to buy the necessary tools, of which we will stand in need at the opening of school.\n\nRelying on your well-known kindness, I trust that this great favor will be conceded, for the welfare of the Assiniboine Indian Day School.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist\nOttawa, August 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sister Mary:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letters of the 10th instant, in which you express the hope that the Department will be in a position to send forward to you certain supplies urgently needed for the promotion of a worthwhile educational program at your school.\n\nI am today communicating with the Indian Agent, asking him to discuss with you the desirability of purchasing a certain amount of equipment for manual training. The Agent will be authorized to buy tools to an amount not exceeding $50. The blackboard, to which you refer in one of your communications, is being ordered and will reach you in due course.\n\nI am anxious to have additional information with respect to the loom you request. Are such looms available locally? If not, you might give a brief outline of the type of loom you have in mind. If you can supply us with this information, your request will be very sympathetically considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

The School Inspector Mr. Leblanc, who visited us last week was surprised, meanwhile pleased with the manual work performed during the month of September by the big boys and girls of the school.\n\nWe are checked however, by a problem which the Department alone can solve. That is, to cover the expenses made in buying the materials, particularly the lumber needed to keep the pupils busy during 10 hours weekly. Unless the Department come to our help, or allowing us a $5.00 bill to buy at the authorized store, some more lumber for the making of common chairs, we will see ourselves forced to keep a stand still regarding the matter.\nIf the pupils succeed in constructing chairs, I planned on selling them at the Atlantic Trading Co. in order to have a continual revenue to supply with new materials.\n\nLeaving this to your own kind consideration,\n\nI remain\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist.\nPortage Indian Day School,\nBonaventure County, P.Q.\nFebruary 10, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to your generosity and the delicate attention of Mr. Richard in saving all the wood boxes received, we have been able to keep the Senior Class of the Portage Indian Day School busy in Manual Training.\n\nWould we labour of your kindness if we would ask for $5.00 more to be used in buying the necessary material, such as nails, hinges, glue, paint brushes, and few sheets of three-ply wood,\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is scarcely necessary to add that the cost of these supplies should be kept down to the lowest possible figure and must not under any circumstances exceed $100 for the present academic year.

The postage expenses are covered, with money raised by a Bingo Party, organized by the girls, in the afternoon of April 14th.

McGill\n\nRE: RESTIGOUCHE AGENCY\n\nI beg to submit a report of my inspection of the above Agency, made during the last part of June.\n\nSCHOOL:\n\nOn June 19th, I visited the Indian Day School and found 130 children present, out of 174 registrations during the current school year. Children were neatly dressed and clean; the class rooms as well as other rooms were spotless.\n\nI took much interest in looking over the exhibit of pupils' work and handicrafts. The amount of constructive work on the part of the sister in charge; sewing, knitting, etc., done by the girls show that the teaching of the sisters was not fruitless; amongst the collection I found, baby, child and grown-ups shirts, pants, dresses and windbreakers, all cut and sewn by the girls; girls' winter coats made from the materials authorized by the Department were most useful and the best practical mean to teach the girls how to make up their own clothing later on; boys' shirts and pants, all made at the school, were to be seen on many of the boys' persons, and all made up at a much lower cost than it could be purchased ready-made.\n\nThe idea of supplying the material to be made up by the pupils is most practical, providing we have such an interested person to supervise and direct the children, as Sister Mary of the Eucharist, actually in charge.\n\nThe boys have made many practical and useful articles, such as chairs and tables, plain, but solid; other fancy things were also made by the boys.\n\nThe pupils also took an interest in Red Cross work in its war effort; fine woolen knitted articles were made from the wool supplied by the Red Cross Society.\n\nUpon my recommendation last year, the amount of twenty-five dollars was allowed for a school garden, and it was a pleasure to see the success achieved so far; the sister told me how the older boys and girls were pleased when garden work began this year; every one has a task to accomplish; the work is arranged around, weeding, cultivating, watering; at the centre of the garden, a large molasses punchpan is sunk half in the ground and kept filled, so that water is at the proper temperature at watering time, rather than using cold water from the well.\n\nThe following requests were made by the sister in charge:\n\nRepairs to the sewing machine not to exceed five dollars.\n\nTen(10) single desks No.4 for the young ones (actually, many have to sit three on a desk for two)\n\nI recommend that the above requests be granted, providing funds permit.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nQuebec Inspectorate.\n26-1-11\n\nFortignac Indian Day School,\nBonaventure County, P.Q.\n\nAug. 2, 1941\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the re-opening of the academic year 1941-42, we beg leave to appeal with known generosity for the $75 which the Department generally grants in favor of the boys' manual training class of the Fortignac Indian Day School. I sincerely trust on your usual benevolence to concede us this favor.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nP. A.

Dey, Sup't. of Welfare & Housing,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the re-opening of the school year, we beg leave to renew our well-known generosity for the $5.00 which the Department generally grants in favor of the Domestic Science class. Thanking you for past favors, and trustfully hoping for the same in future.\n\nI remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Spirit.\n\nP. Art. Richard\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letters of the 2nd instant with reference to requests received from the principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School. Very careful consideration has been given to these requests but we also have to consider the amount of money available in the current year's appropriation. You may, therefore, inform the Sister Superior that the following amounts will be allowed for the academic year 1941-42:\n\n1. $40.00 to purchase material for use in the manual training class.\n\n2. $40.00 for the purchase of material for the domestic science class.\n\nThe above amounts are less than were allowed last year but are the total sum that can be allowed for the academic year 1941-42.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nOttawa, September 5, 1941.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nRE: RESTIGOUCHE AGENCY.\n\nI beg to report on my visit to the above agency during last month.\n\nSCHOOL\n\nThe school garden started this year, has proven successful; it is hoped that the interest shown by the boys and girls will be kept up at home when they leave school. The farm instructor will take charge of the garden next year and this will allow the Sister in charge more time to take up domestic work and cooking with the girls.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be most useful to teach the girls how to prepare vegetables of all kinds and other plain home cooking. However, there is no equipment for this purpose, and may I recommend that a three burner oil stove, with small oven and a few kettles be furnished; this would take up little space and would be clean, requiring no chimney connection. This training in my opinion would be most useful to future housewives, along with their training in sewing and knitting.\n\nMr. Arsenault has agreed to take charge of the boys manual training at Restigouche as well as at Marie, besides his course on proper gardening to be given to the boys and girls.\n\nJude Thibeault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nBonaventure County, P.Q.\nOct. 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nWould my desire collaborate with that of the Honorable Department of Indian Affairs if I would be looking forward for the day when the Restigouche Indian Day School would be granted a coal oil kitchen stove as a complement of the Domestic Science Course given at present?\n\nReally I can not complain! Your generosity in behalf of our school is tremendous and I would accuse myself of the deepest ingratitude if I would fail to recognize it. Yet as a final point to our organization may I humbly ask this last apparatus as a great favor for our girls. We would thus be able to teach cooking and canning for their winter supply.\n\nVery eager to receive your benevolent decision.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nRestigouche, October 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to include two letters received from the Principal of the Restigouche Indian School. The first one showing the result of the cultivation of the Indianschool garden for the first year. Really I believe it was a great success bearing in mind this land was before a swamp. For more explanations Mr Inspector Thibault examined it carefully.\n\nBy the second letter regarding the coal oil stove for the domestic science course I have to recommend it believing it is an urgent necessity for the girls to learn cookery and the canning of garden vegetables. This modern kind of coal oil stove is very safe for the fire, and moreover it will be continuously on the supervision of the Sister. Regarding the cost of this kind of stove I went, with Mr Inspector Thibault, to Campbellton but we could not find the right article and the price, but I believe there is a better chance at Ottawa to have the right cost of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nOctober 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to the second paragraph of your letter of the 22nd instant in which you recommend the purchase of a coal oil stove for use at the Restigouche Indian Day School. Before requesting the Purchasing Branch to secure this equipment it will be necessary to have more definite information regarding exactly what is required. You should let me know the number of burners and the approximate space in which the stove can be placed. I presume that you only want the stove without a warming oven.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nOttawa, November 21, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Filteau:\n\nThis letter will introduce to you Mr. A. J. Doucet, an official of the Welfare and Training Division of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMr. Doucet is at present engaged in the inspection of a number of our Indian Day Schools in the Province of Quebec. It is his intention also to visit your Department and while there to discuss a number of matters in which we are mutually interested with your officials. Any courtesy you can extend to him at the time of his visit will be very deeply appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nB. O. Filteau, Esq.,\nDepartment of Education,\nQuebec, Que.\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet of the Training Division will reach Campbellton, N.B., on the Ocean Limited at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday, November 26.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would meet him and take him to the Maria Reserve where he intends to spend two or three days.\n\nMr. Doucet has recently joined the staff of this Branch and was formerly in charge of a large vocational school in Western Canada. He will be able to discuss curriculum with the teachers of the Maria School and make certain suggestions with regard to the Department's desire to have vocational training receive proper attention.\n\nI feel certain that Mr. Doucet's visit will be conducive of much good at the Maria School and I have no doubt that the teachers will carefully consider his suggestions and make every possible effort to put them into active operation.\n\nFollowing his visit to Maria he will spend two or three days with the teachers of the Restigouche Indian Day School and his work at Restigouche will be along the same lines as at Maria. You should notify the teachers of the Restigouche School accordingly. It will not be necessary for you to advise the teachers of the Maria School as a copy of this letter is being sent to them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Arsenault:\n\nI wish to notify you that I am sending the material required for the woodworking classes to the Restigouche School and to the Maria School.\n\nAs soon as ready, I will send you a brief outline of the agriculture that could be taught to these children.\n\nAs mentioned in our interview while I was at Restigouche, I am expecting the outline of the work you are endeavouring to carry out.\n\nWishing you the best of success in this all important training you are endeavouring to impart to these children, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nMr. Edgar Arsenault,\nFarming Instructor,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nOttawa, December 22nd, 1941.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI was quite pleased with the hand work at the Restigouche School. I described the work going on with the result that this office would greatly desire a sample of the work done. The hand knit socks made from the unravelled wool from Military socks would be kept here as a sample. Whatever else you would desire to send would be returned. I refer to the articles made from Military clothing.\n\nEnclosed please find directions for the use of analytic sheets and plans.\n\nI would greatly appreciate the outline of the principles to be installed in the Parent School Association. In return I will be able to send you a sample of a method or procedure.\n\nWishing you and your staff the best regards for the Season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. J.

But newly made specimens will be forwarded to you in the near future.\n\nThe outline of the principles of our \"Indian Women Club\" is as follow. Half a day weekly, while the agriculturist, Mr. Arsenault, gives his courses. I teach sewing, spinning and knitting to the Indian Women. Having but two sewing machines, one spinning wheel and a rather small sewing room, the number of women will have to be limited to eight members.\n\nI will highly appreciate all suggestions and methods of procedure which the Honourable Staff will present me.\n\nHearty thanks for the Wood-work program and analytic plans sent.\n\nGreetings and Good Wishes for the New Year.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist\n\nIndian Affairs.

The proper procedure, I believe, would be the principle of suggestion. The principle which you have chosen to instill into your students is determined upon before each sewing meeting and this principle is instilled indirectly by suggestion. You will know better than I can tell you the principles which would be desirable on the Restigouche Reserve. I should appreciate having a list of these principles if you find it convenient. I am following this movement with great interest.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A. Doucet. I would highly appreciate your approbation and all criticism which your wide made experience has made you acquire.\n\nI am asking same for the specimens of clothes sent to the honourable Staff.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist.\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 17 1942.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nThe officials here were deeply gratified to learn that you had succeeded in making the discarded military clothing supplied you by the Department into such useful articles for the Indian population. These articles reflect great credit, not only on the pupils, but on the Sisters responsible for their instruction.\n\nI may state that this clothing was sent forward to the Minister's office and inspected by the Minister himself. He was simply delighted with the work undertaken and accomplished by you and expressed the hope that we would embrace every opportunity to extend work of this character at all our Indian day and residential schools. The Minister is definitely of the opinion that our courses of study should become increasingly more practical and vocational in character - hence his pleasure with the work accomplished by you at Restigouche.\n\nThe samples sent forward by you, with the exception of the socks, will be returned in due course.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist,\nPrincipal,\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nRestigouche, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe teaching staff of the Restigouche Indian Day School is deeply touched by the congratulations made by the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs, for the humble handiwork concocted here at school. As you stated, our aim is to develop a spirit of initiative, indispensable for a happy and proper living.\n\nWe are pleased to present to you, kind Mr. Doucet, the methods we are using in treating the discarded military socks.\n\n1. Disinfect the socks with formaldehyde, by hanging them on lines in a well closed room, placing the solution in an empty tomato can, setting the latter on a coal oil lamp, till the disinfectant is evaporated.\n\n2. Wash the socks. Here the Reverend Fathers washed them with their mechanic washer. We could have distributed the socks and have them washed by the Indian mothers, but we feared that all would not have been returned. This explains why the Reverend Fathers benevolently asked to wash them in their stead.\n\n3. Each child selects as many socks of a similar shade as she will need to knit the work assigned. Either mits, bonnets, socks or sweater.\n\n4. In general, the feet are cut off, but the legs are unravelled, starting by the bottom. Care must be taken as the grey yarn will sometimes break. The white yarn at the top of the socks is the strongest.\n\n5. For mits, bonnets and even socks. By means of a spinning wheel, we twist one ply of grey yarn with one ply of white, from the top of the unravelled socks. For a better quality, we twist one ply of very fine home spun warp yarn with either the white or grey unravelled yarn. This makes a yarn strong enough for sweaters or socks.\n\n6. We can also twist the yarn by means of a distaff of 1/4 foot, which we are forwarding to the Honourable Department. Before twisting with that apparatus, the yarn needs to be balled into a doubled ply.\n7. If two strands of the best white yarn is used, we can dye it green or any desired colours for girls' dresses.\n\n8. The only difficulties encountered are the inevitable knots.\n\nThe process may appear long, but to my personal opinion, this work is a very practical one. Each Friday afternoon there is always a demand from an Indian woman to come and twist her already prepared yarn at school, while the four women of the sewing club are at work.\n\nHeartfelt thanks for the appreciation you have so kindly made of the humble articles made at school.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nMarch 17, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have asked so much already that I feel somewhat shy to solicitate a new favor!! Knowing that you can cancel any of my unworthy demands, I confidently ask the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs, a small blackboard of 3'6\" by 4'6\", to be placed in the kitchen of the Restigouche Indian Day School. It would be to teach sewing patterns, and copy their recipes while at the cooking class.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Enchanted.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This special grant is conceded to Indian pupils attending residential schools. Have we the honour and privilege of being classed among the residential schools, and partaking the same advantages? If such be your intention; I understand that the fixed amount would be to cover the expenses of the cooking, sewing, wood-work, gardening and midday meals. Am I right?\n\nExplanations regarding this vocational programme would highly be appreciated by your teaching staff of the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sister:\n\nI am unable to understand your letter of April 7 reading, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of March 25 authorizing a grant of $10.00 per pupil for vocational training.\"\n\nI am unable to locate, on our file, any indication of authority to this effect having been issued to you and certainly it is not the intention of the Department to do so. In official letter of March 24 you were authorized to expend an amount of $10.00 for supplies for the domestic science class. This was the amount requested in your letter of March 17. The total expenditure authorized, therefore, was the amount stated and not that much per pupil.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Our intention was to return these to you immediately, but instead of doing so we sent them to British Columbia in order to give the Indian schools in that province an idea of what could be done with discarded clothing. Recently Col. Daly, the Chief Salvage Officer, has expressed a desire to see similar samples, as he wishes to use them at lectures that he gives throughout the Dominion. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you could forward, at the earliest possible date, one or two pairs of mitts, socks and sweaters made from unravelled wool.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

We had children's dresses on hand but I limited myself and sent only articles asked for.\n\nCol. Daly, the Chief Salvage Officer, might be interested to know that we are at present preparing a five-plied yarn for floor rugs. This thought was developed by the fact of having more gray yarn to dispose of than white one, and noticing that the gray yarn alone easily breaks, we concluded that rug making would be the only practical use we could make of it. I am very eager to see the effect of our first ones.\n\nA complete yarn teaching could be made if sheep industry would be introduced on the reserve, as we could twist a ply of unravelled yarn with a new one.\n\nThe interest you kindly bear in our manual work is a reward and a stimulant for all!

The boys' class is not provided and can not be furnished with the moulding machine necessary to frame them, having no electricity.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe new program of Manual Work introduced in our Indian Day Schools since the last four years had often given me apprehensions concerning the intellectual progress of our pupils.\n\nLately two Indian orphan girls who had left the Restigouche Indian Day School, with a married sister in Montreal returned for their summer vacation and brought their rank cards. The reports show that the younger one of ninety, the name of Evelyn Marchand who had left this school at the end of September, 1942 in the 3rd. Grade, entered St. Ann's Academy, Montreal in the same grade, missed two months of school Nov. and Dec., yet obtained her promotion to the 4th. Grade with 71%.\n\nHer sister Velma Marchand of 11 years of age, left us at the end of September in the 4th. Grade, entered the 4th. Grade at St. Ann's Academy, Montreal in February only, yet obtained her promotion to the 5th. Grade with 83%. This child arrived the 2nd. out of a class of 30 pupils.\n\nI was pleased of the news and I wish to communicate it to the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs to show that the development of Manual Work does not check the intellectual progress.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist, r.h.r.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nRestigouche, N.B.,\nSept. 27, 1943.\n\nKind Mr. Richard,\n\nMr. A.J.

Q.\nOct. 26, 1943.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the requisition form of August 8, 1943, the Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School had asked the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs for the habitual grant of $200. to buy the necessary material to dress the orphans and most needy pupils of the school for the winter season. Generally the amount varied from $150. to $175. annually. This year due to the raised prices in dress goods I have asked $11. more, but I do not dare to open the said account since that special item, when the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs returned it to Mr. A.J. Doucet, Inspector, who was then here, that item I say was followed by a question mark. Kind Mr. Doucet made inquiries on how I intended to use that grant and I am under the impression that he considered my demand reasonable.

We are allowing the Restigouche School much more in proportion than we do other schools and it will simply be impossible for the Department to consider increasing the amounts stated above.\n\nThe sewing machines may be repaired at a cost not exceeding $8 and the knitting machines may also be repaired at a cost of $8.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,-\n\nWould the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs benevolently grant for the Domestic Science and Women's sewing Clubs of the Restigouche Indian Day School the discarded military clothes asked on the Requisition for School Material forms?\n\nKindly do not forward more than the amount stated as I have no room to store same. We have enough discarded military socks, heavy coats and jackets for the year. We presently stand in need of aviator shirts for the making of shirts and dresses, also navy pants for snow suits and flannel underwears for underwears.\n\nI would suggest that you please address this order to the Restigouche Indian Day School to facilitate the delivery.\n\nThe Women's sewing Clubs started in 1941 numbered to five members now count twenty four regular ones, grouped in three sections. They are doing good.\n\nThe two second handed tailor sewing machines sent in September are not yet repaired. I asked the manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Co. of Campbellton N.B. to repair them on their arrival. He was unable to do so. He immediately sent them to the manufacture where they are detained since.

For your information I may say that discarded military clothing is no longer being given to us free of charge. We have to purchase all such material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche, Que.\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th instant I do not quite understand if it is your intention to send only letters for sewing purposes, to the Restigouche Indian Day School; the discarded military clothes requested on the 16th, or if it is your intention to definitely quit forwarding the said clothing.\n\nI was aware that the discarded military clothes was not given to the Honourable Department free of charge as late Dr. A. Richard once stated, \"This last car load of military clothes arrived for the three reserves amounts to $700.\"\n\nI admit that such manual teaching is costly and if it is the desire of the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs to close the Indian Women's sewing Clubs I think I could slowly do so without arousing complains. The $200, benevolently granted for the purchase of yarn, lining and heavy material to match with the discarded military clothing, I have tried not to spend more than $20. each month so as to have enough for the season. In spite of my extreme care to remain in the limits of $20. a month, I surprise myself many a times to exceed the expenses in this is with the discarded military clothing. If the second hand clothes is cancelled what will make them work with? If it is your desire, I am ready to close the women's sewing clubs as soon as you express such a wish.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister M.of the Holy Eucharist r.s.r.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 4, 1945.\n\nRev. Sister M. of the Holy Eucharist, Principal,\nRestigouche Indian Day School, Restigouche, Quebec.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant, I wish to say that it is not our intention to discontinue the Indian Women's Sewing Club, as long as the women are making good use of the services available. I wish, however, to point out that in order that these services may be more appreciated a certain amount of sacrifice must be made by the Indians themselves. I wish to suggest here, that there might be a possibility of some members of the club bringing in their own sewing material or at least a part of it. I know that this has been done to some extent but I am wondering if it could not be increased.\n\nThe material which you require according to the samples sent in in your letter of December 16th is not available. The underwear have all been distributed. There is a possibility that we might be able to procure some later.\n\nThe shirts that have been sent in 1941 were not used but shirts that were unsatisfactory through shrinkage, etc. This material, of course, is not available. There is, however, a possibility that used shirts may be obtained at a later date.\n\nWe are making a check-up and if any of this material should be available, we will be pleased to forward some to you.\nI do not know whether or not the Agent has anything left from our last shipment. If so, you may ask him to turn over to you what you find suitable.\n\nAs regards the yarn and lining for which $200.00 has already been granted, I wish to know how much more money you would require to finish this year's work. It is unnecessary to state that this amount should be kept at the minimum.\n\nThere is another plan that might interest you, which has been in use at several other centres. We require skirts and windbreakers in the three sizes; small, medium and large. If the members of your sewing club are willing to make these we will pay them providing the price is fair. These articles would be made from new material which would be furnished from this office. We will pay the members of the club in kind, that is, by means of household goods and not in cash. The reason for this is obvious.\n\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience the cost of labour for the making of the skirts and the cost of labour for the making of the windbreakers. We will be able to decide then, if it will be worthwhile to have these articles made by the Restigouche sewing club.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nRestigouche, P.Q. Jan.13,1945.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant I wish to inform the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs that Mr. Arsenault, Acting Indian Agent, (whom we would wish would be permanently named Indian Agent,) has nothing left from your last shipment.\n\nConcerning the amount of money necessary to finish the year. If you would kindly grant $50, I would do my utmost to stay in such limits.\n\nThe proposed plan of confectioning skirts and windbreaker greatly interested the members of the Restigouche Indian Day School sewing club. After having discussed with each member as regards to the cost/labour we see ourselves impossible to set a definite price before we know the style, the heaviness of the material etc. used to make those articles.\n\nCould you forward us a sample of a skirt and windbreaker as you desire, with the material. Then I feel that we will give you satisfaction as to the fairness of the price. Could you give me an idea of how much you could give for the sewing, I could not doubt make them accept same.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, r.s.r.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 17, 1945.\n\nRev.

Yesterday I was warned by a letter, \"In order to make the two machines in a first class working condition, it will cost you $40.00 or $41.00, in two weeks' time!\n\nWill the Honourable Staff wish to have them repaired?

These biscuits are made and stocked at London, but the season is now so far advanced that it will be difficult for you to purchase and deliver a supply to us in Montreal in time to be forwarded by our scows to James Bay. However, if you wish to place the matter with us and will wire us on receipt of this letter, we will get into touch with the manufacture, or his agent, and do our best to get immediate delivery.\n\nWe understand the present price is about twelve cents per lb., and it will cost you for transportation from Montreal to Rupert another twelve cents per lb., on the gross weight.\n\nIf it is your intention to proceed in the matter, we would ask you to comply with our request and send us a wire, as this is the only way that delivery can be secured in time.

Mr. Brett at Rupert's House, James Bay. Our freight charges from Montreal to Rupert have been added, and we look forward to receiving the Department's cheque to cover our invoice in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nREVILLON FRERES TRADING CO. LIMITED.\n\nSecretary-Treasurer.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, August 16, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI re-inclose herewith accounts which you submitted recently for supplies received at Rupert's House Mission. Before the question of the payment of these accounts can be considered it will be necessary for the said accounts to be supported by receipts for all charges made for cash, and purchases which were made from merchants should be supported by their receipted accounts.\n\nAs Messrs. Revillon Freres were paid by the Department for freighting supplies sent to the Mission, it is not understood why you should make request for payment of freight charges on drugs shipped from Montreal to Rupert's House.\n\nI may add that accounts for expenditure incurred should be presented to the Department within the year in which the said expenditure was made. There are in the accounts above mentioned charges for expenses incurred during 1919, 1920 and 1921, and the appropriations which Parliament made for those years have lapsed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of December 15th, last, I beg to say that we are arranging with the Revillon Freres Trading Company, Montreal, to supply and have transported in the spring the 5 boxes of biscuits required for the use of the children attending the Rupert's House Indian Day School. We hope that this firm will be able to supply and forward this quantity of biscuits, the same as was done last year.\n\nWe are ordering a football which will be sent you at a later date by mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. C. Brett,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nRupert's House, James Bay,\nVia Mattice, Ont.\nOTTAWA, January 11, 1923.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to deliver to Room 502, Booth Building, 1 football, complete, for the use of the Rupert's House Indian Day School. This football should be supplied at the price usually charged this Department.\n\nYou will be good enough, also, to send your account in duplicate covering the cost of the football.\n\nYour early attention to this order will oblige,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Ketchum & Co.,\nSparks St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, January 11, 1923.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nLast March you were good enough to supply and have transported for the use of the Rupert's House Indian Day School a quantity of hard tack biscuits. The Rev. C. C. Brett, teacher of this school, again requests to be supplied with 5 boxes for the Indian children attending the school.\n\nI will be pleased, therefore, to be informed as to whether you can supply and arrange to have forwarded by your scows to James Bay this coming spring the 5 boxes of hard tack biscuits required. We will pay the cost of the biscuits and freight from Montreal to Rupert's House upon receipt of your account covering the cost. I may say that any make of hard tack biscuits of a good quality would be satisfactory to fill this order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs.

These biscuits will cost you 11\u00a2 per lb. in Montreal and will be shipped to the Rev. C. C. Brett, Rupert's House. As soon as they are packed and the cases weighed we shall send you invoice covering the cost of the biscuits and freight to Rupert's House.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nREVILLON FRERES TRADING CO.

The allowance for developing school was made for a month on account of the raising of cattle, but now since June or July it has been made the straight 52 months for supplies and scrubbing and they provide their own fuel.\n\nSigned\n\n(Rv.)

The question of the payment of this account cannot be considered until it is rendered so as to show details of all charges made therein. I may add that there should not be any charges in the account except those in connection with the above mentioned school. Receipts or receipted accounts should be attached for payments made to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Audit Office would not pass this account in its present form.\n\nI am, sir,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAest.

Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 17th instant, enclosing accounts in duplicate covering the amount paid the Hudson's Bay Company and Levillon firm for goods furnished on the teacher's order and for supplies for the use of the Rupert's House Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for $243.96 is being sent you today, which covers payment to December 31, 1922. In connection with these accounts, I have to state that, owing to the delay and difficulty in obtaining proper vouchers, it is considered advisable to make other arrangements for the payment of sweeping and scrubbing and the cutting and splitting of firewood at this school. Therefore, instead of the teacher issuing orders to the above firms for goods in payment of this work, the Department will allow the sum of $20 per annum from the beginning of the present fiscal year, viz., the first of April, last, for the janitor's services, which will include sweeping, scrubbing and cleaning the school.\n\nWe will also allow an expenditure not to exceed $70 for the providing of fuel, as well as sawing and splitting the same. It may be necessary for the teacher to continue the issuing of orders in payment of any work performed for the above purpose, but this Department will only reimburse you to the amount mentioned, which, it is considered, should be ample to cover the cost of these services. You may settle with the firms who supply any goods and you will be reimbursed to the above extent. As rental is paid for the use of the building, it is considered that there should be no charge made for any material purchased for repairs, etc.\n\nIt is thought that the above arrangement would be the most satisfactory and overcome the difficulty and delay in the receipt of proper vouchers and accounts. I shall be pleased if you will inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev.

The school returns show that the school is being continuously conducted.\n\nYour last cheque of $52.45 paid in August 1923 covered Revillon's school account to March 31st, 1923 and your cheque of $243.18 covered payment to Dec. 31st, 1922. Since that time I received the attached receipt of H.B.C., which covers the period from Dec. 31st, 1922 to May 31st, 1923. At least part of this amount of $48.00 is due to March 31st, 1923, which I shall be glad to receive in addition to the $155.00 claimed above, as per agreement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have been informed that the missionaries from Fort George, Rupert's House have been out for the winter and have no doubt according to custom appointed substitutes to carry on the schools in their absence.\n\nThe school year is drawing near its close, and I remind you per 72-2-5 and yours of April 1st, 1843, that the allowance present, fuel and caretaking of the Rupert's House school for the year ending April 1st, 1843, amounting to \u00a3155 (55 per cent) will be paid, received in due course. I attach copies of the last accounts from R.R.C. and Missionaries showing the cost of maintenance without rent.\n\nSimilar accounts from the Fort Hope and Albany schools will be sent to you between now and March. The amount is usually about \u00a3108 or \u00a3112 each. I notice that we did not claim rent and fuel allowance or for the Fort George school for 1842 and 1843 and 1844.\n\nThere was an overstatement of the teacher and I did not notice the omission myself. I am willing to accept \u00a3250 by Dec. 31st, 1843 (6 months in 1843) in regard to the above, so without continued statement from the teacher, you have had the utmost kindness.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The grant for these services is allowed at the same rate as is paid at Fort Hope and Albany Mission Schools. The Auditor General will make exceptions to payments dating back to a period exceeding two years. The amount of $10 is, therefore, being allowed for rent, fuel and janitor service at the Fort George School for two years to December 31st, 1924.\n\nCheques for the above amounts will be sent you in due course. I shall be pleased if, in future, Your Lordship will make allowance for these grants for each of the schools mentioned not later than the beginning of March in each year.\n\nAt Rev. J. C. Anderson,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nAs -\nAs all the above buildings are the property of the Church, we should not be called upon to pay for any repairs or other incidental expenses.

Having been one of the native residences, its ceiling is low, its lighting poor and I fear that, in other respects, it is not conducive to the health of the Indian pupils. The regular school building which was vacated over a year ago is much more suitable although its lighting needs to be improved and its interior and exterior painted. I should like to see it placed on dry ground, painted and its lighting altered. The need for this is apparent and I would be very glad if the Department could assist in making these desirable changes possible. Nothing requires to be purchased with the exception of paint, putty and nails, all of which could be obtained here.\n\nWould you kindly tell me what the Department would be willing to do, and then we could talk about the details more fully.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLouis A.

Being small, it provided the barest living\nwants in the case of the large families.\n\nThe school was built in 1900. It can scarcely be wondered at that\nthe foundation was so rotten, resting as it has done on boggy land\nfor some thirty years.\n\nAs the entire under portion required renewing, the building was torn\ndown and moved to a higher and dryer location. In the course of\nrebuilding a completely new foundation and sleepers were provided.\nThis entailed the cutting and hauling of some sixteen logs. The outer\nsiding was found to be badly weathered and warped, as well as rotten at\nthe base, so that it could not be painted without considerable waste of\npaint, time and effort. Accordingly a great portion of this has had to\nbe supplied. This entailed some more logs which are still being converted\ninto boards by means of the pit-saw.\n\nSome lumber has had to be taken from the old building which is being\nused as the school.\n\nThe Mission has supplied the roofing.\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Tyner,\nNoose Factory, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Tyner:\n\nI commenced work on the Day School. It seemed a bit early, but there was no alternative. Living conditions came to such a pass for some of these Indians that something had to be done right away.\n\nThe canoe building are on the job and it looks that they will do a very good job.\n\nI noted the P.S. in your letter to the effect that you did not see why the school need be moved. My reason for suggesting removal is as follows:\n\nThe present site is boggy and, to my mind, most unsuitable as school grounds. Attempts had been made to drain it, but the place was almost impassable all last summer. Examination of the foundation showed that it had rotted badly, doubtless owing to the dampness of the area. To repair the building and leave it on such a spot was, to my mind, a waste of time, money and effort.\n\nThe present seems most opportune for this useful work. Labour is cheap. Indians want the work. It is far better, I think, for them to accomplish something while they are being supported, and they will have to be supported somehow. They generally ask for work here rather than a handout, which is a very good thing.\n\nApart from the school work there seems to be nothing in sight here. I have heard nothing definite about the canoe building.\n\nSo I am proceeding with the school work according to plan.\n\nLast year I believe you said that you would send up some biscuits for the school children. We did not receive them. If it is possible to get them, by all means do so. I know that some of these children sometimes come to school without breakfast. Most of them can't afford an extra little.\n\nI enclose some Vital Statistics.\n\nWith all good wishes to you and yours,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. W. L. Tyre, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, via Moosonee, Ont.\nMemorandum for file:\n\nFrom time to time during the past few years Rt. Rev. J.G. Anderson, D.D., Bishop of Moosonee, has requested us to pay rent for the building used for school purposes at Rupert's House.\n\nThe voucher on file indicates that the last payment made to the Bishop was for the year ended December 31, 1937.\n\nIt should be noted that if he applies for rent for this building in future he should be informed that in view of the heavy expenditure made on this building during the summer of 1939 the Department is not prepared to allow any rent for it in future.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI still think that your letter of Jan. 26th, 1936\u2014No. 78-2-5\u2014gave me authority to have this work done on behalf of the Indians, the material not to exceed $50.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Orford,\nMoose Factory.\n\nDear Dr. Orford:\n\nI have once or twice this winter experimented with a hot meal served to our school children, and am hoping to secure sufficient co-operation from the Dept. to make this a more or less permanent arrangement. Last year the school boys planted a few potatoes, and we used these plus a little meat, etc., I supplied. This year with some of the seed you so kindly sent I hope to grow a lot more, although I have to get everything done by hand as our plough was taken away for Moose.\n\nIf I could get a couple of dollars a week for a woman to cook the meals, plus some salt pork or other meat, and some vegetables, I could try it for a time. Some tin plates and spoons and a cook pot would also help. There is a cottage here we use as a dispensary and office, which should be perfect for the job. Also, if I were given some small vegetable seeds too we could in time provide most of our needs. Some fish might be bought in summer but Moose is out as our people do not get enough for their needs.\n\nWhen Mr. Watt of the H. B. Company was in Ottawa he spoke to Mr. Hoey whom I understand gave some encouragement to the idea. You will not mind my saying that our Rupert's Indians are not as resourceful as some of the 'Beaver enthusiasts' make them out to be. Last year they received ten dollars less for their beaver than Moose Indians, and the cost of food here is just about three times that at Moose. We missed the biscuits usually supplied by the Dept., and if these could be sent again it would be a godsend. The Indians who remain in the village all winter get no beaver allowance and need what help we can give as the children definitely come to school hungry. In summer the bulk of the people have spent their credit by the end of June and are a hungry bunch too.\n\nI shall be so grateful for any help you can give and to know your reaction to the suggestion of a meal served, say, at noon each day.\n\nWith cordial wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.)

H. Marshall, missionary, and teacher in charge of the Rupert's House Indian Day School.\n\nThe officials here are somewhat disposed to be a little more liberal in our allowances for noonday lunches at Indian day schools, despite the limited funds at our disposal. We are of the opinion that by serving a fairly substantial noonday lunch the attendance at a number of our schools might be greatly improved.\n\nWe are definitely opposed, however, to an allowance to an Indian woman or to any other person for the preparation of these meals. These meals should be simple and should be prepared by the senior pupils, under the direction of the teacher. If additional assistance is required, it should be secured on a voluntary basis. Surely the time has not arrived when we must provide education, medical care and relief to Indians and pay for the cooking of the meals as well. I cannot think of anything more demoralizing than a policy such as this, if adopted at Indian day schools.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult for the officials here to determine what allowance should be made at a particular school. A great deal depends upon local conditions. If a garden is cultivated at or adjoining that school, the vegetables produced tend to keep down the cost of the noonday meal. You might, in cooperation with the teacher, outline for us what you would consider to be a simple noonday lunch, together with an estimate of the cost of this lunch. If you do this, I can assure you the request will be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. T. J.

Attached is a requisition for other seeds which I believe he can quite easily cultivate near the school.\n\nIt may be possible to obtain ducks, geese and fish and also some beaver meat for the meat part of the meal and I will discuss this with Mr. Marshall when I reach Rupert's House this summer. He could hire a few Indians to do the hunting and could purchase shells and eat at the Hudson's Bay Post Store as required. I could transfer a few of the kegs on hand here to him for this purpose.\n\nI am quite in agreement with the idea you expressed of using the pupils to prepare the meals. The Indians look to the Department for entirely too much assistance and have come not only to expect it but demand it and I have been doing all I can to discourage them in this belief.\n\nI suppose it will be in order to purchase a few utensils for the school as Mr. Marshall suggests.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.A.

We have been informed also that it is impossible to secure desks with steel or metal fittings. It might be possible to secure a number of desks constructed wholly of wood.\n\nI should like to learn from you just how urgently needed the desks are at Rupert's House. A few days ago I received a letter from God's Lake in which the Indian Agent sought permission to purchase the lumber necessary for the construction of 12 double desks at the God's Lake School. If similar permission were granted to you, or to Mr. Marshall, would it be possible to have desks constructed at Rupert's House or at Moose Factory? I am anxious to hear from you again in respect to this matter.\n\nThis applies also to the request received by you from the Missionary at Albany.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Therefore, in order that there may be no delay, I believe that it is important that the Department should now take the necessary steps to secure the services of this second teacher.\n\nThe present teacher is the Rev. Sister Marie Josephine of the Community of Grey Nuns of the Cross, whose mother house is in Ottawa. She teaches excellently and is very much loved by the Indians and they will be very glad to have another Sister from that Community as second teacher.\n\nI believe that in order to secure the services of a second teacher as competent as the first it will be necessary to pay her as high a salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.C. Comire,\nAgent.\nA new schoolhouse is being built for the Roman Catholic Indians of St Francis out of the funds of their Band, which will be ready for occupation after the summer holidays. As the building is laid out for two class-rooms and the attendance is more than sufficient to justify the employment of a second teacher, whom I may say was promised them if they paid for the building, the Agent asks to be allowed to take the necessary steps to secure the services of a second teacher. The school is under the charge of the Grey Nuns and it is proposed to employ another sister of that community. The amount at present paid is $290.00 and I think $250.00 would be a fair remuneration for an assistant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In fact, in a model school there should be three teachers for seventy-five scholars.\n\nTherefore, it is my duty to recommend the engagement of a third teacher for next year. If the progress last year was so remarkable, it was due to the assistance that Rev. Mr. Woods gave the other teachers. Rev. Mr. Woods is especially adapted to give the other teachers the assistance they require. Protestant scholars attended the institution last year, and, if all the money given for the education of Indian children was proportionately distributed according to the number of scholars, they would come to the R.C. school a sum of money sufficient to pay for the services of their teacher.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nJ.E.

It is conducted by the Grey Nuns, who have a convent on the reserve, with three teaching Sisters.\n\nThey are now in receipt of a grant of $550 a year, but the enrolment would hardly justify the employment of three teachers. Most of the instruction is in French, but Sister Wood, the Superior, teaches the English classes, including those who take the commercial course. She told me that she thought she should receive some remuneration, and I think the Department might recognize the good work done at this school by increasing the grant now allowed the teachers. It all goes into the same fund and it would be quite satisfactory to the Superior of the Convent if they got it in that way.\n\nIn a memorandum I prepared for the Accountant in connection with the school estimates, I suggested that, if possible, a larger salary grant should be provided for this school, and pointed out that the title of the Indians to the reserve at Pierreville and St. Francis is dependent on the maintenance of the Catholic mission there and that the only way it can be maintained is by supplying sufficient funds to carry it on.\nOttawa, December 12, 1905.\n\nThe Accountant:\n\nCan the sum of $5 be spared for the purchase of Christmas presents for the children of the Roman Catholic school at Pierreville.\n\nSister Woods, in charge, asks for presents of a religious character.

Shortly after he commenced there Sister Woods, the Principal of the school, wrote me privately asking if the Department would assist this boy in qualifying himself for becoming a mechanical engineer by providing him with a course in the International Correspondence Schools.\n\nI told the Sister that I thought it would be better to wait some time to see how the young man was progressing before urging this matter. She wrote me again on November 28, last, on his behalf, and I then communicated with Mr. Desbarats, Director of the Shipyard, asking him to be good enough to let me have a report on this boy. His reply is on file, and you will see from it that the foreman reports that he is a bright lad, very steady at his work, painstaking and obliging, but that he has no mechanical ideas, having absolutely no experience in that line of work but gives promise of doing well. Mr. Desbarats states that a Shop Practice course in the International Correspondence Schools would be an excellent thing for him, if he knows enough English to follow it and that the Department would be well advised in helping him to take such a course.\n\nI sent a copy of Mr. Desbarat's report to Sister Woods and asked her to inform me whether he has sufficient knowledge of English to follow the course. She replies that he has and that, as he was so anxious to begin, his\nbrother signed the contract and paid the first installment but now he is laid up and threatened with hemorrhage of the lungs; consequently he will be unable to keep up the monthly payments. The shop practice course, five divisions, which Mr. Desbarats recommends he should take, will cost in the neighborhood of $80, payable by monthly installments of $5 each. As this boy appears to be ambitious to perfect himself in his trade and is apprenticed at the Works, I think the Department would be quite justified, if funds are available, in stretching a point to enable him to pursue his studies in the correspondence schools. It is admitted that this method of teaching is most beneficial to pupils who are anxious to learn as everything depends on their own exertions.\n\nI would only recommend that the Department should pay the installments so long as he continues to work assiduously on the course, and I am sure that Mr. Desbarats, who appears to be interested in the boy's advancement, would not object to sending in reports from time to time, showing the progress made by him. The Department would be under no obligation to the Schools; it would merely provide the monthly installments so long as it was deemed advisable. It is so seldom that we have an Indian boy who shows sufficient energy to advance himself that I consider that the Department might fairly come to his assistance. Of course his present wages are hardly sufficient to pay his board, without providing him with clothing. They are only $3 per week, while good wholesome board costs $5.50 per week in Sorel, the balance having to be made up by his friends.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is intended to strengthen these by placing additional joists between each pair now in position and also placing posts to further strengthen beams now supporting floors. For this purpose a grant has been made by the Council of the Abenakis band.\n\nThe school apart from the building is a good and successful one, under able management as evinced by the thorough and efficient work of the pupils which I had the pleasure of witnessing in a recent examination during my visit to this reserve, especially as they are compelled to hold their classes under very considerable difficulties, in badly arranged rooms.\none of the school rooms being an old laundry addition to the kitchen which has been adapted for class use and is not at all suitable for the purpose.\n\nEffective results are not to be expected except under reasonably good conditions and to get the best results from the capable Principal and staff in charge there welllighted and ventilated class rooms are required.\n\nTo provide suitable school accommodation it will be necessary to erect an addition containing modern class rooms more strongly built and provided with heating and ventilation.\n\nThe cost of erecting a suitable addition having two class rooms on the ground floor and the same floor space in one large room on the floor above, built in a substantial way on concrete foundation will cost about Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00).\n\nI would recommend that providing the Department views favorably the school need for more suitable class rooms that the Bands grant of $500.00 for repairs should instead be expended on the new building and all conveniences for heating and ventilation provided in the new wing instead of expending the amount on walls and joists etc., in the old building. The necessary strengthening can then be made to the old foundation and joists by placing under them beams and posts; these obstructions would not then interfere with the furnace etc., providing these were arranged for in the new addition.\n\nThe cost of strengthening the old building in this way would be nominal in comparison with the system proposed.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, June 12th., 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to request that you will proceed to Pierreville as soon as possible and enquire into various matters in connection with the proposal to erect an addition and make improvements to the present school building. When he was recently in the Department Chief White made a suggestion which might lead to the purchase of lumber at a reduced rate. You should enquire carefully into the Chief's suggestion, and if possible obtain an option on the lumber or suggest some other arrangement for taking advantage of the reduced rates. You should also enquire into the ownership of the land on which the addition to the school building must be erected. This of course should be vested in the Band before the Department erects any building. You should also enquire into the possibility of making a contract for the labour only, if the Department decides to buy the material. You should enquire whether there are skilled mechanics either on the Reserve or in its vicinity who could undertake this work; what the current rate of wages are; and the possibility of obtaining other necessary material on the ground.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Above all, I ask you for instructions in this matter. There is a widower among us in the family and he remarried some years ago a woman who is not worthy of having the bringing up and care of the children of her husband for reasons sufficiently serious, but I do not wish to go into details before having proper instructions necessary in regard to this question. But one thing that I can tell you is that we have had a solemn declaration from these children made before the missionary, J. Desonzague, so serious that we have decided to do all that is possible to arrange about these unfortunate children.\n\nSo we await a reply addressed personally to Louis P. Obomsawin, councillor.\n\nPlease send me the last report and also a copy of the plans of the two reserves that have been surveyed this summer. From your humble ward\n\nLouis P.

Scott.\nOttawa, April 29, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 5th instant in which you ask for the salary of a musician in connection with the work at the St. Joseph's Academy I beg to say that, as the Department is now paying salaries aggregating $1,000.00 to three teachers at this institution, it cannot at the present time consent to increase this grant, which, taking the average attendance into consideration, must be considered a very reasonable allowance.\n\nI should be pleased to know whether at the present time there is a teacher whose time is devoted wholly to the teaching of music or whether this tuition is given by one of the three teachers at present drawing a salary from the Department and also whether, if there is a teacher whose services are devoted to this work, what time each day is given to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. Sister St. Albert,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nSuperior,\nSt. Joseph's Academy,\nPierreville, Que.\nSir,\n\nI have just received complaints from the teachers of our two schools in the Abenakis village in the matter of the attendance of the children.\n\nWith the fine weather that we are having the little Indians leave school to amuse themselves in running in the woods or along the rivers to fish there. So we should like to take such means as you may suggest to constrain them to attend class. For that purpose I have given an order to our two constables to go to the schools and warn the children to attend regularly or that they would arrest them; but I believe that the Department would be able itself to appoint constables for this duty. These young Indians are also in the habit of running in the streets until 9 or 10 p.m. Cannot the Department order that a regulation be passed to compel the children to go home at the hour mentioned in the regulation?\n\nI may mention a case that is not new because you have already spoken of it in several letters to Sister Woods last year; it is the case of the young son of Edwin Benedict. This boy (fourteen years old) has just left school and he ill treats the other little Indians and insults grown-up persons the same way as the children, which is not good; and if he is not placed in some house where his character may be changed, he will be very bad before long. It is desired that he should be placed in an industrial school. It seems to me that the Department did decide that; but when it was intended to take him to that school he disappeared and hid himself.

Une le beau temps que nous avons, les petits sauvages quittent l'\u00e9cole pour s'amuser \u00e0 courir dans les bois ou le long des rivi\u00e8res pour y faire la p\u00eache. Alors on voudrait prendre les moyens que vous nous sugg\u00e9rez pour les contraindre \u00e0 assister aux classes.\n\nPour cela j'ai donn\u00e9 ordre \u00e0 nos deux constables de se rendre sur place et d'exercer les enfants d'arr\u00eater imm\u00e9diatement ou qu'on les arr\u00eate, mais je crois que le D\u00e9partement pourrait faire lui-m\u00eame la nomination des constables pour cette t\u00e2che.\n\nLes petits sauvages ont aussi l'habitude de courir dans les rues jusqu'\u00e0 neuf et dix heures du soir. Selon que le D\u00e9partement ne fait pas ordre qu'on repousse soit plus loin afin d'obliger les enfants \u00e0 rester chez eux \u00e0 cet \u00e2ge, parce que le r\u00e8glement mentionne que nous avons parl\u00e9 d'un cas qui n'est pas nouveau parce que nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu plusieurs correspondances avec le directeur de la ville. L'an dernier, c'est le cas de la jeune fille de Edward Benedict, et nous gar\u00e7ons (nom) vient de quitter l'\u00e9cole et maltraiter les autres petits sauvages, insulte les grands personnes comme les enfants de ville, que c'est rien de bon et s'il n'est pas dans une maison o\u00f9 l'on peut \u00e9duquer son caract\u00e8re, ce sera un bien mauvais reflet avant longtemps. On aurait pu \u00eatre inform\u00e9 dans une \u00e9cole industrielle. Il me semble que le D\u00e9partement avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cela, mais lorsqu'on a voulu le confirmer, \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole, il \u00e9tait trop tard, il est donc cach\u00e9. Si il y a de la place dans ces \u00e9coles, donnez nous la permission ou demandez encore une fois l'autorisation de la conduire. Votre tr\u00e8s respectueusement,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, our community wishes to write to give to the Church his tribe one of our best music classes and he is not unmindful.\n\nWe have twenty pupils for piano, mandolin, viola, and organ studies who require twenty-three hours of teaching; two or three hours of singing, reciting and practice of the orchestra each week. At the present price of two dollars a month, we could hire four.\na few and we do not receive even $200. Many of the families, as in the Indians habit, do not pay. We would be sorry to be obliged to put the music aside; for it is a great means to civilization among them. We present you with this and we beg you to consider in the most favorable light. The superior of this convent, born in the village of Pictonville, has assured you that since there is a missionary among them, and also since they have religion in the tribe, a great change must necessarily result.\n\nTwenty-five or thirty years ago, when the Indians returned from the United States, we have during every week the painful sight of drunkenness, vice and immorality. Today we do not see these things. At their arrival they come to us to be members of the singing choir or to be members of the orchestra, and the parents want music for their children. Are we going to refuse them?

Maclean, Chief Inspector,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your favour of the 27th, I have the honor to inform you that we have a music teacher especially for teaching of music. We have engaged Miss Anna Smith, who teaches twenty-three pupils of all grades, who require twenty-three hours of teaching, two hours of religious exercises, and two hours extra for the orchestra; that makes an average of more than five hours of work every day.\n\nMiss Anna Smith has just received her diploma of Musical College of Canada, Montreal, and Miss Alice...\nOur Community makes the sacrifice of having her one of her best teachers for such a small number of children and we would not be remunerated. We cannot treat the Indians as they do not pay. We would be sorry to be obliged to put much aside for it is a great means of civilization among them. We present worth for looking out to engage them selves in the most spirited sights.\n\nTwenty five or thirty years ago when the Indians returned from the United States, we had during many weeks the painful sight of drunkenness, pray etc... Today we do not see those things. At their arrival they come to us to be members of the singing choir, or to be members of the orchestra, and the parents beg more for their children.\n\nAre we going to refuse them? As we need also to be remunerated for our work, we will be in the necessity of sending the musician to a greater center where we will be sure to be well paid. I leave to you and to the authority to judge this matter, and please use all your influence to obtain a salary for the music teacher.\nThe Department finds that the teachers' salary is already too high, seeing the small number of pupils, but take in consideration please, that we have pupils from the first grade to sixth grade. The first class has 15 pupils, the second 20 pupils, the third 30 pupils, etc., etc.\n\nSince Easter the first class teacher gives one hour extra to six pupils who are preparing themselves to pass the examination of the Civil Service. The pupils are not very numerous, it is true, but we have to do the same work in each grade, as if they were great numbers.\n\nDear Sir, please excuse me to call your attention once more on the furniture for the Superior's Office. May be the Department finds it too high, but Community finds the same and would not allow me to make the expense. I have a good idea! Will you furnish a part of it, and I will pay the balance.\n\nLooking to read you soon,\n\nTrusting, Dear Sir,\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In your letter of May 15, No.152,859-1 you asked me whether it would not be possible to place him in an industrial school in the province of Quebec. The fact of striking a child of five years of age with a club, and that without any reason, might perhaps be a sufficiently serious reason for his being sentenced to a reformatory and being kept there for some years.

J. Claude parce qu'il a fait un testament par lequel il donnait sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un Ab\u00e9naki (Joseph Collet Ab\u00e9naki). Je dois vous dire que Mme Claude a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au commissaire qu'elle se souvenait encore en possession de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nNous savons que sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est voisine de celle de la famille de l'Acad\u00e9mie St. Joseph. Nous savons aussi que l'institutrice de cette \u00e9cole, Mme Bellmont, dans son dernier rapport recommandait de voir \u00e0 l'examen de la cour des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ; alors je crois qu'il serait temps de s'occuper \u00e0 prendre les mesures pour assurer la possession de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nMme Claude est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 84 ans et elle est actuellement malade.

I beg to say that Mrs. Glaude has destroyed or cancelled this will, and she has again come into possession of her property.\n\nYou are aware that her property is adjoining, that is to say that it touches the lands of the St. Joseph's Academy. You know also that the school inspector, Mr. Belcourt, in his last report recommended the enlargement of the playground; so I believe that it is time to take steps to assure the possession of this property.\n\nMrs. Glaude is 84 years of age, and she is ill at present. She is asking for assistance. I consider that she ought to have $1.50 a week, because she is alone, and unable to do anything; at present she is in the charge of Chief Nicola. The latter is disposed to make an effort to help Mrs. Glaude to sell her property to the Department, and I believe he will succeed. If the Department intends purchasing this land, I should like to know it in order not to take trouble for nothing. I believe that this land can be bought for $200.00. The amount could be applied on account of board, and at death the balance, if any remain, could be paid to whatever person to whom she may make a deed of sale. Advise me of your intentions, and I will see to making arrangements with the old woman Mrs. Glaude.\nIn the meantime will you kindly grant her the assistance that she asks for, which will make her more inclined to come to terms.\n\nYours, etc.,\nJoseph Cot\u00e9\nAgent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. Agent Cote, Pierreville, writes the Department for relief for Mrs. Glaude who is 84 years old. He recommends that she be allowed $1.50 a week as she is unable to make her living owing to her advanced age.\n\nMrs. Glaude is the owner of a piece of property adjoining the Roman Catholic school at Pierreville and it would be advantageous to obtain her land in order to extend the grounds around the school. The Department has had this matter under consideration for sometime and is anxious to secure the land, but, owing to Mrs. Glaude's absence in the States, has been unable to do so. The Agent suggests that the Department purchase her lot at $200.00, which is a reasonable price, and this would be the means of killing two birds with one stone. It would give the school grounds this extension and provide means of support for Mrs. Glaude. I would, therefore, recommend that this lot be purchased.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This will was made yesterday. Mr. Nicola Paradis told me today that Mrs. Claude's property will belong to him as soon as she dies, and that this will was made in order that this property might be handed over for the use of St. Joseph's Academy as soon as he should come into possession of it. He is ready to sign a writing to that effect.\n\nMr. Paradis asks the Department to make him an allowance of $2.00 a week, or $8.00 a month, in order to assist him in supplying Mrs. Claude with what she may need, the amount to be applied on account of the $200, the amount allowed for the property.\n\nMrs. Claude is alone in her house and she wishes to die there, which will make it necessary for chief Paradis to keep the house warm and to let one of his daughters take care of her.\n\nA reply on the subject of the assistance asked for by the chief will oblige.\n\nYours, etc.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, 13th November, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the case of Mrs. [illegible] who is being cared for by Nicola Panadis to whom she has willed her property, with a view to having it transferred to the St. Joseph's Academy; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your furnishing Panadis with relief supplies to the value of $2.00 a week for the support of Mrs. [illegible], upon the understanding that the cost of the food issues will be retained from Panadis, after Mrs. [illegible]'s death when he receives payment for the land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I observed that there was much progress during the year.\n\nNow I inclose my report on the teaching and the advancement of the pupils of St. Joseph's Academy. It gives me pleasure to say that the teaching is given with success; the positions obtained by five or those Abenakis who went through their course at this school is the best proof that I can give you to show the importance of this school. I went today to St. Joseph's Academy, and I was told that three or four pupils will finish their course this year and that they are aspiring to positions such as those obtained by their Abenakis brothers who are now in the Civil Service.\n\nI beg to add a word in favour of the Grey Nuns who devote themselves to the teaching of the young Abenakis who attend this school. These good nuns tell me that the salary that they have is very small, that it is only sufficient for their living and maintenance. They are three teaching nuns and one as cook, in all four nuns for $1200. If they had an increase of $100 for each teaching nun, say $300, they would be satisfied. I am going perhaps farther than my position as agent authorizes me; but I believe that all these details will be useful to you.\n\nYours, etc.,\nJoe.

Such a state of things has always been tolerated in the past years and the children have always enjoyed the benefit of the high education given here by our good sisters the Grey Nuns. This year, I am told, they talk of putting those children out of the Academy or at least to make them pay.\n\nI have had an interview with the Sisters on the subject. They say that those six or eight children are not at all troublesome; on the contrary, they are a source of emulation for the rest of the scholars. They would regret the\nexpulsion of those dear children. As for me, I understand that it is an act of charity to receive these children and to instruct them, and I can assure you that I have witnessed several times the effect of the good example they gave to the Abenaki children by their intelligent work, their application and their success.\n\nThese children belong to very poor parents who earn their living here by making baskets, so that they have not the means of giving a cent for their instruction. If they are not allowed to come to the Academy, they will run in the roads and will be lost morally. It would be too bad, while there is room for them in the convent as in the past years.\n\nAnd if the tribe allow these families here, it should allow the children to the Academy.\n\nKnowing your spirit of justice and the interest that you bear us, I have confidence that you will treat this affair according to our wish and we will follow the direction that you will give us.\n\nI am with high consideration, Sir,\n\nYour ever devoted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

While I regret that your drawing did not win for you First Prize, I am glad to announce that our Judges found in your drawing excellent ability, and they have been pleased to award you one of our Third Prizes. According to this prize offer, you are entitled to any of our Art Courses at a discount of 33 1/3% from the regular price. In other words, you are entitled to any of our Art Courses at just one-third the regular price.\n\nNow, Mr. Ren\u00e9, the opportunity to secure one of these very valuable courses for just one-third the regular price is indeed an exceptional one, and one which you cannot under any circumstances afford to let pass. Your drawing shows that you have excellent talent which only needs to be properly developed to make you a highly successful Artist and to enable you to enter this exclusive field where a large income surely awaits you.\n\nNo doubt you have long been ambitious to become an Artist. Here we bring the opportunity to your very door, an opportunity which you positively will never get again. The little effort on your part in making this drawing has been the means of you saving many Dollars on the price of our course. Now that you have earned it, take advantage of it. I have already mailed you our Art prospectus, which possibly is in your hands ere this. Read it very carefully. Investigate our courses, our instructors and our equipment. On Pages 53 to 57, you will find an outline of the different courses we teach. Make your selection, or if you prefer my advice, let me know and I will gladly help you select. Enclosed is a specially marked enrolment form in keeping with your Prize. Fill this in and forward with your enrolment by an early mail. We cannot hold this offer open indefinitely since it has been given under such special conditions. I trust, therefore, that you will take advantage of it at once.\n\nI await your early favor and enrolment and remain,\n\nYours for a successful Artist,\n\nTHE SHAW CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL.\n\nPer\n\nVice-President.\n\nCANADA'S ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL\nDear Mr. Benson,\n\nI enclose a letter that one of our pupils has received lately from the Shaw School. He had taken part in a drawing contest and has won the 2nd prize. It gives him the advantage of taking a course, and to pay only the 1/3 of it. As he has a great talent in drawing, he would like to take the course if the Department is willing to help him. He is really not able to pay by himself, for his family is very poor, especially this year. It would be too bad to see such a good talent lost.\n\nIndian Affairs.

To comply with the wishes of many families, the school trustees of the town have built an important addition to the school house so as to enable the Brothers to admit boarders.\n\nWith respect to comfort, the Masson Academy is second to none of the other institutions of its kind; the rooms are spacious, well ventilated, lighted by electricity and heated by hot water. An extensive play-ground affords space to the boys for all kinds of games and in winter may be turned into a skating rink.\n\nThe Academy is beautifully situated, and Danville is well known as a health resort. The Grand Trunk station is at a short distance, five minutes walk.\n\nTuition\n\nAt the request of a good many English-speaking families in Danville and the neighborhood, the Academy has a double course of studies: 1st the French course, in which English has its due share; 2nd the English course, in which the French language is taught.\n\nA commercial diploma is awarded to the student who successfully passes the annual examination made for that purpose.\n\nTerms\n\nBoard and Tuition per month\nRent of bed and bedding per year\nRent of bed (spring bed and mattress) and wash-stand per year\nWashing per year\nTypewriting (optional) per month\nTelegraphy per month\n\nPayments should be made in advance every month.\n\nNo reduction will be made for an absence of less than fifteen consecutive days.\n\nAn extra of $1.50 is charged at the beginning of each year for the use of the library and table set.\n\nParents may deposit with the Director a sum of money to defray the incidental expenses of their children.\n\nIn case of illness of their children, parents will be charged extra for the medicines and doctor's fees.\n\nParents are charged extra for books and other stationary articles which may be procured at the Academy.\n\nBed spring-bed and mattress are furnished by the Academy.\n\nBesides books each boy should be provided with about three sets of light underwear, as many of heavy underwear, two night gowns, two suits, an overcoat, a pair of overshoes, some towels, scarf, a looking glass, a comb, shoe and clothes brushes, napkins and a bag for laundry.\n\nThough the students do not wear any particular uniform, parents are requested to provide their children with a black or navy-blue suit and also with a common blue cap.\nACAD\u00c9MIE MASSON\nDANVILLE, P.

Sisters in charge of that school do not see any objection, and I do not believe that it would cause any difficulty.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable reply,\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nHenri Niquet,\nIndian Agent.\nAugust 18, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 14th instant, and to say in reply that I see no objection to your son attending St. Joseph's Academy if you can make the necessary arrangements with the Reverend Sisters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nHenri Niquet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nSir,\n\nA few days ago I told you that Mrs. Claude was to make a will in favour of Mr. Nicola Panadis, chief. This will was made yesterday. Mr. Nicola Panadis told me today that Mrs. Claude's property will belong to him as soon as she dies, and that this will was made in order that this property might be handed over for the use of St. Joseph's Academy as soon as he should come into possession of it.\n\nHe is ready to sign a writing to that effect.\n\nMr. Panadis asks the Department to make him an allowance of $2.00 a week, or $6.00 a month, in order to assist him in supplying Mrs. Claude with what she may need, the amount to be applied on account of the $200, the amount allowed for the property.\n\nMrs. Claude is alone in her house and she wishes to die there, which will make it necessary for Chief Panadis to keep the house warm, and to let one of his daughters take care of her.\n\nA reply on the subject of the assistance asked for by the Chief, will oblige.\n\nYours &c.,\n\nJos. Cote,\nAgent.\nOttawa, 28th August, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant showing items amounting to $56 received by Nicolas Paradis which is to apply on the purchase price of the property that he acquired from the late Marie Josette Claude.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose a copy of a letter received from your predecessor dated the 4th November referring to the will of the late Mrs. Claude in favour of Mr. Paradis. Kindly secure this will and forward it to the Department with an affidavit setting forth the date of the death of the deceased and an affidavit by one of the witnesses to the will as to the execution thereof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Desmarchais. Et Comme j'ai bonne intention de le payer, comme aussi \u00e0 M. Morin et M. Boucher, je serais bien volontier de le donner pour $1000.00 pour payer ces trois messieurs.\n\nSi le Rev.

Sect. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nNotwithstanding that the Rev. Jos. deGonzague, missionary to the Abenakis of St. Francis, here, as much has no right to acquire houses and holdings here on the reserve; I owing him about $700, as I owe Mr. A.A. Mondou, M.P., $150, and as much to Notary Aime Boucher, of the French Canadian village of Pierreville, in all $1,000, and although my house, formerly belonging to Pierre Louis Obomsawin, standing about 200 feet from the Roman Catholic church and the same distance from the convent - St. Joseph's Academy - worth $1500 or at least $1200 as I said to the Rev. Mr. deGonzague; and, as I fully intend to pay him as also Mr. Mondou and Mr. Boucher, I shall be very willing to give it for $1,000 to pay these three gentlemen. If so much is due to the Rev. Mr. deGonzague, it is because he took the debt that I owed to a French Canadian named O. Lariviere, also of Pierreville.\n\nI committed an act of folly in transferring all my three houses to the Missionary Priest, Father deGonzague; these are certainly worth $5,000.\n\nIt is said that the Priest is going this week to Ottawa to get the assistance and influence of the Member, Mr. A.A.

Mondou, M.P., and Notary Boucher may each get $150 and the Priest, although he has no right to do such transactions, being the missionary to the Abenakis Indians, a thing that I shall contest as having no right to be done.\n\nVery humbly submitted for your consideration.\nPierreville 15 avril 1916\n\nMonsieur,\n\n\u00c0 propos du jardin scolaire de l'\u00e9cole Acad\u00e9mie St-Joseph de la r\u00e9serve de Pierreville, je crois devoir informer le D\u00e9partement qu'un terrain d'environ 55pds de largeur sur 125pds de longueur, et qui ferait tr\u00e8s bien pour ce jardin scolaire, est \u00e0 vendre, \u00e0 des conditions raisonnables. Ce terrain, voisin de l'emplacement de l'\u00e9cole, est occup\u00e9 pr\u00e9sentement par Anna Capino, il est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Samuel Watzo, lequel en demande $300.00 mais ne refuserait pas $200.00 et le vendrait peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pour $150.00.\n\nMr. D.

This piece of land next to the school site is at present occupied by Anna Capino; it is the property of Samuel Watson, who asks $300 for it, but would not refuse $200, and would sell it perhaps for $150.\n\nMr. P. Chene, of the Department, knows this piece of land well and could offer you about it fairly. I recommend the purchase of this land, which would enable the runs to make their school garden on the same land as the school.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nHenri Niquet,\nIndian Agent.\nPierreville le 12 avril 1916\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJe crois qu'un excellent moyen d'encourager les enfants de la r\u00e9serve de Pierreville \u00e0 assister assid\u00fbment \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole serait d'accorder des livres de r\u00e9compense \u00e0 ceux qui n'ont pas manqu\u00e9 un seul jour de classe dans le trimestre; et \u00e0 ce sujet je vous serais tr\u00e8s reconnaissant de m'accorder la permission d'acheter, \u00e0 la fin de chaque trimestre, pour un montant d'une couple de piastres de livres de r\u00e9compense que je distribuerai \u00e0 ceux qui n'ont pas manqu\u00e9 de classe.

I believe that Flie Wawanolett would be satisfied with a salary of $2.00 a month, and I beg you to grant him this amount.

Cost estimated at $40.00.\n\nTwo days' work for one man to empty and clean the heating system in the spring and fall. Cost $5.00 each time.\n\nFencing of the school lot on the east side between the Government property and Mr. Papineau's. Cost estimated at $50.00.\n\nTaking off two wall radiators in the basement and installing same in two of the bedrooms on the first floor, with the necessary connections and piping. Cost $80.00, including work and materials.\n\nOne typewriter to replace an old one, which cannot be repaired, also the repairing of another which is in a damaged condition.\n\nRenewing of fifteen blinds.\n\nPainting of the exterior of the whole building.\n\nAuthority to purchase yearly five tons of chestnut coal instead of a like amount of furnace coal which is now being supplied.\n\nUpon hearing the explanation given by the Superior I beg to recommend that the above articles and work be granted, with the exception of the painting, which can be done better early next spring by contract.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should arrange to have this work completed as soon as possible and the cost of the same is not to exceed $40.00.\n\nYou may inform the Sister Superior that she can engage the services of a man to empty and clean the heating system during the present fall and again next spring. This work should be done by one man in two days and the cost should not exceed $5.00 for each time.\n\nThe fencing of the school lot on the east side, between the government property and Mr. Papineau's, is urgently required. You should take this matter up at once and arrange to have the necessary fencing completed. It is considered that the cost of this fence, including the work of putting it up, should not exceed $50.00.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Sister superior that the renewing of the blinds and painting the exterior of the building will not be undertaken until next spring, when the question of doing this work will then receive consideration.\n\nYou have already received authority to purchase the coal required and it is hoped that you have attended to this matter.

(Odabak), I shall make it my duty to inform you of her qualifications.\n\nThe long period of forty years during which I have been connected with the Abenaki parents and children has been a source of profound satisfaction to me and of fruitful labour, not only for the children, but for the entire reserve at large.\n\nMay I hope that the Government will give some consideration to so many years of service in view of a pension?\n\nVery respectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She will have to carry on and remain where she is for that additional period of time although her salary as teacher is to be discontinued on account of having attained the age of sixty-five. This would cause duplication as another teacher would have to be brought in and at cost to the administration of the convent.\n\nWith her health and faculties well preserved, Sister Marie-Josephine still remains the heart and soul of the institution she has founded, and if it were at all possible to grant an extension of her term as teacher, it would not only mean economy but it would certainly be received with gratitude as a testimony of appreciation to the fine lady who consecrated her whole life for the good of the Indians.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

But, meanwhile, we intend to have the pupils benefit of special lessons in Manual Training, even though we are not to be paid for the said month.\n\nAs we have received neither salary nor School Material yet, we take the liberty to inform the Department of same.\n\nYou will oblige us greatly in taking interest in the matter, for, Sister Mary-Josephine, who is still the Superior of the Convent, has already notified the Secretary in regards to the School Material, which requisition was sent in to the Agent at the beginning of last June, as requested in letter C 1-1-4 dated April, 13, 1940.\n\nThanking you in advance, we remain,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nOctober 9, 1940.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: St. Francis R.C.

No reply has come yet. May we inform you, that, according to the Rule of our Order, this cheque must be addressed to Clanak.\n\nWe suggest that such allowance for the Retirement Fund be not withheld on our salary, being so, that we are liable to change place quite often, and consequently causing a lot of trouble to both the Department and ourselves; and this, uselessly to our point of view.\n\nWould you be so kind as to take interest in this present matter in making inquiries for same, at once.\n\nHoping a favourable answer, we remain,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperior.\nDear Sir,\n\nyou will please find attached a letter just received from the Superior at St. Joseph's Station.\n\nWill you please look into this matter mentioned in the letter and let me know.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Maurault, Indian Agent, Pierreville, Que., has been referred to me for attention and in reply I have to inform you that from the monthly salary of Sister Charles Cvide, from September 1, 1940, the following deductions were required to be made:\n\n5% for Retirement Fund = $3.00\n2% for National Defence Tax = $2.40\n\n$4.90\n\nWith reference to the National Defence Tax, I may say that this is a tax, levied at the rate of 2% on all single persons whose income is over $600 per annum but does not exceed $1,200 a year. It is not applicable to Sister St. Cleophae as her salary is not in excess of $600 per annum - only 5% of her salary, or $2.50 a month, is deducted for the Retirement Fund.\n\nThe Department has requested the return of 5% deducted from the salary of Sister Yves de Jesus during the months of May and June, 1940. When the cheque is received it will be addressed to the Rev. Sister at Odanak, Que.\n\nIt is regretted that we are unable to accede to your request that no further deductions be made for the Retirement Fund from the salaries of the teachers of St. Francis' Indian Day School. The Order-in-Council under the authority of which deductions are made, exempts only those employees whose work is of a casual nature or who give only part-time service.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W.

McGill\n\nRE: Pierreville Indian Agency.\n\nA local industry is giving work to a fair number of Indians, at a fair wage salary; some are also employed at war industries in Sorel, earning much higher salaries, however, due to the high cost of living accommodation in Sorel, or even bus travel between Pierreville and their work, those working locally are almost as well off, having no board nor travelling to pay.\n\nIt also appears very easy for some of our Indians to obtain liquor in Sorel, and bring it to the reserve for consumption and some suspected sales over the week end.\n\nSince we have no constable on the Pierreville Reserve, the monthly patrol made by the R.C.M.P. from Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, is not sufficient to prevent the circulation of liquor on the Reserve, and unless drastic steps are taken, this matter will be getting worse and worse. The most efficient way to stop this would be to appoint a resident Indian constable who could act quickly. The fact that he lived on the Reserve would have some effect also, if it is only the fear to be caught with liquor.\n\nThe Sister Superior of our school has complained to the Agent that many children are allowed to stay out so late at night that they come to school next morning without doing their homework. If a local constable were appointed, he could very easily see that school children were home early at night and stayed there.\n\nThe services of patrols by the R.C.M.P. detachment from Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, may be more efficient in summertime as they can reach Pierreville within a couple of hours, but in winter there is only one train a day each way. Besides, matters such as liquor are harder to deal with and take longer to follow up; the R.C.M.P. cannot stay here day after day waiting, owing to their limited staff and so much other work to do.\n\nThis suggestion of an Indian constable could at least be tried for one year, as the cost is low, and the curse of liquor is so detrimental to our Indians. The fact that they are\nnow earning a living, should be no reason to let the liquor circulate more freely on the Reserve; they surely could put that extra money in to something far more useful to their families.\n\nA local Indian could well attend to that matter; Dr. B. Maurault our Indian Agent is also of that opinion and thinks we could get a man for about $150.00 per year.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nThe Grey Nuns' Convent\nOdanak, August 26, 1943\n\nM.T.R.L.

I am very discouraged. My husband has been working in war factories - Sorel Industries - since four years and in May last we were unable to find a house at Sorel. We were forced to rent a place at Odanak, Indian reservation. I have five school-age children and they cannot be accepted because they are not Indians. I live opposite the convent and I will be forced to send them to a school one mile away and will have to pay $12.50 per month for the five, which I cannot do. We are nine in the house and we pay the rent and my husband's transportation expenses. I cannot solve this problem. That is the reason for which I am writing you. The Reserve's convent comes under the jurisdiction of the Fed. Government and you are the only one who can do something for me. As I know that you are very kind, I am positive that you will help me in placing the children in the reserve's convent.

Ross,\nSuperintendent du bien-\u00eatre et de la formation.\nOttawa, September 14, 1944.\n\nTO BE WRITTEN IN FRENCH\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 4, in which you seek permission to enroll your daughter, 8 years old, at the Odanak Convent.\n\nIf you are an Indian of the Odanak Reserve and recognized as such, permission for your child to attend school can readily be secured from the Indian agent. If you are not an Indian, the education of your child is definitely a provincial responsibility and should be discussed with the school inspector for your district. The Dominion Government has neither the legal nor the constitutional authority to enroll white children at Indian schools. You might discuss the subject matter of this letter with the local school authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoe\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Euclide Salvos,\nOdanak, Que.\nEdmond Courchesne\nBarrister\n10 St. James Street West\n\nMontreal, October 5, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I draw your attention to a fact which occurred in the Abenakis village of Od\u00e8sek, Quebec.\n\nSister Marie Jos\u00e9phine, who during forty-four years was a missionary with the Ab\u00e9nakis was recalled to her community.\n\nAs I was born close to this village, and still spend my summers there, I often receive the visit of these Indians whom I advise to the best of my knowledge, and I may add without any false modesty, that I have done much for them in many ways.\n\nThe Ab\u00e9nakis are under the impression that this nun, who has brought up and educated them, and made good christian citizens of them for the past forty-four years, has been recalled due to an order from the Department.\n\nTheir affection for this Reverend sister whom they consider as a mother is remarkable, and they are grieved at her dismissal.\n\nI am enclosing copy of a petition signed by everyone of them, and which has been forwarded to the mother house of the Community of the Grey Nuns, at Ottawa, and which is self explanatory.\n\nShould this come under your jurisdiction, would it not be possible to reconsider the matter and grant to these Indians that which they request urgently.\n\nI am not writing as a lawyer, but as their friend, and I am confident in your sense of justice and your great desire to help Indians morally and materially.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nEdmond Courchesne.\nWe, the undersigned members of the Abenakis Mission of Odanak, deeply regret the departure of our Sister Superior, Rev. M. Jos\u00e9phine. We note the change since Sister St-Gaetan has already taken over the duties of Superior of the Convent.\n\nWe abide by the decisions of the Council, and have no intention of interfering with the affairs of the Community, but we are very much interested in knowing the reasons which have motivated such a sudden change.\n\nRumour circulate here that the Indian Affairs Branch had something to do in the matter. It is said that Sister M. Jos\u00e9phine was accused of having taken too much interest in our affairs, and criticized the acts of certain employees of the Department. It is quite easy to bring up an accusation, but care must be taken not to exaggerate. Sister M. Jos\u00e9phine has always looked after our interests, as a mother naturally takes an interest in the welfare of her children. This is only logical, and we can see nothing our of the ordinary in that.\n\nIf the Abenakis have deemed it their duty to protest against certain acts of the Indian Affairs Branch, Sister Josephine had nothing to do with it; she did not initiate any hostile movement, as it is claimed in certain quarters.\n\nUseless to remind here the deep devotion and zeal displayed by Sister M. Jos\u00e9phine during the forty-four years she spent among the Abenakis. The entire mission acknowledge her merit. Half a century of devotion to religious life is an entire existence.\n\nThe matter deserves consideration.\n\nAs a practical conclusion to this petition, we humbly but firmly seek the return of Sister M. Jos\u00e9phine, as Superior at Odanak, as soon as possible. We consider that this request is more of a \"claim\" than a \"favor\" requested, since we already\nReceived the definite promise of the Community that she would not be moved. Once again, we do not intend to dictate to the Community the decisions it should make, but when the details of this unfortunate incident are known to us, we shall be in a better position to discuss the matter.\n\nWe have the honor to be,\n\nRespectfully ours,\nThe Abenakis of Odanak.\nMontreal, 5 octobre 1944\n\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa.\n\nCher Monsieur,\n\nPermettez-moi d'attirer votre attention sur un fait qui s'est produit derni\u00e8rement au village des Ab\u00e9naquis d'Odanak, Quebec.\n\nS\u0153ur Marie Jos\u00e9phine, qui fut durant quarante-quatre ans soeur missionnaire des Ab\u00e9naquis, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e \u00e0 sa communaut\u00e9.\n\nEtant n\u00e9 tout pr\u00e8s de ce village et y passant encore mes \u00e9t\u00e9s, je re\u00e7ois souvent des visites de ces indiens que j'aide de mes conseils, au meilleur de ma connaissance, et je dois dire, sous peine de manquer \u00e0 l'humilit\u00e9, que j'ai beaucoup fait pour eux \u00e0 tous points de vue.\n\nLes Ab\u00e9naquis sont sous l'impression que cette s\u0153ur qui les a toujours instruits et \u00e9duqu\u00e9s, en a fait de bons citoyens chr\u00e9tiens depuis quarante-quatre ans, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e par un ordre du d\u00e9partement.\n\nLeur attachement \u00e0 cette r\u00e9v\u00e9rende s\u0153ur qu'ils consid\u00e8rent comme une m\u00e8re, est extraordinaire, et ils sont tr\u00e8s pein\u00e9s de son renvoi.\nEDMOND COURCHESNE\nAVOCAT\n10 OUEST ST-JACQUES\nTEL HARBOUR 4607\n\nMONTREAL, 5 octobre 1944.\n\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\n\nJe vous inclus une copie de la p\u00e9tition sign\u00e9e par tous, qu'ils ont envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison m\u00e8re de la communaut\u00e9 des Soeurs Grises, \u00e0 Ottawa, et qui parle par elle-m\u00eame.\n\nSi cela d\u00e9pend de votre autorit\u00e9, n'y aurait-il pas moyen de reconsid\u00e9rer la chose et donner \u00e0 ces Indiens ce qu'ils demandent avec instance.\n\nJe n'\u00e9cris pas en qualit\u00e9 d'avocat, mais bien comme leur ami, et j'ai confiance en votre esprit de justice et votre grand d\u00e9sir d'aider les Indiens, tant moralement que mat\u00e9riellement.\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEC/PDA\nNous les soussign\u00e9s, membres de la Mission Ab\u00e9nakise d'Odanak, d\u00e9plorons am\u00e8rement le d\u00e9part de notre sup\u00e9rieure, Soeur M. Jos\u00e9phine. Nous constatons un changement comme fait accompli, puisque Soeur St-Gaetan assume d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 Odanak la charge de Sup\u00e9rieure du Couvent. Nous respectons les d\u00e9cisions du chapitre, et nous n'avons nullement l'intention de nous immiscer dans la r\u00e9gie des affaires de la Communaut\u00e9, mais nous serions tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ress\u00e9s de conna\u00eetre les raisons qui ont motiv\u00e9 un changement aussi subit.\n\nDes rumeurs circulent ici que le D\u00e9partement Indien serait pour quelque chose dans cette affaire; On aurait accus\u00e9 Soeur M. Jos\u00e9phine de trop s'int\u00e9resser \u00e0 nos questions en critiquant les actes de certains employ\u00e9s du d\u00e9partement. Il est bien facile d'accuser mais il faut bien prendre garde \u00e0 l'exag\u00e9ration. Soeur M. Jos\u00e9phine, a toujours pris nos int\u00e9r\u00eats comme une m\u00e8re s'int\u00e9resse tout naturellement au bien-\u00eatre de ses enfants, c'est logique, et nous ne voyons rien d'anormal dans cela.\n\nSi les Ab\u00e9nakis ont cru de leur devoir de protester contre certains actes du D\u00e9partement Indien, Soeur M. Jos\u00e9phine, n'y est pour rien; elle n'est nullement l'instigatrice d'un mouvement hostile, comme certains le pr\u00e9tendent.\n\nInutile de rappeler ici tout le d\u00e9vouement et le z\u00e8le que Soeur M. Jos\u00e9phine a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 durant les quarante-quatre ann\u00e9es de son s\u00e9jour au milieu des Ab\u00e9nakis; la mission toute enti\u00e8re reconna\u00eet ses m\u00e9rites; un demi-si\u00e8cle de d\u00e9vouement dans la vie d'une religieuse, c'est toute une vie.\nLa chose m\u00e9rite consid\u00e9ration.\n\nComme conclusion pratique de cette requ\u00eate, nous demandons humblement, mais avec instances, le retour de Soeur M. Jos\u00e9phine, comme sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Odanak, le plus t\u00f4t possible. Nous consid\u00e9rons que cette demande rev\u00eat plut\u00f4t le caract\u00e8re de \"r\u00e9clamation\" que de \"faveur\", puisque nous avons eu la promesse formelle de la Communaut\u00e9, qu'elle ne serait pas d\u00e9plac\u00e9e. Encore une fois, il est bien entendu que nous n'avons nullement l'intention de dicter \u00e0 la Communaut\u00e9 la ligne de conduite \u00e0 suivre, mais quand nous connaissons les d\u00e9tails de ce malheureux incident, nous serons plus en mesure de traiter de la question.\n\nAvec consid\u00e9rations, nous avons l'honneur de nous dire,\n\nVos tr\u00e8s respectueux,\n\nLes Ab\u00e9nakis d'Odanak.\nOttawa, October 19, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Courchesne:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 5 and also copy of a petition received by you from a group of the Abenakis Indians of Odanak, sent forward therewith.\n\nI may state by way of comment that Indian day school teachers, whether they be members of a religious Order or lay teachers, retire under existing regulations at age 65. Sister Mary Josephine, having reached this age, a few years ago, was retired from our service in June, 1940. Sister Mary Josephine, however, although removed from our payroll at that time, appears to have remained on at the teasherege, acting in a kind of honorary capacity or as teacher emeritus. While I have no desire to be in any sense critical of Sister Josephine's action, I should state that her presence there, immediately following the appointment of her successor, led to a number of somewhat embarrassing situations, at least, so this Department was informed, and one can readily imagine how misunderstandings might arise with respect to the exercise of authority, discipline in the school and a number of other such matters. In any event, it would be a somewhat dangerous precedent if the Government permitted retired Indian day school teachers or retired civil servants to occupy buildings the use of which had accommodation in which has always been reserved for the members of the active staff. If this matter were fully explained to the Indians, I feel confident they would understand and fully appreciate the position taken by the Government. As a matter of actual fact, this is the first case that has ever been brought to my attention where an Indian day\n\nEdmond Courchesne, Esq.,\nBarrister,\n10 St. James St. West,\nMontreal, Que.\nschool teacher remained on the reserve in any capacity after the age of retirement.\n\nMay I thank you, however, for your interest in this matter and for the courtesy that prompted you to bring it to my personal attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\nschool teacher remained on the reserve in any capacity after the age of retirement.\n\nMay I thank you, however, for your interest in this matter and for the courtesy that prompted you to bring it to my personal attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed today that Paul Laverie, the son of Philis Laverie, has two of his children\u2014a boy and a girl\u2014following the class in the St. Francis school. They have begun about two weeks ago.\n\nI have communicated with the Sister Superior and she confirmed the fact.\n\nThat Paul Laverie is of Indian extraction but of aboriginal blood. He told the Sister Superior he was Indian and his children had right to go to this school. The sister, not knowing him, detained him and took the children. I doubt that man has right to send his children to St. Francis school because I think those Laveries are emancipated.\n\nI'd like to receive information regarding that case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 23, 1945.\n\nDear Sister St. Rene:\n\nIn a report on his inspection of the St. Francis R.C. School on the 5th of June, Inspector Parent writes as follows regarding Grade 7:\n\n\"Cependant, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de la 7e ann\u00e9e m'ont paru un peu faibles sur les principales branches du programme.\"\n\nIt is very disappointing for the Department to receive this report. Only 16 children are enrolled and the number present on the day of inspection was 10. It appears to us that in view of the small class there should be no difficulty in covering the year's work very completely.\n\nMay I point out that the total enrolment, as shown by the Inspector's report, is 43, and we are allowing salary for three teachers. I think you will agree that the number enrolled is very small for three teachers. As a matter of fact, we have many schools in which one teacher is handling 43 children. In view of the condition existing at the St. Francis R.C. School, it would appear that the pupils should receive very thorough and careful training.\n\nLast May we wrote to the former agent, expressing a wish to have more vocational work done with the boys. The late Dr. Maurault did not reply to that letter, but presumably he discussed the matter with you.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would discuss the whole situation with the Sister\n\n....

Mr. Ali lives, since a week, in the Odanak Indian Reservation, right near the Indian School, and his children do not have the right to attend that school. They are unable to come to Pierreville on account of the distance and particularly because the Winter roads are practically not kept in the village of Odanak. Mr. Ali has not been able to find a place to rent in Pierreville and, if the Department of Indian Affairs refused to grant this permission, the children would be deprived of attending school this year.\n\nFurthermore, I wish to point out that I am a distinguished benefactor of the Odanak Indian School. My sister who belongs to the Order of the Grey Nuns of the Cross, is a foundress of the school, and I gave much money to organize that school which had a humble beginning 50 years ago. It seems to me that the signal services which I rendered, since 50 years, to the Odanak school should dispose the authorities of the Dept. of Indian Affairs to grant the privilege which is requested.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Gilbert Ali is a veteran of the last war; he served two years in the Army.\n\nThose are additional reasons which I could not give you over the telephone.\n\nI am assured in advance, Sir, that with the help of a lawyer like yourself who always wins his cases with the government, my little nieces will soon be able to attend school. I am ready to pay the school charges for those children.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMilton Rousseau,\nPierreville.\n\nTranslation\nAP/\nNov. 20/46.\nGentilly, Nov. 17, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt,\n\nDo you think that there would be a means of doing something concerning this request from Mr. Milton Rousseau, of Pierreville, which I am sending you with the present memo.\n\nBest regards,\n\nL.

This permission depends entirely on the accommodation available at the school concerned. The records of the Indian Affairs Branch show 40 children registered on the rolls of this school.\n\nTherefore it will be necessary to refer this matter to the Indian Agent at Pierreville for his recommendation.

They are four of them: two boys 12 and 10 and two girls 13 and 6 years of age.\n\nPersonally I have no objection to the acceptance of these pupils in the Indian school, even though it may raise some protestation in the part of the white living on the Reserve, especially from those married to Indian girls to whom this favour has been refused these last years.\n\nWill these children be accepted like Indian pupils or if they will have to pay?
