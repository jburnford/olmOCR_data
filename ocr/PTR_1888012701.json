Though the matter may only be laughed at here, it is perhaps as well to notice that there is a large element who take an interest in our welfare, and I hope you will kindly allow me space for a few words in reply. The correspondent begins by saying \"Major Perry has incurred the displeasure of the people in this place.\" That he incurred the displeasure of a section of the people is true, but was it implied that the whole community? How about those citizens who are memorial to the Government in support of Major Perry, and those who have nothing to do with the question? These all belong to \"the people of this place.\" What right then has this correspondent to make such false inferences on one side and put Major Perry, as their object of resentment, on the other? The correspondent further says \"Major Perry in last year's report stated that the people here were a unit in opposing the law breaking, the defeat, the go as you may rely on it,\" to my correspondent, he added still further, but the same result. This monstrous statement and its repugnance to the least grain of common sense is the slightest thing that a truck driver could have penned such a glaring slander. And the writer so obtuse as not to see that by trying to create animosity against the people of Prince Albert, he really brings a most serious charge against himself. It is evident that he has undertaken to champion. I have not read the report referred to, but I take it that the statement made is not accurate. Were it as this unscrupulous advocate avares, Major Perry would have been the first to dispense with the law and the constable in his place. But the constable was there, and Major Perry in the place. Again, referring to illicit trade, the correspondent excuses the constable for not arresting because it is difficult to obtain direct proof. Every one knows how the nature of the trade is, and the difficulty of smuggling, but when the writer proceeds to say that proof is hard to obtain because of the secrecy of the trade, he states what is not true and the lie must be buried in the grave. There is, however, fortunately, black sheep in every flock, but it is needless to say this community as a whole is opposed to law breaking, opposed to law breaking in every shape. It is also opposed to calumny and false witnesses, and ought to be treated as officially \"sold\" against the author of this slanderous communication. We credit it to be directed at Prince Albert, and it might be directed at anyone. It is impossible to obtain convictions against illicit liquor traffickers here. There is no foundation for the statement that the majority of the cases brought on for trial have resulted in conviction and severe penalties. In fact, it is said that more than half of these operations have not invariably been sustained on appeal. The magistrate tries to be fair, but the difficulties of giving effect to the foreigner's opinions of prosecutors (whether having a pecuniary interest or not) are too strong to withstand. And they are apt to insist on sufficient proof in every case before convicting. Individual cases are not tried in detail, but the general impression is that the majority of the cases brought on for any offence. It is their duty to protect the innocent and less than to punish the guilty. A harsh sentence does not make charges in the Witness indictment, the minor details are mostly distorted, misrepresentations are made, and instead of saying what real motives may have prompted the conclusion of this piece of legislation, the correspondent seems to interfere with the cordial relations existing between the police and civilians dealt. It is quite a curious contradiction to hold P rising true to the principles of the rule of law, yet to be so anxious to see the laws of Prince Albert for sympathy. I am sure that the decision of local magistrates and higher judges have not always been in conformity with the wishes of informants and presenters.
